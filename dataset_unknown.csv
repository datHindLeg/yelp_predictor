Fable|4.0|American (New) in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|211|-1|4.03428571429|" Our first time dining here, our meal was EPIC.  stars. I had the melon salad with chili vinaigrette. My brain exploded. I. Have. Never. I then had the four cheese mac and the corn with shishito peppers, tomatoes, and butter. I wanted to eat forever. We finished things off with the coconut cream cake and berries. Lemme tell you, when we renew our vows, I'm having this cake made for us. It is heaven, in the Castro, and it seriously lit my heart on fire. Our second time here, everything fell flat. Maybe it was a different chef? Please find the guy that created our first meal here! Please, find him and pay him a large sum of money to teach all the other chefs how to elevate their game. Gotta give 'em  stars for lagging the second time:/ I highly recommend this restaurant! Not only was the food delicious but the service was amazing!!  Everyone was attentive, considerate and accommodating.  We were seated in the back and the group behind us became quite loud, within a few short minutes we were offered a table in a quieter part of the restaurant and our dessert was on the house for the inconvenience which was absolutely unnecessary but greatly appreciated! A fable. . . Once upon a Thanksgiving,Invited BRLFF's for breakfunchnner. Food coma'ed out while waiting Completely missed their visit. That weekend I had an idea:Great Mish brunch, my treat. Then firearm shopping. Yet overslept and thus rescheded. Very next morning,In a drizzly, empty Castro. Online brunch (de)rezzes. #tronFood. Friends. F'ing Finally. Said goodbyes near muni. Bus collided with the bus stop. Out of service  no passengers. Some other way to get home. ~ The End ~ I love this place. The portions and quality match the cost. The wine selection is great. The service is great. I've been there twice: Once with a group on their gorgeous patio and once with the misses on a weekend date. It's one of my favorite places in the city. Everything I've had there I enjoyed. I've lived and eaten in the Castro for ages.  I'm excited to finally have a restaurant like Fable in the hood.  The food is fresh, seasonal and well prepared.  I've had dinner and brunch with friends and we always leave well satisfied and feeling like we got our monies worth.  The atmosphere is romantic and a wee bit hip.  If you want a longer sit down meal with a bit of class, this is the place for you. . . Came here on a Friday night for my friend's birthday with a party of  girls total. We got the backyard seating, which was really cutesy with an orange water fountain. We had the beats salad as an appetizer, which was ok, but I didn't like it because of the goat cheese =/ The brussel sprouts had that bitter taste so I didn't like it much either, but the mussels wasn't bad and their broccolini. Birthday girl chose this location because she wanted to try their lamb that everyone on Yelp raves about, but when we got there, we were told that they changed the menu two days ago  what a bummer. She settled with the ribeye, which she loved, and many of us had the porkchop with pomegranate & butternut squash. I wasn't a fan of the butternut squash because it tasted a little different from when I usually eat it, but the porkchop was cooked tender and juicy which was awesome! We all finished our meals and then brought a cake for our friend. When we got the bill, we saw that they charged us $ per slice for the cutting fee, which wasn't on the menu  nor did anyone tell us when we got there, which was a major disappointment. They did waive it when we complained, which was nice of them, but it would be better if they told their customers before charging us. Other than that, I thought it was cute there and decent, but nothing that wows me to come back. Decent. Great patio out back  definitely check it out. The food is good, but nothing to write home about. Decent service. Nothin fancy, just good food!!  I'm really excited that I have a place in the neighborhood that's actually GOOD!  I am actually *feeling* Fable!  The only thing I'm not sure I care for are the seating arrangements.  I mean, the space is really small, awkward, and there are really no great places to seat.  But lucky for me (and my date), we were seated in that little nook by the window.  That just may be the best seat in the house. I highly recommend Fable as a great date spot  but even better  a great ALONE spot (yes, they have bar seating)Moving on to the food  FANTASTIC!  To be honest with you, all I can remember that I had was a beet salad and a stellar entree. I couldn't tell you the actual dishes, except that they made a vegetarian exception for me :)  That said, they managed to make the food exceptionally fresh, rich with a little extra something that made me want to come back. My biggest gripe is that I walked out smelling like cooked food.  Not the worst thing in the world, I guess. Being that I'm only  blocks away, maybe I'll be back soon with a  star update?  We'll see! Very good food, we ordered the rabbit and it was very well cooked. We also ordered the duck off menu and that was better than the rabbit. Great atmosphere and good patio in the back! Selection is not too big The patio could accommodate a small group. Food is decent and the ambiance is nice enough. It's good to see the Castro finally attempting to add better quality restaurants to the neighborhood. I would've gave given another star or two, but the service is kind of off. As far as the staff I encountered on my visit, they need to be careful to not get their heads too high in the clouds and remember that they are employed to ""serve"" patrons not the other way around. Service was good, but food was just ok. . I wanted to eat somewhere I'd never been tonight as I live in the neighborhood. Fable was my choice. I walked in, by myself, at :pm, and asked if they had a seat at the bar for one.  I was told by the host there to wait outside it would be just a minute.  I waited outside for twenty minutes to a host that never came back.  I felt like an idiot, popping  my head in to see how things were progressing.  To busy to care I guess.  They need to figure out how to ask people to wait outside and then not have a host to busy to do his job. . . bummer. All around excellent.  Well crafted menu, great appetizers, really dense rich dessert. Service was excellent and friendly but not overwhelming.  Only complaint is the table in the hall way are cramped and near the bathroom.  Considering the interior space that's inevitable.  Going to come back soon for brunch.  Definitely recommend. First time I really enjoyed this place so I went back for second time with my fiancé. I love how they greet you upfront. The restaurant has very low lighting which makes it very romantic. I really enjoyed their house wines as well as their food. I am not going to talk about my specific food because they keep changing the menu. I would % recommend this place. It is a great ambiance with great food and its quite enough that you can hear each other. Fable is one of those places that's hard to rate on a simple five point likert scale like Yelp, simply because some things were SO five star and other things, just, weren't. The location, perfect. Easy to find, right on Castro Street, hidden quietly amongst sex toy shops and pizzerias right in the middle of boystown. The aesthetic is precious. I can't think of another word, it's just precious. Definitely lives up to the whimsical name. The back patio (which requires a reservation, FYI) is a little garden paradise, something straight out of the set of a Tolkien adaptation. I can't think of a nicer place to spend a boozy brunch. But that's really the list of amazement, for me. The server wasn't doting and attentive as one would expect of a nicer establishment. He sort of had that slightly irritable Castro temperament that the clubs are becoming known for. He seemed like he'd rather be somewhere else, and he seemed like he'd just as soon have us go eat elsewhere. Lacked charisma and was certainly not overly friendly. Detached, maybe, is the best word. The menu read well, we were excited by many of the offerings, everything sounded delicious. The food came out and while the presentations were fantastic; it looked like something from a magazine. . . the flavors were just. . . I don't know. . . standard. Nothing particularly special about my chicken sandwich, and my dining companions' benedicts were, likewise, pretty aesthetically pleasing but average fare. So it's gorgeous, a bit pricey, the servers need more training (or charm school), and the kitchen staff perhaps needs more attention from the lead chef? The place has promise, really it does, but it went from walking in excited to walking out disappointed. Came here for brunch. Fable is a sizable restaurant with a bar area in the front and an outdoor area towards the back. I highly recommend sitting outside if the weather is decent it's super cute and has a bunch of heaters if not, though. We had the pork eggs Benedict and the blueberry pancakes, each with a side of bacon. Friends got ice tea, which our waiter made sure was always full! All the food was very solid and service was very prompt! Fable? Myth! Why is it that when you arrive at a restaurant that is / empty on a Wednesday night at : PM, they ask you if you have a reservation, you say 'no', and they tell you they only have two terrible options near the rest rooms or the bar, and you say fine, and during the two hours you are there, only two couples walk in and the place is still empty? Stupid and pretentious. And then the Brooklynesque (yawn) long bearded, tatted and youthful waiter asks if you want still or tap  because ordinary tap water isn't even an option ( though it's on the menu as 'free' )  you say 'tap' and the waiter takes his own sweet time to get it . . . and then the detailed descriptions of the food don't live up to the watery and sour salad and over cooked fish, well, what can you do? Pay the over priced bill and never go back to such a mediocre place but that is pretty much the Castro these days. Kale salad. Steak. Glass of wine or cocktail. You're good to go. I always sit at the bar. Service is great. Sometimes the music is awful more like bar music than restaurant. This place is great! We went here for dinner and sat outside, I had the rabbit dish. It is  a bit pricey but we had an amazing meal and a great experience. The decor is super cute. I would recommend it for a date night or small group. Fable is one of my favorite places in the Castro. The interior is stylish and usually quieter than lots of the other options nearby, so it is great for conversation over a nice meal. The food is maybe a touch on the expensive side, but it is high quality. I've gotten the chicken and fish entrees in the past and they've always been great. The staff is friendly and will take good care of you. Definitely one of the best restaurants the neighborhood has to offer. Fod is delicious. Wine is really great. Ambience is fun. Its a pity we didn't even get to eat here and I'm having to write a one star review. My husband and I were super excited about coming here for dinner. As we were walking in, the menu at the door caught my eye and I got engrossed in reading it. My husband in the meantime walked in and asked to be seated and asked where the bathroom was. And to his surprise, the dapper looking black host refused to let him go to the bathroom till we ordered our food. I stood at the door, in disbelief and stunned at his rudeness. I told my husband right away that I didn't want to dine at a place where they treat their customers like this. The host made no effort to apologize or stop us, in fact, as we left he said ""Have a good day"" in his best mocking voice. The host was a jerk. We were set to eat here, but as my wife checked out the menu, he impolitely informed me that I couldn't use the restroom unless we had made up our mind on whether we we're eating here or not. Absolutely outstanding meal.  Wife and I went here for our  yr anniversary dinner (we wanted to keep it casual).  Really outstanding beginning straight away with their warm bread and pink salted butter.  The friend pork cheek was possibly one of the richest things I've ever eaten in my life, and the pickled salad they serve it with is perfect.  The portions aren't huge, but between the bread, app, two entrees and dessert we definitely didn't leave hungry.  The wine wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was a blend, and not too pricey (like $). Eclectic find in the Castro area. Chicken Caesar salad is moist, flavored and delicious. Bistro burger is super juicy and tasty. Spicy lava cake was a great finale. Service is outstanding I was convinced that Starbelly was the only good restaurant in the Castro (and lez be honest, Starbelly ain't THAT good), but I'm glad that I can add Fable to the list. Their menu is kind of like Miley Cyrus: you know she's basic as fuck, but you like her anyway. My main take aways: Remember to get the chicken.  Remember to get the corn and shishito peppers (when they're in season) And most importantly, remember to starve yourself prior to eating at Fable so you can have your daily carb limit with their mac and cheese. Trust me, it's worth it. Went there for an early dinner before a show at The Castro. The outside was a little nondescript and hard to find, especially with the sidewalks being torn up all up and down the street for renovations. Inside though was stylish and a great atmosphere. We dined on the back patio, which has a canopy and garden and fountain. It was a very pleasant environment. The service was outstanding. Attentive without being overbearing. I'm not a wine drinker, but our server made a recommendation and it was probably the most I've ever enjoyed a glass of wine. We started with the Dijon Crusted Braised Pork Cheeks, which were OUTSTANDING! The serving size was just barely enough for two, but it just made you appreciate it that much more. The rest of the meal was a little hit and miss, but I think my wife enjoyed it more than me. I got the rabbit, done two ways. Part was breaded and served with risotto and a okra gumbo with the remaining rabbit being stewed. I thought the crust on the rabbit was way too salty and over seasoned. That may just be me though, I know I'm a little more sensitive to saltiness than most. My wife was able to finish it for me and didn't have any complaints. The prices were a little high for a casual after work hang out, but for a date, I would definitely recommend checking it out. Excellent meal and service last nice. Great for sharing. Price point is reasonable. Glad that the Castro is getting some decent restaurants. Stylish, yet casual.  Absolutely terrific modern American food with some nice little twists.  Service is warm yet professional.  An outstanding addition to the neighborhood! We went for brunch on //. We ordered the Western omelet.  It was tasteless, no only the omelet, but also the potatoes were tasteless, onions and red sweet peppers were burned. Well, we are not going back EVER!! If I were one of those people who gave five stars for everything that met all my expectations I would, but I'm one of those who only give one and five star ratings for experiences that are either horrible or wonderful. This is okay. I have seen this space cycle through a number of restaurants and this iteration is about as good as any of them. The pricing is about what you'd expect or a little better, the food is about what you would expect or a little better. They have a nice patio. There are some interesting things on the appetizer menu but I cannot remember what they are now. The service was better than average, probably because the restaurant is small and they've plenty of people. I would say the best thing about Fable is that it's a place where you can get a pretty nice meal and actually get into (all of the nice places we used to drop in on are totally mobbed nowadays). My honey took me here for my birthday.  It was fabulous! The service was outstanding, and all our entre were superb and on point.  I really loved their duck salad and their chocolate mouse dessert.  The interior is romantic and classy but casual enough to make you feel at home.  We will definitely be back and I highly recommend! This is an excellent place for taking your date. The food and service are top class. The prices are a little high though. I would recommend this place. Try it at least once. This review is for brunch only. GREAT! We sat outside on their patio which was super quaint. The service was excellent, and the menu was super easy to choose from once I saw that their was a pork belly eggs benedict. Tasty too. Brunch today was tasty, but service was terrible.   of us arrived shortly after  and were seated even though we did not have a reservation. We acknowledged that we could be finished by .  Orders were taken, coffee poured, and we did not see the serving person Nikki again.  We asked three times for coffee refill and twice for outside heater to be turned on.   Another server finally poured more coffee.  We had to ask twice for syrup for pancakes.  Virtually no service from our desinated server. . . thank gooness for the male busser. My partner and I were in San Francisco for Pride and we stumbled upon Fable while exploring the Castro. We walked in and needed no reservations. That was a plus. Lol. We were seated in their cute patio out back, which not many restaurants have in the area. We had a bottle of wine and ordered the Artichoke hearts with aioli and shrimp sauce. It was great. For our main meals we had salads. The Little Gem Salad(my partners) and I had some Cucumber Yogurt Salad and it was GREAT! We also shard their  cheese baked pasta. All in all I recommended this place to everyone. Cute atmosphere. This place is really hit or miss.  Went here for dinner last year and it was enjoyable.  This time around, went for brunch and service was not that great and the food was not that good  who runs out of bloody mary mix over weekend brunch? They didn't seem that busy to me either.  It was hard to catch our waiter's eye and when we asked for something, he would forget.  Luckily one of the other waiters was more on top of things and was able to grab what we needed.  Also, the host was sweating so hard that he was emitting B. O. , which was quite unpleasant when he would walk by us.  I don't think we'll be back. DELICIOUS!! We shared the cucumber watermelon salad very refreshing. Artichoke with Crab appetizer was perfectly cooked & lots of crab! The salmon entree with Fava beans was a nice portion & very flavorful! We finished off with the lava habanero cake for dessert had the perfect heat . to top it off our waitress was fabulous! I don't remember her name but she was great. I wish I could afford to eat there every night! Thank you Fable for being one of the few restaurants in the Castro that rocks! See you soon! Fable is a cute, charming and cosy little restaurant in the heart of the Castro. The quality of service and the ambiance definitely make up for the lack of space. The staff is very friendly and the outdoor patio is gorgeous  perfect for brunch on a sunny day. The food is amazing. The grilled king salmon is by far my favorite. The combination of sweet and savory with a touch of crunchiness make this dish very unique and tasty. Highly recommended! I have recently eaten here for brunch and another time for dinner. Brunch we had the Eggs Benedict (which was available with Pork Belly Yes duh) and the duck confit salad. Both were delicious. The duck was so good I debated ordering it when we came back for dinner (a similar item was listed as an appetizer. ) I ended up branching out, and everything we ordered for dinner was fantastic. Short ribs and a special appetizer (fried soft shell crab) were the absolute standouts, but everything was fantastic. I can't wait to make this a regular haunt. There were two, now three favorite eateries we can go to in the Castro. I would have to say however, Fables by far is the best in years and would consider them # choice for . What a fantastic meal we had. We came to celebrate an intimate birthday dinner for two, and what we received was more than their scrumptious and excellent meal, we were treated by ""Fable's"" signature, excellent, first class, world service!  We even got tickled pink when the gracious staff kept bringing our new utensils from a cute basket.  The owner Eric (host) and along with his staff, they are just wonderful. Recommendations, their duck salad was just fantastic. Their grilled lamb and pork chops, all we can say; OMG, wow!!  Cheers and enjoy! :p A good restaurant in the Castro serving tasty French y, California food is overdue. Fable seems dependable and capable of turning out flavorful, well prepared food that is slightly overpriced. Main dishes were $ and up which puts it into competition with some renowned SF restaurants that are more daring and flavorful. We ate lightly and had the duck confit salad and short ribs main dish. The duck confit was tasty but too much dressing turned the pile of greens into a sodden mess. The short ribs were tasty but seems overpriced at $! If Fable wants to compete at those prices, it can't have misses like the salad, and it will have to amp up the short ribs. Requested patio seating in reservation made on open table. Got to restaurant party ahead of us did not have reservation, but knew a line cook; that party was seated on patio where we had requested. When this was pointed out to maître d' after checking OpenTable he came back and admitted that yes, we had requested the patio. Maître d' blamed it on oversight, offered to move tables to patio, which would have been extremely obtrusive, excessive, and embarrassing. No other effort was made to remedy this grievous and egregious oversight on the part of the inadequate management; visit Fablle only if you know one of employees and want a good table. Food is adequate, there are other restaurants in the neighborhood with equal or better food and superior service. Do not go to this restaurant. Bad bad bad experience all around. Bf took me here for mystery dinner. Cute place,Interesting decor,love the open kitchen, really tiny kitchen. Pork cheek appetizer was really good. The kate and apple salad with it went really well together. Lamb shank, was okay. I couldn't tell that it was lamb, even though the meat was very tender. Pork chop was cooked perfectly. Nicely seasoned. Overall I think this was a really nice date, but I'm not sure I'd want to come back. Was good, but expensive. Service was great though. Great service and vibe. Order the chicken breast (unique twist on the veggies that come with it) and the smoked gouda mac and cheese. I was visiting SF from LA for the weekend and wanted to go to the best restaurant for dinner. Nopa was booked solid and Frances had us th on the wait list so we went to Fable. We wanted to treat the friends we were staying with to a nice dinner to show our gratitude. Our overall experience was mostly positive but not incredible. As we walked up to the location, the entire sidewalk in front had been torn out of the ground and was a construction zone so not exactly the perfect cute environment I was expecting. Then we were seating at a table which was essentially in the hallway. It was right next to the kitchen (I think) and there was a lot of traffic. I like restaurants where you can see the other tables and have some kind of Ambiance but our table did not have that. There seemed to be a nice romantic patio but I did not get to look (or sit there) to judge. The great thing was that they only charged a $ corkage fee so we were able to bring some nice wine and pay a low corkage fee. The scallop salad appetizer was fresh and delicious. Oysters were good. We were a party of four and each had a different item on the menu: salmon, chicken, pork chop and short rib. I had the short rib but tried some of each dish. It was all solid but not incredible. For $/plate it was overpriced. I am happy to pay that for an incredible meal, but not sure this was prices appropriately. I agree with some of the other reviews to note that prices have increased since some previous pictures posted here on yelp. I am used to paying $/plate at Susan Goin's restaurants but not here. Service was good, but again nothing spectacular. But the worst part was what happened after we paid the check and left. My husband, who only recently moved to the US, paid and used an iphone app to calculate the tip. He chose the ""great service"" (as opposed to excellent) on the app and it calculated a % tip. My husband is not too familiar with tipping etiquette (now he knows % is standard) and thought he was leaving a good tip. As most people know, tipping is not customary in other parts of the world. So after my husband paid, we left the restaurant. As soon as we got outside we realized we forgot to take a picture so we took a few of us as a group in front of the restaurant. When all of a sudden, out comes running the host in a panicked voice asking ""excuse me, were you not satisfied with your service?"" Confused, we all stopped to ask why and he showed the receipt and said ""because you left a % tip. "" Our party was caught off guard and my husband changed it to % on the spot but he was pretty embarrassed. This was the first time he was treating a party to a dinner in a foreign country and made an honest mistake based on what he thought was actually a good tip for ""great service"" (stupid app. ) So it was embarrassing to have the host make a full confrontation in front of our guests. Even if it wasn't an honest mistake, chasing after us was a bit intense. It really soured our experience and made my husband feel badly. It's also not a cool impression when you are treating guests. Luckily, they agreed that the confrontation was over the top and we resumed our night. All in all, this place lacked ambiance inside and out. The food was good but not great and definitely not worth the price. And the confrontation about the bill was upsetting. Dinner with my bestie on a school night.  The  restaurant was quite pack for this evening. My entree was the grilled leg of lamb with rosemary.  It was a savory and satisfying dish.  I love my lamb and this was a good dinner dish to quiche my lamb craving. Service was great and attentive. With a small and changing menu, I could come here often and try something different every time. I've written a review about Fable before, I feel compelled to write another. I went last night with  friends and it was insanely delicious. We started with Lamb meatballs and Deviled Eggs (a special) . . . they were both mouth watering! The Deviled Eggs were something like I've never seen. They had Roe eggs on top, it might sound strange but trust me, they were fantastic. I had Salmon for my entree. It was served encrusted in delicious herbs, I wish I recall what herbs to share on this review but. . . the salmon was served over a type of pancake and in between the pancake and salmon were grilled greens. HOLY SCHMOLY. . . so fantastic! Went to Fable for the first time last night with a group of friends to celebrate our April birthdays.  What a perfect spot!  Loved the food, the atmosphere, the service.  Loved it all.  It's a shinning star in the Castro and I would highly recommend to locals and tourists.  It's small inside but they are planning on opening up the patio soon and that will allow for a lot more seating.   Don't skip the desserts.  We had a chocolate mouse with chipotle salt and it was incredible.  A great addition to the San Francisco restaurant scene! Nice setup, food was pretty good. The dessert was the highlight for me. It's definitely higher priced than the $$ indicator suggests. This restaurant totally surprised me. . . In a good way!First of all, having spent plenty of time in the Castro specifically and in lots of SF restaurants generally, this one was not even on my list of great places to try (I keep a running list don't you?) Boy it should have been!To start with, the restaurant is adorable on the inside I'd go back just to sit at the bar and enjoy the food! The food was stars, all the way. It stands on it's own just for the strength of the food definitely on par with any restaurant I've tried in the yrs I've lived in the bay (and there have been many!) The only reason for the star instead of  was the deviled eggs appetizer was a miss for me. We ordered  appetizers to share, plus an entree, and all the others were near perfect. However add on the impeccable service, plus the great staff, and Fable stands apart. This is the very first star I've given on Yelp, and it is well deserved. Then, the owner asked about our service on the way out, and gave us a tour of the place, replete with the back patio that will open soon. Too bad no live music because of neighbors, but it promises to be great!I highly recommend Fable, and will be back often! Fable is a great choice for brunch if you find yourself in the Castro on a weekend morning. It's conveniently located between th & th on Castro, so street parking can be tough, but if you go up the hill toward Noe a bit, you may get lucky. The brunch food is fresh and well prepared and the servers are super sweet. There are a couple of tables on the front sidewalk, but the best seats are on the often sunny back patio. They're also open for dinner, though I think brunch is the better kept secret. The service was good. The food looked amazing and done right, but just tasted okay. Watching people try to open the front door with a bad lock/handle was definitely entertaining. Been here twice now and would say that  stars is a great rating for this restaurant the food won't absolutely blow you away, but you'll still get a very good meal. Each time my gf and I have tried the special of the night st it was a scallop and caviar dish that was incredible, second time around it was a corned beef dish in celebration of St. Patty's day. Why mention this? It seems like both times the seasonal dishes were more creative and came together better than the dishes we got off of the regular menu (the scallop and duck confit on the menu tasty but heavy). Maybe it's just luck, but the chef really knows how to make a nice special dish with fresh and new ingredients. The service here is  stars all the stuff you'd expect from a nice restaurant in SF. Overall a good place for a date night/small group dinner in a safe neighborhood where parking isn't too rough. Plus it's never a dull time walking along Castro street. Incredible, fresh, vegan lasagna features more vegetables than pasta for a great low carb option. The chefs table is a great seat to observe all of the action in front of your eyes!The aroma of herbs and spices floating through the air from the au four create a warming ambiance of culinary delight!! Delicious food and great service, but don't ask the waitress for a wine recommendation. Or if you do, ask her the price. We ordered the wine she suggested, discovering at the end of the meal that it was the most expensive bottle they offer. I nearly threw up when I got the bill. As much as I enjoyed the meal, I won't be back because that feeling of having been burned will linger. My daughter & I enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Fable. We loved all the dishes (the duck confit w/ scallop!). . . and the wine (local Pinot Noir) suggestion from our server was a beautiful compliment to our dinner! I plan to search out a couple of bottles : ) We couldn't say enough about the impeccable service, which included ALL the staff, everyone from the host who seated us to our table service, and of course the servers!Fable is quite small, and so reservations are probably a good idea. We did hear their opening a patio area come late spring summer! We'll be back to check out the new outside seating!! This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Castro, and quickly becoming my favorite. It's a shame it can be so difficult to get a table most nights. Finally this location gets a restaurant that is worthy of that beautiful patio, since the restaurant Luna that was here prior just neglected it until the point of complete dilapidation. The food is very good and the menu is constantly changing, something that many restaurants in the area need to take notes on. They keep fruits and vegetables seasonal and the management seems genuinely interested in the feedback from customers. Their wine list and dessert menu is a bit lacking in selection and the wine list is mostly expensive with very few economic choices. The last two times I ate here they didn't even have a cab on the list, a felony in my world. The service is quite good. Tried it for the first time tonight and loved it. The service was impeccable from the moment we entered. We started with the little gem salad (plenty for ) and the garlic bread  both were perfect. I had the chicken breast and my date had the steak. My only complaint is that the sweet and sour sauce on the chicken tasted like one of those Chicken McNugget dipping sauces. All in all a nice experience and a great addition to the Castro. I really appreciate Fable because they always have a vegan entree on the menu. I've had both their beetloaf and vegan lasagna and both were really delicious : ) I love that Fable is just around the corner. I've been several times & have enjoyed every meal. Recently, I was hosted a friend that owns a restaurant, & suggested we dine at Fable. We painstaking planned our meal & wine pairings. We loved every bite. The service, even on a busy night, was really great. Little touches make the experience even better. We left very full, very satisfied customers. PS: Thank you for making me look good to a friend with a sophisticated palate. Fable is so wonderful! The food is great  the service is great! I live in the Castro and I am so glad to have this as a neighborhood spot. Usually when I eat here, we just walk in and eat at the bar  which is fun, because then we can watch the chefs at work. Everything I have had at Fable has been delicious  the salads are great and all the mains I have had have also been delicious. Recently I had their Grilled Angus Petit Filet  which was served with root veggies so good. In the past I have had their chicken which is also so tasty  crispy skin, tender meat. I also find that their wines by the glass are also very good. Really  you should try Fable  it's that good! According to Wikipedia, a fable is ""a succinct fictional story, in prose or verse, that features animals, mythical creatures, plants, inanimate objects or forces of nature which are given human qualities which illustrate or lead to an interpretation of a moral"". Yep, that sure sounds like the Castro all right, where naive visitors are constantly surrounded by animals of all species, mythical and not so mythical creatures, inanimate objects that come to life with a little vodka, and when the clubs close, genuine forces of nature. But I digress as this is a fable of a different genre. It's a succinct, decidedly non fictional place where appetites remain of a human quality that may or may not lead to a moral. Fable is a bit on the pricey side, but the menu is mostly scrumptious (photo: bit. ly/fAJqzb) which probably accounts for the number of young, smartphone adhered foodies waiting against the side wall for an empty table. I got lucky as a solitary diner who was able to secure the closest seat at the counter to the host station. I was a bit in the shadows, but that didn't seem to affect the service level much. Even though I was almost lured by their daily special of deviled eggs, I decided to try the $ Dijon Crusted Braised Pork Cheeks. They were a tantalizing trio of fried goodness covered in lacinato kale, crisp apple, and crispy shallots, all of it drizzled with a cider vinaigrette (photo: bit. ly/muyJzV). Very unique flavors that were a bit on the sour side. Perhaps to compensate for the pig factor, I went to the other extreme on my main dish and ordered the $ Vegan Winter Vegetable Lasagna, which turned out to be quite tasty even without the ground beef I had come to expect thanks to all those years of Stouffer's frozen entrees. It was made with spinach and butternut squash with cashew ""cheese"" and macadamia ""ricotta""  faux cheeses that were pretty darn convincing dairy doppelgangers  and a thick tomato sauce (photo: bit. ly/fojjwM). Accompanied by toasted wedges of rustic bread, this was quite a hearty serving of goodness. Patting myself for such a healthy selection, I paid the price by ordering the $ Pear and Ginger Crisp, a hefty cobbler festooned with walnuts and dominated by a large scoop of Straus vanilla ice cream (photo: bit. ly/jwNGN). Completely undeserving, completely devoured. It was a comfort dessert on steroids. Chef Jon Hearnsberger even came out to serve it to me, a personal touch I appreciated considering how busy they were that evening. So Fable is not a fable in the literary sense, just a culinary treat for all you inanimate objects in need of a moral lesson like stop being such a glutton when you already had two courses. Sheesh.

HIgh priced for very little food. And really, you're gonna charge for side dishes? Then at least offer more choices! The food was not all that good. I had the swordfish. It was so so. Not worth the price. The ONLY good thing about the dinner was our waiter. He was very nice and attentive. All in all, I would not pay that kind of money for such little food that wasn't all that. Unbelievably delicious and HEALTHY! So rare to find that combo! The ambiance was so cozy and romantic. . . totally forgot I was in a city. Very welcoming service and the patio is adorable. This one is on my list of favorite date spots in the city. came here on a Saturday evening for dinner not knowing what to expect.  pleasantly surprised, to say the least.  service was excellent. decor and ambiance was very comfortable.  started with a citrus salad which was very flavorful and plenty enough to share for two.  ordered a swordfish dish and their cioppino, both done excellently.  didn't have enough room for dessert so I can't comment on that.  overall a great experience and will definitely return for more! Finally made it back to Fable and they did not disappoint.  Again, great  food made with fresh, quality ingredients put together by a passionate chef results in a tasty and most enjoyable dining experience. Service was very good.  Expensive food, there are other places to try.  This was my second time there.  $ small pork chop, asked for med, got rare.  Very little food, very BIG price.  I guess that's why it's a ""Fable"". Went to celebrate a birthday. Dinner was great, and the service was very attentive, but I had asked upon making the reservation to bring out a dessert for his birthday and they didn't follow through at the end of dinner. Left slightly disappointed that they didn't take the time to pay attention to my request. So I'm visiting from Vegas. And back home we have some amazing restraints, but this place. Wow! Amazing service, beautifully decorated, and the food is phenomenal! If your lookin for a place to try out, this is it! Cioppino was the winner entree but steak could have been a bit more flavorful. Service is good and resto has a cozy feeling into it. Another excellent meal at Fable. They have the best chicken and the vegetables had an amazing flavor and I'm not a vege guy. Also loved the cobbler and dulche de leche mouse. Great service too! .  stars rounded up Deja vu. We created memories in this space's patio once before, in its prior life. Its newest incarnation, Fable, got mixed reviews from us. I'll give you both sides, so you can decide if the New American joint is worth a looksie. Salad with Dungeness crab was not too exciting. Components seemed to be kind of random  pistachios AND oranges? Can't say I approve of chef's pick of ingredients. We both ordered cioppino ($), which I thoroughly enjoyed (garlicky/not too sour), save for shallow portion of broth. Don't expect a deep, heaping bowl. Boatloads of white fish, crab, mussels, clams, & a giant scallop. No ""fishy"" smell or aftertaste, which is what usually deters me from ordering seafood. Before even taking a bite, he commented that he couldn't believe we were paying so much for something we could've made at home. I told him I expect a homemade cioppino dinner tomorrow night. . . doubt I'll get it!We couldn't resist their dessert special: dulce de leche mousse with creme fraiche & smoked sea salt. I enjoyed the flavors & semi thick consistency. He was not amused, & likened the $ glassful to jello. I do agree that their execution leaves something to be desired, but flavors were a ok. There are many yummy sounding dishes on their menu, but I don't think we'll be back because his final remarks were, ""It's called Fable cuz it's a lesson learned. . . never again!"" Yikes. The $ bill (pre tip) did nothing to endear him to the place. Food: /. Superb food. Wife had the duck and I had the tri tip. Both were very good with excellent flavors. Don't need to get a side but I have to say the squash side was amazingly good. Service: /. Attentive, friendly, and slightly awkward. Vibe: /. I really liked the small restaurant and laid back vide. We were seated *right* next to the bar which was a bit of a pity. A truly appreciated departure from the rather icky restaurant choices in the main area of Castro, Fable is comfy and cozy with a menu that delivers. You won't be disappointed. Staff is insanely friendly and accommodating. They're all about their guests and it shows. Beer and wine only, but a selection that's just right. The menu changes regularly. I was secretly hoping that they'd have mac & cheese on the evening I visited. Sad pandas, they did not. Our meal was delicious and we savored every bite: The duck confit salad was lovely. People who say they're weary about duck will change their minds. Perfect for sharing The Cioppino is some of the best I've ever had. Insanely generous chunks of seafood (esp crab) in broth so rich and satisfying you'll think you're eating a King's feast Tri tip is pleasantly flavorful and not too spicy Sides: the roasted squash is undoubtedly one of the the best things we've ever had (we recommend getting one order per person), Cheese grits are good but nothing mind blowingCan't wait to return. Cons (this is why the restaurant is  stars instead of ): Prices keep increasing!  Within the past year they have been open, prices of entrees have gone from around $  to $ .  It's great when a local restaurant makes it, but please don't do it at the expense of locals' wallets.  At the current pricing, this restaurant is miscategorized as a $$ establishment, and instead should be $.  Prices here are comparable to NOPA, which is categorized as $ on yelp.  To see proof of rising prices, take a look at some of the menu pictures posted on Yelp from the restaurant's earlier days then look at the current menu pricing. Pros: The food was really good!  I enjoyed the duck confit dish and pear/ginger crisp.  The waiter was the right amount of attentiveness without being overbearing or aloof.  The set up of the restaurant is cozy, and I liked the bright orange napkins.  Decor is minimal but carefully thought out.  Small outdoor patio looks very cute (there are heat lamps), and after a couple months they are opening about  more seats in the back. Other: Dinner only now, but once back patio is totally complete, it plans to open for brunch as well. Arrived with my BF around pm without a reservation and we were promptly seated. Would've gotten a better seat had we reserved ahead but neither of us are from around here so we were working 'on the fly' from a recommendation we'd received. The service was exceptional and extremely helpful as we tried to decide on our meals and which wine to order. We both decided on the split pea and ham soup as well as the steak dinner option and both agreed, hands down, it was absolutely delicious. The salted butter they use for their complimentary bread adds a very nice flavour to it as well. Neither of us are really wine experts but the Rossese they recommended went very well with the meal. . . lastly, desert was a very refreshing closer to the meal. I had the parsnip cake and was only disappointed when there weren't  more slices waiting for me afterward :P Awesome place! The food was amazing and the service excellent. Reasonably priced for quality place in the Castro. Highly recommened! Cozy backyard!  It was a little cold but the heat lamps worked well.  Food was good and well prepared.  Wine recommended was good too.  Service was excellent.  They had to stop serving alcohol after pm due to neighbors.  Will be back if in the area. We were looking for a great place to kill hunger pangs, and Yelp pointed us to the Castro. The neon sign hanging outside lets you know there's a garden patio in back, and it's worth checking out! I'll let the other reviewers give the details on the food & drink, but we were really pleased with our choices. The chef and owner, Jon, is famous for his $ cioppino, and it was worthy. Mussels, clams, fresh crab, salmon and a large diver scallop in a savory red broth had me fork fencing with Luci N. for last bite. There was a vegan entree that looked appetizing, but we didn't check it out. The standout entree of the night, however, was the chicken! Amazing and one you wouldn't easily recreate at home. Our party of  ate at Fable this evening, and we had a wonderful time.  Their service was AMAZING.  We were late and in a rush for a show, and they were attentive and friendly.  The chicken and pork chop are not to be missed.  We sat outside, and it was LOVELY!  Heat lamps, private, and cute lighting.  Thanks for a great night out Fable! Fable, what can I say I have been here numerous times and never had a bad experience. The service and food has always been great and worth every penny. This small spot is cozy and great for the Castro. It's a hidden little gem. . sh. Anything, you choose will not disappoint your palette I called the night before and asked if they could change my reservation from  to : ( was all that was available on open table). They made the accommodation happily by seating us on the porch, which was warm and comfortable. The waiter was wonderful as was the food. The timing of the dishes, their preparation and presentation were all wonderfully done. The jus with the steak could have been a little bit more plentiful, but was very well prepared. All in all a nice evening. Had to write an update and send my compliments to Jon and his team for the best New Years Eve dinner ever! Every detail was thought out so beautifully and the food was incredible. So often Pre Fixe tastes. . . . pre fixed. . . this was NOT the case at Fable. The food was just amazing, the atmosphere was festive and lively, and we enjoyed every moment. Book us for next  year! So god!  One of those places where anything you try on the menu is really good.  Great, refreshingly innovative dishes.   Really nice staff, too!  The waiter was patient and advised us what to order when we had to dine quick! I don't know how Fable ended up on my radar, but it did. I think it had something to do with a review somewhere saying how weird the decor was, and thinking I needed to check it out myself (it's really not weird at all). I came here with a friend that I hadn't seen it a very long time, and we went on a little dinner date. I hardly ever go out in the Castro anymore, either, so I wanted to find a place that would get me out of my normal haunts. The food was excellent. My friend and I split the dungeness crab appetizer, with orange segments, and it was refreshing and delicious. The portion of crab was very generous. Actually, you could add oz. of crab to any dish, if you wanted. I didn't opt for this, but I was really pleased to have had the option. I had the pork chop with a pomegranate glaze over grits. The pork chop was cooked well, and all the flavors melded together well. It was a good portion size, and wasn't at all overwhelming. For dessert, I had the new to the menu at the time parsnip cake. It was flavored well (think about it as a take on carrot cake), but perhaps a little too moist if you like a drier crumb. I, however, enjoyed its almost pudding like consistency. I had a bite of my friend's apple crisp, and that was also well executed. There's only one thing wrong with this restaurant. . . I left my iPhone there late Saturday night and I cannot reach anyone at the restaurant this morning, Sunday /. It's important that I get it back right away. The iPhone is displaying my phone numbers. If anyone from the restaurant reads this, please contact me ASAP. I will take this post down as soon as the phone is in my hands again. Thank you. (later that same day)Indeed, Fable found my phone and I'm a happy customer. I decided not to take the post down but rather to embellish on it. Satuday night's meal was excellent. We walked in and not only got the WINDOW table on a beautiful evening, but we got exemplary service and even a Pinot Grigio with a pink tint! It was delicious. And everything I ordered included crab (just now in season). . . it's easy to screw up crab, but Fable does not! Check this place out. . . just don't get so smashed that you leave your two day old iPhone S behind! Ta ta for now. How adorable is this place?  First I think mostly of clubs when I think of Castro so to find this really cute dinner spot was amazing!  The decor is so classy and the mirrors on the walls are all pictures of Aesop's fables, like the name. Get it?  I ordered the chicken breast and my friend ordered the beef stew, both of which were classics and very tasty.  Our waiter was maybe a little disappointed that we are not big spenders ordering wine and appetizers and dessert, but he was still very, very nice, like all the other staff at the restaurant.  This would be a great, kind trendy, but not too cool for school place to take a date for dinner.  Super cute, super friendly waiters and good food.  Enjoy! Honestly DELICIOUS! Cutesy romantic little neighborhood vibe place.  It's an amazing find, and not overrun or uber trendified. Great wine list. Nice waiter. Food was outstanding. Caesar with little gem lettuce was zesty and the chicken stuffed w spinach and gruyere was cooked to perfection. I WILL BE BACK. . . often! Warm lighting and romantic vibe with spot on service. Reservations were not a problem. Staff is on point, friendly, and non intrusive. Albeit fork tender, the pork cheeks with salad tasted lackluster and did not live up to its hype. The roasted Brussels sprouts with grapes and pistachios, however, inspired my Thanksgiving offering this year. My friend's crispy skinned chicken was salted properly and well executed. My pork chop was one the finest I've ever had; the rest of the plate's veggies offered fragrant bitter notes to balance out sweet, juicy meatiness. Portions are substantial. Stomachs leave satisfied, but yearning for something a little more inspiring. . . Not impressed. Don't seat us at the fricken bar when we can see  empty tables the entire time we are there. Skimpy wine pours at ridiculous prices and had to lasso someone for service. . ,actually had to ASK some guy if he worked there (it was the CHEF on his day off working on holiday menus. ) Never, ever again. Food was NOT worthy. The Scallop crudo was absolutely delicious, and the cauliflower was very tasty. My friend ordered the Black Cod topped with dungenous crab. This was a suggestion by the waiter, but honestly, it was too much, very salty and adding the crab took away from the crispiness of the cod. I think both the cod and the dungeness crab would have been better separate from one another.  I ordered the vegan beetloaf, which I read some amazing reviews on, but I felt it was very dry and not very tasty (and I love beets). Overall the experience was moderate, and I don't think I will return. Highly improbable. Getting a table on a Saturday night with such little notice. Caramelized Brussels sprouts with incredible flavor at an accessible $ price. Squash that was completely squashed by our appetites. Cod and crab partnering to create a main more delicious than either could do solo. Grilled vegan beetloaf is the only part of the story with regret. Should have done it. Bottles of $ Argentinian red wine to wash it all down. Personality and a consistent yet subtle attention to detail by the staff. Whimsical design touches like antlers accented by lights in an otherwise relaxed and polished environment. That was just the food and experience. If I were to tell you the story of how we got there and who I was with the story would take forever. Improbable and at least for this Fable completely true. To anyone who is looking to have a wonderful dining experience, Fable is your place. I absolutely loved it. The food is to die for. The service is unbelievable. They've been around a year and I only just heard about the place from a friend who has been a few times. I don't know who the chef is but he is a GOD. I don't know who the person was who served us last night but he was amazing. It's a small place and once it becomes popular it will be impossible to get in. Go check it out. It will be a night you will not regret. My new favorite by far. Thank you Fable for such a lovely experience. We dropped in for an early sunday evening meal. I had the braised pork cheeks with kale and other salad type things. The salad part of this appetizer was actually better than the meat, though it was best when both were eaten together. My main was a risotto with fish and tangerine, which was both good and interesting. The gf had a sweet potato curry soup and the caesar salad with added crab.  The added crab part wasn't on the menu, but she read about it on yelp and heard another server telling the group next to us about it. The soup was okay and the salad good/crab fresh, but I don't see why people would rave about it. Maybe we tried to order too quickly, but when we said ""We are ready to order"" the waiter didn't take the time to tell us whether there were any specials or even what the soup was that night (We only ended up with the soup because the gf kept asking if they had any specials or soups of the day she should know about). They also didn't bring out bread until we asked, though since I think I should be avoiding bread more often than not this might be a good policy rather than another sign of a relatively inattentive waiter. Overall the food was very good and the service was otherwise very pleasant.  I forgot to mention desert  the chocolate mousse was really good. I had such high expectations but everything was VERY average and I ended up skipping dessert which is definitely not something I do often!Started with the Caesar that received a lot of hype but even with the fresh crab, it was still just lettuce, shaved parmesan cheese and average dressing. Where were the croutons?! My date got the Pork Belly which was again OK but not something spectacular. I actually enjoyed the kale more than the Pork Belly. As for mains, we ordered the Chicken stuffed with Spinach and Cheese and the Fresh Fish  very average and despite walking in really hungry, neither of us finished our dinners and decided to get dessert elsewhere. Maybe it was an off night but I have a hard time recommending this Fable with nearby options like Frances. I came here with a friend after work who had heard good things about this place. We started out sitting outside as suggested by the hostess but the wind was coming down hard off of Twin Peaks so decided to head indoors. They provided blankets and the outdoor heaters were blazing but we couldn't take it. I liked how the took care of us. Ok, on to the food. The meals that I remember were the pork cheek and the scallops with pork belly. These dishes were outstanding but the portions were on the small side. I only got  scallops and even though they were delicious, they weren't as substantial as you'd expect. The wine we got was so so. I also thought I'd get something a bit more special but the wines seemed ordinary. The service was good overall. I'd like to check it out again sometime I'm in the Castro. Surprisingly good, especially compared to the choices in the neighborhood. My favorite dish of the night was the scallop crudo, which had avocado, diced pear and some hot peppers, that added some complexity with its heat.  Never had a dish like this with these combination of ingredients.  Also good were the pork cheeks, which were more substantial that I would have guessed. For entrees, the black cod served over risotto was good but even better was the pork chop.  They recently changed up the menu so that it was no longer served with grits and a honey glaze. Rather, it had scalloped potatoes on a bed of sauteed greens.  Still quite nice. Don't think they served any alcohol other than wine.  Overall, a very nice place to catch up with good friends. Good food. Nice ambiance. Now there's three good places to eat in the Castro! Tried this on a recent long weekend trip to SF and in short: fable was FABULOUS. We mostly enjoyed every creative dish and there wasn't a plate that left the table without being licked clean.  Plus, the wine list was solid along with the service and delightful ambiance.  We started with the Dijon braised pork cheeks.  While the cheeks were underseasoned, the texture was terrific as was the accompanying kale and pink lady apple salad with the crispy shallots and cider vinaigrette.  YUM.  My pork was perfection:  medium rare with a great sear on the outside and savory juices on the inside; great greens and fall vegetable gratin were sensational sides.  While the appearance was underwhelming, the heirloom tomato and beet salad was solid and the fennel was a delightful bonus.  My vocal Italian friend was sorely disappointed with her so called bed of risotto (overcooked and not arborrio).  But, she loved her black Cod.  The fig and bleu cheese side was also disappointing.  I'd go back here in a heartbeat on a future visit to the Castro. Cute, casual, and non pretentious . . . perfect setting for a fun date night!The food is your standard new American style deliciousness.  Unfortunately for Fable, this is something that other restaurants in SF do really well, so it's hard to stand out. The menu changes regularly, presumably due to the need to jump on the local/ farm fresh movement.  This is what we had on the night we went:() Mint tartare with scallop and avocado.  Actually, the scallops were supposedly the main ingredient, but the mint was so strong I could barely taste anything else.  () Sauteed rock cod with creamy risotto.  So rich, so delicious, and so filling that my date had to finish it for me after he devoured his. . . () Pork chop with bourbon honey glaze.  'Nuff said. () Chocolate mousse with caramel whipped cream and chipotle sea salt.  Despite not finishing my entree, I somehow made room for this and almost single handedly finished what was supposed to be a shared dessert.  Oops. One thing that threw us off was that we had to order all our food at once because the kitchen wanted to pace our courses for us.  Which we found strange, because by choosing our appetizer first while we ponder our main entrees, would that help with the pacing? Also, the wait staff couldn't seem to charge the right amount on my date's credit card.  First, they overcharged him.  Then, they undercharged him.  For the record, this meal, with two glasses of wine and a diet Coke, cost ~$ without tip.  I'd call this slightly overpriced for something that is supposed to be a casual dinner, but maybe I haven't been in SF long enough to think this is completely reasonable. The slowly receding memories last night from my Fable experience continue to linger as dancing thoughts of the banana pudding haunt my consciousness.   The dessert aside, my second visit to Fable impressed me once again.  This time I noticed the chef standing proudly in front of his open kitchen approving and making final touches to every dish that make their exit from the hands of the subordinate sous chefs.  The menu is consistently fresh with new dishes to reflect the current available meats and vegetables.  I was pleased with my prime rib and the original preparation of the potatoes.  The staff are always pleasant and tentative to your needs.  When your feeling like a night out in the Castro hit this place up. My wife and I tried Fable for the first time over the weekend and based on our experience it deserves the great reviews. Here are some of the highlights: The ambiance is warm and inviting. Fable's dining area is an intimate space, with interesting etched glass windows and dark wood throughout. We had a cozy table for two, and although the noise level was ""energetic,"" we never felt like we had to shout at each other to enjoy our conversation (over a great bottle of wine). The food was very good. We started with some wonderful figs with Maytag blue cheese, and for entrees, my wife had a cod dish over risotto, and I had the center cut pork chop. We also shared a dish of the caramelized Brussel sprouts. Everything was excellent. (The deserts were good, but unmemorable  definitely not the highlight of the meal).  We had a couple of minor mix ups with our orders, otherwise, we would have given Fable  stars. The waitstaff was eager to please, though, and offered us our desserts for free, which was very much appreciated. Regardless, based on this one experience, I would definitely recommend this place to friends and it's likely that we'll be going back at some point. Excellent food, excellent service. Nice, intimate ambience. Really enjoyed all of the food  from salad to desert. My date and I tried two different deserts, both of which were delicious and had a touch of an unexpected flavor that worked really well. Can't afford to eat here regularly (yet), but will come back sometime. The patio outside was heated with lamps and just lovely.  Gracious, attentive service by our waiter (with a tattoo sleeve) and the manager.  The food was wonderful and thoughtfully prepared.  We got the beet salad and soft shell crab as appetizers, the scallops entree and scallop appetizer as our main dishes, and the raspberry/pear crisp for dessert.  Went there for our anniversary, and it made for a perfect night.  We'll definitely go back. Went here last night with a group of friends for a birthday celebration. We got the pork cheeks and clam strips to start and a carafe of their sangria. All were fantastic. Like that the carafe of sangria was presented as a carafe of wine + fruit and ice in the wine glasses. The sangria was great, but I thought it overpriced. Wouldn't do that again despite its tastiness. We sat on the back patio, which is really nicely landscaped. Not only do they have heaters, but each chair has a soft, cuddly blanket, too! Very nice touch. For entrees, I got the pork chops, two got the pot roast, and one got a caesar salad with sides of winter vegetable gratin and caramelized brussels sprouts. Impressions: Pork chop: AMAZING. A fantastic crispy crust on the meat, and the bourbon huckleberry jus was incredibly flavorful (nice touch of garlic). It came with spinach (good, not a standout) and the vegetable gratin (could have been very good, but I thought it a bit underdone). I'm not a huge pork chop fan, but I would order this again without hesitation.  Pot roast: Got great reviews! I didn't try it, but it looked lovely.  Caesar salad: Again, didn't try, but it looked great.  Caramelized brussels sprouts: These were FANTASTIC. For the portion size, however, I thought them way over priced. Same with the side of gratin. We ended with the banana wafer pudding, which we all enjoyed. Strong banana presence, and dare I say, a touch of Speculoos perhaps?I would definitely go back. Recently I dined out with two friends of mine who happen to be amazing chefs.  We had an extended discussion about the lack of really great food in the Castro.  Yes, Frances is AMAZING, but you cannot show up there on a whim and have a lovely meal. So after a sub par dining experience else where earlier this week, my hubby and ventured down to Fable to give it a try.  I crossed my fingers and toes that it would be good.  It was not only good; it was VERY good.  I would honestly give the food a .  stars and the atmosphere and staff a  star rating. The interior is intimate and warm with an outdoor eating area (we sat at the chef counter).  Our waitress was lovely and attentive; food was prepared exactly as requested and well paced. You can actually hold a conversation in there without screaming and yet it was not dead pan quiet. Since we were on limited time (movie date night) we kept it simple.  I had the pork cheeks and kale salad (lovely flavors) and the sauteed brussel sprouts (with a balsamic reduction that was fantastic and with roasted black grapes).  The pork cheek salad was well portioned as a small plate and with a side of sprouts was plenty for a lighter meal. My hubby had the pork chop.  Let's just say, pork chops are his *thing*.  He likes them medium rare and most places never get it right.  So he asked for it medium rare to slightly rare, and low and behold it was EXACTLY that.  Super flavorful with a side of bitter greens and grilled pears.  We actually asked the chef to commend his line staff for getting it right the guys were very proud!Desert was a quick banana bread pudding.  OMG. . . we nearly licked the bowl. All in all, a lovely meal.  We will return again.  The moral of the story: try and try again. We ate at Fable on a Saturday  arrived a half hour early for our reservation, but was seated right away since we were there soon after the restaurant had opened for the dinner meal.  The food was really good and well constructed.  Service was impeccable.  The menu selections are varied and the servers are well informed and can answer questions well.  This is a great romantic spot and a thoroughly enjoyable place for a good meal.  Recommended. Loved this spot!Attentive staff. Beet salad with goat cheese was good. A little overdressed for my liking. Baked potato was delicious. I usually don't like sour cream, but this was the perfect baked potato. Brussel sprouts were cooked with the right amount of salt. Pork chop was so good. Not as good as Nopa, but a close second.  A fine medium rare! Tender and delicious!Banana & wafer pudding lacked a little sweetness. . . maybe a caramelized banana would've added a little character. Maybe I should have opted for the chocolate mousse. Would go again. The Caesar looked awesome. Loved the presentation of the other dishes including the scallops and chicken. Just ate here last night. Loving the dark romantic vibe. . . . Food was excellent and so was the service!I enjoyed the braised pork cheeks. . . . served with this perfect marinated kale salad topped with fried onions. . . The crispy chicken was phenomenal. Served with perfectly whipped japanese yam. . . I am definitely going back for that one soon. I also ordered a side of the padron peppers. delicious. Worth checking out ;) I ate at Fable while visiting San Francisco with my family. We all have different tastes (and there is a vegetarian) so selecting a place to eat that has good proteins and vegetarian options can be tricky. Fable reviews looked good (thanks, yelp!) so we stopped in. We didn't have a reservation, but the receptionist was helpful in finding us a group seating at the bar. We were seated, and then a corner freed up so they suggested we move so we could talk easier. I don't have enough good things to say about the staff  our server was excellent and made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy the food. The food. I got pork belly and scallops. The scallops were cooked perfectly. By the end of the meal, not one bit of food was left on anyone's plate. Success! Pretty much the best option for a nice dinner in the Castro. It's not as hard to get a reservation (ahem Frances) and the price point is fair. It's very cozy inside but it never felt cramped. Service was five star and I appreciated that they could accommodate our dietary restrictions. Once upon a time two people didn't make a reservation at Frances and decided to come here instead of waiting in line. They had the pork chop and the pot roast, and while both were good, neither were just right. Food here is good, but not all that memorable. Normally when I see .  stars on Yelp, I expect to be blown away. I either expect a food orgasm with every new dish or an incredible value for my money. Fable sadly offers neither. I've definitely had better for this price (~$ an entree). Three stars for good but unremarkable food and another star for decor and ambience. It's a cute place to bring a date, but given that there are so many great places in SF to eat, I don't think I will be back. Yumm!! Had a great time here!! We had a reservation for , arrived at  and told the staff we had an event at . We were seated ate some delicious food and still made it to our show:). Thank you Eric for being so sweet! Il definitely return Yum! Glad for a great new restaurant in the neighborhood! Hopefully other places will step up their game. Nice space. Food was excellent, service is friendly and professional. O. M. G. The following are to die for:. Braised pork cheeks. Eggplant stuffed with goat cheese. Padron peppers. Crispy chicken with Japanese yamI was beginning to start feeling disappointed in SF restaurants; it had been a long time since I felt totally blown away by one. Thank you, Fable, for showing me otherwise!Great food and great service. I've made reservations to come back. Pretty mediocre all the way around.  One server was very pleasant but batty.  Other server was unpleasant at best.  Host is your stereotypical queen, polite but with an attitude that is ready to strike should you cross her. Food is not bad but far from great. Everything about my dining experience here was fantastic. The service was attentive and everything we ordered was thoughtful, creative and fresh. I think this is a new gem of a restaurant in Castro. . . I would definitely go back! Great new foodie hangout. From the very beginning of entering this gem in the Castro we were treated with excellent service and food that is expertly  prepared. The dishes ingredients are beautifully paired and fresh. We had the tomato salad that had fresh sliced peaches and shiso and a tasty vinegar dressing, it was amazing. My five spice roasted chicken was absolutely delicious and the mashed potatoes and vegetables where a prefect match to the chicken. We are so happy to have a great foodie Resturant in the Castro neighborhood. I can't wait until they open up the outdoor seating. The food was amazing and my waiter was on top of everything. I definitely recommend Fable! Fable is a cute little restaurant just popped up in the Castro. It's a great spot for a date or to catch up with some friends. Someone compared them to Frances but that is really unfair because Frances adds alot of extra creativity to the menu than at Fable. Food here is solid, with highlights and low lights. There was nothing particularly exceptional but it was a good dinner, albeit a bit on the pricey side given the quantity. I especially loved the acme rustic rolls, Cabernet Sauvignon (ouch  $/glass), and side of corn (super sweet and fresh!). Everything else was pretty good  make sure to pass on the Mac and cheese. Great food at dinner.  Pork cheeks are amazing and the chicken was one the best mains I've had this year.  Fantastic service too: everyone has been universally cheerful, positive and competent.  Complimentary dessert as one of the mains was a cold.  Great wine price too.  Wouldn't hesitate to recommend for dinner.  Brunch was much less successful and so I'd probably stick to dinner. This place is a great addition to the neighborhood. I love the food and the atmosphere. The staff are friendly and attentive without being intrusive. Just a great relaxed vibe with great food and wine. We need more of this in the hood. I really want this place to succeed, because the gayborhood needs more nice places to have a great evening and a great meal. The food was fine.  The wine was great.  We had a lousy table, next to a place where plates and silver were being clanged! and banged!, but what can you do?But for the prices they're charging, they need to pay attention to service and attitude.  Some examples:. The host was snotty, both on the phone (you could sniff the attitude) and in person.  We felt really unwelcome before we even arrived. . The server had this totally phony, unpleasant affect.  I don't need to be coddled or fawned over, but I do want to feel that the folks who work at a nice restaurant are. . . Nice. Pleasant  Agreeable.  Professional. The whole staff should go to Frances, which is charging the same amount for a meal, to see what I mean.  Or Delfina, or Firefly, or some other restaurant in walking distance aiming for the same upscale clientele, with lovely staff who know how to interact in a genuine way with diners. . The single most important thing: We arrived at , the restaurant was never full, they were not trying to turn our table, nor were they eager to get rid of us to close the place.  But at least a half dozen times, staff zoomed over to our table to try to take away half finished dishes.  ""Are you done with that?""  ""Can I take that away?""  Over and over again.  This creates the totally wrong vibe: It's not K Pop across the street where the bottom line might depend on turnover.  It's a place where maybe folks want to linger over a meal (again, they weren't trying to turn the table).  Relax! Especially at the prices you're charging. . As we left, our server and another server were out front smoking. That's really a turnoff, and not something you see elsewhere.  If the staff who is handling your food smokes, they usually do it where the customers can't see. Again: Take the whole staff out to Frances.  See how a restaurant charging what you're charging and angling for the same clientele in the same neighborhood gets it all right. So here is the deal, Byron was the best server at a previous restaurant. Now he is here. I trust that this place is amazing. Service alone. . . it's worth coming here for Byron! Loving their wine list and food!Pork Cheeks  amazingScallops  amazing (they were a special)Overall great experience. The entire staff was actually great as well. Came here recently with two friends for the first time. Service was fine, our waitress was attentive and personable. The issue for us was just the caliber of the food for the price. We ordered: Melon salad appetizer Soft shelled crab with an avocado slaw (appetizer special) Scallop and pork belly entree (special) ""Beetloaf"" entree Mac and cheese side dish Caramelized brussels sprouts side dishTotal came to $. The appetizers were just okay, not great but not bad either. The beetloaf, mac and cheese (very watery) and bsprouts (bad/weird flavor  and we're all big brussels sprout fans) were all major disappointments. My friend said that the scallops and pork belly were cooked well, so that seemed to be the winner of the night. For us the food just didn't deliver, and if I'm going to spend $ on  apps,  entrees and  small sides I'd much rather do so at Frances. Great food with a lovely wine list. Each menu selection has a suggested wine pairing. My wife and I shared the soup of the day, corn chowder, and the heirloom tomato salad. Both were amazing. She had the pot roast and I went for the the mixed kabobs. Again, both were very nice. We'll be going back again soon. *Great service. lovely ambiance. Friendly, attentive, patient with our questions, professional but not pretentious. Laid back and sophisticated at the same time!*Braised Pork Cheek  delicious and tender, rounded out well with granny smith apple/cider vinaigrette. *Pot Roast  Great flavor! Loved this dish, really well executed. *Au gratin  good, but the consistency was too thin which made it a bit awkward to eat. The flavor was strong and it tasted great, but it seemed more like a soup with odd vegetables. (large pieces of onion, squash dominated) I ended up dipping my bread in though and it was tasty, not gonna lie. *Risotto was cooked perfectly. Most delicious maybe I've ever had!Can't wait to return. Keep up the great work Fable, Castro needs more restaurants like you! Fable, how have I forgotten to review you?Fable is awesome.  Jon in the kitchen is amazing and Eric runs the dinning room.  The service is professional, and relaxed.  Food is quality, interesting, and delicious.   I've enjoyed dinner here a few times and each time it gets better.  Keep up the good work boys, thank you. Absolute  stars!!The service was great. The food was cooked and prepared perfectly. We order everything from wine and aps to desert and even a few side dishes. Everything that was brought out to us was above and beyond what was expected. I have been telling all my friends and family about this place. MUST GO! We stopped in here tonight for the first time. Anchor was full, and we were on our way to Starbelly but needed to run an errand on the other side of Castro, and the menu posted in front of Fable caught my eye. A bunch of interesting choices, many of them  nicely seasonal. We had no problem getting in as early as we were; the restaurant was filled by the time we left. We had one of those wonderful first time here not a wrong note experiences at Fable. Our starter (a tomato/cucumber/white peach salad) was fresh, light, and summery. The pot roast was as good as my Mom's  a compliment I've never dished out until now, my Mom made great pot roast! The summer squash gratin side dish  complemented the pot roast perfectly.  And the coconut cream cake was to die for. We're looking forward to exploring other parts of the menu in future visits. The service was terrific, informal, friendly, not too prompt, not too slow, just right. The noise level suited the meal  not too loud, but not deadly quiet either. To my surprise, the Castro is starting to become a foodie destination. Who'd a thunk it? In the long hiatus between the time Ryan's closed on th Street and Frances opened, the neighborhood was a culinary disaster, with Anchor providing the only high quality option. I've lived in the neighborhood a long time and usually left it for another part of town when I wanted a good meal. But now, with Eiji, Frances, and Fable coming on to the scene, we can get great meals close to home. Low and mid priced entries like Chow, Burger Meister, and Pica Pica round things out nicely. We had dined here at Fable several months ago and although the service was a little bit awkward, the food was really good. We were very excited to dine here again with our good friend. I had made reservations for the  of us a week in advance. I received a phone call from the restaurant the day prior to confirm and inform me that they will only hold the table for  minutes if we don't call to inform them in the event we were running late. We arrived on time looking forward to a evening of good food, wine and conversation. HOWEVER, the host started to seat us in the front table in the window that is by any reasonable person's standard, barely enough room for . Not to mention that it was a high table and we had to sit on bar stools. I told the host that we were very uncomfortable with the accommodations and ask him to seat us else where. He said that he would try but they had large groups in the back and he didn't think he could, but he said he would try. I believe this restaurant has a lot going for it. Great food and wine list. However, from a service perspective they seem to struggle. A professional host would have informed us that they had large groups and they were running behind. The host would also offer us the option of the substandard table or provide us with some expectation of a more reasonable table and an estimated wait time upfront without me having to ask. We were very disappointed, hungry and although the host thought he might be able to come up with a ""plan"", we couldn't wait and moved on. Luckily we were able to find a place and was able to enjoy good food and wine at a different restaurant without reservations. Slightly reminiscent of the Dot Com days when poor service was the norm in San Francisco. I know that they wouldn't have any problems seating a party of  or  that would be willing to sit in a very uncomfortable space after we left. The service was terrible. Just terrible. Our waitress didn't seem to give a sh*t about us and neither of us, my friend and I, felt welcome at this place. The food pretty good, although more expensive than it was worth, and that's the only reason it didn't get one star. I do not recommend and I will not be eating there again. Ugh. . . I really wanted to like this place. . Rebuffed by the host. (Anyone remember Dana Carvey's host charecter on SNL? ""Wait at the bar, wait at the bar. . . . "") . Our waitress was NOT in the mood. (Don't they realize that it's obvious when your being a bitch with a smile on your face?). Manager couldn't be bothered. (He literally asked if we we're okay from the KITCHEN. ). Food was delicious but not amazing. (For $, I expected more. )Most likely a perfect storm situation.  Worth a try I guess. I had no expectations when I came here for dinner a while ago, and was pleasantly surprised.  Our server was the friendliest and smiliest server I've seen in a while. We kept asking her lots of questions about the menu (they were legit questions, but we also liked talking to her, so had to keep asking questions).  We shared several appetizers and side dishes.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  The bread they serve was a nice crusty one, a free plus. We had dinner here on Friday and the food was very good, the service was great, and an all around great time. We walked in to our pm reservation and the previous group was finishing up. After waiting for less than  minutes, our group was seated. Immediately after sitting our waitress asked if she could get us started with water, wine, and/or beer. The four of us shared a bottle of wine and we ordered a couple appetizers (pork cheek so good!). I had the chicken, which was good. But, my partner had the wedge salad and pork chop, which was amazing. We also all shared a side of delicious mac n cheese. Such a good meal and a great experience! This little place is a great addition to Castro Street.  We shared a salad (blue cheese wedge), two entrees (pork chop and chicken), and glass of chardonnay for $ (including tip), so quite reasonable for the quality of the food.  All selections were fabulous.  Service was attentive and pleasant.  Really enjoyed this place and definitely recommend. evening reservations in the castro. . . quaint, casual, long and narrow fable. . . quite charming and nice. . . simple small menu variety for anyone. . . chicken, duck, lamb, pork, fish and even vegan. . . almost everything near $twenty main. . . simple bread and salted butter complimentary and good. . . under $fifteen starters. . . starting with strawberry salad and pork cheeks to share. . . dainty small plates of sweet strawberry and greens quite fresh. . . . pork cheeks delicious and succulent. . . found the chicken breast to have a nice salted crust and similar on the tuna. . . grilled pork chops flavorful, decent and filling. . . sliced lamb okay, but boring. . . finding the meals quite simple and decent meal overall. . . $one hundred twenty five total for four people. . . Love the storybook idea but it only applied to the font on the menu. I was hoping there would be more of a Fable theme in the restaurant but then I guess it could veer into super cheesy. Get the quinoa stuffed portobello mushroom, beautifully charred and offset with some kind of tangy/creamy sauce and grilled squashes. Waitstaff is incredible. So helpful and courteous. Yep. . Your eyes are not playing tricks on you   stars from me for Fable!We went for dinner on our first night in San Fran and had a wonderful time. I had the dijon crusted pork cheeks as entree and the crispy skinned chicken breast for  the main; and they were both amazing. For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse w/ whipped cream and it was well, for lack of a better word. . . quite simply orgasmic. . . I'm still thinking about it now and the pork cheeks as well!Fable serves modern american dishes and their prices are quite affordable + the service is great. They're quite busy so be sure to make a reservation prior to going. . I really enjoy my dining experience here. The food was great, and the wait staff was really friendly and accommodating. I would totally recommend this restaurant. First of all, impeccable service. Secondly, Jesus H. the food is good.  Pork cheeks, halibut, mac and cheese and chocolate mouse I DIE.  All done perfectly.  Plus, I love a space where they let you take your time.  We had lots of wine, lots of conversation and delicious food over a two hour period.  A fantastic date night. Thirdly, patio is coming soon. Boom. GO! EAT! GET IT ON AFTER! I am very impressed by this new Castro neighborhood spot! The ambiance is intimate, and seating inside is quite limited,(FYI, make a reservation well in advance), while the outside seating area has a fire pit that is great to have a drink and wait for your table to be ready. The menu was simple, but had many options for shared appetizer plates, and entrees. The staff was knowledgeable, professional, attentive, and there was good Motown music playing to lighten the mood. I recommend the pork pot stickers as an appetizer, (they were bread crusted and savory), and the braised lamb or pork chop for entrees all were well seasoned and served right. Given how high grade the foodie quality of the food was, the price was quite reasonable. Chef Hearnsberger, the main owner and formerly of Woodfish Grill is an outstanding chef. Fable is a gorgeous little place with a charming interior and lovely patio out back. The food and service really are impressive quite possibly the best restaurant in the Castro and one of the best gems in the city. Regardless of your tastes and preferences in food and dining options, you and your friends should at least give this place a onceover. It's definitely worth it. Meh.  Another offering in line with the neighborhood tradition: an ""all form, little  substance"" Castro dining experience. To be fair, the service was excellent, very attentive.  The food was beautifully presented (very pretty on the plate!) but mediocre in taste, oversalted, tiny portions.  Noisy and crowded.  I'm unlikely to return. Absolutely  stars. But then again my friends own the place and I couldn't expect anything less. But you be the judge. Service is outstanding. The food was amazing. . . try the Pot Roast or the Chicken with one of their side dishes or the Gem Salad. Now one word of advice. . . MAKE A RESERVATION! or you are taking a chance since they have been solid booked since the first day they opened. Went here after walking around Castro for awhile. They didn't have any room but took our number to call when something opened up. We sat at the chef's bar which is always fun. Nice waiter explained some of the dishes for us. Had the calamari & the green goddess salad to start  both very good. Two of us had the crispy chicken w/sticky rice  delicious. One had the pot roast & said it was delicious. The rhubarb strawberry crisp was a little too sweet for me. Overall nice place, would recommend it for a leisurely meal with good service & food, not too pricey & a good wine list  as well. I had an absolutely fantastic experience at Fable Sunday night. We actually only discovered that they've been open for a little while now by checking the web. It was a wonderful surprise to have a new restaurant open in our hood and to find that the food was so good. Plus, they've really improved the decor and ambience of this space. Someone has a good eye for presentation and it shows. We had a couple rounds of tasty wine to accompany our appetizer and main courses. We shared the special soft crab mixed salad, which was fresh, well seasoned, and just enough to tide us over 'til the main event. I had the pot roast, he had the wild salmon and neither could have been more content. The pot roast was obviously carefully slow roasted and produced a really tasty gravy to dip the mashed potatoes and veggies in. There were carrots, asparagus, fava beans, and I believe tiny cherries. It was awesome! Ordinarily I would pass on dessert but I figured I had to top off such a pleasant experience with something sweet. The chocolate mousse w/ salted caramel whipped cream fit the bill. It was light but such a nice treat. All in all, Fable is great and we will definitely be returning soon! The best food I've had in the Castro. I started with the corn chowder, a soup I would normally avoid due to it being more of a gummy paste. This corn chowder was actually soup like and had such a delicious, fresh corn flavor to it. I tried the leg of lamb with potato cake and vegetables. The lamb may be the best lamb I've ever had, and the potato cake was quite delicious. Dessert was the dark chocolate mousse, which can only be described as sinful! Parking is what is is since you are dining in the Castro, but this one is worth the trip even if you don't live in the Castro area! The Castro finally gets a good restaurant!I have eaten here twice and had great experiences both times.  The meat was cooked as I ordered it (which should be a given but sadly is not), the service was good, and it was just an overall pleasant upscale experience. I would ask that they consider not playing music when they are busy.  It just adds to the noise. This place will be even better (and more popular) when they open the patio in the back. This was a great experience.  Yes there was a short wait for our table but the staff kept us informed about the situation, we had our wine and really I do go out to eat to relax and enjoy the company of my friends.  The food was excellent and the service (Thank you Ramsey) was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  I live right around the corner and I'm sure I'll be back often.  They also told us that brunch has been added to the schedule, I predict French Toast in my near future. Having recently moved to SF, I was told that the food in the Castro left a little to be desired. Which is why I was so thrilled to have found Fable on Castro between th and th. Though the menu is not large, each item is well crafted and memorable. The staff also deserves special mention, as all of the servers, clearers and hosts were friendly and helpful. I can't wait to go back! Our party of  made reservations one week in advance.  We arrived about  minutes early and our table was ready on Saturday night. .  We tried many items on the menu and everything was very good.  Service and ambiance exceeded our expectations.   The chef owner even managed time to stop by our table. Fable is still relatively new but they seem to have settled in and have their sea legs.  Long and short of it, Fable serves very good food, provides very good and caring service and is a very nice venue. I started my meal with a sweet corn bisque.  Happily this wasn't some too sweet, cream based diet busting bowl of soup.  Rather it was based on a light broth that was filled with corn, potatoes, and some very nice and subtle spicing that brought the bowl to life.  Great. Dijon crusted pork cheeks came with lacinato kale and granny smith apples.  Bullseye!  Another big winner.  The mustard perfectly complemented the braised, tender, not too fatty pork cheeks.  The kale was a mellowing influence on the plate that was highlighted by the apples.  Wonderful. Next a main of leg of lamb that came with a potato patty and freshly braised vegetables. The lamb was nicely cooked to medium rare but it's taste was so ephemeral that it might have been beef.  The vegetables and potato were nicely done.  So, the weakest plate of my meal was only very good. My pour of pinot noir was generous as were the portions of each course.  Pricing is very fair given the quality of the food. I will certainly come back and you should try this place. Good place and the chef and staff are really making a  percent effort.  Reservations definitely recommended. It's nice to see the restaurant scene in the Castro starting to improve with the additions of Starbelly, Frances and now Fable in the past few years. We had a date night here tonight and the food was fabulous from beginning to end.  We started with the gem salad with green goddess dressing and ahi tuna salad.  Both salads were superb.  Our main courses were the lamb and the pot roast.  The lamb was medium rare and tender.  The pot roast was beefy and tender.  Delicious.  Dessert was the dark chocolate mousse with caramel whipped cream, and sourdough bread pudding in a cherry sauce.  Wonderful. Don't hesitate  go eat here.  You won't be sorry. Oh, service was also terrific from the greeting from the host to our server to the man who prepared our salads and desserts.  We ate at the counter.  The food was prepped and plated carefully and presented well.  We'll be returning. The new Castro restaurant Fable was really good.  Food tends to have bold flavors with some creativity.  Service was good too.  Seating is a bit hard due to demand.  Special fried soft shell crab was very tasty.  Tuna tartare was some of the best I've tried.  Leg of lamb was good and the blue cheese broccoli gratin was quite flavorful.  Usually don't do dessert, but the bitter sweet chocolate Carmel moose with sea salt was worth the $.  Overall great choice if you can get in. I love to cook and silently despise people who criticize my food.  Ironically, I must be a sucker for torture because I silently love their criticisms in the same way, as it allows me to refine my methods to make a better spread the next time around.  Ambiance was awesome, chef/owner was very nice and staff was very attentive.  After having waited for about an hour to be seated (we went to have drinks at another place and they conveniently called us when our table was ready, which was nice) we ordered a few items that seemed very palpable on the menu.  When we received our meals, they were very well presented and looked yummy but (think drum roll from national lampoons christmas vacation/no lights) they didn't taste as well as they were presented.  I ordred the pot roast and my friend ordered the lamb, both of which were just, meh. I loved that the pot roast was served on a bed of legumes and had a nice gravy poured on top of it and the meat was very tender but the flavor was pretty bland (kick the gravy up maybe?).  I can't speak for my friend's lamb but the taste I had was mediocre and left me wanting a richer sauce on that as well.  However, I AM glad I ordered the macaroni and cheese (goat cheese added a kick) and the chocolate mousse dessert was very delish (I think it had salted caramel whipped cream on top, YUM).   In end, I know this is a new place and it shows a lot of potential.  With a little fine tuning, I'm sure this place will become a tasty success. I'll see about coming back in a year for another review. This place is amazing!! Great service and super accommodating. They didn't have a table for us when we got there, but they took our number so we could go have a drink while we waited. The food is incredible  I had the pork tenderloin with their homemade hot sauce and black eyed pea cake best pork I've ever had. My sister had the salmon which she loved, and my friend had the chicken. All great. Nice wine selection, too!Byron the host and Ramsey our waiter were a couple of other highlights so nice and attentive. We literally hugged them when we left!We will definitely be back here, especially when the patio is open in the back. I am ever so glad that Fable is here and that Jon is back! I've been to Fable three times now, and each time I leave more and more crazy about it. We have never had to wait more than ten minutes to be seated (and once was on Mother's Day!) Another time,  I wandered in with a friend during a packed evening, thinking it would be a huge wait, and instead we were seated immediately at the bar, which we loved. The food is amazing  the wine list is interesting and very reasonably priced, and the staff has been lovely. I'm not sure of the name of the host  but he's helpful, fun and professional. This is our new favorite neighborhood spot and we are thrilled. Word on the street (Castro Street) is that brunch is coming soon. Yum. I'm always excited to try a place when it is new. I heard about Fable and made my reservation for a Friday night around pm. We were a little early and were seated right away. The location is convenient and easily accessible at the upper end of Castro. The atmosphere is pleasing. They used the current trendy slate grey with taupe coloring. There is a mural on the long wall. Orange antler horn light fixtures add a pop of color. The bar cozies right up to the kitchen, which is where I will sit next time. The staff was very pleasant and attentive and our waitress was great on suggestions and knowing the menu. Now the food. . . It wasn't trendy enough to be interesting or simple enough to qualify as comfort food. It was tasty enough but not memorable. The restaurant is new and the menu may develop itself.  One exceptional point however was when our plates were picked up, the owner ,Eric, came to our table to ask if we didn't enjoy the macaroni and cheese. We explained there was nothing wrong with it but just not to our liking. When we received our bill, which was very reasonable, the dish had been removed from our bill. That is customer service. When we left, I made a point to express to Eric that his action was exceptional customer service. It is apparent that Eric is passionate about his restaurant. I can appreciate anyone that loves something that much and makes an effort to make it an exceptional experience to the best of their ability. I intend to come back if nothing more than to watch them grow as a local restaurant in the Castro and to show my appreciation for Eric. We had to wait  minutes past our reservation time but the staff was apologetic about the wait.  Other than that glitch, we had a great dinner here. The braised pork cheeks were my favorite, though they are very mustard y.  The kale/apple/shallot mix that accompanies it was really refreshing, I could probably eat a whole bowl of that alone. I got the crispy skinned chicken breast as my main.  I didn't find the chicken to be particularly remarkable but I did like the strawberry salad on the side. Finally, we shared a chocolate mousse, and the salt on top (I think it was chipotle salt? not sure) was a nice added touch. The restaurant is adorably decorated inside.  Great date place, not so much for groups. I wanted to try this new restaurant in the Castro, so I dragged the BF to Fable. After a rocky start (we had to wait over  minutes for a table for two), we were very, very pleasantly surprised by the very nice and attentive waitress and the taste of every dish we had. We had the melon and avocado salad, tuna tartare with (tr especially yummy) crostini, pork chop, and sautéed white corn.  We finished it with the strawberry rhubarb crisp!  I cannot say anything negative about the food or the service!  I am so glad it is there and will most definitely return soon! It's true when people write that we are spoiled living here in San Francisco regarding our choices in dining. But, Fable made me realize that I've also become accustomed to the way dishes are seasoned here in SF. Tonight was a revelation in flavoring familiar dishes.  The North African spiced chicken breast served with a side of ""forbidden rice"" was a wake up call.  I haven't had those spices in a while and it was a welcome change of pace.  The rice contained bits of celery, carrots and fresh, ripe peach.  It was a well thought out dish that paired together unexpectedly for me. The soup that we started with was a cauliflower and parsnip mix.  Served very hot, it was again flavored in a unique way that caught me by surprise. Tonight they offered fresh dungeness crab as an addition to any starter so, we included it in their tarragon flavored green goddess salad.  This salad included little gem lettuce, beets, shaved pecorino cheese and croutons. Service was excellent.  We opted for Trumer Pilsner over a glass of wine tonight.  Dessert was the fresh berry tart. Looking forward to the outdoor space opening soon. Pretty disappointing evening, and it will be hard to think of returning. After having gone to Fable on several occasions, and having enjoyed some very good meals there, we made a reservation weeks in advance for a Friday night. We had to make a last minute change to add one person and were assured there would be no problem to do so. We showed up at pm (the appointed hour) and ultimately left at :, still waiting for a table that was clearly not going to materialize (indeed, as we walked out, the people at the table we were waiting for were being served their entree). In the end, who knows who was at fault, but it does seem that a restaurant that is looking to establish itself in the neighborhood would be more attentive and seek to provide better service. It's not clear what the purpose of making a reservation really is if by  minutes after the appointed hour you are still standing there waiting. To be fair, they offered us a spot at the bar area that faces the open kitchen (although it' s not clear how much longer that would have taken). All in all, really disappointing, especially given how much we had enjoyed the food in the past. Not sure we will return and it's hard to recommend a restaurant with this kind of service given the many, superb options in SF. Really too bad.  But I wish them well. First of all, I must say it is great to have chef/co owner Jon Hearnsberger back in the Castro again!Last night the food was impeccable.  We started with two appetizers, the tuna tartar and the beef cheek, both delicious.  For entrees, I thoroughly enjoyed the lamb.  Probably the best lamb dish I ever had.  My guest felt the same way about the salmon.   For desert, a wonderful chocolate mousse. This is an amazing place. The food was terrific and the service even better. Chicken dish was superb. Likewise the starters/salads. The staff was very attentive and helpful without hovering. This is my first five star rating. Glad I ventured to the Castro for this place!  I wasn't expecting much, but I was blown away by the food.  We ordered all of our server's recommendations, and they were spot on. The food was creative and fresh, and so reasonable priced. The tangerine carpaccio with almond, fennel, avocado and habanero oil was incredible!  Sat at the high bar near the door, which was ok.  Looking forward to the back patio opening in the fall. Took my girlfriend here for a date night.  We'd probably go back. I don't want to be mean to a new business so I'll give them a generous rating of  stars. As you can see, we eat out a lot but on the weekends. It's our thing, we look forward to it. So we've been to a lot of restaurants. And as such we've learned to expect certain things with certain restaurants. Expectations for a taqueria are different than for a French restaurant, for example. With Fable yes we had some expectations. I had to reserve  weeks in advance since they didn't have the time on a Friday we wanted. That very rarely happens to me; usually will get reservations a day or at most a week in advance. Let's start out with the location in the Castro. . very nice. Close to everything. When we arrived, somebody (not sure if he was the host) held up a finger towards us (index) indicating he would be with us soon. And he proceeded to hug his buddies who just arrived (hey gurl!). Never saw him again. Another man appeared, maybe he's the host? I don't know he's wearing jeans and his shirt is untucked. And there's no host stand at the front. Oh we'll just trust him and follow him towards the very back table, by the restroom. Our reserved table!  weeks reservation and we get prime location by the restroom. Yay. So we're at our table.  minutes pass by. . no one says hello, no one greets us. I'm ready to leave. Maybe our server sees this on my face (he's been passing us by this whole time), and finally starts a serving us. He's a nice enough guy; by the end of the evening he's proven himself to be very good and attentive. (But at times also finds his shirt untucked, then tucked again. . hmm this is weird. Same thing with the ""host""). We're looking around. Can't really tell what this place is wanting to project. I see deer and antlers. But they feel like afterthought. The customers are older, mostly gay men. They all seem so serious. And just unhappy. This unhappiness can be seen on the faces of the employees of the restaurant as well. Oh this is not good. I'm starting to get depressed. We need wine!So we order wine. We order some sides instead of the starters as none interested us (they were mostly salads). The mac and cheese and broccoli au gratin. I take out my phone camera to take a pic. . eek you can't tell what they are, so I put my camera away. First sign something is not going to be good: you can't tell what the food is by looking at it. And yup they were mediocre. Mac and cheese was more mac than cheese. The broccoli was more soup du jour than gratin. Neither was cheesy  or creamy enough, and they felt rushed. For main dish I ordered the wild boar sausage, and my partner ordered the pork chops. My generous rating is based on these two dishes: they were very good. And like I said, the server redeemed himself towards the end. I don't however see Fable succeeding, unfortunately. I didn't see passion, excitement, curiousity, or urge to please that most new restaurants should exhibit. This may be one day merely a fable told in a story, and not anything real. Is Fable a dream come true? Not quite but there are some good elements to this story. Positive things+the food was all good to excellent. We ordered five dishes all either starters or side dishes. We had:+the pork cheeks which was the best dish and really would make a good main. three cheeks with a great apple & greens salad. sweet pea soup, it was good but one note in taste and texture & it was served way too hot+grilled artichoke, served with a great aioli and bacon crumble that perfectly cooked and served nice and warm+broccoli and morel gratin, there was simply not enough cheese it in and the morels were overwhelmed by the Béchamel sauce but it was still a very tasty dish mac and cheese. We got the fresh crab with it was an extra  dollars. It tasted best once we mixed it into the mac and cheese. The mac and cheese had a nice flavour but it was missing the cheese and the French Spouse was very disappointed it didn't have any bread crumbs on it and wasn't gratined. We finished with a real French style chocolate mousse which was nice and think the way a mousse is in France and not a pot du creme which is often called ""mousse"" in the US. +The prices are very good for a San Francisco sit down dinner with everything under .  The portions are also good for the price. The less positive super noisy, doesn't appear that they did any sound dampening and everything is hard surfaces, also there was horrible early 's pop Rn'B playing loudly. the host was a bit standoffish when we got there, our server forgot one our dishes, they brought out all the dishes at the same time, food was served way too hot with two dishes. All little things that can be improved. They had almost no non alcoholic drinks not even ginger ale or sprite or sparkling water. The restthe decor is hipster with wall paper that looks like wood, lots of antlers in bright colours and lots of prints of animals. There are mirrors with frosted glass prints of stags which the French Spouse found to be straight out of Vegas but I thought were hipster takes on tapestries. The space isn't large with bar seating and high tables in the front and more formal dining tables in the back. The patio wouldn't be open until the end of summer. All in all, this is a good addition to Castro and is a nice blend of good modern American food at reasonable prices. When I first went to this place, it was so good. . . That I made reservations for the following week, after paying the bill. . . So I never thought I'd be writing this, but. . . The attention to detail is faltering already. . . The plate I ordered last night had  things on the plate, that were each at different temperatures. . . The lamb was cold and of the  sides. . . One was hot and the other was tepid . . . The bread was also tough last night,      Make your own mind up about it. . . But with so many great options available down on Valencia St. . . My advise to the chef is. . . Details, details. . . details. Two of us had dinner at the bar roasted artichoke, chicken, and sole. Every single thing was great, including all the sides. Fantastic! I went last Thursday with my family ( diners in total) and there wasn't space in the restaurant, so they fit us in the bar, right in front of everyone preparing our food. Perfect! It was amazing to see our dishes made literally right in front of us. But this place isn't just about atmosphere the food really shines through. Of all the dishes I tasted, my favorite was definitely the lamb (among the fish, duck, and steak dishes I tried). It just hit all the right notes for me, although it was very difficult to decide which was best. I was a little too nervous to try the Beetloaf, although having tried all those other dishes I'm sure hoping to return and try it. This is definitely my new favorite restaurant in the Castro and hopefully will be returning soon."
Stones Throw|4.5|American (New) in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|333|-1|4.39563862928|" This was an amazing experience from the moment I walked in the door. I've rarely met friendlier and more attentive staff every single person, from the host to the waitresses to the chef brightened my day with a smile and great communication. The first thing they put down on the table was awesome, and it wasn't even the food: it was the sparkling water. Okay, you're saying, what? Sparkling water? Who cares? It's just like every other sparkling water. But not here. They had some kind of magical unpronounceable potion that merely masquerades as sparkling water on its off nights. I took one sip and I was like, ""Whoa!""Now, maybe you're thinking, this guy's spent a whole paragraph on water; are we ever going to talk about the food? Yes! Wow, yes. Just like almost all the other reviewers, I had the puffed potato and egg, which was creamy, interesting, savory, and smooth. Really a delightful starter. Then for my main, I had the duck, which was equally as mind blowing as everything else, if not more. It came with so many cool little extra things (all of which were awesome) that I can't even tell you what they all were. I'm not sure my prose is up to describing this duck; I think you'll have to try it for yourself. Overall, extremely worthwhile. Expensive, but completely and absolutely worth it. Absolutely magnificent dinner!  Innovative and delicious.  The atmosphere is comfortable and casual in a quiet Russian Hill neighborhood.  An absolute must for visitors or locals.  UberCab it from Union square, totally worth the $ ride to have dinner made by Chef Jason Halverson! Located in Russian Hill, Stones Throw is a trendy spot to grub with a great menu including their not so healthy but flavorful duck pate. Considering the quality of eateries you can find in Russian Hill Stones Throw is definitely a must try if you're in the area!I did want to point out the heavy dust that has settled over the lamps that are above some of the dinning room tables. You can't but figure those dust particles are continuously raining down on the tables, food and whatnot. Now I'm giving the venue a four star qualification but it would be nice if management addressed this issue and perhaps ran some air purifiers to clean up the air. I've been here several times and the service is great and well the food is fantastic too. I like the eclectic variety of dishes as well as their seasonal plates and drinks. I will definitely come back and recommend this place to everyone I know but. . . . MANAGEMENT PLEASE CLEAN THE PLACE UP! The menu makes big, big promises. It is absolutely mouthwatering. And then the food arrives and the portions are teny!! I can't say that all the flavors described in the entree listings come through in the food. I came for brunch and ordered the french toast, which was good but as I said, not filling and not as epicurean as described and therefore  to me  not worth the cost. I came here for a dinner with friends on a weeknight  we had a reservation so there was no wait. The interior is very intimate and cozy, but sociable enough to go with a group of friends instead of a date. We shared the potato puffs, squid ink pasta, and duck pate. I loved all of it! I thought the squid ink pasta would be gross, but the pasta was very chewy and not heavy on the squid ink flavor, which was nice. The portions were very small, but enough to keep us occupied till our main course. I ordered the crispy skinned bass and my friends each tried something different  the duck, burger and steak dishes. The bass was delicious; my only complaint was that I thought the broth was slightly salty. The duck looked really good; it's on my list of 'to try's. Everyone gave their respective dish a huge thumbs up. Tip: apparently the tater tots that come with the burger are made out of potato puree so the inside is mushy and delicious. They also seemed to have a good wine / beer selection. Overall, service was great. Quick, friendly and very attentive. Definitely a place worth checking out! After months of walking by this joint I was excited to nab a reservation for this joint for a friends birthday. I called ahead and asked the restaurant to do something for her birthday and they were kind enough to set up a hand written note and offer us dessert at the end but im getting ahead of myself. The restaurant itself is a in nice quaint area of Russian hill and there are the cable cars up and down the street showing the SF flair. The décor of the joint is really simple and modern. They have a bar setup and multiple tables. The servers were all very friendly and we were promptly seated for our reservation. We perused the menu after the bday girl was happy about her handwritten note and decided to order multiple starters including a bottle of vino. They had a great vino selection and we were easily able to find a bottle to our liking. We decided to order the Duck Pate, Squid Ink Pasta, Grilled octopus and okonomiyaki pancake, Da burger aka da Disaster, and the striped bass. The Duck pate was good but also a bit rich after a few bites so drink up the vino and use lots of the pretzel roll. The squid ink pasta was standard but well done and we ate every bite of it. The pancake was very unique and pretty solid which was surprising as I thought this would be a hard dish to pull off. The burger was delicious and extremely big. The tater tots were a bit forgettable for me but the main was solid. The striped bass was delicious as well. They brought out a ""surprise"" dessert for the bday girl afterwards to wrap up the dinner. All in all, a good experience at this joint. Good flavors that are refined will be a joint I come back to for an intimate dinner with friends or a date. It's rare to find a new American restaurant now a days that offers you a unique selection of food more than just the typical steak and chicken dishes. This restaurant by far has surpassed my expectations. I would without a doubt go here over and over again. Some stand out dishes are the pate, duck and the bass. Not only was the food good but the service was just as good. They made us feel like regulars that we're going to our local dinner spot. You won't regret going here. I'd love to love Stones Throw. The menu was whimsical and fun, and the dishes ordered were inspired, well executed, and plated with an artful hand. Flavors and tastes were just as on point as the dishes looked. The challenge was the complete lack of regard for good service. A server that is an order taker is a shame at an establishment like this, and that's how I would describe our service that night. Cold, entitled, and unwelcoming, and like pulling teeth to get recommendations on wine or favorite dishes. This type of service is fine for a diner, but for the high quality of this restaurant it makes a significant disconnect. The complimentary dish sent out since we inquired about it,but didn't order it, was a nice effort to make up for lack of effort, and clearly one knows that it can be credited for an extra tip on top of the  but it's times like this I wished I didn't have my industry hat on, because it wasn't well deserved. To compliment the hard work and craft of these chefs, the service really needs to be at the same caliber, and it made this experience so hard to swallow. Would I go back? Absolutely for the food, but it's been months since, and my reluctance seems to have gotten the best of me. I have been hyped up about this place for quite a while now.  After eating dinner here last Saturday, I am pleased to say that it definitely lived up to the hype. First of all, the service could not have been more on point. Expect to be greeted warmly upon entering and leaving. It is hard to explain  but you get that genuine welcoming feeling from the staff. For dinner, we shared three small plates and two entrees:  Shrimp Cocktail, Puffed Potato and Eggs, Salt Baked Beet and Fennel Salad, Duck Breast, and Slow Roasted Ribeye.  All of which were great and unique, but my least favorite was the shrimp cocktail. It was good, but the other dishes definitely out shined it. Stones Throw has a very creative take on dessert. In addition to offering a delicious dessert menu, they also invite you to inspire them for new dessert ideas. You can choose your favorite childhood treat and the chefs may create an inventive, yet similar concoction. You can also leave your email so they can email you if they decide to choose your idea to be featured on their menu. Cool huh?Anyways, don't hesitate to dine at this great establishment  your tummy will thank you. We started off with the duck pate, puffed potato and eggs, and warm mushroom ragout followed by the squid ink pasta and warm pork belly  every dish was bursting with flavour and definitely woke my taste buds. Definitely coming back here to try da burga my next visit to SF! I came here a month ago and I'm already back. The first experience was awesome; second. . . EVEN BETTER!Let's start with the wine, prices are in my wheelhouse and cab we had was delicious. We all had a glass of the same wine and the waiter gave us some generous pours, which was really nice. Now onto food. To start we had a couple snacks and apps. On the snack front, we ordered the Warm Mushroom Ragout and Duck Pate. But we were also considering the Puffed Potato & Eggs. So the they just brought us all  and WOW They were both just rich enough and incredibly delicious. I think the Potato & Eggs were the winner for me. On the app front, we had the Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta and the Beet & Fennel Salad. The Squid Ink Pasta is one of their most popular dishes. It's probably among the best squid ink pasta I've ever had. I will get this dish every time I come here, which will probably be quite often. Entree time, we had the Prime Beef Ribeye and the Agnolotti. The Ribeye was cooked perfectly IMO (I ordered medium rare). If you're not hungry yet, then wait until I get to dessert. We got the chance to try everything. They do a nice culinary fine dining twist on childhood desserts which is pretty cool. The smores and nilla wafers in banana pudding were my favorites. Oh and they take suggestions for desserts to add to their menu in the future!Hats off to Stones Throw! You've knocked me off my feet once again. I will be back! What a great restaurant! I have been waiting to come here for a while and the food and service did not disappoint. We ordered  appetizers and  entrees to share for the table. The apps were the eggs and potatoes and the pork belly. The eggs and potato is one of their signature dishes and it wowed. I'm still trying to figure out how they get egg yokes in the fried potato ball. My money is on them freezing the egg yoke and then encasing it in the potatoes before frying the little suckers. The puree of cauliflower perfectly complemented the subtle sweetness of the potatoes. Definitely order it!The pork belly was also great. It was soft and you can actually taste the pork. It didn't taste oily or fatty, either. It was artfully presented and oh so yummy. My entree was the duck. The heirloom carrots that came with it was almost as good as the duck. I ordered the dish medium rare and the chef delivered. It was almost slightly undercooked and a bit stringy. I also wish they crisped up the skin a bit more. The sauce was great, though. I also tried a bite of my friend's rib eye and it had intense flavor. I didn't get to try my friend's fish, but she loved it. We also ordered the banana vanilla wafers dessert. It was light and comforting. I should make something like that at home! Stone's Throw has some kicking cocktails, too. All in all, it was a great experience. Will definitely be back again! When I see a restaurant that has so many great reviews and a few that are trashing the place I often take into account that the few are just errant malcontents. Not so this time, although  I have to admit we were a party of  and most of the others liked the place. When I sat down I was looking at the yelp reviews on my phone and the waiter said; ""I'll be a lot more help to you that those reviews. "" NOT UNLESS HE COULD MAKE THE PORTIONS BIGGER! I've eaten in those she she French places, Stones throw makes them look like Good and Plenty in Pennsylvania where the Amish feed you till you burst. If you're going to be pretentious and serve entrees that are the size of Nouveau Cuisine at least the taste should be there, this wasn't. So disappointed I don;t even want to continue reviewing. We came as walk ins during a Friday night and ended up getting seated right away at the bar. The space is really cute and the dishes were awesome. The bartender had awesome recommendations for wine and beer. The carried one of the best pinots I've had in awhile. My boyfriend got a sour beer and there beer menu was pretty expansive. We came by during my birthday weekend for brunch one Saturday afternoon after snagging a reservation online. Upon entry we were seated alongside the front window which was perfect since it was one of those SF Summer in Autumn day. We ordered several dishes to share and while everything was great I will say the one thing that stuck out is their Butter fried pancakes with European butter. As simple as it is, the pancakes were deliciously buttery, not overly sweet, and it had that amazing crispy buttery edges as we were told these are baked, not cooked on a griddle like normal pancakes despite being called ""butter fried"". I am literally salivating as I speak. The staff are welcoming, chipper and warm and we had a laugh about the parking situation out front. I mean why is it so hard to find parking in Russian Hill?!Just take a quick look at their menu items, particularly their dinner. Everything sounds incredible. Definitely a neighborhood gem. This is a must try. Came here with my father who was, let's say, already into the night a bit. I was worn down from outside lands. But, the owner was more than accomidating, setting us up at the bar while we waited for the table. Chef sent out some mysterious foam breadsticks which were good though quite confusing. Food was good, classic trendy american fare. Outstanding. Came in here on a hunch since it's been in the neighborhood and a visit seemed overdue. The atmosphere was more casual than I expected, but the food was second to none. Great portions, great variety  service was good but not super attentive, perhaps a bit of room for improvement there. But basically a top notch experience, we'll be back! Delicious food, incredible beer menu, fantastic service. I only wish I could eat at Stones Throw every night of the week. I came here for a dinner with a couple of coworkers. The space is open and modern. We decided to order family style. To start we shared the puffed potato and egg. As my fork cut into the little ball, a gooey egg ran out. Scrumptious! The beet salad looked like a modern piece of art and was light and simple. The squid ink conchigle didn't have as much seafood or flavor as I had hoped for. The stripped bass was excellent in a ramen broth with farro. For dessert we shared the pavlova and the banana cream pie. Wow! What a dessert. The banana cream pie was superb, and creamy. I'm never one to complain about price but I was shocked to see the bill considering we only ordered one entree and two appetizers and a snack. Over $. We did have a $ bottle of wine, but this seemed very highly priced, even for San Francisco. Good but really expensive so I would not rush back. Small portions. Loved the brunch. So, so, so good. Came for a special occasion and it was a great choice. Parking sucks, but it's SF so what's new? The service was on point, and interestingly it seemed to be an all male wait staff; not sure if it was just the night or is intentional. My dining partner did have the only negative comment of the evening that there was far too much urine around the toilet for a restaurant as cute as this is, but if there are few women on staff, it seems sadly unsurprising. Still, mop around the toilet fellas! I didn't see it, so I can't confirm her findings. However, sullied bathroom aside, this place is fantastic. Inventive without being crazy. Bites with all parts of a plate, or pieces of it, were equally delicious. I had the sea bass, my fellow diner had the duck for our entrees, both were fantastic. Our snacks & starters were the potato egg balls, which in reviewing fellow yelpers' pictures, our may have been a bit overcooked as our yolks were solid. Still yummy, but would have preferred a looser yolk. We also had the mushroom ragout, which was super flavorful and delicious and the squid ink pasta which was quite lovely  especially the foam which seemed to be a very delicate sweet onion.  Dessert was a tough choice, so we didn't choose and got both the s'mores and the pb&j donuts. Though the s'mores was quite yummy, I was surprised by how effing delicious the donuts were. I didn't want them to end and held myself back from licking the plate. Crazy good all around. Left feeling full and quite happy. We didn't hold back ordering (as you can tell), and also had  drinks per person in addition to the  starters,  entrees, and  desserts (just call me Fatty McFatterson, I've earned it). All said, however, the tab was just over $ all in. I'd say that's not bad considering the quality of every component of the evening. Stones Throw has yet to disappoint. Had an amazing brunch this morning, after having had dinner here twice. We split the puffed potato and egg, smoked salmon mousse, messy breakfast sandwich, and the brioche pain perdu. The only thing that did not completely wow me was the smoked salmon mousse. It was good, but everything else was off the chain! Splitting the sandwich and brioche is perfect balance of sweet and savory. The Espresso version  go here and get ready for one of the best nights you'll have. Stones Throw is a dining experience like going over to your best friend's house for a dinner party, and your best friend happens to be the master chef of last season.  It's like they have a giant tub of a secret ingredient called ""Love"". This treasure of a restaurant is worth the arduous journey of finding parking in Russian Hill. The staff is a superior blend of attentive service and authentic, friendly personalities. The menu is a smorgasbord of consistently high quality across inventive dishes that delighted our table throughout the night. Every one of the following dishes are worth ordering:Snacks/starters: Squid ink pastaDuck pateWild mushroom ragoutMain: DuckSea bassRibeyeThey even have a great selection of wine and beers, both of which I am an avid high standard consumer. I don't know why I'm writing this review this way. I think it's because Stones Throw made me feel like a pretentious restaurant reviewer for the first time in my life. Comin' back for sure. Let's cut to the chase: Everything I tasted here was incredible. Despite yelp classifying this place as American, some of the menu items are more of a fusion of different cuisines so you won't find anything that's ""typical American""  which is refreshing. This is one of the rare restaurants where everything on the plate tasted great together vs. sometimes I get fancy looking dishes and the garnishes and stuff on the side are kind of gross or feel like an after thought. For starters: Grilled Octopus & Okonomiyaki Pancake  very interesting combination and pretty unique. Delicious. Mains: Crispy Skinned Wild Virgina Striped Bass  Pretty good. It's very interesting with the addition of the Ramen style Miso Broth. LIBERTY FARMS DUCK BREAST  I highly recommend this dish  it was so melt in your mouth good. I don't think I want duck from anywhere else after this  that duck was cooked so perfectly it felt like butter was twerking my mouth. Dessert: Campfire S'mores  Absolutely delicious dessert  sophisticated and well done. I scraped the crumbs and if it was not socially unacceptable, I would have licked that plate head first like a dog. I would love to return and try some of the other amazing sounding dishes next time around! Went here with friends for the first time. I was thinking this place was going to be American cuisine, but after looking at the menu, it's more of an Asian fusion. We tried the octopus fried pancake, sea bass and the duck. All were exceptionally good. We finished with the s'mores dessert. I had the bass, which I thought was perfectly cooked and had a nice ramen like broth sitting at the base. The octopus pancake was a good appetizer and perfect to share. Overall no complaints and was very satisfied. The restaurant is a bit noisy and I found myself talking a little louder than usual, but other than that, a charming spot for a date or catching up with friends in Russian Hill. This is my new favorite restaurant.   We had the squid ink pasta, mushroom ragout, potato & egg and octopus appetizers.   They were all good, but do yourself a favor and have the squid ink pasta and octopus!  I hate these things normally, but this place makes the pasta look so appetizing and the octopus is so tender, it's amazing! I couldn't resist a taste which eventually turned into almost finishing both dishes :P. My friend had ""da burga"" which came with the best tater tots I've ever had.  My husband had the ribeye, which was perfectly prepared, and I had the pork tenderloin with pork belly spatzle.   We finished with the donuts, smores and pavlova desserts which were all delicious.   It's pretty unusual to find a place that does all three courses equally well and doesn't disappoint as the dinner progresses.  This place has it all.  To top it off, they have an extensive beer menu.  I had the Dieu du Ciel Rigor Mortis which went well with everything, in addition to having a high enough ABV to make it worth the calories ;). I started with the orange blossom cocktail and ended with the PB&J donuts, and I can contently say that this meal was great from drinks to dessert. The orange blossom was pretty great. If you are concerned about it being too sweet or too dry, don't be. It did receive and delightful, quite well balanced. I would put it in the range of a French . And if you're not a cocktail person, there are  craft beers on the menu, so take your pick. We got the potato and egg. Honestly, we weren't sure about it, but it looked and smelled so delicious that the table next to us promptly order the same thing. Which brings me to another point, the tables are all quite close together. I don't mind when my neighbours ask for recommendations, but if you're looking to have a private conversation, you may want to consider an alternative location. We also got the risotto, the pork, amd the agnolotti. Good choices all around. Nothing to rave about over and above the other dishes, but the consistency put this place over the top. Last but not least, the PB&J donuts. Get some. I don't have anything more to say on that topic . Mixed feelings about this place. Appetizers, along with one of the desserts, tasted kickass but my main dish, was not so great. Appetizers: CORN RISOTTO IS A MUST! We ordered two bowls of that yummy, magical stuff. Of course, it has a bit of truffle. :) Their grilled octopus and pancake was pretty yummy, but they were really skimpy about the octopus. You get just ONE leg.  They don't have a green salad, which was disappointing. The beet salad was as close as we got. Main Dish:  My prime beef rib eye was terrible. It had this strange smoky taste that I didn't anticipate. Even the romano beans were yucky.  My husband's pork tenderloin and pork belly dish was way better, but unfortunately, it made us very sick the next day. (TMI I spent some time on that toilet. ) We narrowed it down to the pork because it was the only dish that we didn't share with the rest of the group and my husband and I were the only ones that got sick. Dessert:  AMAZING donuts. So good.  The raclette cheese thing was a bit of a mystery for us, especially because we had a real French guy in the group. Why is this a dessert?!?! It's salty and not sweet at all. I  mean, it's just a cheese dish dish, which is never a dessert. And, it wasn't that good. Service:Fantastic front staff and servers. Overall:Probably won't be back but the donuts and risotto were memorable. Thursday evening ~pm. Busy bar. Had a reservation but. . . + mins later still having to wait in huddle by the door. Perhaps issue with reservation process or bad lack? Annoying either way. Comfortable table, ok atmosphere (would categorize is a little on the lively/noisey side). Food sometimes good (squid pasta, risotto), sometimes fine (sea bass), and fine you're paying on the higher side given what it is. So. All sounds fine right? But. . . when you're waiting and waiting sometimes you feel like a vent, so we'd written an initial review and posted. Maybe we felt like the score was creeping up over the course of the meal and may well have updated . . . But along comes Mr Manager/Owner. Yes you probably take a bad review personally. Yes you and your staff presumably work very hard. But no, you can't come and loudly lecture paying guests in front of a bunch of other customers about how they should take down their yelp review or change their opinions. Whatever intention you thought you had by doing that, it was a condescending and embarrassing delivery, and turned a slightly positive experience into a very negative one. The food was really creative and everything was cooked perfectly but the taste just didn't blow me away. I think the flavors just need to be bolder and more aggressive. Service however was fantastic. It's hard to come by a place where you feel taken care of. This place took really good care of us. They made sure we had everything we needed and that we are happy with everything as each course came out. Our drinks were always full and napkins were folded when we come back from the restroom. They go the extra mile and even write you a card with your name on it if you are celebrating a birthday. And of course at the end of your meal, they will add a candle and write happy birthday on your ordered dessert. The menu is not extensive so it made it easy for us to choose and order. We basically just ordered two from each category. Desserts were better than the savory courses so it was a great ending to the meal. One thing they did really well was with the spacing of the tables. It's a small restaurant but it felt really spacious. They can beef up the non alcoholic drinks selection and have valet service because parking in this area really sucks.  solid stars! Came here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. I briefly mentioned that in the reservation notes and they had a cute hand written ""Happy Birthday Tim"" card put at our table and added a birthday candle to our dessert. Thank you! That was very sweet!The restaurant is very classy, clean, modern, and very nice without feeling pretentious. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. And the food is presented beautifully and everything tasted amazing. We started the meal with their very popular ""snack"", Puff potato & eggs. They're these airy potato puffs filled with runny egg yolk on a bed of cauliflower cous cous. Definitely a must get dish here. Next, we shared the Brentwood corn risotto and it was so god. I LOVE corn, so this was a great dish for me. The sweet corn was the star of the dish and it also had truffle and mushrooms  both went really well with the corn risotto. The starter dish was quite small, but it was enough for a light starter for two people. On to the main dish, I had the crispy skinned wild striped bass with shrimp dumplings, and my boyfriend ordered the prime beef ribeye. Both dishes were presented beautifully and were very flavorful. The fish had a crispy skin and was served on a really fragrant broth  it also came with two shrimp dumplings that reminded me of chinese dimsum, har gows. Every element of the dish was seasoned well and by the end of the main dish, I was stuffed! The beef ribeye dish was also very good  the beef was tender and also seasoned well. Dessert! For dessert, we decided to order two to share. I read lots of great reviews on the Peanut butter & jelly donuts dessert, so we definitely wanted to try that. In addition, we also ordered the Campfire s'mores dessert. The dessert menu is comprised of elevated versions of popular childhood snacks/sweets (such an adorable idea). The peanut butter & jelly donuts was our absolute favorite! The donuts are fluffy and lightly sweetened and the peanut butter, jelly, and chocolate was delicious for dipping. The Stones Throw staff also had a candle and a birthday message on this dessert for my boyfriend  it was a surprise for him and myself (Thanks again for making dinner so special)! The campfire s'mores had a interesting smokey taste, it actually tasted like it was roasted over a campfire! This dessert had roasted marshmallows, ice cream, and graham cracker on a bed of chocolate cake. Highly suggest this dish to all chocolate lovers and sweet tooth's out there! Overall, we had a very nice meal here. The prices are also decent, it's a great place to experience a high end meal without paying a fortune. The restaurant ambience, the staff, and the food were all excellent. Looking forward to trying the other items on the menu and brunch too! I was here for dinner with a client. Not too loud, but also not too quite where everyone could hear our conversation. Good service. Ended up coming back a week later because I was craving the squid ink pastaStarted with:Duck Liver Pate  A must orderPotato and Egg App  A must orderSquid ink pasta  THE BEST! Must order above all elseEntree:Sea Bass  It was highly breadedPork   Too much port belly for my tasteDessert:Peanut butter and jelly donuts  Very good. Would highly recommend a visit to Stones Throw. Especially for drinks and apps. We live in Davis and were in San Francisco for the evening for a concert at the Masonic.  Based on Yelp reviews we decided to give this restaurant a try and were glad that we did.  Our reservation was honored; the service was fantastic; and the food was delicious.  Though everything was good, our favorite item was the peanut butter and jelly doughnut, it was just yummy! This is the best restaurant I have been to in San Francisco for a few reasons. ) The food is phenomenal. I had the duck pate, squash ravioli, corn risotto, and smore's dessert. It was all incredible. ) Great wine, beer, and cocktail selection. ) The wait staff was the perfect balance of being attentive yet not being invasive) The Head Chef made a point to come out to our table to greet us since it was our friend's birthday. I really wanted to hate this place. I figured it was just another San Francisco, American New, menu full of pretension and douchebaggery. . . . but I was wrong. Sure the menu has things like Chicken Liver Pate and other things that I would likely never try, but we came in here last Friday with an open mind. In  people we split:Corn Risotto: AMAZING, literally so f*ckin good. Corn was perfectly sweet, not overcooked, and while the dish was comforting it was not heavy at all. Tomato Soup: This is a hard thing to make well, because it is so simple and generic. Honestly this soup was so delicious, right amounts of acidity and generally enjoyable. Ribeye: Amazing flavors, perfectly cooked. Da Disasta Burger: We ordered this thinking the above list was not going to be enough food. Unfortunately by the time the burger came we were not hungry at all but it still tasted good. The bartender was extremely nice and informative, pleasure to dine with. All in all a very positive experience. I'll be back!Only problem is they are beer & wine only but that is probably because it's nearly impossible to get a liquor liscence in the residential part of Hyde st. Came here for my bf's work party.  It was amazing.  I am currently on an elimination diet, so didn't expect to eat much, but before the meal started a waitress came around and asked if anyone had allergies.  i mentioned the diet, and they accomodated me!!  I got my own veggie/starter plate.  Followed by a diet approved similar fish entree to everyone else, as well as a pork tenderloin, similar to what everyone else got, but free of the things I am avoiding.  Not only did they do that, but a friend across the table forgot her reading glasses and couldn't see the menu, so  the owner borrowed her HIS glasses.  Later someone else spilled wine on there shirt and they brought over ""Wine Away"", which magically made the red wine disappear.  The service here is AMAZING.  And the food, is to die for. Pro: cute decor, good location on Hyde, server was nice Con: Food. It's insanely over priced, and honestly inedible. This is my second time going and I held off reviewing because I figured the first time they just had a bad night. Not the case. My + dollar entre can be described as follows: Lukewarm ""cream"" sauce poured over a plate of random twigs, brussel sprouts, and  pasta things. It was like a plate of vom. Why does this place have  stars?? I seriously do not understand. This review is long overdue. We live in the neighborhood and continue to come back as frequent guests for  reasons.  .  The food is excellent.  Worthy of its price tag. .  Tyler the bartender is the best in the city.  Seriously, if it wasn't for how accommodating and awesome he is this would just be another great date spot.  Not only does he make incredible drinks but his knowledge and kindness trump that of any restaurant bartender around.  For these reasons we never make reservations and prefer to sit at the bar so we can add a great conversation to an already fantastic meal. Stay Awesome Tyler the bartender.  Never change.  Your NeighborP. S. I really hope i remembered his name correctly.  I know it begins with a T.  He wears a goatee and an old timey hat sometimes.  That's the guy. Simply put this place is outstanding. The food was so good that if no one was watching I would have licked the plates. . . no lie. What really was even better than the food was the service. We were fortunate enough to have Danielle as our server. She was spot on for recommendations  and exceptional timing of her service. Living in the East Bay what I notice is people are willing to accept sub par customer service. I would clone her and show these restaurant owners this is how it's done. What a great combo, we can't wait to go back!! Stones Throw has a highly curated selection of quaffs and Michelin quality cuisines with an equally attentive and friendly staff  which makes sense given that the owners also run Fat Angel. If you haven't been to either, you're really missing out. How can such a low score come from a place that has such high reviews?  Positive  Host/Hostess staff very attentive and apologetic for the wait.  Salmon and Tomato soup were very good.  Everything else was sub par at best and some dishes were highly salted. Cons  tables are very close together, no full bar and the variations of non liquor based drinks did not go over too well.  Portions are generally small but the Salmon was actually generous.  Entrees were much better than the starters or desserts. I know this review is not detailed but the overall experience was just so much lower than the expectation that the rating resulted in two stars. After seeing numerous five star reviewed for Stones Throw, I made it a point to visit for our next date night. Parking wasn't to horrible on a Saturday night. We parked about  blocks away. Yes, we had to walk uphill, but I expected worse (and an uber was ready to be called just in case). We were about  min early for our reservation, but were promptly seated as soon as we arrived. We started with a lovely bottle of white wine recommended by the server, since the bottle we originally wanted was no longer available. Womp. But it was agreat recommendation. Before going to stones throw, I already knew what I was going to order based on the yelp reviews. We ordered the duck pate, potato puffs, and squid ink pasta to start. DELISH. The duck pate was incredibly rich and decadent, which paired perfect with the warm pretzel rolls. The potato puffs were little balls of fried heaven. And the squid ink pasta was a delight! Bf was thrown off by the caper taste, but still enjoyed it. I ordered the duck breast for an entree and bf ordered burger cooked medium well. Unfortunately, the burger came out more rare than medium, but he insisted that it was fine and ate the entire thing. Bf was incredibly apprehensive of being full after dining here. He's made it a point that all ""nice restaurants"" will leave him still hungry after the meal, due to their small portions and high price tags. But that burger was a good size portion that even he was stuffed! Recommended for those looking for more of a ""bang"" for their buck!I was able to snag a bite of the stuffed tator tots which I'm sure went along beautifully with the burger. The duck exceeded my expectations! I loved the sauce that came along side it For dessert, we decided on the bananas foster. Please get this!! It was a party in my mouth. And the fact that it's a frozen banana milk shake INSIDE the chocolate dessert. How cool is that?! Service was great! Super attentive and friendly. Tried this place last night and was VERY impressed. Highlights) Food was incredible) Ample space between tables. There's nothing worse than tables squeezed together, and feeling like your eating dinner with strangers at the table next to you. We had a group of  and our order was as follows. Starters we shared Squid ink pasta(/),  A MUST TRY, maybe even ! Burrata salad(/)  very good  ""Da burga""(/)  very good, and large! Melts in your mouth. Entries we tried Salmon (/)  one of the best salmon dishes we've ever had(group consensus).  Raviolis (/)  on the lighter side, but very good.  Ribeye (/)  solid ribeyeDesserts S'mores (. /)  not bad, but not comparable to the previous plates.  Peanut butter and jelly donuts (/)  donuts are the best part, but again, not on par with previous dishes. Overall experience was really good. The staff was amazing other than the blonde haired bus boy who sort of had an attitude throughout the night(maybe having a bad day, or just an unpleasant person), but the server and hostess were great and made up for it. Only bad thing I can say is the desserts weren't mind blowing, and the burger was a little undercooked(which I've read in multiple reviews), but it won't stop me from coming back, soon!! Here's my story with Stones Throw.  I already heard great things about them from fellow yelper reviews, so when I saw that they had a booth at the  San Francisco Street Food Festival, it was a perfect opportunity to try their famous Puffed Potato & Egg (bit. ly/mVorYv).  Luckily for me, they didn't have a line and after that first bite of their Puffed Potato & Egg, I was hooked and went back and ordered it again at least twice that day.  It was so good!  And with that, I knew I wanted to give their restaurant a try.  The timing for it was actually perfect since I took a huge gamble and decided to try Stones Throw as the venue for Janice C. 's birthday brunch party for a group of  folks. Before we get to the food, first off, I want to say that communication was really great with Tai Ricci and their staff to help plan for the event.  Even though I had to call them several times to change the head count, they were very patient and accommodating.  Amazing customer service!  Like what all past reviews have stated, get a reservation!!  Even though we had one, the place got packed just a short while after opening. What was great about having a big group was that aside from their oysters and burger, we basically got to try the whole brunch menu in family style form.  Not a bad deal for $ per guest (for groups of  or more it's the minimum before drinks, tax, and gratuity).

I think the experience might have been a lot different with a small group since we probably would've ended up only trying a few menu items.  So to be able to try all that food for a low nominal price was quite a deal!So in the end I'm really glad things went well.  The food was great and everyone had a great time, especially the birthday celebrant!  If you plan to have a big dinner or brunch party, I highly recommend Stones Throw!  I'm pretty sure I'll be returning for another brunch or to try them for dinner in the near future.  Gotta love that Puffed Potato & Egg! Located in the heart of San Francisco's renowned Russian Hill, this charming little hidden gem of a restaurant serves up inspiring American cuisine in a friendly, unfussy yet contemporary setting. Upon entering the restaurant, I noticed the warm lighting throughout with rustic wood details flanking the walls of the elegant yet casual dining space. I honestly felt transported to Napa Valley!Service was pleasant and our server was very knowledgable helpful with the menu/wine options. Since it was our first time, our group decided to share a variety of their tempting dishes. Puffed potato  light fluffy and absolutely dreamy.  The accommodating slaw added a crisp and refreshing balance to this delicious snackCompressed Heirloom Melons & Tombo Tuna Tataki  bright flavors from the fresh tuna with a sweet tang from the melons & a delightful zing from the garlic mint yogurt. A surprisingly pleasant salty crunch from the crispy chicharrones topped off this whimsically inspiring dish. Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta  Absolutely fantastic! The texture was pillowy soft and enticingly fragrant. Coupled with the plump shrimp, clams and chewy calamari, each bite had a remarkable mouthfeel. The spicy capers added the perfect kick to this blissful dish. A must order in my book. Grilled Octopus & OkonomyakiWarm rustic and earthy with some bright acidity imparted by the accompanying pickled condiments. Ny Steak A bit too heavy handed on the salt but acceptable nonetheless. Not my favorite dish but still cooked perfectly with a warm pink center. DuckCooked to a perfect pink with a tender texture and subtle yet inviting flavor For dessert, we enjoyed the doughnuts, which were fluffy sugar dusted puffs of sheer delight. An indulgent finish to our spectacular mealService was warm friendly and felt personable. Loved the environs and was amazed by the inspiring cuisine. It's safe to say i'd definitely pay them another visit when I'm in town!Happy Eats! Creative ExcellenceIt's about time we had a fresh approach to food preparation in SF. This new bistro is fantastic with so many original recipes to traditional fare, for example: the squid ink conchigli pasta prepared with spicey capers, clams, calamari, shrimp & greens was the best tasting spaghetti I have enjoyed in years (I'm from the north end of Boston); and it was a perfect size. Everything on the menu is really excellent, which is posted online. It is a cable car ride on Hyde to corner of Green; a must dinner in SF. Visited September  Really cute place, in a really cute part of Russian Hill. The food was mostly solid, with a lot of inventive flavors and techniques.  Some dishes seemed one note flavor wise, but I was in sort of a sweet/sour mood so it could just have been me. I also appreciated that they had such a great alcohol program. Tons of sour beers, and interesting wines I'm always a fan of that. In general, I thought it was totally reasonably priced for the service and quality of the food. i Had just about everything on the menu.  Standouts were corn risotto, pork two ways (esp. the tankatsu) and duck pate w/ soft pretzel roll ( to an order so you make sure you can have two).  Love the environment.  Cozy and casual.  Sat at table but would have gladly ate at bar.  Many wines and beers available. Lovely, lively atmosphere, super staff all complement the FABULOUS food. We came here on Saturday night for my daughter's birthday party and what an awkward crowd we were.  My daughter had phoned ahead to warn that our party of  included a gluten free eater, a vegetarian, a diabetic and someone with a severe poultry allergy and even though we were having the fixed menu, family style, they would need to be accommodated.  Well the food was fantastic, plate after plate of deliciousness kept coming to the table, and every time one of our special needs would have been compromised, they got their own special serving.  I really wish I'd taken notes, so I could describe the food in detail, but highlights for me included the puff potatoes, the corn risotto, the salmon & the pork belly tonkatsu  sublime!  I am absolutely not a pudding person, but when the s'mores and donuts came they could not be resisted. Wine list was good  interesting & well priced.  We went to K&L the next day to buy some of the wine we had here. Service was excellent, staff were very friendly on arrival and pleasant all through the evening. Groups can be difficult to accommodate in a cosy, intimate restaurant, and I repeat, our group was awkward, but Stones Throw made a stellar job of it.  Calling ahead was a great idea, they were able to give us their best with the fair warning. Highly recommend this place and will be back! Nice Crowded place with great audience. Staff was very very attentive, felt like all had a little to much speed or ADHD. Coming from Europe its bigg difference of serving guest and sometimes I starting to laugh about the staff and the super happy conversations. . . . Our meal was finished in  hour incl starters main and drinks, a little to fast and stress. Prices are a little to high for what is is, food are good but not that creative and wonderful that Yelpers say. Dinner was about  and my opinion is that to much for this neighborhood place. A three star review for Stone's Throw seems like a crime, but I really did not enjoy this establishment as much as I thought I would. Price are high expected. Food quality is good, but not great unexpected. Pros:(+) Cute environment (hipster), wonderful decor, located in a great area of SF(+) Huge beer and wine selection(+) Food presentation. Detailed; unique. Cons:( ) limited beer selection on tap ( )( ) small portions( ) good versions of average food squid ink pasta was good, but nothing to die over (although I enjoyed their conch style pasta versus traditional spaghetti like pasta). steak was cooked well, but didn't blow my mind. potato egg puffs were unique, but again, nothing to rave over. ( ) service was a little cold, but friendly. Overall:Stone's Throw feels like the hipster's version of fine dining. Next time I would probably opt for another $ restaurant, but no regrets the experience was well worth it. Let's start on a positive note. Friendly staff, earthy décor, nice ambiance. NOW, on to the food. It's wine, beer, appertifs only, if that matters to you. It DID for me. I like the option of starting out with a mean cocktail and moving on something mellow, like a pinot. The portions were ridiculously, insulting, especially for the price. We spent $ for  people. I left there hungry and disappointed. The presentation for the food was beautiful but the starters and appetizer portions were tiny, like it was meant for a toddler, while still priced at $  per item. I mean, it was comical at some points. The pretzel bread tuna tartar for instance: The pretzel was smaller than a mini cupcake. Two bites and it was GONE. I hate to go on and on about my experience and waste this Sunday morning. I basically will NOT be returning. If you like small, tiny portions, like THROW ing (pun intended) money around, then. . . . well, 'nuff said here. Really have enjoyed the ambiance of this cute dining experience. Food is good and so is the staff. It is unfortunate that the location is really out of the way and is really a better local dining experience for those who live in the neighborhood. Parking is nearly next to impossible because it's more than just a stone's throw away from off street parking. Cabbing it or alternative transportation is the best way to get there. Impeccable service!!The service alone was worth coming back to this restaurant. Although they were running a little behind for our reservation their service was impeccable! Part owner, Bob, gave us the Crispy Tomato Wafer starters on the house while we waited (just an extra /mins over a glass of wine at the bar). Plus the hostess, Tai, apologized to us multiple times, which was such a personable way to start our meal. Delicious food!!Their menu may be small but it packs a delicious punch! I ordered the Pan Seared Salmon and my girlfriend had the Prime Strip Steak, needless to say, we both finished our plates clean. The portions are just the right size so we planned on skipping dessert, however, the awesome staff gave us a mini version of the Peanut Butter & Jelly Donuts. OMG. so good!Nutshell, Every part of the dinning experience earned a  star! :) Had a really great dinner here and would recommend trying it!Puffed Potato & Eggs with Cauliflower Mousse, Chives, Crispy Chicken Skin ($)I thought the puff was a lot smaller than what it looked like in pictures, but it was still really good and a great dish to start with. Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta ($): My favorite dish of the night. Best squid ink pasta I've ever had! Not too heavy with sauce, but extremely flavorful. Only downside is that the portion was pretty small and I wanted more after I finished. Warm Pork Belly & Crispy Pig's Ears with Grilled peaches and apricot vinaigrette($): The Pork Belly was very tender and I loved the crunchy pig ears. I really enjoyed the fruit element as well, which made the dish less heavy and overwhelming. ""Da Burga"" ($):Highly recommended if you like burgers. It was cooked perfectly medium rare and I loved the ""Everything"" Baked Potato tots that came with it!Chocolate Bananas Foster ($): The presentation of this dish was unique as they pour a boiling caramel sauce on top; however, I thought it was a little too sweet and rich for me. OVERALL:The food was really good and memorable so I would definitely come back again, especially for the squid ink pasta. Parking is a real pain though and we were circling around the neighborhood for around  minutes, so be prepared if you plan on driving and you have a reservation! Loved the food, especially the Duck. Excellent service and lively atmosphere. Would definetly go back. Very interesting place with unique ingredients all over the menu. At the end of the day though, nothing blew me away to say that I would come back or to say that it's worth the money. The item I enjoyed the most was the dessert crepes. Although the main course of pork belly was tasty, something just wasn't quite right to warrant a  star rating. Again, maybe just my opinion. The squid pasta was also tasty, but not something I would make an effort to get again. I had the same feeling about everything on their menu. Service was excellent as expected. To summarize Stone's Throw, everything was good and tasty, just not amazing and lacked the right combination of flavors to make it a place where I would return consistently. Oh, and no expresso?! Come on guys. Reservations wise, it looks like a trend that despite making a reservations ahead of time, you will have to wait some time to get seated. Yes, they were very apologetic and nice for the + minute wait, but it appears to be a trend and they need to do something fundamental to fix the issue. I am not taking away any stars for it as they were so nice and even brought a little snack. **Utilize OpenTable before attempting to dine here! We had reservations at pm for a table of  and we still needed to wait about   minutes on a Tuesday night. There were many more patrons awaiting a table who arrived before us, so definitely take advantage of making rezzies ahead of time. What we ate:Potato Puffs . /  soo delicious! One of the best Scottish eggs I've had! The poached egg broke beautifully and didn't overpower the taste of the potato crust. The cauliflower puree was nicely done and really brought the dish together. My only gripe is that I couldn't find the chicken skin!Da Burga /  I've had my fair share of gourmet burgers and this is pretty top notch. Ordered the meat medium rare and that's what I received (so hard to find a restaurant that doesn't overcook the meat!). The tater tots are genius! It's infused with what tastes like sour cream, cheese, and other herbs. Not to mention, deep fried to utter perfection. Potato Pancake with Squid . /  I've never had something so delicious. All of the side dishes were designed to enhance the flavors of this starter, which again, was genius. I'm sad that i was too full to try to the banana foster, but we shall meet again Stones Throw. Came here on a first date  my first in San Francisco  and was delighted by the great staff and delicious food. Out of the snacks, I like the puffed potato and egg best which was a twist on croquettes. For the main course I enjoyed the flava bean ravioli. I thought I would miss meat in the dish, but the ravioli was filling and left just enough space for desserts. I picked s'mores to end the night and was completely surprised by the unique take on such a traditional dish. It was a lovely setting for a first date and look forward to coming again! Being a Virgo, I always organize, not only because I'm very good at it, but I want to take care of things so others won't have to. I plan parties for friends, book trips for families and worry about the little details. This year, someone did the planning for me! it was a relief to hand over the reins and actually just show up at my own birthday brunch and just BE. Tai and her incredible staff welcomed us with such warmth and attention, it felt reassuring that we made the right choice in choosing Stones Throw for this occasion. Impeccable service, wonderfully executed shareable dishes and a nice personal touch from the staff: a hand written birthday card! I love, love, LOVE getting handwritten notes. It's a dying practice in the time of social media. The FOOD. Delectable, delicious, divine! The Burratta with avocado, crepes stuffed with chocolate and bananas, the pain perdu with sweet peaches and almonds, that fried pancake! (Yes. BUTTERY goodness!) I really love duck and their duck hash with the perfectly runny eggs and cornbread was to die for. My fave was the potato puffs. Who invented these fried ballz and can I haz some more?! ;) A celebration wouldn't be complete without mango orange mimosas and Pimm's cup. What else can I say except cheers to this beautiful life! * thank you Rodney H. for organizing my party! This review is for you * This is a Don't miss spot if you are in San Francisco.  The octopus is fantastic and prepared perfectly.  We had the pan seared salmon and prime beef ribeye for our entrees and they were so good.  Fresh, farm to table style restaurant with excellent cocktail choices too.  Staff was so friendly and attentive.  Would high recommend! Came here for brunch and it was great! My only complaint and why they lost a star was that it took a while for the hostess to seat us with our reservation (but our table was ready) and a long time for someone to take our order which also ended up being the friendly hostess who sat us. We shared everything and got the strawberry jam donuts, egg omelette and Nutella crepe. The donuts were amazing! Melt in you mouth; I could've eaten several of them without the jam on the side as my meal! The omelette was just ok. It was interesting flavors to it but definitely would not order it again. The crepe was also delicious. If you like hazelnut and/or Nutella, it's a must!All their portions are very small ( donuts,  square crepes and  inch omelette) so I suggest ordering a bunch and sharing. Overall a great experience; very attentive and friendly wait staff. Our water glasses were never empty and the table was cleared almost instantly after finishing. We came at :a, by p, there was a crowd waiting at the door. Great food, great service. By the end of the meal I wanted to take our sever home with us to be my best friend forever. In fact the service was so amazing it almost distracted from our delicious meal. Luckily the food was so good that it kept up with the entire awesome staff! Best anniversary yet! Don't miss this place!Beer list is quite extensive, and the staff is super knowledgeable and happy to discuss / recommend. The squid ink pasta and the 'everything' baked tater tots are mandatory. Totally delicious and completely unpretentious. The food was beautifully crafted and plated, and the staff warm. They gladly turned several dishes vegetarian for us. On the night we went, they had over  different bottles of beer you could choose from, and the descriptions of them on the menu were a delight. Definitely a spot we'll return to. Five dishes all fantastic.  Puffed potato and egg, squid ink pasta, grilled octopus & okonomiyaki pancake, prime NY strip steak and banana foster dessert.  Want to try brunch, pork belly, soup and apple dessert next time. I have awesome people in my life that will constantly feed my hungry needs and never ever make me pay a dime. I'm blessed, I'm loved, and I'm truly thankful. Stones Throw never cease to amaze me with their simplistic menu, making it easy to order. Go heavy on the appetizer and do share to maximize your tasting experience. Here is why:) You must get the PUFFED POTATO & EGGS. I'm telling you, it is that GOOD!) Squid ink conchigile pasta to share is the way to go. ) Warm pork belly & crispy pig's ears. why not? Get in my tummy. . . ) Crispy Liberty Duck breast & rillette ""taquito"".  By now, you all should know how much I love duck meat. Do I not emphasize it enough on my profile?!?! Anyway, this dish is UH AMAZING!) Stone Fruit Clafoutis is hands down the most memorable dessert for this month. Something about the fresh fruits suspended in a thick waffle like batter that make it so delectably tasty. Love. Love. Love. ) An extensive beer list that will get you to drinking for , ,  or . . . . Beer me! Don't forget their great vino as well. Outstanding food. Attentive staff. Low key vibe. Highly recommend this place. Cheers!The simple things in life. The food was good, but service not so good. It was a sunday (labor day weekend), and our waiter was simply in a bad mood/not friendly. I think one dines out not only for the food but also  for the experience and having a good time! Expectation was high because price was high. Two star because expectation was not met. Overall food was disappointing, portion was small, service was good, drink selection was good. Did I mention price was high?Ambience of dining hall is nice; restroom is really old and filthy. Unlike most restaurants, Stone's Throw does not give you any complimentary bread. Puffed Potato & EggThe balls are interesting. The cauliflower and crispy chicken skin shavings on the plate did not enhance the dish. Chicken skin was not crispy. The shavings were cold. Squid Ink ConchiglieThe best dish of the whole evening. Each ingredients bring on a distinctive flavor and blend well with other ingredients. I wish all the dishes are like that. Pork Belly and Crispy Pig EarsPork belly reminds me of roast pork from China town, only more tender and without the crispy skin. Pig ears were deep fried until it's hard and crunchy. Crisy? Yes. Special? No. Feels rather gimmicky actually. Corn soupYou get about a tea cup size for $. Crispy Duck Breast & Rillette ""Taquito""The taquitos were cold inside, probably because they were made ahead of time and just not heated through before serving. Prime NY SteakCompetent, good quality meat. The sides were uninspiring. Fava RavioliThe ravioli was filled with grinded up fava bean, the dish was decorated with whole fava bean, with a light green sauce made of fava bean and butter. Overall rather bland. I would not cook like this at home. Why do I want to pay $ for  of these ravioli?It was so bad that we decided to skip dessert and go somewhere else. Definitely not what I had hope going to a $ restaurant. I feel that this restaurant is following some formula trying to maximize its profit with least amount of work. Cool decor. Fusion recipe. Nice presentation. Good service. Portions were small so you can order more dishes. Most dishes were made ahead in big batches and simply assembled right before serving. Food comes really fast so they can turn the table over quickly. If I am paying $ per head, I'd have enjoyed this place for a quick meal with a creative menu. But when it costs $ per head, what was delivered was surely disappointing. This place was the highlight dinner of my trip  to San Francisco. The waiting staff was friendly and very knowledgeable of everything on the menu. My girlfriend is very lactose intolerant and they were able to accommodate every course for her.  I think you could order anything in the menu and be pleased I would be happy eating the same meal for a month from this restaurant. I would give them * if I could. Incredible flavors, brilliant presentation, friendly service and a seasonal menu. Excellent beer and wine menu. Loved everything we tried here ( Potato Puffs with their creamy yolk center, duck PÂTÉ  with soft pretzel, burrata salad, pork belly and crispy pigs ears appetizer, duck breast and PBJ donuts. Will definitely visit again. This place was very hipster but I enjoyed it. . . like when one of the servers called the mustard a ""dijon jellay"". We arrived about a half hour early of our reservation and the nice gentlemen at the door still welcomed and seated us promptly. This place does small plates so we ordered a bunch of items from the starters, main, and sides menu. Very cool textures to the food, unique mix of flavors, and interesting presentation. Price point was a tad high but the service was great and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time. We had the duck mousse, puffed potatoes, seared duck, squid ink pasta, and warm pork belly. I'd say just the right amount for two people. Hosted my son's st Birthday here this weekend.  We were a part of  so food was served family style.  It gave us opportunity to try everything.  Squid pasta, duck, pork belly and the steak were my favorites.  Amazing top to bottom.  Ryan worked with us on the menu in advance and the wine selections he recommended were wonderful and reasonably priced.  The peanut butter and jelly beignets and banana foster desserts were to die for!  This is a great spot.  Staff was amazing and I would definitely come back again. Really great. We had the avocado and burrata salad as a starter, the burger and the duck for mains, and the pb&j donuts for desert. We also tried some of their wheat beers. All the food was really great. The highlight for me was the burger  one of the best I've had. The lowlight was the pb&j donuts  they were kinda disappointing in that they were essentially beignets that you dipped into the pb&j. Not really what I was hoping for. The staff was extremely friendly and chatty in a good way. Unpretentious and helpful. Overall, an enjoyable visit. Will be back for sure.

If you Uber there you get $ off the bill. Parking is a pain, but I parked on Van Ness and walked up the hill. Wasn't too bad. You just have to do a little walking. Good exercise, especially after all that food. Had a wonderful time at Stones Throw. Visited on a Tuesday night with my husband for a :pm reservation. Our table was ready and waiting when we arrived. The hostess was really friendly, as was everyone who approached our table whether it was our server, a bus boy, or another server just helping to deliver food. Everything we ate was really good but the stand out of the night for us was the pork belly & crispy pig's ears. It was sweet and savory and just an all around delicious dish. My husband had the burger which had a cool carrot slaw on it and was really good. The stand out with that dish was the fully loaded tots  they tasted like a baked potato with all the good stuff. I had the corn soup for dinner.  It was sweet and creamy with a couple of little corn coquettes, and crispy chorizo.  A great entree for me, since I was saving room for dessert. We shared the chocolate bananas foster for dessert.  Super rich and decadent but a perfect end to the evening. The food was absolutely delicious!  My friend and I went with suggestions via yelp.  The potato puffs, pate, were our favorite!  The pork belly and pig ears, minus the baby food puree were delectable!  We also got the squid ink risotto, but it wasn't our favorite.  Those peanut butter and jelly doughnuts though. . . swoon. I was so disappointed when Stones Throw did not blow my mind . . was extremely excited to try it. The presentation of the potato puffs was original and pretty. Great photo moment but the taste? Nothing to rave on about. Really saddens me when a restaurant everyone is taking about does not live up to the hype. We did have a lovely bottle of pinot so maybe I would go back for that, and give other entrees a try! I've dined at Stone's Throw just once while visiting the San Francisco area, and I am looking forward to a return visit.  The food, service, and ambiance were all fabulous!The Duck Pate and Mousse was delicious.  Pate is traditionally a rather pretentious appetizer, and I loved how the warm soft pretzel rolls added a bit of casualness to the dish (which certainly adds a layer of appeal to the less adventurous palate. )I also tried the Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta.  This was my first time trying squid ink pasta, and I always imagined it would taste bitter.  On the contrary, the flavor of the squid ink itself was very delicate, barely noticeable.  The pasta was cooked al dente, and the rich sauce was a wonderful compliment.  The salmon was phenomenal.  Doneness, thickness, temperature, accompaniments, and sauce were all spot on.  I'm going to say the BEST salmon I've ever eaten. *The Fava Ravioli is bursting with bright green flavors.  Unique to other raviolis I've tried, I really appreciated the lightness of this dish. Be sure to ask for a side of Everything Baked Potato Tots.  I originally had little interest in trying these, but after the first bite, I knew I wanted to cram the rest into my pocket and hoard them for myself like Napoleon Dynamite. The portion size is set to ""satisfy"" as opposed to ""burst at the seams,"" so keep that in mind in planning your meal. Enjoy!*Unless you're reading this and you're my dad.  If that's the case, your salmon is way better dad! Just had the most AMAZING meal at Stone's Throw! Highlights of the meal were the duck liver pate, squid ink conchiglie, salmon with chanterelle mushrooms & creamsicle panna cotta! Service was top notch! Chef Jason Halverson & Ryan Cole's team is on top of their game. Thanks for a wonderful evening! Amazing food, drinks and service! Have the potato egg puff small bites to start, the avocado/ procuitto/tomato salad and the bananas foster brownie dessert. Eric was an awesome server and one of the owners, Ryan, was so welcoming. We'll return when in S. F again! We came here last night for one of their ""Eat like a Chef, Drink like a Sommelier"" dinners. They host them once a month in collaboration with another restaurant, and all of the proceeds go to the Marin Food Bank. . how cool!We opted out of the wine pairings and got to try their large selection of beer and wines. The tasting menu was absolutely delicious!  Each dish had very unique flavors and left us wanting more. I typically skip on desserts but I polish my plate of delicate treats! The service here is excellent everyone super friendly and attentive. No wonder people rave about this place! NOT WORTH THE PRICE. This place is trying way too hard (even the logo) and fails on pretty much all accounts  except for the beer menu, and the duck, both of which are pretty great. I spent $ on a meal with my wife that was just ""ok"". Atmosphere feels like a Polk Street retread. The service was so so. Everything that we tried on the menu lacked flavor  and for the price, you gotta deliver. Dishes sound creative, but when you eat them, they lack any sort of cohesion or discernable approach. Lots of pouring sauces on things and talking about the dish via the waitstaff  and it doesn't deliver. The best thing we had was the duck, which was extraordinary and rich. The Octopus was handled well, but then coated with this insanely intrusive BBQ sauce on top of a flavorless pancake that didn't fit at all. You're better off eating BBQ chicken and latkes. Fava Pasta was so subtle, it didn't exist. Needed salt. Puffed Potato and eggs  also relatively flavorless. Duck Pate and Mousse was pretty great  a few flakes of salt could have taken this to a whole new place. Dessert  Bananas Foster was just really rich. The PB&J Donuts were pretty disgusting and flavorless. Don't be fooled by the menu  it sounds great and doesn't deliver.  Come here for an ok, overpriced meal. If you've ever had experience with balls, then you know the best ones are ""puffed"", because that's when they're swollen with tasty runny yolk. Add some stick to the balls with crispy tomato cream wafers and you've got yourself an orally pleasurable night. You're welcum. There were some hit and misses to each dish. Grilled octopus was tender and had good flavor but the okaonomiyaki on it was terrible. Way too hard and tasted rather overcooked. It does not have the fluffiness of an okonomiyaki nor any of the familiar flavors. It really detracted from the octopus. Potato puffs were nice and fluffy. . . I loved the light crunchy texture, but it was bit too heavy for my preference. Chocolate and banana foster was way too sweet and overwhelming. I wish they didn't drench it with so much caramel as it really overpowered the dish. One of the best burgers I've ever had. Their beer selection is awesome too. Made reservations and had no problem being seated on a Sunday evening. Though, service was slow the entire evening as people started to file in. More than half the dishes we had were just ok. Perhaps this might have to do with the anticipation of  waiting for quite some time before our next dish came out and it not meeting our hungry expectations? I dunno. I would rate this .  stars for two dishes and friendly staff. This would be a place to come for a couple of dishes and variety of beer. The dishes that were either just ok or underwhelming were sweet corn soup (what about a little bit of liquid smoke for another dimension of flavor?), warm pork belly & crispy pig's ear (grilled peaches were the star, rather than the meat), pan seared salmon (lacked salt to bump the flavor), duck breast (flavors and textures seemed like they would work together but ended up being disjointed on top of the inconsistent salting or lack thereof on the duck breast), da burger ($ for a burger  you can make an awesome one at home or get an awesome, simple, tasty, no frills cheeseburger at Garaje for $ $), pb & jelly donuts (gourmet beignet, but denser than I would have liked. Needed more and/or bolder peanut butter to match jelly), stone fruit clafoutis (the bar for any stone fruit dessert is best compared to Boulevard's). The two dishes to definitely go for, however: puffed potato and egg, grilled octopus and okonomiyaki pancake. Not to be missed. Bonus: Try the chocolate bananas foster for dessert! Still as good as the day they opened. Winning awards left and right and run by only the finest. The complainers are about money, then go eat somewhere less expensive and don't complain if you can't afford it. Tip, uber it and let them know :)Make reservations. Relax and enjoy. You will be well taken care of by competent chef, staff, hosts, bar staff and soms. Impressive beer list and the food is amazing!  The owners and the staff make you feel like they truly care.  What I can't get over is how the server (Danielle) remembered my name, what I ate and the sage sour that liked (omg!)  High end stylie dining in an easy, relaxed and inviting atmosphere.  My kind of place! This place is awesome.  The hostess has an unusual name and it started with an ""M"" I think but I forgot what it was!  She was great.  Our waiter was really good looking and well built.  Good eye candy and he was great too.  The menus are cute, they remind me of the ones at Marlowe but cuter.  We had the potato puffs (we almost ordered another one), squid ink pasta, grilled octopus, pork belly and crispy pig ear and grilled peaches and the peanut butter and jelly donuts.  Everything was really tasty and delicious.  I liked the squid ink  conch style pasta instead of the usual noodles.  The service was really outstanding!  I'd definitely come back!% off the bill with Uber.  But we forgot to show them since we were so excited with our dinner =( Maybe I expected a little more or maybe I came on a bad rotation. Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad; it just wasn't blowing my mind. The service was perfect  flawless  impeccable. However, I don't go back to a restaurant for the service; I go back for the food, which is what I will grade on. For starters, I ordered the ""WARM PORK BELLY & CRISPY PIG'S EARS. "" The pork belly was delicious and soft, accompanied by pig ears that were not as crunchy as advertised and some tart and crunchy grilled peaches. For my entree, I ordered the ""PRIME NY STRIP STEAK // Warm Potato Salad, Grilled Romaine 'Caeser', Garlic Brioche, Tarrago. ""  The steak was perfectly seared and presented medium rare as requested. The steak is good, but sides felt like misfit accessories. The taste of olive oil drizzled on top was overpowering the flavour of the steak. The potato salad was confused. I was poking at the pieces of hard boiled egg and cornichon soaked in olive oil. Do I eat these? The potato was tasteless. The flavors on this dish did not complement the steak at all and was not cohesive; I was expecting something a little more rustic instead of overdone. I was in no mood for dessert. Oh my! I hope every SF foodie has the chance to come to one of their monthly charity dinners. I was here x for the charity dinners for the Marin county food bank, choosing the  course tasting menu + wine pairing. The food is great, as are the wines. The service is friendly and the atmosphere is buzzing. Both times I've gone it's been a pretty full room maybe even sold out. I can definitely understand why, what's better than a decadent meal that goes % towards a good cause?However, each time the service has been super slow. . . Which is hard to understand since we aren't ordering anything and one can assume everything is at least semi prepared ahead of time. Also, they have so many wait staff around . . . Filling water and standing around the kitchen walking in circles. . . . It would be worth their while to train the staff on hand to be efficient and help the busy servers. Overall, great experience. Likely to go back again when I see another cool chef on the menu! Just had brunch here for the first time and had to give another  star review on top of the previous one for dinner. This place just elevates food, simple as that.  Some places have bagels and lox; stone's throw has smoked salmon mousse with house made bagel chips.  Basic foods that everyone knows how to make, like eggs, find a whole new level here.  Stone's Throw is now in a heated battle with Brenda's and Plow for best brunch in SF as far as I'm concerned. Also, big shout out to Ryan & co. for the philanthropic work with the monday night dinners benefitting the SF food bank.  Best food in Russian Hill + giving back to the community in a big way =  shiny stars. I want to get the hype  i really do  but maybe breakfast just wasn't the best shot for me to give Stones Throw? We tried to go to breakfast here  weeks ago, woke up and saw they opened at am. Cool. Walked up to the restaurant around :am, and chairs were still up and the place was empty  puzzling. Came back again last weekend, excited to see the doors were open and people being served, and were seated quickly upon arrival for our reservation. We sat in the back, which to be honest, was a bit dreary/dark next to the wine cellar  the windows and light in the front room were definitely a better vibe. The menu was pretty limited as well  unless you're a morning sweets kinda person, which i'm not  there are  ""savory"" items: burrata salad, duck hash, egg with spinach and mushroom, and a burger. Well, alright  not super stoked on the selection, but I went with the eggs (seemed to be the most breakfast y and healthy alternative). Wine prices were also pretty steep (i can stomach  bucks for a glass of Champs at brunch, but ? eep!)Overall, my eggs, spinach and ""foraged"" mushrooms were just that  scrambled eggs, spinach, and mushrooms. Could have totally made this at home and saved the $ dollars on breakfast. I have no problem dropping this kind of cash on a nice meal, but for the price, the portion and taste just didn't do it for me  not to mention the limited menu. I might try Stones Throw for dinner since it's in the neighborhood, but I'll be saving my brunch money for Blackwood, where the menu, quality, portions, and bottomless mimosas always impress. Yum. This is one of those places that you go gaga over every dish because every dish is just superior in taste. You know those places that you're like, ""OMG"" after you put the first bite in your mouth? Yeah, this is one of those places. Will not disappoint. Do not listen to nay sayers. Excellent food, excellent service.

I've been here once.  It was the brunch menu which was a bummer because I was looking forward to trying dishes off the main menu. Parking is a nightmare. My thoughts:  Stone's Throw has  many five star Yelp reviews, some calling this place PHENOMENAL in caps.  We didn't get PHENOMENAL in our first visit.  We got HAS GREAT POTENTIAL. We had burgers (DA BURGER), but they didn't make me cry.  Umami (Hollywood) and The Lexington House (Los Gatos) have the burgers that put a tear in my eye. KALE SALAD and POTATO PUFFS were not memorable.  Getting stuck with the brunch menu happens to me often.  I think that if I ordered off the main menu, this review would be going in a different direction.  I get the feeling that some restaurants get too relaxed with their brunch menu, and they don't try as hard as they would normally like not full steam.  But when I read go back and read the reviews of this place, I get re convinced that we should try this place again.  But I'm torn because it's way out of our area, and the parking scavenger hunt is not something I want to experience again. If you try this place go on a day when the main menu is out.  That's my suggestion. Then write me a good, straight forward, reliable review so I can figure out if this place is worth a second try. Happy Eating! I've been to Stones Throw a few times, and this has become my go to place when I am looking for a sure thing.  The food is fantastic!  Their vegetarian option 'Toad in the Hole' is absolutely delicious (please bring it back!).  However, what is truly amazing is the friendly, unpretentious, and geniune service.  Everyone from the host, to the servers, to the chefs  takes absolute pride in making you feel welcome! Never Again!!  I live less than two blocks from Stones throw, I was there for the pre opening and I have been back twice.  To be sure.  To be absolutely sure.  Because I wanted to like this place.  I really really did. But I don't.  I have lots of feelings about them but like is not one of them.  For the neighboorhood opening, they served appetizers, only one of which would actually be on the real menu, and that was okay, they were heavy handed with the salt but still, I couldn't wait to come back for dinner.  We didn't make it back for a few months so we thought the place would be up and swinging by then. What they were was RUDE.  Starting with the host, who acted like we were insulting him because we didn't have a reservation.  Then he minced about like he was in physical pain trying to find a table on a Tuesday night.  Really?  I can see you are not full, you just ACCEPTED a reservation for  minutes from now in FRONT of me and I already said we would be happy to sit at the bar where there were plenty of seats.  What saved the night was the food.  We had some good food, not revolutionary, not overly creative, but it was good.  We really liked the pate and the puffs with chicken skin.  So we decided to come back and just see if it was a rude fluke and to determine if the food was something we would want again.  But NO!  Even MORE rude host AND bartender, who both acted like everyone in the place was more important than us.  The host gave a glass of champagne and a menu to two couples who came in after us but ignored us.  WTF?.  We ordered drinks from the bartender who promptly ignored us to make drinks to two other people who ordered after is while we watched and waited.  WTactualF?  Then we ordered the tomato cream crackers and the puffs.  Awful!  Who is making those tomato cream disasters?  The puffs were bland, no crispy chicken skin in sight which was what made them special. So food is average at best, attitudes stink and rudeness abounds.  Never Again.  How I miss Luella. . . . . . tl;dr I've been meaning to try Stone's Throw for a while and glad I tried once, but don't crave anything to go back. Compared to few similar price range places in the city, I found both food & overall experience to be lacking; IMO not worth the price. While few dishes were good (such as banana foster dessert), there were few misses for me (strawberry shortcake; puffed potato  & eggs) and the main dish (steak) was pretty standard and not memorable. That said, I think it's a fun place to try once. If I did go again, I'd be a lot more conservative and only order a few dishes and skip the main. +  star: creative and interesting dishes; seemingly fresh ingredients+  star: sweet corn soup, chocolate banana foster, pasta part (esp. its texture) of squid ink pasta+  star: service  star:  While the dishes were creative, usually only few aspects of each dish were tasty. Several dishes were noticeably salty (squid ink pasta & puffed potato end eggs) and not cohesive in flavor. The pastry part of strawberry shortcake was a definite miss for meDishes my friend and I tried: squid ink pasta  pasta had a really nice texture; but sauce wasn't memorable and overall salty puffed potato & Eggs  just tasted like potato puffs nothing special sweet corn soup  this was one of our favorite and only dish I enjoyed as a whole; the sweet corn taste had some depth that made you crave more  prime ny strip steak  not impressive in any way; pretty standard; the meat wasn't that moistDessert strawberry shortcake  disappointed; it wasn't a traditional shortcake, and instead came with neither chewey nor soft, dull mini pastry like breads; pretty generous in strawberry & Rhuburb mixture (this was slightly sweet for me and not subtle in flavor);   chocolate bananas foster  this was really tasty; generous portion; it was served with warm caramel on top and they brought out the boiling caramel and poured on top of the dessert in front of us which made the experience more memorable; brownie and the ice cream didn't stand out, but the the ingredients together were quite tasty & fun to try; caramel sauce was really good red wine & lemonadeAmbience & Service: During dinner time after /.  pm it became too loud to hold a conversation comfortably, and I had to make an effort to shout out to speak to my friend.  Service was very friendly and professional. Everything tasted great! everything! This is my kind of food, beautiful presentation, exciting new flavors, small portion to try many dishes. Okay, too small because we didn't have enough and had to double order some dishes, I can probably handle a third round too. But very few places I try, I think to myself, I am definitely coming back here, but this is the one! Excellent corn soup, duck pate with pretzel.  Avocado burrata salad was good but not as exquisite.  Service is attentive and superbly professional. I plan to go again. My experience at Stone's Throw was one I will remember for a while!  Our server and those who visited our table were each incredibly knowledgable of the incredible food and equally as patient and friendly.  The menu was ideal  concise  with plenty of variety and descriptions assuring each would be amazing.  Our table consumed each of the appetizers listed as well as several main courses and the majority of the desserts.  The highlight was probably the surprising and fresh take on apple pie!  This is a must for foodies, and great for special occasions. We had a lovely dinner here last night!  The food was great, the service was excellent, and the ambiance was pleasant. Our party of four shared all the dishes family style.  The avocado burrata salad was great, the duck pate was good, and the okonomiyake was tasty (though I wish they could have done it without the bacon in the batter).  We also enjoyed the squid ink pasta (our favorite entree!), steak, and duck.  For dessert, we got the chocolate bananas foster and PBJ donuts  both delicious. The beer and wine selection was extensive and awesome!Our waitress was great  articulate, friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating!I only wish the entrees were slightly bigger. The grilled octopus was super good, as was the deconstructed apple pie dessert. Slightly overrated. Granted we sat down with high expectations, the only memorable plate was the pork belly appetizer. Great neighborhood gem, but if you're treking here from outside of the nob hill area, I advise to either take lyft/uber/taxi/bus, otherwise parking is a real pain.  Good thing the food was well worth the pain of looking for parking!Between three people we ordered: Roasted Carrot soup with dungeness crab Salt roasted beets Duck Pate with mustard that came with a pretzel bun Puffed potato and eggs Warm pork belly and crispy's pig ear Chestnut raviolo with chanterelle mushrooms and truffle butterFavorites:Puffed potato and eggsChestnut raviolo with chanterelle mushroomsPortions aren't very big  think tapas.  Good to share between two people and would suggest ordering about three small dishes and one main dish each for a party size of . Great place to celebrate or catch up with friends. The place isn't too big, but it looks like it can at most accommodate a party size of ! I thought the food here was just ok.  The squid ink pasta was the best dish we had.  Others were the pate, ny strip steak and the burger.  Nothing here was bad by any means; I guess we over hyped the place based on the reviews we saw.  Why this place does deserve  stars, though, is because their service was impeccable.  They were attentive and even brought us a free appetizer since we waited around  extra minutes for our reserved table.  I hope this restaurant does really well. . . . . I just didn't fall in love with it like so many others. Foster the people. Signature song: youtube. com/watch?v=SDTZ…Signature dessert: Bananas Foster topped with caramel, chocolate and a served with a minature chocolate milkshake enclosed in a brownie. So good you might skip dinner. But don't because the seafood infused squid ink pasta is great and and the Five Peas In A Pod salad is a tasty combination of peas, lemon and an almond pesto. Each pairs well with a well done Pimm's cocktail with a ginger beer twist. Salmon however a $ disappointment. Portion was just average and the appealing squash, couscous and tomato marmalade complements were in short supply. It's been only two weeks and while the wood decor, conversational vibe and great service linger nicely can't figure out how we spent $/person on our meal. Salmon is one culprit. Perhaps a little overpriced for the final product. Except that priceless dessert. This is a bit overdue. We went for brunch about three weeks ago and loved it. Service was great and the space has a good look and vibe. All of us split and devoured a stack of the butter fried pancakes and then each dived into the duck confit and corn hash. The hash was heavenly. This is one of our new fave brunch spots. Stones Throw will not disappoint. It is a solid, new American restaurant in the Nob Hill/Russian Hill neighborhood. I've dined here a few times and did find that the best way to dine here is by ordering several dishes and sharing them family style. This option will cost more per person though ($ $ pp depending on how many dishes and/if alcohol's ordered). The other way is the whole table just orders one hearty dish. I went with the burger and was absolutely stuffed and walked out only paying $ for the meal for my share. While everything here is outstanding, I do think that the burger is extremely heavy, along with the fried tater tots. Still  it's really delish. I would recommend ordering it medium rare. I ordered medium and it almost seemed to miss any hint of pinkness. The other dishes are fantastic and lighter  all the seafood and protein dishes are great!The ambiance is cozy and modern. It's not as contemporary as Verbena and , nor does it have a very large bar. Still if you want to grab a glass of wine, their high top tables and small bar area are great just for that. Overall, a great place for date night, a double date night, or simply catching up with a small group of friends. They do have a back area that can seat more than a dozen people though if you do want to host a special event/celebration here! Not sure why this place is getting such great reviews. The amto was fun, the people who work there are super nice and friendly and attentive. Drinks are also great but the food, not so much. The menu actually looks interesting but the execution just isn't there. Flavorless meals and some not cooked or seasoned well at all. If you're going there for drinks, it's great but if you actually want a good meal, this place is skippable. Good place, been here twice. Not too pricey, nice staff, good food. It's kinda fancy food that's made to feel a bit more home cooking style. Great wine list and casual ambiance. Would recommend for a small gathering of folks for a nice dinner, maybe max  people at a table. . . . . . you may have guessed I am not into cutsey or fancy or expensive. . . to me $ for  people with only a few beers and glass of wine is a bit much. . . . as long as you know your going to pay on the high side. . . enjoy. . . parking impossible so bring your hiking shoes. . . read the rest of the reviews for good description of all the cute doings available. . . . I am well aware that a $ a person ain't diddily here in never never land but then I think folks who go to Saisson to get reamed to tune of $ each to eat trash of the sea need head exam. . . . or daddy should take their credit cards. . . This is one our favorite places in SF.  We have been lucky enough to dine there several times and each time it exceeded expectations.  The potato egg puffs, the squid ink pasta, and the octopus are all phenomenal.  Desserts are awesome, particularly the bananas foster and the PBJ doughnuts.  The service is impeccable without being pretentious and the staff is always warm and friendly, even during the busiest times.  There is none of the haughtiness that we have experienced at other restaurants of similar ""ranking"" and it is refreshing. Once a month on a Monday night,  Stone's Throw features a different guest chef (from one of the other highly ranked SF restaurants) cooking in concert with Jason.  All proceeds benefit the SF/Marin Food Bank  it is great to see local restaurants wanting to give back to the community. Stones Throw definitely lives up to its reputation. We had reservations for Sat night and were seated right away. Service was top notch. They recommended great food and wine. We started with the Puffed Potato and Eggs which were delicious and the restaurant gave us the Crispy Tomato Cream Wafers (which were pretty good), but our favorite was the Duck Pate & Mousse. . which was incredible. Next we ordered the Pork Belly and Crispy Pig Ears which we enjoyed as well.  I got the Duck as my main course and my boyfriend got the Steak  both were coked perfectly.  Then for dessert we had the Peanut Butter and Jelly Donuts and the Chocolate Caramel Banana Brownie desser which were out of this world.  Our paired drinks (the Spring Cup, Wine and Moscato and Beer my boyfriend ordered) were all delicious as well. We will definitely return. It was worth every penny! It was awesome. I would recommend this place to anyone. The meals were great both in taste and presentation and the service was fabulous. They were attentive, courteous, and polite. Usually cuisine that aspires to mix Asian, Latino and Italian flavors together fail miserably but not at Stones Throw.  The food is delicate, rich and creative  but it's not for people who are better suited for a hot dog eating contest. The squid ink conchiglie pasta is unlike anything in Italy but works really well with its unique blend of flavors. The grilled octopus okonomiyaki is nothing like what you'd find in Japan, but is improved and enhanced with its smoky bacon dashi and other unique condiments. The duck breast taquito is also suitably inspired:  delicious, succulent, very lean duck with a wonderful pistachio butter.  Absolutely great!We'd definitely go back again and again, but found the chocolate bananas foster a little uninspired and cloyingly over sweet. The service is absolutely outstanding. Small portions, over priced, food was a C at best. Shocked by all the great reviews, because we found the food very unremarkable. Admittedly, we were big fans & frequent diners at Luella (RIP) but we we still really looking forward to the opening and came ready for a great new restaurant. We were disappointed. First, they screwed up our order. Not a big deal if the food is still great. The food wasn't terrible, it was all just very bland, from the soup to the steak. In addition, the ambiance was kind of unwelcoming. I get the theme, but it just didn't work for me. We were seated on these really hard, uncomfortable benches that made you want to get out of there ASAP rather than linger for drinks or dessert. I'm not asking for a bed (although wait, maybe a restaurant full of beds would be nice) but we found it weirdly uncomfortable. Overall, just a disappointing dinner experience with so many better options in town. Maybe brunch is better. I will update if brunch is great. Best meal that I've had in the city in many many moons. Better than Bourbon and Steak, Flour and Water, and Cotogna (realizing these are different genres but still highly regarded).  I happened upon this place wandering around the 'hood and made a reservation. I will go no ambience for amazing food and this place had both. We started with the octopus app and the squid ink pasta with seafood. Both were delicious. My pasta on its own with the frothy sauce was incredible on its own and I know Italian (you see the other restaurants I am comparing this to?). For entrees we had the salmon (well, the hubby did and loved it and frankly I don't eat salmon so I take his word for it).  I had the beef ribeye which was incredibly tender, rich, and melt in your mouth. For dessert I had the brownies with bananas foster  yummy!!  The service was impeccable all night. Definitely going back and probably the only  star I've given out in a long a** time.

They have an awesome selection of beer and wine. I ended up drinking a champagne type of beer that was delicious. Oh and the food was also good haha I came here for my birthday dinner and it was an overall awesome experience. Food and service were  stars and the staff was really sweet and personable. They even sent out a birthday dessert for me! I am so glad that I live down the street because I will be back again, and again and again! If you're a foodie, this is on your 'must try' list. We went last night for a fundraiser for the SF food bank. % of the proceeds were donated.  For a mere $ (including tip) and a $ wine pairing, it was a menu to die for. UNbelievable quality ( Michael Mina style)  and we did not leave feeling hungry. The GM, Ryan, could not be more gracious. You will not find a nicer group of people with excellent backgrounds in this small industry. We wish them all the very best and will definitely return! Oh, and THANK YOU, Tai, for raising the dress code bar in San Francisco. We need it! First of all, make sure to make a reservation in advance!  Stones Throw certainly exceeded my expectations  each plate is truly a work of art both for the eyes and taste buds.  The names and descriptions of each dish can be confusing and sometimes misleading; our server graciously translated menu item descriptions for us.  (don't be afraid to ask your server to do the same)We ordered an array of small plates:Puffed potato and eggs  I referred to these as ""bites of heaven"", the cauliflower mouse accompanying the puffed potato balls perfectlySquid ink conchiglie pasta   The handmade ink stained gnocchi like pasta nuggets were nothing short of delightful.  The delicate pieces of clams and calamari finished this dish. Five peas in a pod   This plate is Stones Throw's version of a salad.  This dish utilizes  different types of peas in diverse preparation techniques.  I was confused by the description of brioche, and therefore expected this dish to be served as a bruschetta.  Nonetheless, I was very pleased with it.  Pork belly with grilled peaches   Stone Throw slow cooks the pork belly and I certainly tasted it!  Grilled peaches and marmalade balanced the salty pork to create a lovely sweet savory dish.  Watercress accents added just the right amount of zest. Dessert:  Savory comte crepes  This was one of the most savory desserts I've ever had; it could almost be ordered as an appetizer.  The crepe layers are very thin and smothered in creamy cheeses.  It is then sliced in very, very small portions and paired with actual slices of cheese.  (Being from Wisconsin I absolutely loved this but didn't feel as though it was ""desserty"")The broad beer and wine menu was impressive.  I found it very amusing that the drink menu was roughly  times larger than the food menu.   I made a mental note to take my beer snobs here during their next visit.  I additionally noted that the menu we experienced last night is slightly different than the current menu online.  Apparently a few dishes change with the season to keep the menu fresh.  Also, I'm very interested in the brunch menu! Four offerings are Brunch drinks are offered by the pitcher. Great ambience  very low key and relaxed. The service was excellent and everyone was very friendly. The food is outstanding  must try the puffed potato and eggs (so good we ordered two) and the crispy duck breast and duck taquito. Service is always so warm and attentive. The food is a feast for the eyes and the balance of flavors is spot on. My husband and I have been here on four separate occasions and we always leave full and impressed. I always try to enjoy their cocktails because they work without liquor. Having said that I've never tried one I didn't fully enjoy. If you have the time and budget for sweets at the end make sure to try not your grandma's apple pie. Simply amazing!! Such a good place!! All the food was unique and delicious. Got the sweet corn soup, octopus appetizer and duck main entree. . . . all so good! Also try the strawberry shortcake dessert with rhubarb! This was quite possibly the best restaurant experience I've had anywhere. EVER. The food was exquisite, and the staff polite and helpful without being obsequious. I only wish I lived in San Francisco, because I would be a VERY frequent customer. They won't seat you until all the party arrived.   Table were closed together and noise level was loud. We ordered the duck pate with warm pretzels,  it was good but I had better.   The tomatoes cream wafer with fava bean dip was very light and airy, fluffy and delicate. The sweet corn chowder with corn croquettes was rich, creamy,  and delious. My favorite of the evening was the squid ink pasta with calamari,  clams and shrimp with tender green.  Its a small plates leaving you craved for more.  Great well balance sauce and perfectly cooked pasta. The grilled octopus was tender.  I love the side condiments that comes with it. My husband loves the warm pork belly and the crispy pig ears. We ordered the burger and tots as well.  Maybe I am just not the burger kind of gal, it was good but too rich and heavy for me.  My stomach was a bit upset from it so we skipped the dessert. Though I am not thrill about the parking situation and the waiting for my party to arrive before I get seated part,  I will be back to try other dishes.   Reasonable price as well. I have a hard time recalling another occasion where I experienced such lovely service for such a large, rowdy group. I ate dinner at Stones Throw with  other people and if you've seen the place you'll realize we took up a lot of room. They tucked us into the back though and kept the food and wine constantly flowing. And, oh! The food! Was it ever amazingly delicious. We were lucky enough to get to try a plethora if items since we were eating family style in our big group. The puffed potato and egg with a cauliflower mousse, the squid ink conchiglie pasta, the tomato cream wafers, maybe most importantly the peanut butter and jelly donuts were all standouts for me. Gah! I salivate every time I think of this meal. But, even better than the food was the service. It was flawless and even though several of us lingered over last glasses of wine (we don't see each other that often and were really enjoying catching up) nary an eye was blinked. Stones Throw is definitely a fantastic dining destination for a date or a group and if you haven't been you should try it sooner rather than later.

""Deceptively large despite its tree shaded façade on Hyde Street with an up front bar, open kitchen in back, plus hip yet exceedingly well trained staff at every turn it was to a monthly changing menu that I soon found myself challenged and with nearly every dish something I'd consider ordering elsewhere hard decisions were made  a half dozen plates increased + by a gift from the kitchen without a single disappointing bite in the bunch.  Divided largely into bites, appetizers, larger plates, and sweets it was first the gift of light tomato chips and creamed broad beans that I began and moving next to things more substantial both the molten centered puffs and silky liver would prove oddly reminiscent of simpler things refined  the former harkening a ""loaded"" baked potato while the later, slathered on a warm pretzel, invoked memories of Big Mac. . . but in a good way.  Clearly leaning on concepts of ethnic comforts it was next in tender Pacific octopus grilled and set adjacent to a savory pancake served with condiments that I found my favorite savory of the evening and only slightly less impressed by rosy duck melded to seasonal vegetables by smoky nut butter it was onto desserts I progressed  that ""fat kid"" comment immediately making sense as a box at the bottom of the menu requested customer's childhood favorites.  At this point warned twice by my waiter that I had overordered it was at my insistence that a duo of desserts arrived and beginning with four pillowy beignets finding their flavor inspired by many kids' lunch the light cocoa cream proved an admirable segue to the NOLA tilted brownie sundae  the flambéed sauce poured tableside to melt a frozen cylinder into a rich pudding far more interesting than anything I experienced at Brennan's. Simply perfection. The staff is top notch, we were blown away by the entire team. They were all so incredibly sweet. The service was impeccable. The food was delicious and creative. Most of the menu were dishes I have never seen before and every single item we ordered was delightful! I % suggest you go here! If I lived in SF, I would def be a regular. We had an absolutely fabulous meal here.  I loved everything but the octopus appetizer really stood out.  They don't have a hard liqueur license but their wine and beer selection is impressive.  The wine cocktails are quite clever and really spot on. It is a bit of an irony because it is one of the oldest standing building in the area because it survived the earthquake and fires because it was a warehouse for the largest supply of whiskey on the west coast. We had dinner reservations here at : on a Thursday. We were debating if we should order  small plates and  mains but the only main that was appealing to us was Da Burga so we decided on  small plates and  main. ""How was the potato puffs?""  Delicious.  This delicate potato puff was perfectly cooked and the egg yolk had the perfect consistency.  ""How was the duck pate?""  Delicious.  I love pate and to smear and on the mini loaf of pretzel bread made it more enjoyable. ""How was the pasta?"" Delicious.  I've never had squid ink pasta before.  Honestly, I don't know if it's supposed to taste the way it sounds but it was good.  ""How was the pork belly?"" Delicious.  The pork belly was okay but the crispy pig ear was yummy. ""How was the burger?""  Delicious.  Soft brioche bun, juicy meat, melted cheese, and tasty cole slaw with a side of crispy tots.  FAB U LOUS.  They even divided it onto two plates for us!  ""How was the chocolate cake?"" Delicious.  Really rich, like really.  The caramel made it a little too sweet for me but it was good. ""How was the apple pie?""  Delicious.  This was a creative, innovative, and tasty version of the apple pie.  Very different and worth the try. From the time I sat down to the time I threw my white towel on the table, service was impeccable.  The servers were very attentive and friendly.  I love, loVe, LOVE the decor style. I'm convinced there's a name generator online somewhere that allows you to enter the last name of your first grade teacher and the name of the street where you grew up.  POW!  Your new cool restaurant name.  Stones Throw has one of those names that catches your attention with a fabulously unique name, but keeps your patronage with excellent service and really good food.  My husband loved it so much he proclaimed it his new favorite restaurant in the city.  We made reservations for an early dinner on Father's Day.  We have two young boys and didn't want to risk someone breaking into an ear piercing rendition of ""Let It Go"" in a packed to capacity restaurant.  I'm talking to you, late night couples and people who do not eat at retirement home hours like we do.  You're welcome.  The lovely woman who served us was cheerful, friendly, and seemed to genuinely liked our kids.  She was very accommodating, and even provided us with an off the menu children's selection of main dishes.  We didn't think this was a family friendly restaurant, and it turned out to be exactly that.  The boys chose the pasta, with a really delicious cheesy sauce. . . the kryptonite of all kids under the age of five.  They were thrilled and we were thankful to not have to worry about having to order an adult entree for the boys.  After all, not all kids like octopus, no matter how good it is. My husband and I had the potato puffs with egg, which were fabulous.  The corn soup came with a demonstration of ""how to make soup look really cool"" by the server, who poured it into the bowl at the table.  It was surprisingly complex, tasty, and rich.  And although I did not partake, my husband was a huge fan of the crispy duck breast with accompanying taquitos.  Everything had a familiarity to it, but was brand new in concept and execution to us.  It was thoroughly enjoyable and we came away from the table happy, full, and excited to plan our next visit.  BTW, my new restaurant name: Lawrence Falcon.  Soft open in a week. Love, love, love this restaurant! It's my new favorite  went last weekend & the service is phenomenal, and the food's even better. Our waitress made great recommendations, was so nice and the atmosphere is great. Squid ink pasta as a starter was amazing & the duck breast entree was melt in your mouth. . . and it didnt stop there, the dessert was heaven! Plus I loved being able to suggest my favorite childhood dessert for a new menu item too. Can't wait to try for brunch!!  only thing is it's only beer & wine, I'm such if they had the license their cocktails would be out of this world too! You're in for a treat for a delicious, exciting and RICH dinner. Everything is decadent and delicious. Our waiter oversold the duck mousse; it was delicious but definitely not the best I've had. I loved the French's Mustard gelee on top, however. The highlight of the meal was by far the Squid Ink Conchiglie pasta. It's so briny and flavorfoul; I could've had a big bowl of that and been happy. Service was very good, with the potential to be great. Can't wait to go back! I really don't know what to say, other than that you can't go wrong with anything on the menu, and chef Jason is amazing.  Really, it doesn't matter if I suggest ""things to try"" on the menu, because at places like this, the menu is constantly changing and my ""must order this!"" list will no longer be relevant.  That being said, everything from small plates to dessert was really delicious, and a unique take on commonly used ingredients (duck! octopus! toad in a hole lasagna!). Also, considering this is Russian Hill, the prices were not over the top for the high quality of food served.  I would totes come back!!P. S.  To further emphasize how awesome this place is, see the following from their website: ""We all know parking is a challenge. To relieve this stress, we have partnered with Uber to offer you % off your check when you arrive in style with Uber! Simply alert the host when you arrive to receive credit on your check. ""P. P. S.  Last Monday of each month they host dinners with other top bay area chefs, with all proceeds donated to the SF Marin Food Bank.  You really can't go wrong. Duck pate, octopus, five peas in a pod and the pork belly was my favorite. There were  of us so we ordered  apps and thank god we did they are extremely small. For our entree we ordered the NY steak which was cooked to perfection and the Salmon was awesome. The duck breast was also tasty. We ordered a $ bottle of Zin that needed to be air rated but after Danielle the amazing waitress took care of that for us. My glass was never empty!! Made reservations  days before and was able to get a table for . Thanks so much and I plan on coming by for Brunch. Came back here and the meal was just as good as last time.  For apps, the potato & egg and pate were both awesome.  The conchiglie and burger were spot on as well.  The only blemish was the mushroom lasagna, which was a bit too rich to my liking  but everything else was so good that this spot deserves to keep its  stars in my book. I loved my experience at Stones Throw tonight.  stars for service as well. Awesome friendly staff and so very accommodating. I changed my entree order  min after ordering and they were super flexible about making sure I got what I wanted. The squid ink conchiglie starter was so good that I re ordered it as my entree as well! Love this place, ambiance, food and service! Loved both brunch and dinner.  Everything was good! This place was amazing! Loved the atmosphere, very chill and knowledgeable waiter.  Absolutely loved the grilled octopus, amazing how it was not rubbery and had a great, meaty taste.  Loved the cocktails, too, try the one that Pimm's and something. Love the vibe, the extensive beer list, the food. The appetizers and entrees called out on Yelp live up to their billing. The dessert is the weakest link (and not even truly weak)  concept is cute, but give me a childhood fave straight up any day. Incredible food, hospitality, and decor. We had the pork belly and squid ink pasta for appetizers and these were heavenly.  For the main course we had the steak and duck and topped it off with the deconstructed bananas foster. Wow!  The hostess and our waitress were so friendly and paid an enormous attention to detail. One of our best dining experiences in this city.  We were recommended this restaurant by a friend and can now see why  we've been raving to our friends! Really awesome place.  We had some great desert wines and tried the pork belly/pork ears which were fantastic.  Loved their deserts, very creative.  Definitely going back. I organized a dinner for  that was flawlessly executed thanks to the wonderful team at Stones Throw. I found the food unique and interesting in a way I haven't had recently in the San Francisco Bay Area. Though the restaurant resides under the American New moniker it's so much more than the usual pork belly and mac and cheese with a twist. Stand out dishes:Puffed potato and eggsSquid ink conchiglie pastaDuck pate with warm soft pretzelWine was carefully selected ahead of our dinner and included some really compelling bottles that pushed the boundaries  definitely pay attention to the ""bizarrely unique"" section for ""varietals you've never heard of and flavors that'll blow your head off. "" I particularly enjoyed the Domaine Les Loges de la Folie Montlouis sur Loire Brut Nature from the Loire Valley. It's a sparkling Chenin with no added sugar and a captivating taste I could drink regularly. Dessert were incredible  I admit, I'm a sucker for sweets like chocolate bananas foster and peanut butter and jelly donuts. My group tried a very large portion of the menu and I can't say I disliked a single dish. Highly recommended! Any one giving this place  Stars is clinically insane. Duck pate, puffed potatoes, squid ink pasta, da burga. . . INSANE. Party in your mouth, %. It also looks so pretty and inventive and fun. The beer and wine selection is ginormous and the helpful/amazing staff are so happy to help you figure out what you're doing with your life (re: drinks)!If I could, I'd work there just so I could partake in the ""family dinners"" they do before service. I've gone to Stones Throw  times within the span of  weeks.  It's a great find.  My friend had taken me there for my birthday, and I couldn't get enough.  The staff is so friendly, and the food is FANTASTIC.  I'd like to call those potato puffs a ""orgasm in a ball. ""  I could eat about  orders to myself!  I mainly eat vegetarian, but when I'm in group settings I don't like to impose my eating habits upon others, so I try the seafood and meat dishes.   I usually order the mushroom lasagna all to myself!  It's not your traditional saucy lasagna.  Quite modern, actually, with thin beautifully layers of pasta and mushrooms.  M!!  You'll have to try for yourself.  I can't really specify which dishes to order, because then you'll be ordering the entire menu!  You can't go wrong with any of the dishes. Went here for the first time even though they've been open six months.    The appetizers and main courses are creative and really good.     Decor is cool, bar in front, tables in back.   All with good lighting.     Wine list is not bad and reasonably priced. Overall very tasty and a good experience.   Nice job by these owners. I wanted to like this place, but in the end I had a lot of mixed feelings. Ambiance: I really liked the ambiance, including the look of the menu. However, I think the ambiance created a different expectation for me. Even from their website, I was expecting rustic and simple. I love rustic and simple, but this was not that. Drinks: Huge wine selection. We got a couple bottles. Later on I did notice they had a small cocktail list but never did try any. Appetizers: Pork belly and pig ears were really good. Potato puffs were okay. Okonomiyaki and octopus were good. Squid ink pasta was REALLY good  my fave of the night. Entrees: I got Da Burga  pretty good, but felt like it could have been better. The tots were good. My husband got the lasagna  umm, not what we expected. . . It was a different take on lasagna, which was interesting. But the portion was TINY. Even with all the appetizers we got, the portion was so tiny that he wasn't satisfied. Dessert: We got Not your Grandma's Apple Pie. It was very loosely based in apple pie. It was a custard with a rolled wafer and some kind of frozen tart crystal over the top. Very different. Refreshing, and definitely not apple pie. It can throw you off if you were expecting apple pie. Overall: The style of the food (trendy) and the prices for the tiny portion sizes didn't match the ambiance for me. It would have been more appropriate for the ambiance to be closer to something like Hakkasan. I really was expecting something more rustic, traditional, simple with a twist or something. There were definitely some high points and things I enjoyed, but I probably won't be back. Service here is great. Came here for my friends birthday party of . Between us we sampled % of the menu. Favorites: Squid ink pasta, pig ears and pork belly, duck, and chocolate banana foster  all were so delicious! Above and beyond: The waiter got the chef to give us extra crispy pork ears since I loved it so much. The hostess noted that it was my friends birthday, and got the chef to do something special for dessert. Our dessert plate came with ""Happy Birthday"" written in chocolate and a magic relighting candle! We all couldn't stop laughing as my friend kept trying to blow it out. Everyone was on top of their duties from checking us in to filling our water cups. Things to work on: Burger was more medium rare than medium. Salmon was well done instead of medium as requested. Special notes: Parking sucked. Uber, lyft, or public transit it if you can. Great MenuBeer Selection that is beyond Impressive. A must try on the Hyde by Green. I heard it was crazy hard to get a reservation here, but we lucked out and were able to snag one that we had to get to in  minutes.  No problemo, we live a stone's throw away.  See what I did there?  The food was great, although I did think that at some point there was a little too much going on with some of the dishes.  Beers, wine, and wine cocktails only, so no delicious whisky cocktail was disappointing.  The service was ON POINT.  Our waitress was a bit overwhelmingly excited, but she was super cute, and everyone who came to our table to deliver food was crazy knowledgeable about what they were serving us to eat.  I think the owner was even the food runner at one point, a young guy who could easily also just be a server or bartender but he had an air of confidence and pride that identified him as the proprietor of this place. I thought this would be a more upscale hipster spot with beer and cocktails as well as creative food.  But it is definitely more hipster restaurant than anything else.  That's was up these days, and this place is at the top of the pile fa sho.  Octopus was DELICIOUS, but too much comes with it so flavors can be confusing.  My BF was not very happy with his lasagna.  But the Banana Foster was SO GOOD.  I kind of wanted the beignets though, so we might have to go back soon. Food  Service  +Atmosphere   Atmosphere is cozy and minimalist.  Wine selection was excellent. Unfortunately, the food was A OK.  Pork belly appetizers were good.  Unfortunately, the duck pate and duck breast entree weren't as tasty.  The deconstructed apple pie dessert was forgettable. Believe the hype, this restaurant is pretty damn good! Go with a group so you can share family style. Puffed Potato & Egg  wow. . . just wow. A deep fried mini potato ball with a creamy egg yolk! So good we asked for seconds. Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta  flavorful! Must get this when you're here. Da Burga w baked potato tots  definitely worth getting. You can't go wrong with the tots. . think deep fried baked potato skins w bacon! Yum!Chocolate Banana Foster  if you like banana foster, you need to get this! We visited Stones Throw, expecting it to be overhyped but it was simply amazing!Of the things that we ordered, I'd am still salivating over the following because there was a surprising element to each of the following:Potato & EggPatePork BellySquid Ink Pastaand Lasagna. I'd skip the following they are good but did not exceed expectations:SalmonDuckBeignets Maybe it was because it was my th dinner out that week (a coincidentally busy week for me!) , but somehow I wasn't impressed as their food didn't hit my tastebuds in any special way.  I felt like they tried to make the food modern, deconstructed, stylish, but the flavors just were not affecting me.  We had the Japanese pancake (ok), salmon rilettes (pretty good), the duck (now this was good, flavorful, tender), vegetarian lasagna (good but something was missing), pineapple upside down cake (deconstructed, ok flavors).  Service was a ok.  I don't know, I wasn't that impressed overall. The  snacks,  starters, and  entree menu is small and simple with thought out dishes. Puffed potato eggs  This is the best dish of the night. As a lover of potatoes and all things egg, I'm amazed at how they even constructed this dish. The outside is perfectly crispy and once you bite into the potato, you get a slightly running yolk inside. Squid ink conchiglie pasta A perfectly balanced dish. There was enough flavor and salt to compliment the seafood, but not over power it. ""Da Burga""  Very solid burger with a thick patty on a toasted brioche bread that did not get soggy even to the very last bite. There wasn't any faults in the burger, but I wouldn't say it's one of the best I've ever had. ""Toad in the Hole"" Lasagna  The dish looks small, but it's very hearty and you really can't say no to runny egg. The mushrooms layered in this lasagna are very earthy and rich. The greens on the dish helped with presentation, but I didn't particular think they add much to the dish in terms of tasteChocolate Bananas Foster DELICIOUS. Not too sweet even though we got a heavy hand of the caramelized banana and walnut topping. The brownies pieces are small but incredibly decadent. My boyfriend and I were thinking about ordering two dessert dishes, but the waiter suggested sharing just one. He was right. My boyfriend and I split all the dishes above and walked away satisfied with only $ damage to our wallets. I haven't written a yelp review in years and think maybe I was waiting for something so good or so bad.  Thankfully it is the former.  The restaurant has a great bar area for waiting and the flow of the restaurant is well spaced so that all the tables are not too far or too close to one another.  Everything we had on the menu was really good and every person at our table was a happy customer.  What more could you ask for!?They have snacks, starters and then mains.  The snacks are really just snacks, but the starters are pretty well portioned and for the most part are easy to share.  The entrees were also the perfect portions. . . enough to satiate without feeling heavy. We started with the duck pate and the pretzels.  The presentation was just beautiful and it was good but not the star of the night.  We ordered three starters to share.  The Japanese pancake and the squid ink pasta.  Everyone voted the Japanese pancake their favorite of the starters, but the squid ink pasta was so yummy too.  There was something spicy in it that created the perfect surprise of heat and the broth made you just want to slurp up a big bowl of it.  The Japanese pancake had a lot going on on the dish and with the condiments and this was just the perfect case of more is more.  I mean it was finished with a bacon dashi. . . hello lover! For the entrees the five of us were all eying the same things so three of us ordered the duck and two of us ordered the salmon with the uni risotto.  Here. . . you can have the duck.  There was a generous serving of duck with crispy duck roll, rhubarb and grilled fennel.  I methodically cut a bite of the rhubarb and then the duck to create single bites as the rhubarb made the duck sing and visa versa.   Whatever sauce was used to create the culinary swish on the plate was definitely not just for decoration. . . I used each bite to pick up a little sauce in each bite as well and at the end of the dinner my plate was wiped clean except for maybe a small fennel garnish. I tried a bite of the salmon and the uni risotto and boy was that sublime.  Creamy and perfect both the salmon and risotto.  The salmon was pan seared with a slight crispy exterior and a fall apart center with a tiny sliver of coral in the center. . . I mean really. . . just perfection. The desserts we had were the comte crepes, the peanut butter and jelly doughnuts and the bananas foster.  The only thing I wasn't wild about was the crepes but the other two were the cause of us almost taking out our waiters arm for trying to take the plate away before we could lick the serving plate for the remaining sauces. Extensive beer list. . . please make sure you peruse the whole menu!I don't think there is anything here that is a miss. Food ranged from OK to Good. Portion sizes were on the smaller side. Thought it was overpriced. Not a great value. I loved everything about this place, from the starters to the cocktails, the entree, with a delicious dessert to top everything off.  The ambience is super cute and rustic, and the service was fabulous.  It was definitely one of my favorite dining experiences in SF. Having the same thing on the menu everyday is so , so by the time you dine here, the entrees and apps may have changed, but if you can find anything even remotely close to the puffed potatoes, GET IT.  The ones I got were filled with a runny yolk and the cauliflower puree was a perfect pairing to these scrumptious spuds. If I ever spot any cocktail with Pimms, I automatically stop reading the rest of the description and order the drink.  The rule applied here and it was one of the best cocktails I've ever had.  Definitely making my reservations right now so I can try the rest of the menu! This place was jumpin on a Friday night, but calling ahead helped so that we didn't have to wait too long before being seated at the window/bar.  The menu changes frequently, so my friend was a little disappointed they didn't have the ravioli she loves. She opted for the lasagna instead and was satisfied, but perhaps there are a few dishes they should consider making permanent staples. I had the duck breast, cooked perfectly and delicious (it came with a duck taquito that they should have skipped).  But honestly my favorite dishes were the tomato cream wafer appetizer (so unique) and bananas foster dessert.  Service was stellar.  I would likely be a regular if I lived in the neighborhood.  Be prepared to drop some cash, because it is pricey; the only real downside. Excellent place for appetizers and be stingy on ordering the main course.  Their appetizers and small plates are THE BEST! It has been a few months since my last dinner at Stones' Throw.  Dinner last night was amazing!  It was  of us, we are family style and shared every dish.  Everything we ordered were awesome!  Loved the potato with runny egg  it was brilliant. The pork belly dish was memorable.  The mains we ordered the steak, cooked perfectly to a medium rare.  The salmon on a bed of corn risotto was nicely done.  My favorite was the duck.  Skin was crispy and was cooked medium, which was very tender and moist. I say at the back of the restaurant overlooking the huge glass cellar room.  I like those tables at the back of the restaurant better than at the front.  Service was attentive.  I dropped my folk and the server came right away to give me new utensils.  From dropping my folk to getting new utensils was about  seconds. A great weekend brunch option. Nice vibe, good service and food. I liked the unique decor. Go on the earlier side, though, they were out of three menu options by the time we arrived late afternoon. Unbelievable, far exceeded my expectations. A pro ex Michael Mina team is serving up the most current, creative fare I've had north of California St. in years. One of the best SF restaurant meals I've had in the last month! Stone's Throw is on par with  with its beautifully plated dishes and interesting ingredient combinations. * Puffed potato with eggs, cauliflower mousse, chives, crispy chicken skin  $Think soft and fluffy croquettes with soft boiled yolk inside. Delicious!!* Grilled octopus ""okononiyaki"" with bacon dashi + pickled mushrooms, onions, turnips on the side  $The bacon dashi was poured over the octopus and ""okonomiyaki"" at the table. The ""okonomiyaki"" was more like a patty or flattened croquette than an okonomiyaki, but it was delicious nonetheless. The octopus was lightly charred and very tender. The pickles were tasty both on their own and with the okonomiyaki. Also delicious!!* ""Toad in the hole"" lasagna with mushroom duxelles, green garlic puree, asparagus, confit egg yolk  $The yolk was firmer than the yolk in the potato puffs and the right consistency to smear on top of the lasagna. Light for lasagna. The green garlic puree was sharp on its own but perfect with everything else. The side vegetables were nicely cooked. Have I overused the word ""delicious"" yet? My vocabulary is too small. * Crispy  North duck breast + taquito with roasted fennel, braised rhubarb, pistachio butter  $The meat could have been a tad juicier, but otherwise this was very good. I wasn't enamored with the tartness of the rhubarb, but I see why it worked with the duck. The pistachio butter didn't add a ton of flavor for me. I actually remember being confused as to what it was and thinking it was a bland gray mustard. (Not my finest moment. ) Overall, this was also. . . delicious!! % off with Uber receipt to restaurant. I'll be back! And hopefully that sunchoke soup I've read so much about will be back on the menu. Wow!  What an amazing find!  Found Stones Throw while searching open table for an available table and after reading the yelp reviews for this place  I was excited to try it. It was AMAZING!  Food, drinks, service were all great (minus having to wait about  min for a table despite having a reservation) however, the staff was quick to get my group's drink order to help the time pass.  They have a huge beer list!  My group was on a sour beer kick and tried most on the list.  The cherry sour beer was delicious ($ was a bit steep but worth it). Fav food of the evening  potato puffs, grilled octopus, pork belly with crispy pig ear, salmon with sea urchin risotto (AMAZING!).  Can't wait to go back!  stars for the food (we came here for brunch),  stars for the service (our waiter was extremely unfriendly) Things I tried: Puffed Potato and Egg: SO SO SO GOOD! If you're from LA and know Porto's, think potato ball, with an egg yolk on the inside. It was heavenly. The potato and crust was super flavorful and the cauliflower mousse that came with it was just amazing. I could have eaten all four =P  Da burga: Who eats burgers for brunch?? WELL I DID AND IT WAS DELICIOUS! This thing was HUGE! AND it came with the best tater tots I've ever had. Like the description said, it literally had everything. It tasted like it had cheese and chives and other magic ingredients. And the burger, that's a whole other story. The bun was crispy on the top but soft, the meat was covered in cheese, and it had this amazing cole slaw that was just AMAZING.  Asparagus & Duck Confit Hash: two of my friends got this as recommendation from our waiter and they both really enjoyed it. The egg was perfectly cooked and I tried the duck and it was so tender! Definitely worth a try seeing as it's still new and not super crowded yet. I'd still make a reservation just in case. It's definitely worth a try! Just amazing ! The service was perfect and the food delicious ! Can't wait to go back on Thursday with some new friend! I had taken other friend last time and they already went back! I am looking forward for the octopus! And this time I will try ""da Burga"" !If you are looking for a new gem for foodies you have it right there!See you soon !Sebastien Oxner We live in Russian Hill and had been wanting to try this place for awhile. Decided to take a risk and just walk in on a Friday evening. The place was packed! It was never like this when it was Luella. We give our name to the hostess and she says she'll call if a spot opens at the bar. We mosey on down to Bacchus Wine Bar to wait it out and I tell my husband there's no way we'll hear from them. Lo and behold, the hostess (I think her name was Tyler?, she was blond and nice) actually calls and tells us  spots are opening up at the bar soon. Just her calling us on a  Friday night impressed the hell out of me. Long story short  the  women we were waiting for to leave so we could eat at the bar didn't leave for over an hour! We just hung out, had a glass of wine, and pointedly looked at them occasionally. Finally, we sit at the bar  nice and roomy  no one crowding us. Ordered the squid ink pasta  amazing, fresh, interesting flavors, highly recommend. The ricotta salad  really terrific flavors, all green, yummy little bursts of flavor in every bite. The NY Steak  again, it just tasted SO good. We made sure to save room for dessert b/c I saw someone order the bananas foster and it smelled so good I ordered salad for my meal so I would have room for it. Turns out that dessert was the BEST DESSERT we've ever had. It was phenomenal. I would go back every night just for the dessert. We're happy as clams because the food was so good and the hostess and rest of staff really treated us well. Then, we get the bill. And it just gets better because they comped us  glasses of wine, a dessert, and gave us a % neighbor discount. Above and beyond what they needed to do. I can't wait to go back. They know how to treat patrons, especially locals, the food was so much better than some of the overhyped restaurants I've been to recently, and you actually felt like it was a good value. Can't wait to try brunch! Well done, Stones Throw and thanks to the wonderful hostess who really made our experience and represented the restaurant so well. I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday a few moths back.  The food was awesome!We got the Duck Pate & Mousse, Puffed Potato & Egg, Pork Belly & Crispy Pig's Ear, ""Da Burga"", the duck breast, and the apple pie.  I have to say, I LOVED the puffed potato and pork belly.  The service was great and I will definitely be back! Nice spot!  The food had great presentation, flavor and texture.  Da burga  was good and had a nice zing that came with the pickled cabbage.  The tots that came with da burga were a little to flavorful, overly bacony.  I could only eat one. . . The Egg n a hole lasagna was tasty and the presentation elegant.  One negative aspect of this restaurant is the limited menu.  I think they should add a few more dishes or at least have nightly specials.  Over all this place is definitely worth a visit. LOVE the vibe at this place along with the deliciously fresh and filling brunch food. The service is exceptional especially when dining with a small infant (we have been there twice already with our baby) as everyone working there caters to making you feel relaxed, not rushed and welcomed into their restaurant. I'm not easily impressed with most restaurants but this one has my heart as they know how to run a restaurant and keep their customers coming back for more! As for the food, the Kale salad is a favorite and the Brioche is so incredibly scrumptious! I can't wait to dine there again! This place is still pretty new, but already making food that is just a notch above great.  Duck mousse, corn soup, were super flavorful.  Ambitious and unique cocktail menu too!Curious to see what new dishes they come up with in the future. . . I've been here a number of times, because it is literally a stone's throw from my house, and each time I've been impressed. I've focused on the happy hour and brunch times, because we have a young child, but one of the best things I can say about ST is that they're so accommodating. Our neighborhood doesn't have many places you can bring a toddler, and it's nice to have an adult option that is so tasty. Our daughter has fallen in love with the crepes at brunch. My only two cons are: at my first brunch the waiter encouraged everyone ( adults) to order savory meals and then split a sweet among us; we did not take his advice and I'm really happy. It would have been a ridiculous amount of food. Also, no changing table in the bathroom, which is more than big enough. My Baby Shower brunch was held here in March. The staff were attentive and friendly; the food arrived family style at the perfect times and the drinks kept flowing. We had two vegans in our party and the chef even came out to check on us. Outstanding experience! WOW!If you haven't been to this place and you live around the neighborhood, what the heck are you waiting for?WOW!This place is phenomenal. I can see this place winning a James Beard award soon or  atleast Michelin rated. WAY BETTER than State Bird Provision BY FAR. Everything we tasted was so freakin' delicious!From the starters  pig's ears, squid ink pasta and root vegetable salad Pig ears with pork belly and squid ink pasta  both a MUST HAVE. Presentation of pigs ears is so beautiful. Flavors blended so well with the slice of the grapefruit to balance the ""fattiness"" from the pork belly. Toad in a hole lasagna tasted so yummy, better than what I expected and the presentation is gorgeous. DA BURGA is the best BURGA in SF right now. Melts in your mouth. Good choice of bread and some pickled veggies added which counterbalances in a good way the fattiness of this BURGA!Duck  perfectly cooked and very well presented. Dessert ordered ""not your mom's apple pie""  different, really what you don't expect as a typical Apple pie but not bad.  glasses of pinot noir later still flabbergasted HOW AMAZING THIS RESTAURANT is. Service was excellent! Timing of food was great. This is one of my NEW , FAV  SPOTS in the city. Come on down before it gets too popular and you have to wait  months to get in! I've had a lot of wonderful meals in San Francisco but this is one of the best in recent memory. A large group of coworkers and I took over the back area of the restaurant. We had set up a dinner with tastings of some of their greatest hits. . . and great they were! I think I liked pretty much everything I tasted, but here are some of the dishes that really stand out in my memory even a couple months later: Crispy tomato cream wafers and a fava bean dip (a light and refreshing way to start the meal) Pate and pretzel bread Puffed potato and eggs (a bit rich but definitely the overall favorite) Squid Ink Conchiglie pasta Dungeoness crab salad Seared Maine Day scallops (I think this was my favorite dish of the whole night) Crispy duck breast and thigh (duck's not easy to get right in my opinion, but boy did they get this right) Peanut butter and jelly donuts (a nice down to earth finish to a very gourmet meal)There were tons of other things we tried that were also fabulous but start with those and you'll be happy, I promise. The service and cozy, romantic ambiance with great lighting are a perfect complement to the delicious food you'll eat. Go as soon as possible!! Wow. Seriously.  I'm gonna cut to the chase & keep it simple, because there's elegance in simplicity.  And this meal was elegant from start to finish. The potato puffs.  Light & airy somehow. . . Great alternative from the traditional potato side/app.  The pate.  I love pate, so it's always on.  Rich & velvety.  Wish there were more pretzel bites though. The squid ink pasta.  Love, love, love.  Fresh, clean, & light.  Not customary adjectives used to describe pasta.  The flavors w the shrimp meshed so well.  Just delicious. The pork belly.  Everyone knows I love pork belly.  This dish, like the squid ink pasta, was knocked right out of the park.  So tender & meaty.  The sauce. . . pretty effin great.  Elements of what I thought were turmeric & curry.  It rocked. The lasagna.  OMG.  Order it.  You will love it.  Full of flavor.  The egg yolk is the icing on the cake.  Not traditional lasagna. . . better. The bananas foster.  BOOM.  Rich of course.  It's dessert.  Live a little.  You deserve it. The pb&j donuts.  Just do it.  My man remarked more than a couple of times that Stones Throw is a  star venue.  He is the toughest critic.  Nuff said. We got off to a really bad start, as we showed up on time for an pm reservation  which had definitely been confirmed earlier in the day  and had to wait almost an hour for our table. I was basically furious, hungover, and HANGRY as hell by the time we sat down to eat. But, we were visiting from out of town and had walked up a huge ass SF hill to get here, so waited we did. We were eventually gifted a salted beet salad, which was quite delicious. Dungeness crab salad was good but not amazing. For mains, we shared the squid ink pasta, which was quite memorable and definitely good for sharing due its incredible richness. I thought the bur ga was a little too much in terms of salty fatty punch. Likewise, the stuffed tater tots were a bit much for me. However, not gonna lie, I eventually finished both off for breakfast without complaint. Food was surprisingly filling and portions quite generous. Probably wouldn't go back given the poor customer service and generally obnoxious dining experience, but I'll remember the squid ink pasta and beet salad fondly. What a great replacement for Luella on Hyde St. The burger is one of the best I've had. . . very flavorful. Also excellent service, wine/beer list. Three things that struck me about Stones Throw. GENUINE Friendliness. Npt the canned or snarky version you see so often but these people were pleased to have us there, happy to answer questions and a honestly felt ""good night/ thanks for coming by"" upon our departure. IN addition one of the partners in the restaurant came by to check in on us. Flavorful and Creative Food. We stuck with just the Starters. Pork Belly was done beautifully and not the traditional crunchy but it was further enhanced with spices and avacado. Then the squid ink pasta. Wish we got a double order. BAM! I loved it. Then we had the Grilled Octopus ""Okonomiyaki"" which for both of us was the winner. Welcoming Atmosphere. Whether you post up to the bar or grab a table there is not a pretentious seat in the house. I wanted to circle back now that I've had brunch here a few times. The brunch is absolutely amazing! I'm pretty confident it is the best brunch place I've ever been to. At this point, I think I've tried just about everything on the menu. My favorites are the duck hash, lemon/huckleberry crepes, pancakes, and of course the potato/egg yolk puffs.  I'm not typically a huge duck fan bc it can be fatty, but this dish is unbelievable! The duck is crisp and packed with flavor (I'm not taste expert, but it reminds me of a variation on corned beef) which goes great with the eggs, biscuit and veggies all mixed in. The pancakes are huge and buttery  I had no idea it was possible to make such thick and fluffy pancakes!! The lemon crepes with huckleberries are a great blend of sweet and tart and so delicious! The potato puffs are also on the dinner menu (and if you look through the reviews, you'll see everyone raves about them), and for brunch they are served with bacon bits (I'm a firm believer that bacon makes everything better)!  This place is the greatest I recommend it to everyone!! Was bummed to see Luella go  but love this new place in the neighborhood. Honestly don't remember what we had  but remember the chef being very accommodating. Wanted the burger. But they were sold out. Wanted the tots. Sold out. . . but they made them some how and provided to us on the house. Whatever we did have was very good. Great service, great food. We had a lovely dinner at Stones Throw tonight. Our reservation was at : which is a great time to dine if you want to avoid the the crowd that arrives by :.  The waiter and bartender greeted us right away. We ordered a Pimms Cup (delicious) and were then taken to the lovely pine table.  The space is arranged wonderfully. They have high ceilings with rafters and lovely pine tables to dine at. They are set around the room and it appears open and not crowded which we loved. The service was especially good. Our waiter Stuart was very familiar with the menu and helpful without being all over us.  One server in particular  was a young brunette woman who also wowed us with her service and smile.  We tried a number of their dishes among four of us.  For the first course 'snack' one person enjoyed the dungeonus crab salad. While two if us feel that it tasted like onion and salt. . . Not crab.   And our most favorite was the duck pate. . . . . WOW.  Our second favorite was the potato ball stuffed with egg served over cauliflower and fried chicken skin mouse. Of the second 'starter' course. . . . Our favorite of these dishes was the roasted/grilled octopus with a pancake of vegetable served with a bacon ju and accoutrements including pickled watermelon rind.  The pork belly was fabulous, as was crab curry soup and squid ink pasta with shellfish. We liked the duck breast/leg served with Asian spice ju and black sticky rice the best. Two of us had the lamb which was a disappointment at furst. It is served with roasted veggies and a ju.  The plate looks ver dark. . . . the meat looked pretty but perhaps some yellow or orange veggies might brighten it.  The meat itself had the texture of beef. But it had zero flavor! Someone didn't taste tonight?  Anyway. . . . . we were given some  salt and pepper and additional ju, and the meat tasted better.  The veggies were so so.  The waiter offered to bring another dish but, when we added spice it was better. . . . if not great. . . Desert. . . lemon meringue won this course.  But the donuts with peanut butter and jelly were yummy too.  Great wine. Yummy pressed coffee. Our friends had dinner at Frances this week and they enjoyed this dinner a lot more:)It is a very nice restaurant and we certainly will return. Now we know the best dishes too! And. . . % off the check if u take UBeR.  There is no parking:) My goodness is all I can say. One fine Sunday night, a few friends and I decided to have a girls foodie night out and of course, this was our destination of choice. My goodness, oh my goodness. First and foremost, the service and ambiance are spectacular  our waitress was attentive without being overbearing and helpful without being demanding. The entire vibe is warm, intimate and exudes understated class. It's perfect for the romantic date night as well as the classic friends get together! Now for the food. . . it seems like small portions and a plethora of app like mini entrees constitute the evangelized SF New American scene with the additions of , Verbana, TBD, Alta CA and the like. At first, I was quite a protester of such radical change, but it has quickly grown on me and I now find myself seeking such restaurants. And Stones Throw is definitely the leader of the pack in this category!Each and every dish was creative perfection from start to finish  but our group had an unanimous consensus that the Duck Breast & Thigh swept the other dishes out of the sea! Seriously, do yourself some well deserved justice and order the duck. It's tender, juicy, fatty without being lard like and oozing with Halvorson's uniquely concocted flavor. Close contenders were: the puffed potato and eggs, duck pate and mousse and the lasagna. Keep in mind, the lasagna does not look or taste like a traditional lasagna  it's quite quirky but delicious nonetheless!The wine list is great but we opted to bring in  bottles of our own wine  the corkage fee is only $ so it's definitely worth it if you want to crack open that special vintage bottle of wine you're secretly guarding at home! Happy Eating, Yelpers! Arrived with an out of town friend for a long awaited reservation. Waiter greeted us, and offered several bottles of wine. I inquired about the wine by the glass a few times but he kept pointing to the bottle. Finally I explained my friend was not drinking and I was allowed to move forward with the single glass. You are strongly encouraged to put all of your order in at the same time. We wanted to see the portions and general feel of the food and enjoy the dinner in a slow way, so we ordered the appetizers first. He mentioned he could give us more time, and said the kitchen highly recommended that we put them all in. It was awkward and pushy enough that it was clear we wouldn't be having our whole dinner there. Honestly, I think we just rubbed him the wrong way. Two people, at his four top,  minutes late, starting out with appetizers and not a full bottle of wine? In my serving days, I would have been annoyed with us. So, I can only comment on the two apps I had. The puffed egg thing: This was pretty delicious and the texture was great. I think the base of the recipe could still be played around with, while keeping the main feature. The Pork Belly: In general, I try to avoid this fatty meat. However, this was absolutely divine and a treat. The flavors that went into it and each item contributed to the best taste in my mouth all day. I would recommend this place to any girl who has a man in her life who always orders this fatty meat. Four stars: +The pork belly+I think the waiter with % of people is gregarious and a really great person. Working with the public means every once in awhile things don't jive perfectly. +The hostess was so polite and friendly! Really impressed! Totally exceeded my expectations. I hadn't been to Russian Hill for a while, so it was nice to take a spin around the old neighborhood. I'd looked at the menu in advance, and thought it sounded pretty good, but kind of a lot like many of the New American places we already have around here. It was definitely a cut above. First of all, the service was super great. They couldn't seat us until about half an hour after our reservation, but the hostess was really gracious and apologetic about it, and gave us a free appetizer for our troubles. The servers were also really friendly and knowledgeable, and full of helpful recommendations. I asked about the cool looking pottery, and they knew all about where the plates come from (England!). The duck pate and the squid ink conchiglie pasta were probably my favorite things. Really great flavors and textures to them both. The pork belly with avocado and greens was also great. The pork belly itself was really tender and not as overwhelmingly fatty as it sometimes is. The duck breast was very good. I was not really into the lamb, sadly. It was covered in an olive tapenade that overwhelmed the lamb flavor and everything else in the dish. Not terrible, but I wouldn't order it again. The chocolate bananas foster was ridiculous and indulgent and I regret nothing. Would order again, and probably will. had whole menu. simply love all ! This Russian Hill restaurant has fantastic, fantastic food, and impeccable service. Very highly recommended. It's the best restaurant in San Francisco in my opinion. Highlights  Everything! Every bite offered an array of flavors. The service was excellent, knowledgeable and passionate about their menu. The wines made for great pairing and the beer list was impressive and vast. Easily ranks as one of our most enjoyable dinners to date. Drinks  Pinot Noir and Cabernet Starters  Duck pate and mousse, roasted root vegetable salad and squid ink pasta. Entree  Seared Maine day boat scallops, Crispy  North Duck Breast and Thigh. Dessert  Banana Foster, Sight Glass Coffee. Interesting restaurant. Left feeling like I needed more.  The food was definitely high quality, service was fine and menu was enticing.  The duck was fantastic, and would definitely recommend.  I think I need to return for another dining experience to possibly consider a higher rating. Really good, but pricey for its casual atmosphere and tiny portion sizes.  Great drinks.    Dishes felt really fresh and healthy, but not too flavorful.  Waited  a long time  for food to be served, but probably because they were preparing each dish with care. This is a solid restaurant whose chef Jason Halverson was the cuisine de chef from Michael Mina. SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA (Spicy Capers, Clams, Calamari, Tender Greens): My favorite dish of the night. perfect al dente texture to the pasta. Great mix of seafood for the perfect balance of flavors without watery sauce. Delicious!ROASTED ROOT VEGETABLE SALAD (Pear, Kabocha Squash, Cauliflower,Banyuls Vinegar)  pretty solid salad but not exceptionalGRILLED OCTOPUS (Chorizo, White Beans, Braised Radicchio): the octopus was a bit too soft for my tasteSEARED MAINE DAY BOAT SCALLOPS (Fresh Chickpea 'Salad', Spiced Orange Oil, Marinated Calamari): I didn't love the taste of the scallops, a bit too salty. It could be that I was comparing this from scallops from Hokkaido a couple of days ago, which had an amazing sweetness to it. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The wooden seats are a bit uncomfortable for a long dinner. Lighting could be better. This place is in one word AMAZING. The staff (Tai especially) are fantastic, can't say enough about the food and cocktails. Truly a great spot. Keep up the great work! all i saw was a sea of hot white dudes with hot asian brawds all with nice jackets.  I'm a mediocre looking awkward irish mexican that came with my brother wearing gap sweaters.  my butthole clinched up when i ordered a beer. when i sat down the service was lovely, but the food was godly. duck pate with a mustard type mouse with the most beautiful pretzel bread, all of which reminded me of growing up, but with such delicate and rich flavors all of which i will never forget. squid ink pasta that was nice and rich, almost reminded me of a seafood fruit de mar but more delicate and wonderful. the pork belly and crispy pig ears:  ok ok pork belly, so prosaic.  but pig ear?  f yo shit.  surprisingly light for such a dish, and a wonderful crunch along with the richness.  jesus fucked budah to make this dish, he left out muhammad because of the pork, but whatevers, he's got enough followers as it is. finished with some banana dessert that sucked dick, but whatever, we were in san francisco.  when in rome. I rarely come to the Russian hill area and was happily surprised at the cute neighborhood feel. Stones throw is a small neighborhood place, and the whole vibe goes well with the area. The space is small, and the bar area isn't too big, so definitely make a reservation!  Warning: parking can be a bit tricky around here. We were seated as soon as our whole party arrived. Wines were very reasonably priced. We started with a half bottle of a sparkling brut rose at $, then  full bottles of Pinot noir (a lighter California one to start, then a more full bodied French one for the more substantial dishes).  Each bottle was around $, which I found reasonable. Onto food: Potato puffs: a light airy potato ball with runny egg yolk inside? Why are there only  per order ? We debated getting another order as dessert  Pork belly and crisped pig ear:  the curry really made the dish. It had lots of textures and colors and is one of those dishes where you really want the perfect bite with all the components  Squid Ink pasta: I kind of wish the pasta had a bit more of a bite, and a little crunch would have been nice for this dish, but the pasta itself was a beautiful black color, and the flavors were subtle and nice   Grilled octopus: grilled nicely, not overdone, good char. White beans are fine, but the chorizo bits underneath were amazing  Scallops: seared sweet with lots of spring vegetables on the side; this was a great lighter dish   North duck breast and thigh: tender, not too gamey, mild Asian flavors with black rice and vegetables. I usually don't like duck, but this one wasn't bad Toad in the hole lasagna: basically we got this for the confit egg yolk. The lasagna itself could have used more salt and was a bit soft, but the Parmesan crisp on top made up for it. If only there were more of that crisp. . . (We debated asking for more. . . . )Desserts: you're instructed to write your own favorite treat on the menu, and if your idea is picked for try next rendition of the menu, they bring you back for free dessert ! Lemon meringue: tart, I liked the berry with it. It was smooth and light overall Apple pie: interesting version with apple granita, panna cotta, and a crisped straw on top Chocolate bananas foster: this was the best dessert by far. Milkshake in chocolate, chocolate cake, amazing warm bananas with rum sauce which helps to melt the ice cream and milk shake so that it's one gooey hot and cold dessert. This was probably one of my favorite desserts in SF Overall, it's very low key. Our server had a great sense of humor. The tables are tighter along the sides of the restaurant, but the center is nice and open for a view of the kitchen.  Prices weren't bad. Again, love the neighborhood feel. Beer and wine only. Stones Throw is everything I want a restaurant to be. . . innovative and delicious with use of unpopular parts like pig ears with surprising flavor combos, like the curry aioli beneath the pork belly with grapefruit, the artichoke and olive with the lamb. We ate: Snacks: potato egg puffAppetizer: grilled octopus, pork belly w/ pig ears, squid ink pastaEntrée: duck breast + thigh, lambDessert: banana foster and the pb+j donuts.  All were delicious, can't wait to go back. It is always nice to leave from a restaurant and feel content. Stones Throw is one of these places. The food both in presentation and quality is outstanding but what is equally impressive is the service, professional, friendly and warm. These are the qualities that will make you wanna come back to this restaurant. Keep up the good work guys. Stones Throw, great food, lovely staff and location. The Banana chocolate pudding (can't remember name) is the best I have ever tasted. Go and I am sure you won't be disappointed. They have started serving brunch and can't wait to check this out. Stones Throw has been on the to do list for awhile now even thought it's basically a couple blocks away (woohoo, no worries about parking!). Although I could only finagle a reservation for : on a Friday night, the struggle to get into the city made it actually a reasonable dinner time. . . go figure!Our group of  was promptly seated although we did spend a little time at the way overcrowded teeny tiny ""bar. "" Having done my Yelp research, we were ready to order and the waiter was helpful in helping us make sure we ordered enough food. Here's what we got in ranking of deliciousness: PUFFED POTATO & EGGS: Cauliflower Mousse, Chives, Crispy Chicken Skin ($)A must order for sure as you can see by the multiple reviews. Think mashed potatoes stuffed with a runny egg yolk, fried and service with fried chicken skin. How can you possibly go wrong?? PORK BELLY & CRISPY PIG'S EAR: Avocado, Citrus, Moresque Spice, Kale ($)Fatty pork belly topped with crunchy fried goodness contrasted with the creamy avocado. Awesome dish, every bite was amazing. SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA: Spicy Capers, Clams, Calamari, Tender Greens ($)Who doesn't love squid ink pasta? The squid ink gives it, in additional to a cool color, a more al dente firm texture that I absolutely love. Clams and calamari give it a seafoody flavor that packs a punch! GRILLED OCTOPUS: Chorizo, White Beans, Braised Radicchio ($)Perfectly grilled. Most people don't like octopus because it's chewy and rubbery when not cooked right  not the case here. This octopus was tender and the char flavor only enhanced the octopus flavor. If you don't like the octopus here, you're not going to like it anywhere. OLIVE MARINATED LEG OF LAMB: Artichoke & Cucumber Panzanella Salad, Meyer Lemon, Castelvetrano Olives ($)I had read that this was the real standout of the main courses and it was definitely good. Not too much lamby taste. Overall I was more a fan of the snacks and starters but it was nice to get a little more substantial dish to feed the bellies 'TOAD IN THE HOLE' LASAGNA: Mushroom Duxelles, Asparagus, Green Garlic, Confit Egg Yolk ($)Raw egg? Hell yeah! The name ""lasagna"" might be a little misleading because the only thing that made it lasagny was the thin pasta on top. Lots of mushroom flavor and the raw egg gave it a luxurious creamy texture. DUCK PÂTÉ & MOUSSE: French's Mustard, Cornichons, Warm Soft Pretzel ($)This was definitely good but not a super standout in my mind. The soft pretzel was an interesting way to load up on the mousse With all these dishes and a bottle of wine our final bill for the group of  was just a little over $  not too shabby for such an amazing meal! Will be back! Our new found brunch (and dinner) spot!  It's been awhile since a restaurant has captivated me with  stars, but Stones Throw is a solid  and more!   From the decors to the staff down to their amazing food, they are the perfect restaurant of what every new establishment should be. We arrived about  minutes before they open their doors on a Sunday morning.  We left the house a little bit early in fear that parking was going to be hard.  It can be, especially on Hyde St. , but thankfully Stones Throw has teamed up with Uber.  Instead of having to worry about parking, Uber it and show your receipt to your server, % will be taken off your bill.  Not only is that one great way to accommodate your customers, the hostess literally walked outside and welcomed us into the restaurant even before they were opened for service.  The staff all felt that it was too chilly to be outside so although they were still setting up some things, they wanted us to be indoors.  Totally a nice gesture on their part that will be ingrained in my head  we got to stay warm and preview the bar while looking through the menu.  If you are into beers, you will definitely appreciate their  extensive selection.  Not only was the front of the house super warm and welcoming, our server Danielle was amazing too!  Super cheerful and friendly, she's the exact person to help bring a smile to anyone's face.  She was very attentive all throughout our brunch, constantly filling our waters and checking if she could get us anything. Simplicity is the key to this successful eatery.  Their brunch menu is not too extensive, but they keep things simple by focusing on a few small bites, some savories, and a few sweets.  Thanks to the recommendations of Cherylynn N. , we started with the Puffed Potato & Egg and boy, they were insanely delicious (thanks Cherylynn!).  I'm usually not a fan of egg yolks either, but the techniques in preparing this dish made us yearning for more!  The chefs not only managed to get the yolk oozy delicious, but the outer layer on the potato had the right amount of crispiness.  We also ordered ""da burga"" with tater tots and the asparagus w/ duck confit hash which were both just a tasty.  The duck confit by itself was a bit on the saltier side, but once you mix the bite with a piece of the biscuit + the runny eggs, it was solid flavor combination in my mouth.  Da burga was cooked to perfection, we asked for it to be medium and that was def. what we received, one juicy well seasoned burger.  The tater tots accompanied with it is just as amazing!  Bacon, sour cream, and chives blended into each tater tot as if I was biting into a loaded potato. To balance out the savories, we opted for the spiced pumpkin doughnuts with pumpkin butter as our dessert.  The doughnuts were light and fluffy and resembled a lot like beignets.  I'm nowhere close to being a pumpkin fan like my husband, but even I liked it.  It's not often that he finishes his dessert either but when he does, you know it's a great dessert.  The pumpkin butter was a nice touch, he only wished there was more of it and maybe have it filled inside each doughnut.   Look no further, stop by Stones Throw for either Sunday Brunch or a nice dinner, you will not be disappointed! Good stuff. Everything was amazing! Service, food, wine, ambiance, everything! The duck pate is to die for :) And now: BRUNCH! Really, though, you need these pancakes. And if you want something savory: duck hash. But. . . pancakes. Top  pancake experiences in the world a tie for pancake champion. Because pancakes. So I love this place. So many good things to rave about this place that I'm not sure where to begin. To me food is most important so let's start there. We ordered based on recommendations of a friend. Puffed potato and egg: DELICIOUS. I wanted to just eat all of these, give up on the rest of my meal and die happy. Too bad I had to share with the bf. The waiter said he wouldn't tell anyone if I I didn't save my bf any while he went to the restroom. Funny guy! Burger with loaded tots: apparently they only make  burgers a day so if you love them, then get one. You can tell the patty is house made with quality ingredients. Loaded tots were pure fatty goodness. Creme fraiche, bacon, chives and cheddar. It was like a baked potato tater tot! Crispy Duck leg and thigh: crunchy, juicy, flavorful, literally mouth watering as I reminisce. . . I can't talk about it anymore. Just get it! Peanut butter and jelly donuts: plain and simple. Little donut balls with peanut butter and jelly swirls you dip into. Grandma apple pie: Panna cotta, maple ice, rolled wafer, apple pieces, and spices. This is not an apple pie but Apple pie inspired flavors. It was so unique, I absolutely loved it. The flavors and different temperature, different consistency all melded to a whoa what did I just put in my mouth? (in a good way) ; )Plus lots of good wines and beers to choose from! Service: was friendly, a bit slow, but expected for a crowded Friday night at . Definitely make reservations. Decor: loved the repossessed wood look, with cute little bird motifs. Comfy and cozy. I want my kitchen to look like this place! Parking: arrive at least  min early. Or park farther and get Uber to drop you off. The restaurant worked some deal with them. I found parking so I didn't get the details. All in all, I'll be back, if I can get a table. . . . Came for a very satisfactory late dinner. Note: MAKE RESERVATIONS. We made reservations at  on a Friday, and it was still packed. Notable and memorable items:. Puffed potatoes with egg  so delicious. Fried potato puff with a runny yolk inside. To die for. Plus the crispy chicken skin surrounding it added a whole 'nother depth of flavor. I could get a bunch of these and would come out happy!. Squid ink appetizer  flavorful!. Duck mousse pate with  a little smaller, but still a tasty dish. Pork belly and crispy ear  the pork belly was pretty good, but the sauce and the crispy ears were my favorite parts. MM!!To skip:. Lasagna entree  this one was okay only. nothing too specialAnyways  make sure to check this place out! Great for drinks and appetizers as well for the lighter appetite! overrated. sad to see a nice place like luella swapped out for this. nothing on menu for the healthy conscious diner. Pricey, but worth a date night. Delightful good, good atmosphere. Great people. Can't go wrong. Limited menu, but very tasty. . . :)On your next visit, arrive in an Uber and receive % off your billA+ I chose this place for a friend's birthday based on the  star reviews on Yelp.  Well this is excellent example of what my ""non Yelper"" friends would say. . . Can't believe everything you read!  stars for the renovated decor & ambiance; definitely an update to it's predecessor, Luella.  The bartender was super friendly and attentive so another  stars there. Unfortunately I thought the food was just good not spectacular.  The popular snack or starter: Puffed Potatoe and Eggs. . . was good, but didn't wow me.  Well to their defense, I'm not a fan of egg yolk.  The squid ink pasta was delicious, as well as my entree: scallops.  I think what turned me off was our unfriendly server.  She rarely smiled and was inattentive.  It was Tuesday night and the place was packed, and yes we were a table of . . . but customer service should not be taken lightly regardless of how busy the restaurant is.  It's the nature of the business, and I think every server should always have a smile on their face and be more engaging.   I always pay at least % tip regardless, but when customer service is lacking, I feel somewhat cheated, which is a huge turn off to me.  I kept reaching out to another server just to get drink or food orders. . . the other server was really nice. Phenomenal service is one of the top reasons that fall on the list of reasons to come back to a place.  SO many other fabulous restaurants in the city to return to. Not sure if this is one of them. A well deserved  stars! Stones Throw is definitely my new and favorite restaurant! :)We decided to be spontaneous and have dinner here on a random Tuesday night. We had a pretty late reservation (:PM) as all the other times were all filled up. Per the reviews, we gave ourselves enough time to find parking in the area. Man, parking was a pain! We circled for quite awhile and managed to find a spot on Lombard Street. A couple of blocks of walking was actually not too bad because the view was amazing at night. We could see Crooked Street (Lombard Street), the Bay Bridge, and the Coit Tower! :)Anyways, we sat down exactly at our reservation time. I was quite surprised that the whole restaurant was packed when we first sat down and when we left. It just shows how good Stones Throw is! We had already knew what we were gonna share/order:Puffed Potato & Eggs  Placed on top of cauliflower mousse, chives, and crispy chicken skin. This dish was pretty amazing. Inside the puffed potato leaked the yolky egg. The puffed potato was so fluffy, soft, and warm. I really liked how the breading of the puffed potato was just thin enough. It wasn't too heavy too!Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta  Came with spicy capers, clams, calamari, and tender greens. Love love love this dish! A generous amount of seafood was provided. The pasta was cooked al dente and was very flavorful. It was actually a perfect portion size because if we were given more, I think it might have been a little bit too much. Pork Belly & Crispy Pig's Ear  Loved this dish as well. The pig's ears were so crispy that it reminded me of chips. The pork belly was lean and not too fatty. This dish was also served with avocado, citrus, moresque spice, and kale. It complemented the pork belly very well as it was refreshing. Crispy  North Duck Breast & Thigh  Came with black rice, asian pear, celery, and peking spiced jus. A very generous portion of the duck breast and thigh. Unfortunately, it was a bit overcooked, but it was still good. I enjoyed the thigh part more though. I thought the black rice was a bit interesting. It kind of reminded me of risotto. I usually don't like cooked fruits (pear), however, Stones Throw cooked it very well that I actually really enjoyed the cooked asian pear!Sadly, we were stuffed from our meal and didn't get to order dessert. (Also, because we had ice cream at Swensen's before dinner. ) However, I am absolutely sure we will be back to Stones Throw again. Overall, it was a delicious and affordable meal. Service was excellent and friendly. Everything was well executed and our water cups were never empty. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant %! Just an FYI, if you do drive, make sure to give yourself plenty of time to look for parking. Otherwise, Stones Throw does offer % off your bill if you take Uber. :) Our date nights are usually enjoyed in silence: Mr. NSS on his phone reading articles (how rude right?) while I have a foodgasm. . . by my lone self or drafting a review in my head about how craptastic the food is. ""How's everything tasting?"" asked our waiter, Dave. Mr. NSS: ""This is the B E S T restaurant we've been to in a long time!""Me *thinking*: WTF he talks?!?Mr. NSS: ""Toastmasters, baby!"" he said to me. Even though Stones Throw has taken over the Luella space for four months now, I held off visiting because of the parking situation and I'm kicking myself for it (thank you to my friend, Bonnie for the encouragement. )I have to agree with Mr. NSS that Stones Throw IS the best new(er) restaurant we've been to in a while. It's even better than  and Verbana which I loved. TBD and Alta CA? Um, they don't even come close to the finesse of Stones Throw and in hindsight, I was too generous in my ratings. The former Michael Mina chef has created a fantastically creative, New American menu that's small yet focused with  small bites,  apps and  entrees. I was a little concerned about the portion sizes from the earlier pics posted on Yelp but I had to doggy bag half my entree so it seems they have beefed up their portions. Expect to spend about $ for dinner for two (including a glass of wine each, tax and tip). ~ * ~ F O O D ~ * ~*Puffed Potato & Egg w/ Cauliflower Mousse, Chives, Crispy Chicken Skin ($)   STARSbit. ly/gVqIiuThe most amazing first bite I've had, I'm still scratching my head as to how they got the yolk inside the crisp and fluffy potato and how it managed to stay deliciously oozy. So foodgasmic that this is an absolute must order. *Pork Belly & Crispy Pig Ear w/ Avocado, Citrus, Moresque Spice, Kale  ($)   STARSbit. ly/lZblpGreat textures and flavor profiles, the combo of the moist yet lean pork belly (with crispy skin), wisps of crunchy pig ears, buttery avocado, garlicky aioli, and burst of citrus worked incredibly well. Make sure to eat each component together. *""Toad in the Hole"" Lasagna w/ Mushroom Duxelles, Asparagus, Green Garlic, Confit Egg Yolk ($)  STARSbit. ly/ozvI've been trying to eat less meat and I didn't miss it with this dish. The mushroom lasagna was hearty and you can never go wrong when it's topped with yolk porn. I think a drizzle of béchamel on top would have elevated the lasagna and tied everything together. Just my two cents. *Olive Marinated Leg of Lamb w/ Artichoke & Cucumber Panzanella Salad, Meyer Lemon, Castelvetrano Olives ($)  .  STARSbit. ly/OAvwmKA stellar entrée, Mr. NSS completely wiped his plate clean. The lamb was a perfect medium rare and was very tender. I usually despise olives but it was subtle enough that it seasoned the lamb well. If you're a carniwhore, get this!*Chocolate Bananas Foster w/ Chocolate Banana Shake & Warm Brownies ($)   STARSbit. ly/PTEOHI'm not a chocolate person but Dave, our waiter sold us on this dessert with his enticing description. The picture doesn't do it justice as the brown sugar caramel soaked bananas were spooned over table side so it altered the clean presentation. The banana milkshake was INSIDE the brownie so it was like a lava cake except the milkshake was still cold. How did they do that?!?! Seriously impressive. ~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~The staff was most excellent and everything you would want in a solid neighborhood restaurant: warm, friendly, attentive, and non pretentious. Dave, our waiter made great recs and was able to get in another order of the potato puffs (yes, it was that good!) on the fly before our entrees arrived. The proactive manager, Thomas graciously took the time to check in with every single table to ensure dinner was going well. Always a nice touch. ~ * ~ A M B I A N C E / D E C O R ~ * ~The space has brightened up a lot from the former Luella space with the use of neutral colored tables and furnishings: bit. ly/iGHb. There's about seating for  with additional seating at the bar. I appreciated that the restaurant absorbed sound well so we didn't have to scream across the table. . . when we did speak to each other. Highly recommended for a date place. We had an early dinner last night and it was a full house by the time we left before  pm so definitely make reservations. ~ * ~ P A R K I N G ~ * ~Street parking is impossible after : pm   pm on weeknights and there are no nearby parking lots. Expect to spend   minutes looking for parking. And even if you find parking somewhere in Chinatown or Van Ness area, making your date hike up and down 'em hills would be mean. If you know what's good for you *ahemWINKWINKahem*, Uber it because Stones Throw offers a % off your bill. This was a recent date night, and it really delivered for that! The food was really delicious, and the wine selection was phenomenal. This is definitely on the ""places to return"" list. Although there wasn't anything specifically vegan on the menu, when the reservation was put in, inquiry was made, and we were assured that they would be able to provide for me. When we sat down, we let our server know, and he was gracious and accommodating. I often worry about being a problem customer because of dietary restrictions, but I was made to feel like I was no worry at all and they were in fact happy to provide me with something. We got the roasted root vegetable appetizer, which was really good, and full of unique vegetables. We actually struggled with placing what some of them were one was pickled radish that had been roasted! Everything was interesting and stimulating on the palate, with only the cauliflower being slightly overdone to being soft, while everything else was perfect. For dinner, I got a bountiful assortment of vegetables, some of which I could not identify (always exciting!). They were mostly sauteed, I believe, and all had great texture and flavor, and none of the natural flavors were drowned out by oil or salt the seasoning was perfectly balanced. They included a few dollops of a white bean puree, and a few dollops of their green garlic sauce. That green garlic sauce stole the show, hands down! It was in my dish, as well as on my companion's meat, and it was just SO. GOOD. I'm salivating a little disgustingly right now while I think about it. You don't even know. Go eat the sauce. Do it. Do it now. As mentioned, the wine list was great, with hilarious commentary under the different headings. It's creatively organized by genre of wine, rather than color of type, so you can browse by things like trusty wines, unusual wines, traditional wines, and so on, plus a ""bargain bin"" of super spendy wines that aren't going very quickly so have been reduced to really great prices. Our server was really helpful with steering us toward a bottle of wine that would match with both of our meals. The dessert menu looked killer, but we were far too full to get any. However, they solicit dessert suggestions, with the chance that your favorite recipe will go on the menu and you'll get to come eat it! Very fun. Overall, a beautiful, nicely laid out little neighborhood restaurant with a great personality and food and wine good enough to make it a destination from other neighborhoods. My one regret was not getting the Bordeaux I was ogling on the bargain wine list but I guess that just means I'll have to go back! This place is amazing, I just wish it were in my neighborhood! I was treated mightly to an evening where dish upon dish was brought to our two large tables, so I have no idea what a normal evening would be like here (y'know, with starter, main, dessert). Instead I had starter , starter  oh look another starter , is this my main? No it's starter , then main , main  and a third main followed by dessert, with an apres meal coma (coma of BLISS). Basically, I got to try around  dishes shared amongst a larger table, and I can safely say they were all divine. Also, when I let a waiter know I was gluten free, there wasn't even any fuss or sigh in making a few 'personal' dishes for me when the main ones being shared with the table weren't gluten free. I was very, very impressed by the staff. The crab? So sweet and delicious. The scallops? Melt in the mouth. The pork belly? MORE PLEASE. But the best dish of the evening had to be the beef which was both sweet, delicious, melt in the mouth and MORE PLEASE. It was the final dish served, at which point I was getting too full, but not too full for as much of this beef as I could have without being rude whilst sharing. If I lived in SF, I would come back here for a 'normal' meal shared with a partner or good friend, and probably struggle to choose only one thing for each course from their menu. I have been spoiled. Come here in a big group and you'll be fed like kings and queens. The staff, again, get a mention for being wonderful; and the beef. The lamb, squid ink pasta with shellfish and carrot soup were all excellent. The menu was small: only  small apps,  starters and five mains, but it was nicely balanced and I like that focus. Service was perfect. I'm a bit picky when it comes to lighting. . . I found it to be a tad too bright. Stones Throw is great!  I was happy with everything we ordered and felt comfortable in the space.  It is a definite upgrade from Luella although they should have done something with the floors in order to create a warmer atmosphere.  We will be back!  Loved the dessert beer and the extra pretzels! So, Stones Throw is probably on its way to being one of the best restaurants in  in SF.  It's THAT good.  Proof can be seen in how packed it was when my friend Brittny and I showed up on a Thursday night.  Thank God for reservations!We had a hard time figuring out where to stand while we were waiting for our table, and was invited to stand at their center table while we waited.  A little awkward, but hey, who doesn't like being front and center?  Once we got seated, our really friendly waiter came by and checked in with us.  It was then that we were informed about the items that were his favorites and what were the traditional picks.  After mulling over things, going through a session of girl talk, we ordered the following:Appetizers: Dungeness Crab Salad Pork Belly & Crispy Pig's EarMains: Toad in the Hole Lasagna Crispy  North Duck Breast & ThighSo, a few things.  I'm not a huge dungeness crab person. I'm more of a shrimp girl, so ordering this dish was a risk on my part.  Pork belly, on the other hand, is usually my go to item when I see it on a menu.  The result couldn't have been more surprising.  The crab salad really just nailed it.  That's not to say the pork belly wasn't good (loved the crispiness of that pork ear), but it paled in comparison to the crab salad. Second item to discuss, I love duck. I love duck at fancy places (La Folie) and I love duck at casual places ().  And throughout my meal, I thought to myself, ""Wow. This is really great. Especially that crispy duck skin. gimme. "" And then it happened. Brittny kindly forked over a sample of the lasagna, and I knew right away one thing had happened: Eater's Remorse. My tastebuds got suckerpunched. I immediately had wished that I had gotten this, especially since it's a seasonal item and the likelihood of me having this again is somewhat unlikely. If you're around when they have this, do me a favor and order it. Kthxbye. Finally came dessert. I had managed to sneak off and tell the restaurant that my beautiful friend had just gotten engaged. Our waiter recommended to us the banana's foster, despite my friend's craving for their peanut butter & jelly beignets.  The banana's foster came accompanied with table side serving of the super hot caramel sauce being poured over.  Amazing. And then, the beignets showed up with a nice little message that said ""Congratulations!"". Overall, I think Stone's Throw has serious potential.  If you're a beer freak, this place is for since it's beer list is long and respectable.  The food here speaks for itself, and the place really gives the neighborhood a nice cozy feel without the need to be pretentious.  I will absolutely be coming back here! Let me make this simple and to the point. . .  stars for Stones Throw!  I only share my  star experiences so congratulations Ryan Cole and team!Started with Puffed Potato and Eggs  topped with cauliflower mousse, chives and crispy chicken skin  Heavenly surprise with a creamy egg yolk inside each one.  A must have for everyone to try!  Next was the Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta with Clams and Calamari  Insanely delicious and worth the cheat during lent for no pasta:)  Nothing like it!  For the main entree. . It was tough to choose while checking out what everyone else was having and I went for the scallops!  Super fresh and seared perfectly.  Fancy dish!  As for dessert. . . Chocolate bananas foster AND I had to go for some sample bites of the pb&j donuts to really send me over the edge and it was well worth the extra calories!  Love that they have  beers by the bottle ranging from $ to $ which takes the experience to any level you're in the mood for.  Excellent wine list with a wide range to choose from. The ambiance is casual and fun with a high end menu!  I **heart you** #MichaelBauer but the stars you gave #StonesThrow need to shoot higher or I'll meet you there for Take :)  I'm ready to go again!! Loved our late dinner here, it's spacious, no elbowing actions between tables. Octopus: very tender, almost too tender for our taste. But very nice with the chorizo and beans. Pork Belly with crispy pig's ear: best thing we had that night. Loved the avocado puree with anise, such a refreshing flavor combination. Duck Breast and leg confit: the leg confit has a surprise green onion stuffed in it, which lifted the supposingly greasy meat so nicely. In all, really nice place to get inspired from. Our waiter was super enthusiastic about the food, which was a big plus. Really really great addition to the Russian Hill neighborhood!  I made a reservation for : on a Tuesday and we arrived  minutes early and were seated right away.  I'm not exaggerating when I say we had  or  different waiters/servers/bus boys throughout the course of the meal and all of them were SO friendly, made conversation, and had real opinions about the food on their menu!  So much so that my girlfriend and I went with three of the recommendations from one of our waitresses.  We ordered the: Grilled Octopus (WOW, best I've ever had. It actually tasted like tender meat with a perfect char on the outside not tough or chewy at all), the Squid Ink Pasta (THE SAUCE OMG YOU NEED TO SERVE BREAD WITH THIS SO I COULD HAVE MOPPED IT ALL UP, no shame), and the Seared Scallop dish (perfectly cooked, but not as over the top impressive as the previous two).  We sat right by the kitchen, so I kept seeing TONS of people order the little potato puff balls and the burger.  Next time I come, those are % on my list!! The wine and beer list is impressive, and I can see why it was PACKED on a random Tuesday night with some of the most fabulously dressed diners I've seen in a long time. LOVE. This was our first time at this fairly new restaurant.  The food was amazing, and the SERVICE was the BEST. The Host/Owner Tai is so nice, polite and helpful, you would think you were a guest in her home.  Other than the parking (which is not very good) I would highly recommend this to everyone.  Bob & Gloria Wow, a  star experience!  My bf made reservations for a Sat night @ pm  people the day before. It was that easy to get a reservation, probably because this restaurant is only a few months old. Upon arriving, they were pretty swamped. We got there on time, but weren't seated until maybe :pm. However, once entering, we recognized Thommas, our favorite waiter (once captain) from Michael Mina. It turns out many of the people from the Michael Mina group (Ryan, owner of Stones Throw, the ex Chef de Cuisine of Michael Mina, and our host Thommas) had jumped ships to this new American restaurant in Russian Hill. Thommas immediately gave us champagne while we were waiting for our table. Highlights:) Duck Pate & Mousse with Pretzel  closest thing to foie gras you can get in this state! So good. . . pretzel was to die for too. . . it was super fresh and soft. Not your typical Auntie Anne's! ) Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta with clams. PERFECT FOR ALL YOU SQUID INK PASTA LOVERS! The pasta was cooked perfectly, al dente, with yummy seafood touch from the clams. Can't come here without ordering. My only complaint is that I wish it were an entree, rather than a pasta. Too small for someone's meal unless you really eat like a bird. ) Fish. . . which I believe was Halibut. They Sous vide'd it, so it was cooked perfectly, very soft and pretty much a poached fish. They took this one off the menu though unfortunately, I couldn't find it! =() Lamb was ordered twice at our table. It was very good  I typically don't like lamb, but this was cooked in a way where it did not taste like lamb (the best). If you are a lamb lover, order this dish!Ambiance was young, loud, dark, fun, similar to Pesce. Food was phenomenal. However, parking was awful. My bf and I ended up hiking up the hill from Van Ness in the rain, not the best way to end your Saturday night! Do yourself a favor and allow  mins to find parking. If you get there early, treat yourself to a cocktail!Can't wait to return for a family member's birthday! I don't write reviews often, but I felt compelled to after the amazing dinner I had last week. My friend Lisa (she's also on Yelp and will include more extensive review :) and I came as part of our monthly dinners just the two of us. We're always looking on the Eater Map for the hottest new SF restaurants and Stone's Throw had been on our list for a while. Here are the three reason's why I loved Stone's Throw:. Our waiter was extremely friendly, knowledgable, and attentive. When we asked for recommendations, he asked us what we traditionally liked, and how the dishes may be different from what you'd normally expect (ie: the lasagna). . THE FOOD. We ordered the dungeness crab salad (melts in your mouth), the pork belly with crispy pigs ear, Lisa had the duck, and I had the ""toad in the hole lasagna""  entrees. I can honestly say the lasagna was one of the best entree's I have ever had. All of the unique flavors meshed together wonderfully. The absence of a traditional tomato sauce was not missed, and the ""white sauce"" was completely and utterly amazing. And it had an egg on it! An egg for crying out loud. I HIGHLY recommend the lasagna. But go quick our wonderful waiter told me it's seasonal :)We had the banana's foster for dessert again, completely superb. We also had the peanut butter & jelly donuts, which they brought out for us to celebrate my recent engagement :). The ambiance. The restaurant is wonderfully decorated and has such a great vibe. The executive chef delivered our appetizer, and everyone I spoke with who worked at Stone's Throw was enthusiastic and friendly. I even asked if they have ever done a rehearsal dinner, and they haven't, but I'm highly considering to be the first :) What a wonderful find. I used to live a block away and now I regret moving away! With its clean lines, dark stained wood, and mixed set of beautiful dishes, you get a sense of the effortless seeming incredible attention to detail that went into putting this place together. I had a great meal and look forward to coming back. RESERVATIONS: Love that you can make brunch reservations! Despite brunch being a Sunday only thing here, luckily it hasn't taken off too much, so it was easy to find a time that worked, and I even changed it a few days beforehand when they called to confirm the time. THE SERVICE: Excellent, excellent. Very friendly and chill. My good friend and I just sat and caught up for an extra hour after were were done eating and did not feel rushed at all (granted, there wasn't a wait for tables either). Our water was always filled, and the timing throughout the meal was impeccable. THE COST: So affordable! $ total per person for  app and  brunch entree. SNACKS* Puffed Potato and Eggs  .  stars(Cauliflower Mousse, Chives, Crispy Chicken Skin. $)pic: yelp. com/biz_photos/ston…cross section: yelp. com/biz_photos/ston…Wonderful. Each puff has a thin, grainy, light yet crispy breading. It was SO fresh that the server warned us to poke it with a fork first, or it might pop open (I should've listened). The filling consisted of a layer of mashed potato, which was super soft, and within that a gooey yolk filling. Delicious. SWEETS* Butter Fried Pancakes   stars(Strauss European Style Butter, Vermont Maple Syrup. $)pic: yelp. com/biz_photos/ston…These pancakes are HUGE! You get two that fill the entire plate. This was very fluffy but not dry. Simple and delicious, but I did need syrup with each bite. We didn't ordered this but actually made friends with the group at the table next to us. They couldn't finish this and let us try it. I tend to like pancakes with more toppings/fruits/filling and found this a little too simple. SAVORY* Butternut Squash & Duck Confit Hash  .  stars(Fried Eggs, Buttermilk Biscuit. $)pic: yelp. com/biz_photos/ston…A very delicious savory dish  I love the autumn hints (butternut squash, brussels sprouts). The biscuit was dense and had a perfectly moist texture while just slightly crisp on the outside. Snacks menu: yelp. com/biz_photos/ston…Sweets/Savory menu: yelp. com/biz_photos/ston… Sunday Brunch has never been better!!A group of  came and had amazing food and service. The chef prepared special dishes for strict vegans in our group, and the mimosas were delicious!  It was a wonderful experience! Can't wait to come back for dinner! Not only is the place great overall, but they were really nice to us when I started to feel sick during our short wait. Thank you for that. I'm still full from my dinner there  nights ago! For the sake of time of dining with a rather large group we ordered ahead of time so we could try a little of everything from the menu. It turns out a little of everything= a lot of food!The starters and the desserts really shined from the menu. I tried a bite of a few of the entrees, but wasn't really feeling it. As for what I'd order again next time. . . Starters: Puffed Potatoes and Eggs Duck Pate and Mousse  Squid Ink PastaDesserts: Chocolate Bananas Foster Peanut Butter & Jelly DoughnutsAnd that's just about / of the food we ate. Can you see why I'm still stuffed?They had a lovely wine list as well. It also proved to be a great spot to dine with  people (we split up among  tables in the back). There's so many great restaurants in SF that I don't return to many of them often, but this is one I'd be thrilled to go back to for some more wine, apps & dessert! Had reservations at : on a Sunday night.  We ordered the following:PUFFED POTATO & EGGS: Cauliflower Mousse, Chives, Crispy Chicken Skin  I'm not a big egg fan and was hesitant when I saw the egg oozing out, but it actually tasted yummy, not a heavy egg flavor and the crispy chicken skin made it taste even better. DUNGENESS CRAB SALAD: Artichoke Chips, Garlic Cream, Anchovy  Probably my favorite dish of the night.  Right amount of crab with crispy artichoke chips. SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA: Spicy Capers, Clams, Calamari, Tender Greens  Had a sweet taste, with al dente texture, good amount of seafood. CRISPY  NORTH DUCK BREAST & THIGH: Black Rice, Asian Pear, Celery, Peking Spiced Jus  Cooked medium rare.  A bit too rare for me.  My bf said the duck thigh tasted better than the duck breast. SEARED MAINE DAY BOAT SCALLOPS: Fresh Chickpea 'Salad', Spiced Orange Oil, Marinated Calamari  Sorta felt the scallops weren't cooked enough since it had strong seafoody taste compared to other places I've had scallops at. NOT YOUR GRANDMA'S APPLE PIE  I liked how it had different textures and temperatures all mixed into one dish.  The shaved ice on top of the custard made it a unique dessert. Overall, I think all of our appetizers and sides tasted better than our main dishes.  I'd like to come back and try some of the other dishes.  Note, parking is very difficult!  We actually had reservations a month prior to this date and were unable to find parking and as a result had to cancel our reservation. Came by for dinner this past Friday and liked the atmosphere  very lively. The restaurant itself seems pretty standard SF yuppie (not a putdown just a statement  I'm a card carrying member)  reclaimed wood tables, high ceilings, and those half silver painted clear light bulbs. The food offerings are not very vegetarian friendly and were overall hit or miss  like other reviews have mentioned, the squid ink pasta was very good (first time I've had non linguine squid ink pasta!).  On the other hand, the grilled squid was not that great  similar to Nopa, they seem to slow cook it in a pouch (I'm know what its called but that word sounds ridiculous), turning the normally chewy octopus into more of a fish cake.  No more trying grilled squid at ""Contemporary American"" restaurants. Finally, in keeping with the SF yuppie comment, prices are high (small dishes $+, mains $+, bottled beers $+) and portions are small (we expect to order ~ dishes per  people).  High prices coupled with small portions and hit or miss dishes means while it was worth checking out once, we won't likely be back. Loved this place! The service was impeccable and the food was fantastic. My favorite items: + Squid ink pasta  Deliciously flavorful but petite pasta dish with a myriad of seafood. Highly recommend. + Potato puffs with egg yolk  Wonderfully doughy and decadent. + Bananas fosters  This was sent over by the staff on the house as a surprise for being patient with the wait. What a gesture! Warm chocolate with bananas and ice cream. Perfect end to the meal. Overall, a lovely experience. :) Friendly atmosphere, delicious food. I had the Lamb roast and my friend had the vegetable lasagna. The lamb was a greek fusion delight with olives and meyer lemons. Very fresh and nicely paired with the heavy meat. My friend's vegetable lasagna was great with Ducelles mushrooms stealing the show. Would go back again. Love the experience  great food, service, and ambiance  happy they've come into my neighborhood! Party of , we had puffed potato & eggs, grilled octopus, scallops, and ""not your grandma's apple pie""  everything was great, but grilled octopus was particularly standout. Seriously, can't wait to go back. Delicious! Great cozy spot with delicious food, great wine and beer, and impeccable service. Came here on a Saturday night and had made a reservation. Unfortunately we still were left waiting for about  minutes before we were seated. hmm. . . isn't this why you make reservations?? on the positive side, the food was absolutely delicious. The appetizer with crab salad, the carrot/ginger soup, root vegetable salad all so good and with fresh ingredients. one stand out was the octopus appetizer dish, they really knocked it out of the park with excellent flavors. I believe I tried a lamb dish as an entree which was also excellent. washed it all down with a nice cabernet. Unfortunately, the food took so long to come out, and the wait was so long even after the reservation was made, that it was a bit off putting. I don't think I will be hurrying back, but I'm glad I tried it. Also the ambiance/decor is very nice, it's a good special date place for sure. The restaurant is smaller in terms of available seating. We had a : reservation but tables weren't leaving at the rate expected, so we ended up standing at the bar for  minutes. However, the host was extremely cognizant of the situation. After   minutes he brought over some complimentary sparkling wine. After  minutes, we were starving so we put in a small plate order, which was also comped. Issues like this happen in restaurants all the time, so to know that they cared and were working on a solution put us in a good mood on what could have otherwise lessened our entire meal experience. While we were waiting, I did order the Tai One On cocktail, which was reminiscent of a French , tart with just the right about of bubbly. For the small plate we ordered the puffed potato & eggs, served atop cauliflower puree, chives and crispy chicken skin. The chicken skin almost tastes like bacon, so it's no surprise this dish also appears on the brunch menu. When we got seated we order some wine after requesting recommendations from the server, who was very helpful. We ordered pretty much every small plate on the menu. My favorite after the potatoes was the salt roasted beets with burrata, lemon and crackers. I hadn't had beets served with a citrus twist before and it really complemented the sweetness of the beets. The Dungeness crab salad with artichoke chips, garlic cream and anchovies was surprisingly flavorful. The duck pate and mousse was a pleasant surprised. The pate and mousse were layer and it was server with warm pretzel balls, so the pate melted right on like butter. The starter plate we ordered (not to be confused with the ""small"" plates) was the squid ink pasta and was my favorite dish of the night. It was well balanced and even though the dish included calamari, clams and capers it wasn't overwhelmingly seafood tasting. My second favorite dish of the night was actually their burger. It comes with all the fixings and thick layer of cheddar cheese. The end result is that it basically melts in your mouth the second you bite in. If you're a burger fan, this is not one to miss. I wouldn't be surprised if it starts popping up on ""Best Burger in SF"" lists in the future (along with the totally under the radar burger from Bistro AIX). The burger comes with stuffed tater tots, which are amazing. We also ordered a ravioli main dish which looks like it's not longer featured on the menu, which is fine because it was under whelming and forgettable (I think it was pumpkin or chestnut maybe?). We didn't end up ordering any dessert as we were way too full by this point but I adore their concept behind the dessert menu. All patrons are asked to fill out a piece of paper at the end of the meal with their favorite childhood dessert. If the chef feels inspired by your suggestion, an upscale, modernized version could appear on the menu. Current desserts include chocolate bananas foster, apple pie and peanut butter and jelly donuts. Overall the meal was pretty affordable if you're following the ""sharing is caring"" philosophy. We ordered about half the menu plus several glasses of wine and didn't feel bad when we say the check. I'm adding Stone's Throw to my list of favorite neighborhood spots and can't wait to go back any see what kind of spin they take on brunch. Came here for the first time for dinner last weekend.  The restaurant has a cozy and inviting atmosphere.  The service was pleasant, but the food was great.  For such a casual unassuming place, the food was such a standout. We had the duck pate and mousse which was good, not bad, but not memorable, then the grilled octopus and the lamb as my entree, both were delicious, but man, that octopus knocked my socks off it was so good.  It was prepared in a Spanish style with white beans, and cooked perfectly. The not your grandma's apple pie was also an unexpected treat.  The cold custard and flaky pastry were really really good, and I loved the modern take on such a traditional classic.  The portions aren't very large, so I would suggest ordering a bunch of things and sharing, which is what we did. I would recommend this place for a date or to go out with a friend to catch up over a delicious meal and some strong beer (they have a good selection of beer, yum!) Overall a lovely dining experience, and will definitely be coming back! Great food!   The duck pate and the pork belly are standouts. My new favorite Russian hill eatery. We started with the puffed potato and egg bites with cauliflower cream and crispy chicken skin ( party in your mouth). Next the squid ink pasta with calamari and clams (seafood goodness). rd course was the carrot soup with Dungeness crab (perfect creamy warmth for a rainy SF winter night). We ended the savory part of the meal with the sea bass (before they took off the menu) flavored with a wasabi cream and a vegetable medley. We managed to squeeze in the PBJ donuts (sweet heaven). A classy neighborhood spot with innovative flavorful cuisine. This place is absolutely amazing, we came here for valentines day and were just blown away. They had a prefixed  course meal with an optional wine pairing for each. My fiancé went with the wine and I had a beer from Netherlands. I went with the oysters, risotto, short ribs and bananas foster, she went with the crab rolls, asparagus soup(so delicious!) ahi tuna and a bread pudding. The wine paired really well with each of her choices and our waiter explained everything in detail. Even though we spent well over $ it was totally worth the experience! Although our first two starters were amazing I have to give a  star review due to the Pan Roasted Arctic Char being so bad. I'm not sure if it was a fluke but the fish was unseasoned, extremely undercooked, had no flavor and the farro was also extremely bland. I was tempted to complain to our waitress because it was so bad but my boyfriend pleaded with me not to. In the end we still wished we would have said something to the waitress. Despite the bad dish our starters were incredible. Highly recommend the Grilled Octopus and Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta. The octopus was so tender and delicious. The service was good and the starters were amazing but that one main dish really ruined the whole meal. Hate to give it  stars but our expectations must have been too high after the great starters. This is one of those great restaurants that make you glad you live in (or near) San Francisco.  The room is really beautiful in a spare way, the food is truly inspired, and the service is very attentive.  Even in the very best restaurants, I've found the service to be less intuitive than we had at ST.  Our server always seemed to be on hand when we needed him, but in no way was he intrusive. So why not five stars you ask.  The noise.  When we first arrived, we actually had to consult one another on whether we'd be able to stand the noise level during what we'd hoped would be a quiet dinner to talk and catch up on our weeks.  I was ready to leave; my husband said we should sit down and give it a try.  I do not understand why a restaurant of that caliber feels the need to play loud rock music.  It was totally out of sync with the experience.  Someone must have asked for the music volume to be turned down, because a little while later they did lower it.  The people at the next table then were able to stop screaming, deafening us and making it impossible to have a conversation, so we could then talk. Still, being near the bar, as the evening wore on, that area got very crowded and the noise level went back up to, if not above, what it had been.  It was an easy decision to say no to dessert; our ears just couldn't take it any more. Bottom line, we may go back (to try sitting in the back room and hope it's quieter), but there are enough other fantastic restaurants in the immediate vicinity where I won't be cringing in anticipation of the noise factor; so, honestly, we'll probably take our business elsewhere. We had a fantastic dinner there ! Most creative food Chef Jason and his team have created a fun , casual restaurant where you can enjoy some if the best food in SF ! We will be back This restaurant has delish food!  I was very pleased  and our waitress was honestly the best.  She was super sweet and attentive and had great recommendations!The only  wierd thing about this place is the decoration, the tables remind me of cheap picnic tables which I found odd, but I dont go to restaurants for table quality so its really not a big deal to me at all. we came here for dinner recently based on the yelp reviews and we were pretty disappointed. . the appetizers and mains are quite small and pricey for what you getpork belly and pig ears was ok. . grilled octopus had a nice char but in no way was worth  bucksmy lamb was relatively bland and was dry (probably overcooked)my wife's duck crispy but was gone after a couple bites. . I love that this place is right in my neighborhood. Literally a stone's throw away. Get  of everything on this list ;) Dinner. Puffed potato and egg. Duck pate and mousse. Da burger (I didn't get this but I was eavesdropping on a couple that had it next to me and they said it was heaven) . Crispy North Duck . This cocktail with wine in it that was amazing but I forget the nameBrunch. Butternut squash and duck confit hashI want to go back and try everything else. Enjoy! Great atmosphere, staff, and food. The only reason I am giving this  stars vs.  stars are the prices. They are a bit high. That said, you are missing out on a great SF dining experience if you don't go to Stones Throw. What a wonderful restaurant on green & Hyde. Every dish is visually stunning. The potato puffs filled with egg yolks, the crab mousse salad, the charred octopus, and deconstructed desserts. YumThe maitre d will be legendary.  The bartending team is brilliant. The beverage list first rate, and a young Rachael Ray waitress look alike. The menu selection is not large, food is ok, unfortunately didn't meet our expectation.  We had the duck pâté (our fav dish here), squid ink pasta (had many good reviews but it didn't meet my expectation due to review), grilled lamb and da burger. . . They are good food, but not wow. Sorry. We had high expectation after reading the reviews, but it didn't quite met it.  Not your grandma's app pie was good but not wow. . . Sorry again.  There are definitely better places to dine.  Service is super though! Wow excellent service here, and really beautifully presented, delicious food.  It's hoppin' but the staff is on their game, cool and gracious. The menu layout is smart and the beers! Oy. We loved the beets and the octopus, and the duck pate made my moms eyes kind of roll back in her head.  Lamb, cod and duck entrees all tops. Easy A+. New Restaurant in the neighborhood!!  It's great,yummy food, wine cocktails were excellent.  The egg potato puffs we divine.  Also had pork belly,,deelicious.  Chestnut Ravioli, very fall and rustic.  Duck,,nice as well.  Dessert was a banana chocolate love fest,holy shit it was so good.  We will be back,, thank you. Sat at bar,,service was great. I only wished we were included in their safety meeting ;) What a great find!  We decided to go outside of the current neighborhoods that we love and found this gem.  Our reservation was at :, we arrived on time but the table wasn't ready but they went out of their way to find us a table at the bar, uncorked our bottle for free and sent over a complimentary starter.  The cauliflower mousse/potato/egg dish  it was delicious!  Once we were seated we had impeccable service, lots of recommendations and superior food!!  We started with the beet salad, which was refreshing. . . but really in a beet dish all you taste is beets.  Next we shared the squid ink pasta  this was too good for words.  In fact we would come back just for that.  Then to the entrees, my boyfriend had the ravioli and loved it.  Sweet, savory and just plain tasty.  I ordered the duck. . . and it was easily the best duck I have ever had.  Cooked perfectly with every bite better than the last.  We finished with the bananas foster, which was wonderful. . . I'm sure I could say more about it but at that point we were done with our wine and feeling a bit warm and fuzzy. We will definitely come back and I'm sure we will enjoy it as much if not more as we try new dishes. This is tricky one!  .  stars for the food which is delicious and a  star for having to wait for + minutes even though there was an empty table that could seat us and they were not even packed or busy. We made reservations for  (couple plus baby) at  PM on a sleepy, rainy Sunday just hours before the Super Bowl. Showed up on time and were told that the they were waiting on a table to pay so would we please wait at the bar. Ordered  drink and waitedThe table clearly was not leaving and  minutes later we were told that they were held up waiting on a to go order which didn't make any senseAll the while a  seat table was still empty and they still hadn't figured out if they could seat us thereFinally around : they figured out that they could give us the  seater and escorted us thereNo apologies. No we will comp your one drink or something. Nothing. All the service staff acted like nothing had happened as if this was to be expectedAnd the kicker  the party of  at the table that we were supposedly waiting to leave to be seated still hand't left when we left at :Like I said food was absolutely delicious but didn't enjoy this part of the experience Everything we had here (which was most of the menu) was delicious and our waitress was so sweet. Recommend dung. crab salad, burger, potato & egg, duck pate with pretzels. Yum. I will definitely be back. Finally trying out the new kid on the block, after hearing rave reviews from some close friends  in fact, one of them had just mentioned Stones Throw to me during lunch, so along I came, wanting to treat my mom to a nice dinner before her flight home. Rather than getting full off of entrees, we focused a bit more on appetizers instead, ordering their:* Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta  Fantastic dish, and easily our favorite part of the meal. With every bite you get massive in your face flavor goodness, which gets stronger the closer you get to the bottom of the bowl. If you don't make a point of stirring every now and then, it actually becomes a little too overwhelming, so, be sure to do so. The best way to describe the flavors of this dish? Pasta in a seafood chowder. But fancier. * Pork Belly & Crispy Pig's Ear  I, admittedly, found my first two bites of this appetizer a bit boring and uninspired, until I made a point of eating the pork with a bit more sauce, and a bite of fruit, which suddenly made for this fantastic, balanced blend of contrasting flavors. As is often the case, all the ingredients are served together for a reason!* Crispy  North Duck Breast & Thigh  Not quite as tasty as our appetizers, especially given that we've had legit Beijing duck before, but, still enjoyable, albeit a bit salty. Could have definitely benefited from less heavy handed saucing, or larger portions of the rice and pear. * Peanut Butter & Jelly Doughnuts  My reaction to this dessert started at wtf, and quickly shifted to resigned disappointment, as I wondered how we went from fantastic savory dishes to a lackluster dessert. To be fair, this platter of fluffy beignet doughnuts and fanciful condiments was not terrible, but, given the complexity and contrast of flavors in our previous dishes, the singularly sweet nature of this dessert fell disappointingly short. But, despite our dinner ending on such a low note, I still have to give Stones Throw a solid , if not almost .  stars. One of the more notable dinners I've had recently, and one I can see myself treating myself or someone special to again, if not just for that pasta dish alone. *Accessibility Info*Venue  Disregarding the excessively steep and numerous hills in the immediate vicinity of Stones Throw, which you may have to traverse depending on where you ultimately find parking, the venue itself is perfectly accessible, with a large, open floor plan. Bathroom  Given how new Stones Throw is, it's not really a surprise that their restrooms were up to spec. Stones Throw is a fantastic new restaurant in Russian Hill. We loved everything about our experience when we went there for dinner last Saturday. The atmosphere is great and the location can't be beat. It feels like a casual and professional restaurant that you can relax at during the week and also go there for a night out on the weekend. I usually don't comment on the service first, but it was truly top notch here. Servers were helpful, attentive, and professional. It was a great combo of fine dining and a casual atmosphere. The food was amazing. Literally everything we tried I would order again. For apps we shared a few things but the highlights were the squid ink pasta and the grilled octopus. The octopus was so tender and tasty. The potato puffs and eggs were also small and a great starter to share. For entrees we had the lamb and duck. The duck was above average, the lamb was really great. The meat was so tender and I loved that they served it in thin pieces. So much flavor. The wine and beer list were  extensive, whatever your interest is you will be able to find something great. As far as things to improve, we tried a few desserts. They were good but not sure if they lived up to the previous courses but by this time we were expecting a lot. It is also is a bit bare bones in the restaurant but maybe to be expected since it's so new. We will surely be back to Stones Throw. The location and atmosphere are great, perfect for San Francisco. You can tell the food is fresh and of the best quality. This is a great place. This place is great. I love the neighborhood (though parking is a bit of a challenge, they offer you a % discount if you arrive with Uber which is a nice touch). We started with the cauliflower mousse/puffed potatoes/egg thing which is really cool. You cut into the fried potato and then an egg yolk bursts out, which both surprised (and entertained) me. We got the dungeness crab salad  holy cow, it was superlative. I wish I had eaten the whole thing instead of sharing. The duck pate was on par  it was one of the best I have had. From top to bottom, there were slivers of cornichons sitting on top of a thin layer of yellow mustard (my favorite), on top of the pate. It was served with two warm and delectable pretzel rolls. For our main course we ordered the lamb, which was cooked perfectly and named accurately  the meat had just a hint of olive. We also got the black cod, again cooked perfectly. We finished up with the chesnut raviolo  probably my favorite, though all three mains were really excellent. We passed on dessert and went for ice cream up the street (probably not the smartest call). Service was good but bordering on a little slow  to be fair, we had a baby with us, and took her out of the restaurant a few times so the progression of food was probably lost on me. They were very friendly despite the fact that she was the only baby in the restaurant. A final word on drinks  I appreciate that the menu is split into different categories/descriptions of both beer and wine. The apostrophe is their version of a Manhattan and it is really delightful. Would definitely come back. Came here because of the reviews. They were right. Cool place, hard to park . But great food and wonderfully friend sly staff. Had the chestnut ravioli and it was very delicious. Also the lamb was delicious and the de burger very special. lemon meringue very good Every now and then a buddy of mine and I go out and treat ourselves.  Really glad I did it here.  The burger sells out regularly one bite and I get why so god.  Other dishes (octopus) were excellent as was dessert.  Excellent quality and presentation value added compared to price. I worked service industry for ~ years.  GM works extremely hard, but makes it look effortless to most and was very nice rest of staff also very on point.  Place has a warm atmosphere versus some of the upscale dining in city leaves has left me feeling less than welcome. I'll be back. At the end of my second dinner at Stones Throw I thought to myself that this is a wonderful place.  The service is great.  The food is great.  The atmosphere is great.  And the price is great. Roasted carrot soup with crab, vadouvan curry, citrus sections and almonds was perfection in a bowl.   And I could close my eyes and know that it was carrot soup that I was consuming, and that is the test of all vegetable based soups so far as I am concerned. . Roasted root vegetable salad with pear, squash, cauliflower, and banyuls vinegar was as good as anything I have had at Greens or Millennium.  And that is saying a great deal.  Finally, their burger.  First, they allowed me to substitute roasted vegetables for the tater tots.  Thank you for being patron friendly Stones Throw.  And whilst being medium rare the burger had char.  That is hard to do and it made the burger superior.  In fact I liked the burger here better than what I have had at Nopa or Marlowe.  And again, that is saying a lot. Overall, the food served at Stones Throw is comfort food prepared by a chef with real haute chops. Excellent food, attentive service, great ambiance, possibly the best burger in the city. Negatives: no takeout, heavy fare, no full bar. Fantastic!  I'm actually glad that the parking is so horrible here, it makes it more of a neighborhood gem. I can rave about it all but I need to call out the chestnut ravioli. . . It was the most delicious thing I've had since the chestnut soup I had at Francis. . . I guess I have a thing about chestnuts!  Anyway, the menu is inventive without being too prissy and delicate.  The only complaint I would have is that I walked out smelling like the kitchen, but I'd happily risk it. I came here for my birthday dinner, and they made me feel extra special with b day wishes and a birthday card! We had the crab and the beets & burratta for an appetizer, each were perfect sizes for  people to share. Everyone ordered entrees which were large and delicious. Full but not that ""too full"" feeling they don't fill you up with any bread and butter at the beginning which is probably a good thing.  The dessert menu left something to be desired as there was no chocolate option, but maybe that's just me! Entrees we all agreed were a thumbs up: Burger  Truffle Ravioli  Duck  Lamb ChopsI will definitely return! Really good food, but did not like the rushed service.  I'm kicking myself for not saying something to the manager right then and there. To give an example:  Was asked , yes  times in  minutes if we wanted dessert (we clearly hadn't even looked and were still enjoying our bottle of wine).  Waiter was visibly frustrated that he couldn't turn our table and the either GM or owner who was inappropriately working front of the house, was doing the same.  This put a damper on being able to enjoy the different dishes, wine, and desserts we ordered. The wine list is confusing in that it is in groupings, but no explanation of what those groupings are (Example: The header of one of the groups talks about having wine that will make you feel better after getting off of a dirty city bus. . . not very helpful in terms of flavor profile).  Upon asking the waiter for wine recommendations, he picked  of the most expensive (hello. . . you are upselling) and then gasped when I picked something else.  Dessert menu is the same.  No explanation of what the desserts actually are. Very young, energetic crowd and while the space is better than Luella, it still leaves something to be desired.  Quick overview:Ordered potato puffs, squid ink pasta, duck breast entree, peanut butter and jelly beignets, and their ""cheese course"" which was a comte crepe.  The crepe was the only thing that was not good (and I love cheese).  Everything else was delicious, but could have been hotter. Extensive beer and wine list.  Good luck sifting through the wine list on your own (and try not to get our waiter if you want any help at all). My dinner date and I had  different ""wine cocktails"" (made with sherry, vermouth, and homemade Pimm's), they were good, but real cocktails would have been better. Overall, won't go back due to the unsophisticated service and inability to enjoy the experience. Unfortunate, because the food is really good.  To put things into perspective, went to The Cavalier last week and spent more time there, but had amazing service despite the place being packed.  The comparison made Stones Throw feel less about what dining out should be about: relishing in flavors and enjoying your company. Sad. What a delicious meal! I never want to repeat restaurants but I would for this place! Must eat Good food but nothing special that would draw me back.  Just feels like another one of the newish SF restaurants sprouting everywhere.  Menu is sparse.  Beer menu extensive.  No cocktails which is a big downside.  Decor is lacking.  Thought the tater tots and duck pate were highlights. Fat Angel is a go to spot, so I was supercharged to give Stone's Throw a try.  Other than a bit of lag at the waiting stage, it was fully delightful.  Staff is fun, enthusiastic, knowledgeable.  Food made me googly eyed.  Potato puff egg things, beets, octopus:  all are tickets to Yum City!  And the final stop on the trip, dessert, was clever and cool.  Donuts (more like beignets) were m m good.  Buying a return ticket ASAP. Made reservations for dinner here before a show.  Gave ourselves .  hours but told our waitress that we need to be out the door by :.  She made it happen.  We were never rushed, even had time for sharing desserts and the evening was very enjoyable.  Our dinner was a great experience and am looking forward to coming back!Here's what we had:Appetizers roasted beets, burrata with  small crispy flatbread:  delish grilled octopus:  was very delicious.  Had a bite and wished I order this and not the salad. duck pate with pretzel bread:  didn't try it but everyone else loved it roasted root veggie salad:  it was only okay.  some roots were not roasted enough and too al dente for me.  not that you would have noticed.  my plate was clean. Mains duck:  heard it was very good lamb:  heard it was very good arctic char:  was great.  Served with crispy skin and farro, leeks, baby carrots. chestnut ravioli:  Star of the show.  It was fabulous!Desserts lemon meringue  must order! PB Jelly donuts  must order!  and eat while it's super hot! oatmeal cream pie  skip itThey have great wine and beer lists. Service was impeccable and loved the ambiance.  Our server has dark curly hair.  She was very professional and helpful with drink recommendations. Thanks Stone's Throw! Pretty good overall. The space needs a little work (at least add some more art to the walls) because it's a little too stark for my taste. Now on to the food:Puffed potato: This starter was not nearly as good as other yelpers said, in my opinion. Lacked flavor. Duck pate: Great dish, and I don't even like pate!Octopus: My friend said it was very good compared to other octopus she's had, not too toughSquid ink pasta: Highlight of the night for me but be aware that it has a slight kick to it, if you don't like spiceArctic char: Cooked perfectly, root vegetables on the side also goodOatmeal cream pie: Boring, not happy with this dish. In addition, while I like the idea of the ""homemade dessert re imagined,"" I would like a better description on the menu. For example, I was about to order the apple pie until the waiter happened to mention that it has a panna cotta texture. If the restaurant continues to change the menu with the seasons, I will definitely be back!PS While I like the neighborhood trivia on the menu, there have been unofficial reports that Filbert is in fact not the steepest street in SF. Food was really really good.  My group and I had some really amazing apps.  The Octopus was good but wasn't impressing.  It was tender but it lacked something else.  The Peanut and Butter donuts was absolutely fantastic.  Something so simple but genius.  Pig Ear and belly, great.  For some reason the vibe reminded me of the Momofuku's in NYC.  Would definitely come back for dinner. The highlights were the stuffed potato eggs & grilled octopus (so tender!). The pork belly and the da burga were also delicious but the burger and the tater tots were a bit too salty eaten together. Everything was perfectly cooked. Service was wonderful, our waiter was very knowledgeable and gave us great recommendations from the menu. I really liked the space too! Went here for my birthday. My farro was undercooked. We asked for a coke but the waitress forgot. Also, we had an appetizer that was really under seasoned and not very memorable. On the positive side, the duck was very good and so was the crab salad. Oh, and the octopus. I'll be back soon to try them again. One of the best meal in sf in a while! So glad the restaurant in sf is finally stepping up again. From start to finish not a disappointing dish. Great services, creative dishes, great taste , and good presentation. We ordered:Duck pate . / good flavor, great use of mustard. Nothing I would crave, so the end. Potato puffery egg . / taste a bit like Chinese dim sum. A mix between turnip cake, taro puff, and dry shrimp bites. Yum!Pig ear& pork belly . / I mean it's pork belly. Squid ink paste . / good portion of seafood. A tad salty for me but everyone loved it. Another must dish. Hazelnut ravioli . / hazelnut never tasted so good. Just do it. Duck . / duck breast was good but the thigh was amazing. I had an moment. For that one piece alone I would order again with no hesitation. Crepe . / for someone who doesn't care for cheese, I was sold. Apple pie . / a creative version of deconstructed apple pie. when every component of the dish is in your mouth, it becomes true my reminds you of your childhood( wait, I'm from hong kong, we don't do American apple pies there. . . )We already made  more reservations over the next  months. With new restaurant popping up every week in sf, this is a bold statement. Loved it.  Had the Beets starter and the Duck Pate (with Yummy Pretzel Rolls).  Followed by the every healthy Da Burga. . . really delicious.  Finished with the Lemon Meringue. . . which was fantastic.  Terrific atmosphere. . . really great, energetic staff with excellent wine selection. I am a yelper that only yelps when I have a great experience, and so I did at Stones Throw! The friendly vibe is my favorite part about this spot. Drinks and food are both top notch. Great all around! I had a reservation here with a friend for :pm. When we arrived the place was packed and we waited for about  minutes past our reservation time. Luckily the manager, sensing that this situation could irritate potential customers, brought us out some complimentary champagne to make the wait go by faster. My friend and I shared a few items and enjoyed a bottle of wine. The service was friendly and prompt and as some other reviews stated the burger is very very good. My friend and I concluded at the end of our meal that anything and everything at Stones Throw that contains potato is a hit. . . A dash of Michael Mina plus a pinch from Fat Angel, and you get one of the hottest new restaurants in San Francisco.  I definitely started my first Friday of  right with a dinner at this spot. First things first: you're in Russian Hill, and you know parking will be horrendous.  Stones Throw is situated on a cable car line, but if you're feeling fancy or running late, an Uber ride will also get % off your bill. The menu did not disappoint.  I arrived a bit late to share a final piece of a crunchy, crispy, and spicy chicharrone.  YOU MUST ORDER THIS  absolute flavor explosion. The table had the puffed potato and eggs, pork belly and crispy pig's ear, and grilled octopus to share.  I especially enjoyed the puffed potato and eggs, as it take delicate skills to make a perfect runny yolk enveloped in the puff.  I hope this isn't one of the seasonal items and stays on the menu ALL THE TIME. I couldn't decide what to get for my main course, so I went with the pate and the pasta (diet will start. . . sometime in ?).  The pate came out looking gorgeous, almost dessert like in terms of color and presentation.  The flavor combination with the soft mustard pretzel was a match made in foodie heaven. I saved the best for last.  The squid ink conchiglie pasta was cooked al dente, and mixed with clams and calamari for texture on texture on texture. I know it's only been two months and there may still be kinks to work out  the main one for us being the lag time between courses  but this was all around a fantastic meal.  yelp. com/biz_photos/ston…Total damage for five: $ This place is terrific.  Food is unusual but not bizarre for its own sake.  Service was excellent. We shared several appetizers and each one was great. We've already made plans to return. We had a great time. The service was good and the food excellent. I loved that they will pair wine or beer with your food. And they have selection of interesting beers available. I'd really give this place .  stars. . . pasta was great, duck very good, a couple of the appetizers were just OK. This place feels like it's always been in the neighborhood fold. A warm welcome with genuine smiles from the professional staff. Decor isn't over done like so many hip Spots on the revolving door of Valencia St. This place isn't a four barrel taxidermy knock off wanna be salvaged wood over priced SF fortnight foodie venture. Serious talent and passion for imaginative and perfectly executed dishes. Spotless service from folks who could be your neighbor and treat you as if you are :) I was really impressed! Everyone must try this place before it's too crazy busy. Order the octopus, potato yolk thingys, the pate, fuck it order everything! i am % thoroughly pleased with my experience at Stones Throw and have been raving the shit out of the this place since i went! for starters i did a super asshole move and came in with Peet's tea. my tea was still blazing hot and i'm at the beginning stages of sickness so i didn't want to toss it yet. most restaurants understandably frown on outside food or drinks but twice someone asked if i wanted my tea refilled with hot water. and it didn't seem like they were saying it in a snide condescending way either, they seemed to genuinely just want me to have hot tea. the service otherwise was excellent. each person that i encountered from the host to anybody who approached my table seemed to be sincere, enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the food. my server checked up on me quite a bit to make sure i was enjoying myself and offered her opinions as well. i had a clear view of the kitchen and could see that everybody was working hard and remained quite silent for the most part. this tells me that the team indeed works as an actual in sync TEAM with the understanding of each persons role and time constraints. i could tell they were operating like a well oiled machine. i treated myself (birthday dinner!) to an indulging meal of four small courses which ended up being five because the kitchen sent out their soup just to be nice. maybe it's because i was by myself or maybe it's because i had my DSLR with me, clearly taking photos of their food (could they have mistaken me for an actual somebody? don't think so but one can dream. haha), but i (of course) welcomed the extra dish. puffed potato and eggs/cauliflower mousse/chives/crispy chicken skin holy hell! the gnocchi like potato was thin and light. you slice into the puff and out pours the lusciously divine egg yolk. eaten with bits of crisp chicken skin and creamy cauliflower mousse, this was what dreams are made of. sunchoke soup confit egg/green apple/black walnuts a single egg yolk is presented accompanied by finely diced apple and walnuts. poured tableside is the earthy smooth sunchoke soup. a very nice soup. at this point i'd eaten the equivalent of five yolks which is a whole hell of a lot. . . whew. squid ink conchieglie pasta spicy capers/clams/calamari/tender greens. oh my god i could eat this for days. the pasta was perfectly cooked and had a nice texture to it without lacking bite. the sauce was super buttery and full of flavor and the seafood was just right. so so SO SO SO very good. pork belly and crispy pig's ears avocado/citrus/Moresque spice/kale. soft, tender, rich pork belly with creamy avocado and citrus to cut through the fattiness of the dish. the pig's ears gave it some textural balance. one of the better pork belly dishes i've ever had. not your grandma's apple pie which was really a maple panna cotta with apple granita and a paper thin rolled cookie topped with a maple sauce and finely sliced and decorative apples. this dish was super light and very balanced. it wasn't too sweet and had all the right flavors of your favorite apple pie. i die! such a good meal! i was so very impressed by every aspect of this restaurant that i gave my server a % tip for all of it's awesomeness. Excellent.  Superb food, service and drinks at a killer price point.  God knows Ive spent way more for way less at some of San Francisco's more ""exclusive"" spots.  We'll be back for sure. Stones Throw had some big shoes to fill replacing Luella. . . props to them for a successful initial execution! We had a great meal here last night  inclusive of good food, great wine, and a fun ambiance. Here's what happened: Salt roasted beets   stars, I had to search for the beets and burrata. . .  Potato puffs  as delicious tasting as they are sounding (and on the house, such a treat!) squid ink pasta  delicious and a perfectly sized app arctic char  could use some improvement, a little salty but added a nice light option to the menu My fellow diners tried the burger, chestnut ravioli, and duck, and all gave good reports Apple pie and beignets, both great, fun to look at and eat! I was pleased with my first visit here, and I'm hoping they expand the menu a bit, in which case, I'll be making a return visit.  Also, props to management for hiring and training the outstanding staff (special shout out to the sweet hostess on duty last night, she was the best!) Following a friends recommendation we dined at Stone's Throw last night. The menu upon first glance seemed eclectic and small but boy oh boy, the dishes were incredible. We started with Duck Pate, puffed potato and eggs and crispy pork chicharrones. The Pate came with little pretzel buns and was amazing, the chicharrones were ok but the star of the starters were the puffed potatoes. We ordered a second round  do not skip them!Then we continued to share Squid Ink Pasta, Octopus and pork belly and crispy pig's ears. All three were outstanding. The octopus was so tender and delicious and the pork belly rich and delightful and the crispy pigs ears like very fine french fries. We also ordered the Duck as an entree as well as the Rib eye and the Ravioli. The Duck melted on your mouth, the rib eye was incredibly tender and flagrant and although the ravioli were the least memorable dish of the selection it was good fare. For dessert: oatmeal cream pie and the most amazing (not your mothers) apple pie ever. I will be back. Perfectly executed from start to finish.  Tables are well spaced, decor is minimalist, attentive staff, great cocktails, wide wine assortment, and the FOOD is wow. We had SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA ($), CRISPY  NORTH DUCK BREAST ($), GARLIC THYME ROASTED BEEF RIB EYE ($), and GRANDMA'S APPLE PIE. . . . BUT NOT QUITE ($).  Each dish was perfect!Only downside, prices are a bit steep for the portion size.  However, I suppose quality costs $.  Highly recommend, will frequent Stones Throw. We brought some good friends, visiting from out of town, for brunch a few weeks ago. (Are they still doing brunch? I hope so!) The menu seemed a bit odd at first  short and desultory, which is very weird in SF, where short menus tend to be ""themed""  but now that I've tried the food I LOVE the menu! It's almost as it they were thinking ""let's say  friends with totally different hankerings each wanted the best brunch ever"" and built the menu from there!The burger was phenomenal (our friend said it was the best burger he's ever had) and (I never eat pancakes but) my friend's pancakes were huge enough fur us all to nibble on and insanely good. Love the creativity of duck confit hash! Love that this is a few blocks' walk from us!Will definitely take guests here and come on dates! No one could say the food here is not phenomenal. Every dish is a treat, from the creamy duck pate with mini pretzel rolls to the deliciously tender octopus. But the portions are tiny. The service is mediocre. And the decor feels half finished somehow. We got off to a shaky start: We set a reservation for :pm, arrived at :pm, and were seated around :pm. To pass the time, my friend and I asked our waiter to recommend a wine. He brought out a Chianti; I was dubious, but agreed. And unfortunately it was sweet and light  the complete opposite of dry and full bodied, as I'd described. At that point the manager came by to offer us champagne to apologize for the delay, but we'd ordered our drinks already. Wish he'd come by earlier. . . My friends and I ordered a bunch of dishes to share, to sample a bit of everything.  SALT ROASTED BEETS WITH BURRATA = Came with  crackers (not ideal for our table of ) and some minced beets mixed in with burrata. This was my least favorite dish of the night  a bit sweet for my taste. It was also tiny. $ PUFFED POTATO AND EGGS = Again bite sized, but crazy delicious. Perfectly crispy on the outside, with oozing yolk inside, served on some creamy cauliflower mousse. Wish there were a few more of these! $ DUCK PATE AND MOUSSE = Still dreaming about this. The creamiest, most delectable duck pate ever. Unfortunately, it was served with  (only !) mini pretzel rolls. Our table of  had to slice each of these pretzel rolls in half so we could each get half a bite of bread. Which brings me to my next point: Why skimp on the bread? In fact, why didn't the restaurant start us out with a basket of bread? I just felt a bit . . . deprived at this point, considering the prices we were paying.  $ SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA = One of the star dishes of the night. This is listed as a starter but could easily serve as an entree. The veggies were so tender, the flavor was rich and the pasta was perfectly cooked al dente. $ GRILLED OCTOPUS = Raved about for a reason. As others have said before me, it's the the most tender octopus I've ever had. Mixed in with chorizo, lemon and white beans, it was just perfection. $ CRISPY DUCK = Crackling skin clung to juicy (without being fatty) pieces of duck on top of moist black rice. Really tasty. $ CHESTNUT RAVIOLO = Not as flavorful as I imagined, considering its ingredients (chanterelle mushrooms, roasted brussels sprouts and truffle butter), but still really good. But there were only two pieces of ravioli. $Quite an expensive dinner for very little food. Honestly though, if the environment suited the prices, I wouldn't have minded. The walls were pretty bare (I understand they've only been open for  weeks, so I'll cut them some slack on this one), but the tacky red flooring (reminiscent to my elementary school cafeteria) was unforgivable. There was just nothing special enough about the decor or overall dining experience to justify the bill. I will give Stones Throw the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they just need a few more weeks to get their sh** together. But for the time being, the food is this restaurant's only saving grace. I haven't reviewed in a while, but since Stone's Throw is new and I had such a good time there, I feel like I have to share the love. The food is awesome.  We started with the cauliflower egg puffs, which were different and delicious.  A great snack to whet your appetite.  Then we moved to the duck pate/ mousse snack. I LOVE pate, and this did not disappoint.  It is served with soft pretzel style rolls and cornichons and everything about it is lovely from the taste to the presentation.  The portion is more than fair considering the price and the listing as a ""snack"".  We moved on to apps after this, settling on the pork belly citrus salad and the squid ink pasta.  The pork belly salad had a nice mix of savory meat, citrus, veggies (rainbow kale, how SF) and crispiness the salad was topped with crispy pig's ears.  Now, for me, the showstopper was the pasta.  It was perfection. The pasta itself was delicate and flavorful clearly homemade.  It was topped with pickled kale, shrimp, mussels, and clams and was in a clam sauce and cauliflower mousse.  I can't really describe how much I hearted this dish.  I live in the area and can easily foresee myself having this pasta and a glass of wine solo at the bar.  Like, regularly.  Between these  dishes and the delish bread, we didn't feel like we needed to try an entree. . . so we skipped straight to dessert and shared the pb&j beinets.  I'm not much of a sweets gal, but these were good.  Now, for the service.  It got off to a slightly rocky start we had made reservations weeks prior, but still ended up waiting  minutes for our table to be ready.  We ordered a bottle of wine and hung out at the standing bar table, where there were two other couples who were in the same boat reservations, but no available tables.  Not sure what that was all about.  Also not sure why the other two couples were given snacks as a thank you for waiting thing and we weren't, but whatever.  Maybe they were waiting even longer?  If so, Stone's Throw really needs to step up their reservation game.  So while at the communal table, after the other couples were sat, I spilled a glass of wine.  Super embarrassing.  It was just one of those things where I was talking and not paying attention and just set the glass down wrong.  It wasn't a huge deal the glass was only a third full and didn't break or spill on the floor just on the table.  I apologized profusely, but the waiter gave me some 'tude.  I know, I'm the jerk here, but seriously, not that big of a deal.  When we finally were seated, our waitress was great. . . super friendly and nice, and knowledgeable about the food.  Her recommendations seemed sincere and she actually seemed excited to be there.  I liked that. Overall, the restaurant is a great addition to the neighborhood and I'm excited to go back.  If the reservations snafus are figured out, I'd be happy to increase my stars. First things first.  Parking was TERRIBLE!  We went up a street then down a street, back up again, turned around, took a left, then a right, went back up, came back down, took another left, then a right, stopped, waited, continued on, passed  or  fire hydrants, waited at a stop light, saw a car pull out a driveway, got excited, found out he pulled out of a garage, then got mad, then hungry, then starving until finally maybe  blocks away we found a stall!We walked up a steep hill, crossed the road and two buildings down was. . . . . wait for it. . . . . . STONES THROW!We had a PM reservation.  Checked in and found out they didn't have our res.  It was opening night and just so happened they somehow squeezed us in for a table!  PLUS PLUS PLUS for Stones Throw!On to the food.  Holy COW!  Like who is their chef (s)??  They must have had some kind of culinary experience from like dreaming or something.  There were flavors I think I never tasted before.  Every dish, be it an appetizer, entrée, dessert (cause we ordered pretty much the entire menu) was as we say here from Hawaii ""BROKE DA MOUTH!"" (Something so tasty that you want to eat it all at once)At this point the parking situation we forgot about. The place is clean.  New restaurant.  Go figure.  It's a really small place.  You can hear peoples conversations.  Couldn't help but eavesdrop.  Price is price.  Bring lots of money.  Your gonna need it to have a great night out of town for a nice dinner.  Bring your better half.  Your friends too.  It's that kind of place. Staff was wonderful.  It's a new joint.  They had to be.  But waitress was on time everytime!    To sum it all up.  HmDAMN the DUCK was unreal! I'll begin with a complaint my feet are cold because the experience knocked my socks off. While I may have granted Stones Throw five stars, the galaxy could not contain the number of celestial orbs that this fine establishment deserves. Our dining experience was so extraordinarily exquisite that my tastebuds were unprepared for the sensuous melding of flavors. The cozy comforts of home, an exquisitely chosen wine list complete with insightful and witty writing, and the attention to detail among the skilled staff are some of the many reasons to quench your thirst and satisfy your hunger here. While it may be called Stones Throw, the distance between it and other dining halls is infinite. P. S. Get the squid ink pasta. It rocks. Overall a great experience and I will definitely come back to try more of their menu. Here is how I rate the experience by courses:SNACKS   starsSalted beets + burrata  excellent, interesting presentation where it looks like tartarePotato puffs  BOMB status, GET THISPretzel with duck mousse/pate   stars & BOMB status, GET THISAPP   starsThe crispy pork belly  salad was actually not that amazing. The pork belly was kind of dry; however, everything else in the salad was awesome, especially the fried pork ears. (I heard the octopus was amazing and will get that next time instead)ENTREE  . We all got ""Da Burga"" ( stars) all around the table. First few bites were amazing  really good quality meat, yummy brioche like bread, loaded with cheddar. BUT, it gets a little too rich and a bit much after a while, and this was probably the only burger i didn't finish in life (not due to portion size but due to the heaviness/richness). The twice baked potato tots that came as a side were also a bit rich (and a little salty), and I couldn't finish them either. (Next time I'd want to try the duck or rib eye)DESSERT   starsPB & J donut/beinets  YUM! really goodDef recommend and I look fwd to coming back! Are you kidding me? How the heck is this place a + star average?  Gimme a break. I couldn't figure this place out. First of all, it's as bare boned as it's predecessor, Luella. So don't expect any innovation there. Ambiance wouldn't be such an issue to me if the food shined. But sadly, it's doesn't. The menu looks very nice (keyword = looks!)  elevated New American, maybe?  But ""inspired fare"" this is not. We started with the tater tots (good) and roasted root vegetable salad (very good). Things started going downhill when they served the that tired Raviolo. It's two large raviolis served over vegetables. Maybe it just wasn't my night. The inside of the raviolo looks and tastes like refried beans. I asked the waitress what it was and she told me ""chesnut blended with truffle oil. ""  Oh kay, so where is the truffle?  I couldn't taste a damn thing. But the worst part was that the ravioli was not cooked properly.  It was hard!  Not even al dente!  Had to send it back :(  (And this girl was HONGRY! So that ain't good)Now onto the interesting desserts. What a disaster. I'm sorry  inspired by childhood favorites  and tastes like them too?  EWW!  I'm sorry, but I don't want an oatmeal cake that tastes like Little Debbie cakes from back in the day.  And I don't want a freaking apple pie that is actually a creative panna cotta that is supposed to taste like what?  Apple pie?  Then just give me a really good apple pie!Oh and here's the kicker. . . Dessert menu comes with a paper and pencil for you to write in a favorite dessert you'd like to see on the menu.  My response:  ""How about something fresh?""  My waitress came right back to me with an attitude to explain that everything is fresh  just inspired by childhood faves.  Oh kay.  Coulda fooled me!Two stars is generous. We were so sad to see Luella go, but could't have hoped for a better replacement. It has all the charming neighborhood qualities you'd hope to find around the corner. . . but the food is anything but neighborhoodie. Duck Pate and Mousse is something to write home about. Octopus was exceptionally well prepared. Service was amongst the best we've had in San Francisco. Get in now before it's too late. I'm still basking in the glow of last night's dinner. . . Quick, get your reservation and eat here before the whole city finds out about it!We ordered:Duck Pate and Mousse  What an awesome dish to start with. Octopus  WINNER! This one was the BEST. We couldn't stop ym ing. Duck So tasty. My second favorite. Raviolo The most savory and flavorful of them all. Roasted beef ribeye  I'm sure if it didn't have to compete with all of the above it would have been really good. Drinks: Great wine and beer menu (no cocktails)Overall  great great food. Ambience was just right  not too loud, not uptight. Good service. My friends and I all agreed we would all come back again for sure. Best meal I've had in a long time! Fantastic neighborhood restaurant. Loved every thing we ate. Everyone was very friendly. Can't wait to go back!!  Pâté  amazing! Squid ink pasta was divine! Best duck I've ever had! Will definitely return.  Stone's Throw is a great replacement for Luella. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. PUFFED POTATO & EGGS ( stars. these were delicious. We almost placed a nd order they were able to make them without chicken skin for the vegetarian in our group)DUCK PÂTÉ & MOUSSE ( stars. Great for anyone who loves foie gras terrine. it's the best imitation.  Pretzels  GREAT call)GRILLED OCTOPUS ( stars. BEST. we've. ever. had. We never thought grilled octopus could be so tender)GARLIC THYME ROASTED BEEF RIB EYE ( stars  the guys got these. they both thought it was good. probably not best they've ever had)CHESTNUT RAVIOLO (.  stars. GREAT vegetarian option)SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA ( stars. even though it's a starter, I got this for my entree and it was delicious and definitely filling enough for an entree. WIne lists surprisingly not out of $ range. Had a $ bottle of syrah and two half bottles of sparkling rose for only $ each. We also brought a bottle of our own wine! Score on getting reservations on Friday for a Saturday night!  I came with a few of my best gf's and we were all pleasantly surprised.  I really liked the Salt Roasted Beets, Crab Salad, Squid Ink Pasta, and Raviolo.  The burger was good but nothing memorable.  Just ok  Duck Pate, Pork Belly SaladI'd pass on the Puffed Potato snack.  It's a nice open space, service was great and prices are average.  Parking is tough in this neighborhood so plan on going early! Stones throw was a great meal!  For starters, the pork belly dish was divine!  It wasn't really a salad, nonetheless it was delicious and had a great flavor contrast.  We also had the octopus as a starter and it was cooked to perfection! For dinner, we had the chestnut ravioli and duck.  Both were unique and full of flavor. Lastly, I really liked how they had their wine lost organized. It was easy to read and creatively put together. Lovely neighborhood restaurant ! Parking can be tricky, Uber is a good alternative. Service was excellent and food was very good. Beets. good but just a bit under seasonedCrab Salad,outstandingSunchoke soup, greatRoot vegetable salad, good but would have been better without the pear in itKing Salmon (in December ?I but they said it was fresh , tasty but a tad overdone. (Maybe it was frozen ?) But nonetheless it was good. but not excellent. Lemon meringue pie, very tasty. Wines by the glass were decent except for the French Peillot, either open too long or just plain not good. Overall it was a very pleasant dining experience . Also considering they have been open for less than a month. Sure it will get even better in the future. The service was great.  Most of the food was delicious. This is a very nice  neighborhood restaurant.  The sauces stood out with wonderful flavors and interesting combinations, but some of the basics were just okay.  Stellar:the hamburger (not so impressed with the tater tots)the sunchoke soupthe lemon meringue pieOver all quality of serviceMedium:steaksalmonroot saladInadequate:Debbie's oatmeal cakeThey do not serve bread with the meal even if you ask for bread. Wine recommendations are over priced considering the knowledge of the servers about the wine they are selling +stars!! Amazing addition to the Russian Hill neighborhood. Great menu selections in addition to an extensive beer menu and wine. Chestnut raviollo was a favorite! Not to forget, a very hospitable crew! Must visit!! Yes Please!I went to Stones Throw last night and it was a great experience. For those who are looking for the quick recommendations  here were my favs: Duck Pate  Perfect in every way. Loved the warm pretzels! Squid Ink Pasta  if you like seafood, order this. Has a perfect kick.  Pork Belly Salad  NOMZ! Perfectly cooked Pork Belly  Any dessert  they're all deconstructed and fab. The longer review. Showed up a few minutes before my pm reservation. The host gave us a 'proactive apology' that there would be a delay as they were very busy along with  glasses of Champange. Ended up sitting down around : and staying until  or so. I admit that we went a bit overboard with ordering but wanted to try everything!Aside from the four items I wrote about above, we also tried. . .  Puffed Potato and Eggs: Good but not INCREDIBLE Dungeness Crab Salad: Again, this was good but I probably wouldn't order again. It was a bit over seasoned in my opinion and I was hoping for pure Crab especially since it's crab season in SF! Raviolo: I had never had a Raviolo, i. e. a giant Ravioli but this was worth trying. Very rich and hearty and something that I'd recommend sharing only because it's so heavy.  Salmon: YUM! big fan  good mix of flavors.  Da Burga: The potato tots are GREAT  yum!I look forward to heading back in  weeks :) We had  dishes,  were great,  was okay. We had an : reservation and unfortunately the table we were waiting for took their sweet time paying their bill.  The mgmt  provided us with a complementary glass of cava while we waited and we were greeted with dish #, also on the house, as an apology for the wait. Dish #: stuffed tater tots.   stars.  kettle chip crust filled with whipped potatoes with bits of bacon, chives, some other stuff that was delicious. Dish #: Grilled Octopus.   stars.  Perfect char on the octopus, chorizo really worked well with the octopus.  Very flavorful and interesting.  Second best dish of the night. Dish #:   Puffed Potatoes and Eggs.  Was savory, but that's about it.  Flavor was okay, but no wow factor.  Not really noteworthy.  Dish #:  Pork belly salad.  First small bite of the belly I had was okay.  Second bite, I loaded up my fork with all the ingredients on the plate and it really shined.  The avo, belly, citrus and kale came together in a flavor and texture symphony.   Third best dish of the night. Dish #:  SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA.  Spectacular.  Flavor was amazing.  Pasta was perfectly cooked.  Best seafood pasta dish I have ever had easily.  Must order.  Best dish of the night. Service was good and the host/GM did a great job of turning our wait, which could have been a negative, into a positive. *.  stars*I really feel that I need to stop saying this with each new restaurant that I try because each time I say it, it lowers my credibility, but for some reason, it keeps being true: this is my favorite new restaurant in SF. These new restaurants have been KILLING it in San Francisco recently and there hasn't been a more exciting time to be trying new places in the city. Stones Throw is just the most recent addition to this list and, for the most part, it stands triumphant. The decor is ultra minimal (feels like an art gallery without the art), the atmosphere is intimate yet lively, and the service is INCREDIBLE. Perhaps it's just the honeymoon stages of a new restaurant (before exhaustion and tenure lead to jaded indifference), but every employee that we came into contact with was cheerful, friendly, and absolutely on point. Even the busboys were chatting up a storm with us, asking us our favorite dishes thus far and adding in their recommendations. I'll call out our server, Dave L, specifically, because he was awesome  our wine and water glasses were always filled; his food descriptions were excellent; and he was honest with us about a couple of dishes to avoid for the night (which I always appreciate). FOOD:Puffed Potato & Egg = GREAT. Nice crisp, delicious subtle flavor. Duck Pate w/ Pretzel = GREAT. Smooth and creamy pate, nice salty touch from the pretzel. Squid Ink Pasta = EXCELLENT. Never had squid ink pasta shells (it's usually in spaghetti or paella form), but this is amazing for squid ink lovers. Grilled Octopus = GOOD. Good flavor but wasn't grilled enough. I prefer the grilled octopus at Mason Pacific. Pork Belly Salad = EXCELLENT. Perfectly cooked crispy pork belly with a nice sweet kick from the pickled onions. ""Da Burga"" with Loaded Tater Tots = EXCELLENT. Love the oily brioche bun; the meat was a juicy and perfectly cooked medium rare; and the loaded tater tots were addicting as hell. Grilled Rib Eye = OKAY. This was the one truly disappointing dish of the night  the rib eye wasn't very tender and the flavors were actually pretty boring. I wish I had listened to my gut and went with the duck that everyone raves about. DESSERTS:I was on the fence with the desserts because even though I understand and appreciate their idea of adding a fancy twist to old childhood favorites, some of them just didn't really work. In particular, the ""Not Your Grandma's Apple Pie"" is a complete deconstruction and then molecular gastronomic reconstruction of ""apple pie""  so instead of a warm, crumbly apple pie, it's a cold apple flavored pot de creme with a crispy wafer roll. It wasn't that the flavors weren't good (they were), but it's just not what I was expecting and I think the dessert is done a disservice by being compared to an apple pie. The PB&J donuts were good, but the donuts weren't airy enough. The Oatmeal Cream Pie didn't really stick out as memorable either  it just tasted like an overly sweet. . . well yeah. . . Oatmeal Cream Pie. Stones Throw has the potential to be one of the best American Contemporary restaurants in SF. It has the talent, the service, the menu, and actually quite reasonable prices. If it weren't for the Rib Eye and the strangely uninspired desserts, I would've easily given this place a resounding  stars. I'll definitely be back though, and I'm pretty confident that once it gets it's gears going, Stones Throw is going to be among the very top of the SF restaurant food chain. I am not sure what the raves are about. . .  We gave it a try bc it has .  stars here and it's a new place.  We came with very low expectation and it was worse than what we expected. . . The puff potato and eggs were NOT what it was described: light, rich, fluffy, crispy.  They were exactly the opposite:  heavy, bland, doughy, chewy on the outside. The pate and mousse was too dense to be pate and mousse.  The mini pretzel buns were a little tough.  The pork belly salad was a rip off. . .  it's boring.  The pork belly pieces were cooked well but it was not exciting!  Three little pieces of pork belly and  leaves of veggies,  citrus supremes,  small avocado wedges, a small dollop of dressing and a few slivers of pigs ear for like $ or $!We were told the octopus was the best and most tender bc it was sous vide then grill with great char. . . .  It was sous vide for too long in too high of the temperature that the octopus was completely broken down to mush and ""stringy""!!  Our server was super nice and tried real hard.  She said the octopus was super tender and cuts like butter!  I was like no kidding it cuts like butter, it was it's way over down to mush!  Maybe I will return in  months if i was in the area and try it again but this place is nothing like what everyone says it is.  We didn't expected we will be wow'd by the meal but we were very very disappointed and went somewhere else instead to finish our dinner. Excellent food, even better service. Must orders: Beets appetizer, grilled octopus appetizer, filet entreeJust ok: root vegetable salad appetizer, crab salad appetizer, salmon entreeI would give this place five stars, but the decor is really drab, especially the floors. I will say that the service is absolutely outstanding  we had a great waitress and the rest of the staff were very friendly and attentive. We went here the first week it opened and I couldn't be more pleased to have them in my neighborhood!  Oodles of yummy small plates and the burger was amazing.  It's a tiny bit cold but have a glass of wine and everything's good. Amazing meal. . . seriously, everything we ordered was outstanding. Service was excellent too. We started with the squid ink conchiglie pasta and the grilled octopus. I'm a sucker for squid ink anything and this did not disappoint. Hubby and I fought for the very last bits. We almost always try the octopus if it's on a menu and this one was superb. There was a tiny morsel left on the plate and Hubby protectively hovered his hand over it when the server asked if she could take it away. He had the duck and I had the salmon as entrees. It took me  minutes more to finish my entree because I was savoring each piece of farro hoping it would last longer. Finished with the deconstructed apple ""pie"" and some grappa. Highly recommend (if you can get in!). Can't wait to come back. Luella location is now called Stones Throw and is seriously good food. Mucho Michael Mina influences with former chef Jason Halverson plus others from Fat Angel. Pork Belly salad, Duck breast and stuffed Raviola were our choices. Pleasing wine list with several by the glass. Brunch will be coming soon and the bar area will expand so more dine at the bar seating. Dined at the bar with excellent service and advice on the menu.  Selection seemed light but everything is highly recommended.  Ambiance a bit rustic but works for this neighborhood.  Parking is challenging, take Uber or cab. The food. . . . what can I say?  I don't typically order pate but theirs is rich and creamy and sinfully delicious. The puff potato and eggs were something I want to consume every day of my life.  Pork belly salad = life changing. Raviolo . . . . Epic. And THEN let's discuss the oatmeal cream pie: Totally my new favorite dessert in SF.  Love it. Our server really made us feel like we were having a meal experience and why the food was prepared and plated the way it was as if we were part of the process.  Fantastic wine and beer list.  They really hit it out of the park from day one!  Can't wait to return. I was so excited to try this place and we ended up having a great time.  The service was good and our server was super friendly. The sunchoke soup with the confit egg was super tasty as was the pate (my favorite appetizer!).  I got the rib eye, which was perfectly cooked, and my hubby got the raviolo which he really liked.  It had tons of flavor and was pretty filling. The apple pie dessert is amazing, but warning  it's not hot!  The icy apple makes it interesting but part of me wishes there was some warm apple to make it really satisfying on a cold winter night!  The flaky ""pie crust"" was SO GOOD.  Overall, yummy!! This place is AMAZING! You must try if you have not yet been there. I live in this neighborhood and it is full of people everyday! Make a reservation if you are going. Everyone is friendly and the food is so so so yummy!! For this price, it is very high value and I will definitly go back frequently. Here are my favorite:Snack. . . DUCK PÂTÉ & MOUSSE Starter. . . SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA Main. . . CRISPY  NORTH DUCK BREAST Dessert. . . APPLE PIEStone Throw begins to serve Sundy Brunch too. I heard it is good! It is on my schedule for this Sunday. . . . :) I can say, AMAZING. The food, people, plating, space. Just beautiful. Amazing food! Love the food, good service! Must go there! They get a lot of drinks too! Owner Cyrick is very nice! They also have a bar call fat angel at Fillmore! I love that place too!"
Wako Japanese Restaurant|4.5|Japanese in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|89|-1|4.52941176471|" Hands down  the best sushi I've had in San Francisco.  The Omakase was fantastic. Will definitely come back and recommend this place to everyone. I kept building up this place in my head based on all the reviews. Over the summer I was in Tokyo and basically wanted to continue my high of quality sushi. When the date finally came to have dinner here I was more than excited. Stepped into a beautiful, cozy restaurant wrapped in wood. The decor in the place was completely inviting and intimate. The place can only sit about  people (you must make reservations and they book up pretty fast. . ). I really wanted to sit at the bar but it was completely booked even with calling  weeks in advance. We decided on the  course omakase which was comprised of   small bites,  piece of grilled fish,  piece nigiri,  small pieces of tempura, miso soup and dessert. Completely FRESH AND SIMPLE. Nothing too intricate or bold just simply delicious quality flavors that stayed true to their ingredients. I have to say the sushi nigiri pieces are pretty small; even to Japanese standards. They were probably the smallest pieces of sushi I have ever had. . Even after the  courses we were still hungry so we ordered the kaisen chawanmushi  a small hot pot of jidori egg curd, snow crab and uni. . . AGAIN absolutely delicious but so small!! I was still so hungry. After dinner  I wanted to run to Genki for a crepe! Bottom line this place is incredible. Pricey considering I left this place not overly full but definitely worth your while. Hate to jinx it but only a matter of time before it gets it well deserved accolades (hint, maybe even a michelin star). Best. sushi. ever!  Both my fiancé and I tried the Omakase and it was so great to have the wide variety of sushi, tasty grilled fish (with the perfect crisp crust), and amazing tofu appetizers.  If you're looking for a traditional Japanese restaurant, this is it.  I don't eat raw fish that often but did tonight and it was amazing better than I have had at any other sushi restaurant in SF!  They even lightly flavor each piece of sushi so you don't need soy sauce for dipping and can better taste the natural fish flavors.  I will be coming back here again soon! Pretty happy I got to try this place when it opened because this spot is definitely rising to the top of my favorite sushi / Japanese joints in SF. This location is seemingly harmless and far away from most places but make no mistake this spot gets busy. It is tiny inside, with a maybe  person sushi bar so you definitely need to make reservations if you want to come here and try it out. I highly suggest the sushi bar, but since it's so small you should only do the bar if you have  people. They can at most seat  to a table, so be aware of this. The chef is very talented, I think and does a great omakase. Not only that but it is worth every penny! It's such a cheap omakase for the kind of food that you get served, and the sushi and nigiri are all expertly cut, freshly sourced and delicious. They have a great selection of sake and good selection of beer as well (of course Japanese based . . . ), also great if you just want to continue your omakase with whatever the chef has to recommend after your official omakase ends. This place, like most restaurants on Clement Street, is terribly overrated. I had the very expensive Omakase and everything about it was just mediocre. They use way too much sugar (or is it HFCS?), the fish was not very fresh, and the dishes frankly were ordinary. I'm not inspired to go back again. We had the $ omakase in additional to seven other nigiri per person in order to get full. Presentation was very pretty, but the palate was too bland for my taste. Great place. Everything tasted exceptionally good and all the food was well presented. The service is good. The atmosphere/decor is nice too; it's a smallish restaurant. Really stands out as one of the better/authentic Japanese/sushi restaurants. Way too expensive for my liking, however. There are better (or very comparable) sushi restaurants for lower prices in SF. I will not be returning to pay these prices. I like weird food. Marinated raw octopus, fish collar, one off things you don't see in other places. Especially uni. I am convinced my soul mate is out there. That one person who loves uni as much as I do, is my true soul mate, separated by time and space, he and I will never meet but if we did, in this life time, sparks would fly and we'd congregate at this restaurant and toast for the love affair of a life time. That is how I think about good food and its effect on people. Made a reservation to arrive at this nice little restaurant. The chef/owner Tomo was very friendly, he shared with us his go to dishes and his life in America. In addition, he wrote down the restaurant I must visit on my upcoming trip to Tokyo. My favorite fish was Japanese barracuda and red snapper. Quite intriguing fish. Modern aesthetics for a restaurant that is in the Inner Richmond district but that's where I go now for Japanese food. By the time we finished the restaurant was filled with people. I like fresh fish. I like small dishes. I like to think as I get to Japan, I'd visit Tomo's buddy who just opened his own shop. Having recently been to restaurants that were strict, it's nice to meet a friendly chef who happens to be super talented too. When I am in the mood, I enjoy socialize with the chef. That evening I was in the mood, and I was indeed entertained. Will be back for more raw sea food, and sit at the counter again. Made reservations a week in advance for  people at p. Got here at that time and we were seated near the door where it's a  seat table. . . wtf? We were not sitting comfortable. We asked to move to a roomier spot and they refused. Fine. Whatever. . . ordered the  course omakase for $. . . . omg. . . so not worth it!  The first  small tiny little plates tasted good but the portion size so small!  Nigiri's were okay sized, rice was good but again not worth  nigiri,  small plates,  grill, tempura, miso soup, and tiny ass dessert. Ordered one of their rolls where you can choose up to  items good but way too small.  Sushi Sam is still by far the best!!  At least their salad order is a good portion size to share. We ordered some kind of a salad here and it was the size of my palm! Waste of time and money. Oh and forgot to mention They charge you for wasabi if you ask for extra the nd time! Just cuz it's fresh doesn't mean you should charge $ for so little wasabi!! Each order of raw fish should come with some sort of wasabi, correct? But only  of our many orders came with wasabi. We had to ask for more and when we did, they told us that it's $ for extra. . . . My new top sushi place in the city!  This place is spot on with everything, from the decor to the dishware to the food itself.  Treat yourself to one of the course meals, and enjoy! One of the best sushi restaurant in SF. It's pricy(one order for pc nigiri), but totally worth it. The sushi are fresh, well cut and nice decorated, the small plates are delicious too. . . wait, actually everything is good here!! I'm a lifelong lover of sushi and have been to most of the highest rated sushi bars in Tokyo.  After + meals here, I would rather eat at Wako than most of them. It is without a doubt the best sushi bar in Northern California. Most sushi bars can get a fresh selection of fish from Tsukiji now days.  The topping is only a small part of the equation and a prerequisite to making good nigiri.  Tomo san's rice, creative preparation, laser focused attention to detail and hospitality set him very far apart from the rest of the pack.  Not to mention that the decor and design of Wako look like a three star Michelin sushi bar that was transported straight from Ginza. Simply incredible.  Go. Wako has a very reasonably priced omakase menu. The first course consists of a beautifully crafted seasonal vegetable dish, very light, very appetizing.  Almost like an amuse bouche.  Then the grill dish we had was a nicely chared pieced of salmon, with the right amount of fat.  It was almost as buttery and decadent as a piece of black cod.  The  pieces of nigiri followed were the highlights of the meal.  The fish super fresh.  The rice chewy and perfectedly cooked.  Each nigiri was nicely seasoned, with a hint of citrus or a pinch of wasabi.  The fish's distinctive flavors were not masked, but elevated.  What ended a wonderful meal was the matcha daifuku, pumped with a creamy filling similar to Beard Papa's famous cream puffs.  Not overly sweet, just the perfect little sweet note to end your meal. All for under $ (excludes tax and tips. )  I think that's a steal. Best sushi restaurant in San Francisco by far. Fresh sashimi and fish. The mochi and mousse is to die for. Will definitely come back soon. If you eat here, try and sit at the bar for the full experience. I've been here twice now. The second time we sat at the bar which was a much better experience. The sushi was served piece by piece rather than all at once. I have to say that Japan has totally ruined me for sushi. . . so my spoiled ass thought wako was good but not GREAT. The ambience is superb with the wooden themed interior, though. This is probably the most authentic omakase you could do in SF right now. Their non sushi dishes were wonderful. Really loved the matsutake soup, miso cod, and tempura with matcha salt. The course meal is definitely a good deal. Although we did sushi a la carte the last time we were here. Tell me who orders ALL of the specials of the night? We do. . . I've been on the quest to find a great omakase sushi bar and have been to  different places in the past  months.  Wako got such great reviews with a bunch of nom nom nom, appetizing photos. But my friend and I were disappointed from our Fri visit. I'm hoping it maybe because they were having an off day. Below's our experience on the full course of omakase. We also ordered a few things a la carte and I thought a la carte has better value. The best dishes are probably the uni and otoro. Ambiance   stars. Nice, quaint, intimate. Deco   stars. Clean, minimalist, comfortable. Presentation   stars. Artistically appealing. Flavor   stars. Sushi rice was dry and lacked flavor. We also ordered the white salmon special; it was cooked tough, doesn't flake off and the glaze was burnt and no flavor. Some other fishes were also lacking flavor. Selection   stars. Service  .  stars. Quality   starsI might go back again. But it would be to try the normal sushi bar. Definitely one of the best sushi places in the bay area. $ for the best omakase I've ever had?! Yes please! My boyfriend and I definitely put our trust into these sushi chefs, and we did not regret it! Each nigiri they hand out is perfectly crafted and just m m melts in your mouth. Every single piece tasted so different from the other but still managed to cause an extravaganza in your mouth.  I've never had a sushi experience like this before! The omakase also comes along with a soup and two small plates which also delight the taste buds in your mouth. The tea is also delightful along with your meal! And oh man! The silverware! From the teapot, to the plates, to the utensils, the silverware is so appealing to the eyes. The whole restaurant is nicely decorated, but the silverware just seals the deal. Also, the sushi chefs were absolutely charming! My boyfriend and I were  when we decided to come here. So we couldn't order any beer or sake. But! They still offered to cheers KAMPAI! with our tea cups and their alcoholic beverages. Made us feel very relaxed and engaged during our meal. They also answer all your questions enthusiastically and kindly if you have any while you sit at the sushi bar. Also, they're open to getting to know their customers which is always a plus! Waitress was nice too. They were all booked for the day, but she managed to slip us in for two seats at the sushi bar an hour later. Overall, this is the best sushi experience I've had thus far! I'm so glad my boyfriend and I decided to splurge on sushi during our visit to SF that day! Definitely would give it a ten stars if I could! I had a good experience dining for the first time at this new spot. Well over $ + $ tip for two patrons, FYI. It's a quality restaurant. Small, focused on nicely flavored nigiri, no wasabi or soy. This isn't a place for diners who don't enjoy legit Japanese cuisine. Note: We had more nigiri than pictured plus miso, another soup, and tempura. I love this new Japanese restaurant in SF. Small, refined, super friendly staff. If one calls Roku Japanese fusion toward the western end of the spectrum, I would call this Californian Japanese toward the Japanese end of the spectrum. Everything was done with taste, fabulous presentation, great balance of flavor, and ingenuity. If you are here with someone, I would suggest to share a  course omakase. The nigiris are amazing  seasoned for you already and top quality for fish, rice, and presentation. I even like it better than the ones in Japan since the chef seasons it perfectly to save us Americans from putting too much soy sauce on them. If you want to miso soup, I would recommend the misoshiru (traditional miso soup) rather than akadashi (red miso). The second one is a bit more salty and the traditional one has more subtle flavors. Skip the rolls  a bit too soft for my taste and the pickles are quite strong. The starters for omakase were a great way to ease one into the more elaborate nigiris. The sesame tofu surprised me a bit with a nutty overtone and subtle sweetness. Probably one of the best uncooked version of tofu I have ever tasted. The vegetable dish was delicate and light. The peach Panna cotta was fabulous. Not too sweet and not too acidic. Beautifully presented. Just the right creamy/airy balance with quite a bit of depth in the flavor. The black cod and the tempura were solid. modern japanese, fresh sushi, and comfort.  Modern wooden interior with a bright and cozy feel. None of the boring dim lit jazz feeling that too many sushi places go for. Uni chawanmushi is amazing, rich dashi broth with fish, shiitake, mochi and uni on top. This is a mid $ range sushi place but it's magic bc the rice is so good and rightly proportioned for each piece of nigiri. I had the buttered snow carb and chutoro nigiri and a mentaiko temaki. Chu toro alone is underrated and should be looked into more. It's better IMO than otoro bc it is less greasy and maintains the tunas true flavor. Sitting at the bar allows you to see the care and preparation that goes into each piece of sushi. Everything on the menu besides sushi is also great and warming, making the whole selection and experience awesome. Parking is miserable, but I would struggle again to eat at wako. Dining at Wako Sushi is an experience in itself and was probably the closest I could get to the Jiro's and Sushi Dai's of Japan. The owner and sushi chef puts so much care into everything he does, and will go into great lengths to tell you about where each ingredient comes from. I went with the seven course omakase, which was really the best way to get a good sampling of the menu and their fish specials. The meal starts off with a small plate that comes with three components. The plate was probably one of the most beautifully composed plates I've seen, built around the theme of autumn. First is a housemade sesame tofu with a tiny dot of wasabi on top, and the texture was a lot creamier than most tofu. Next was a roasted eggplant slice made to look like a tree stump that was covered with a delicious sauce. Finally, a piece of kombucha squash was carved into the shape of a leaf and roasted just right. All of the flavors were simple and clean, but it was the perfect way to pique my appetite. The next course was sashimi, which was served with a bit of lemon zest that really complemented the fish. The best piece was the king salmon, generously sliced and extremely fresh. To round out the appetizers, the tempura plate was the most substantial and further showed the creativity of the chefs. The matsutake mushroom and shishito pepper tempura were relatively standard, but the mackerel was first encrusted with rice cracker and then fried in tempura batter. It gave the tender fish an amazing crunch on the outside, adding both flavor and texture. The main grilled course was served in between the nigiri servings, and the day's special was a potato crusted salmon with seasonal vegetables. The salmon was essentially marinated in a potato puree that really softened the fish, and then it was topped with chestnut, green bean, and carrot. The dish was somehow a complete dish all combined into one piece. The seven pieces of nigiri is really the most unique part of the omakase, with each piece served one at a time, with wasabi and soy sauce already carefully painted onto the nigiri in order to avoid any customer drowning their fish in soy sauce and wasting the flavor. The best piece was the toro, or the fatty tuna belly. It's the most buttery piece of fish, and I loved the rice to fish ratio. They're definitely not trying to fill you up on carbs, leaving you plenty of room to really enjoy the fish. Wako has also brought upon my appreciation for uni. I've never really had good uni before this meal, and the uni nigiri with the shiso leaf tucked in between the rice was perfect. The brine y flavor wasn't overwhelming, but I still got a great flavor of the ocean. Another highlight was the crab nigiri, which was so tender. It was a simple bite, but the perfect way to highlight the crab. The meal is finished off with a housemade strawberry mousse, maintaining that light quality that connected the entire omakase. The fresh strawberry chunks made it refreshing, and the mousse itself wasn't at all heavy or creamy. They also serve a complimentary piece of chocolate that they also make themselves, finishing off with a bit of decadence that you didn't realize you wanted after an amazing meal. Wako Sushi is without a doubt one of my favorite Japanese spots in San Francisco, and I highly recommend it to anyone, sushi lover or not! Enjoy some expertly cut fish and delectable small plates. Koji marinated grilled King Salmon was suburb as were all the mounds of perfectly temped rice with slivers of flesh atop. No other cuisine pays such great attention to details, so just let Atsushi and Tomo take care of you. They will. Hello Wako! To me you are Maruya in the mission minus the big bill! I went here couple days ago and I had a late lunch around pm and went in around  so my friend and I decided to opt for the smaller course Omakaze. Before our official course meal started, we ordered a SEASONAL mushroom soup  this mushroom grows in Japan (also seattle and canada apparently) only under pine trees and because they grow and are at optimal in taste during this time, Wako only offers this soup in Oct/Nov months. Their smaller Omakaze menu doesn't change, but they will change up their menu close to quarterly basis for their bigger Omakaze. Courses:#: Tofu and salad Tofu was super soft (possibly home made) but a bit bland and wasn't too special for me. #: Miso glazed sea bass Pretty good but it's not unique to Wako and there isn't anything phenomenally outstanding#:  Nigiri Beautifully made and very tasty! I have to say. . the rice is better at Maruya but the cut of the fish and how it is prepared is exceptional! I LOVED IT. My favorite was (and if you don't do omakaze try this at least) red snapper with cherry blossom leaf, salt and lemon. It melted in my mouth and I think I had a tear in my eye. ;) #: Finished with red miso soup which was great and unique. #: mini home made chocolateI highly recommend it and it will not break your bank. Outstanding overall in taste, presentation, service and thoughtfulness behind the meal. My hubby and I went here on a whim last night, after being so busy at work and not remembering to find a decent reso for our anniversary. This has been book marked for quite sometime but due to the mixed reviews and higher price point, havent had a chance to take a leap of faith to go just yet. . . . until last night!We both opted for the four course omakase, consisting of other reviewer's similarly served items:) house made tofu with wasabi, dashi stock & seasonal vegetables with bamboo and chestnut refreshing, a good starter, but best housemade tofu by far is still raku in las vegas. ) grilled black cod fish cooked to perfection, one of the better cod's ive ever had, no bones like previous reviews, excellent and buttery!) nigiri korea halibut, chinook salmon with yuzu gelee, bluefin tuna marinated in jalopeno so, pike mackeral, kani with crab butter, seared hokkaido scallop ) red miso soup with himeki mushrooms. Good shari (rice) to fish ratio, edomae style sushi where they paint on the sauce so you dont need soysauce. Everything was very fresh, and delicious favorites were the bluefin tuna marinated in jalopeno soy, so flavorful, and the tuna a very good quality grade tuna. Scallop was also high on the radar, considering normally I dont like scallop, this says a lot. The searing added a good texture to the normally mushy scallop. . . delish!add ons to make our belly full!A wagyu nigiri, x  $ a pop, but totally worth it. Beef comes cooked (seared I think so eat it while its warm) buttery & so tender$ hokkaido uni chawanmushi,  almost as good as aki san at sushi sho in el cerrito! except this one was highighted due to the hokkaido uni included inside! so precious and yummy$ ankimo  the best ankimo weve ever had. Most ankimos have the gritty taste in the middle, but this one was SUPER smooth, velvety like foie. OMG!fried mackeral fish bone  on the house, one of our favs$ tamago so good, get it last for dessert, not a traditional tamago but has hints and notes of vanilla or coffee, almost like cake!$ matcha daifuku house made mochi with redbean and matcha inside. heavenlyblueberry panna cotta $  good, not mind blowing, mild tasting like most japo sweetsgrilled hokke $ this grilled fish was such a pleasant surprise. Its a grilled fish filet with bones, grilled over charcoal. You can tell the care the cook used to grill this fish to perfection, its normally a ""dry cured"" fish and they grill it so it comes hot, but it was the most moist and delicately seasoned fish. Comes with a side of yam. so delicious and healthy. Hubby is generally a hater of small foods, and was pleasantly surprised at the japo chefs behind the counter. ( I thought they were chinese owned) He said overall the quality and presentation was great, and tomosan the main chef you can tell he cares a lot about his restaurant, the customer experience and thought is put behind each and every bite and it shows. $ out the door with  small asahi beer. experience, priceless! not necessarily a normal day type of meal since it is pricey but for those days you want to splurge. . . . for those haters who gave it  or  starts and complained, sorry yall but you dont know what good traditional japanese food is supposed to be about. go eat your jive ass rolls elsewhere in the marina =) Dainty, tiny little overpriced portions.  Extremely limited selection of fish. The fish itself is not bad, but there is much better around for more reasonable prices.  Other reviewers seem to love this place, maybe I am missing something??Nah.

I just ordered some small plates and ngiri off the menu. The house made tofu was ok. I had one at Raku in Vegas before, which I liked, but this wasn't the same/as good. The raw squid was NO BUENO though. It was like in this bitter sauce. The pieces of ngiri are a bit more expensive than what I'm used to in Seattle. $ $ sure, but I got some tuna belly, uni for $ each! That's pretty hefty! The quality was pretty good, but not my favorite spot or anything. I ended up spending ~$ w/ tax/tip. Been there more than  times already . tomo さん is one of the best sushi chef in the Bay Area . never get disappointed . not even once . always enjoy the service and food there. always make a reservation before you go Thank you Wako for a wonderful, top notch dining experience!  My first visit will definitely not be my last.  Looking forward to retuning sooner than later.  I've really fallen in love this place!  I usually stay away from Clement St. bc parking is such a hassle.  For Wako, I will make the trek across town and deal with it.  It's worth it!   The other half and I arrived at pm on Saturday evening, having made a reservation.  The waitress immediately lead us to the sushi bar where we met Atsushi san and Tomo san.  The sushi bar seats , making it a very intimate experience.  Throughout the service, the patrons at the sushi bar talked and toasted with Atsushi san and Tomo san.  They were so personable and made us laugh with their lighthearted conversations.  They introduced themselves to everyone and asked us our names.  It was a joy to watch them as masters of their craft of preparing authentic sushi by showcasing knife skills and displaying culinary creativity.  We even got to practice speaking a little bit of Japanese with Atsushi san.      Wako is a small space with a pleasant, modern sheik ambiance to admire.  The wood sided and tiled walls are simple and classy.  You can appreciate the thought that was put into designing the interior.  Besides the sushi bar seating, there are small tables available as well.  The service is impeccable.  Besides having Tomo san and Atsushi san taking care of all the sushi bar patrons, all of the waitresses are incredibly attentive, professional and friendly as well.  Whenever a cooked course came out of the kitchen, the waitress would go into detail on what she was serving us and teach us how to eat them.  I really appreciated the extra effort.  Our plates were removed promptly.  Our glasses were constantly being refilled even if they were still half filled.     The other half and I wanted to try an array of what Wako had to offer, so we both ordered the  course omakase ($ pp).  It included  small plates,  pcs sashimi,   bincho grill,  tempura,  pcs nigiri, miso soup and dessert.  I won't go into detail about everything that we ate, but I will confirm that everything was exceptional!  In terms of quality, presentation and taste   stars for sure!  I've never had such exceptional tempura.  All the cooked dishes were simply amazing.  Grade A fish selection was melt in your mouth goodness.  They also have real miso soup offered in white and red.  We tried one of each and they were equally delicious.  The omakase was filling and we certainly great value for the price.  Our total tab of  omakases and an order of hot sake ($) came out to $. We already plan to return to try the beef tasting course.  Next time, we'll opt to order sashimi and nigiri on the fly.  The market selection changes daily, so this will surely keep us coming back.  Also, will be happy to see Tomo san and Atsushi san!  Wako is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood!  I wish you continued success and hope Wako is here to stay for a long time. this is my new favorite sushi restaurant in the city. amazing service, ambience, food, presentation. my new spot. [heart] Although the name sounds a tad awkward in English, Wako is definitely a place to go and go again. I know Tomo (the Chef) from his years with Sanraku. Here he truly delivers a top notch experience. I truly felt in a restaurant in Japan. Style, simple elegance, essential design in the food. He even remembered my name when greeted me. I took the most expensive Omakase menu because I trust him.  I got blown away. Take a look at the pictures and you will fully understand. The best sushi I've ever eaten, and I eat a lot  of sushi! A lovely place to eat and very friendly staff. So pleased we happened across it. Will definitely revisit. My experience with Wako is good.  Came here with  others and service is there.  We paid $/pp with drinks.  Wako is good but not great comparing to few other places in san francisco.   I believe the reason is the quality of the fish.  They charge quite low for omakase and it was very fulfilling.    The size of their courses are huge comparing to others.   If we didnt spend that much on drinks, the bill will be around $/pp even with a la carte added.   For the price,  this is one of the hest omakase theme sushi restaurant in sf.  My favorite is the homemade tofu. . . reminds me of the tofu I've had in kyoto.  Will recommend for friends and will come back as well! I would love to give this restaurant more stars! It just recently opened, but I have been here twice already. Both of the times, they went above and beyond my expectations. My family and I got the  course meal for the two times we were here. I believe it was $ for a  course meal, but let me tell you, IT WAS WELL WORTH IT! Dish # was a three part appetizer: sesame tofu, mushroom medley, and okra and shishito pepper tempura. # maguro and seared hamachi sashimi # kyoto style grilled belt fish # hirame tempura # seven different nigiri sushi # miso soup # dessert. We also got chawanmushi in addition. It was the best chawanmushi I've ever had in the bay area. It was $ and it had all sorts of things in it which included a fat piece of uni, white fish tasted like tai fish (not sure), snow crab, and it was just a whole lot of YUM. Not only does the food taste good, I love their presentation. It makes the meal enjoyable through the palate as well as the eyes. I know this place will never disappoint. If you are thinking about trying it out, you should do it soon because it just opened and it's already super busy. Weekends are pretty much reservations only because of their limited seating. Tuesday  Called at :pm to make a reservation for Sunday at :pm. Very accommodating over the phone. Please do make sure that you call during their reservation acceptance hrs. On Saturday, I had to call in to make a last minute change to add  more people to the party. Again, they made it happen and we sat at the sushi bar. Our pleasure and first time was given to Tomo san who serves around the corner are of the sushi bar. Tomo san started joking with us when he found out that one person was late. He said, ""Is the person here? Looking for parking?"" I said, ""yes"". He said, ""oh no. . . Good luck!"" hahaha! The friend ended up spending  mins looking for parking. They didn't rush us to order since our timeframe was blocked off specifically for us to enjoy the dinner. Our party for  did the  course omakase for $/head. Seven Course  small plates (), sashimi (pcs. ) bincho grill (), tempura (), nigiri (pcs. ), miso soup, dessert. The four piece sashimi included King Salmon and Hamachi. Honestly, nothing special for this plate. . King salmon wasn't buttery or creamy enough. Just wasn't a big wow factor for this. I'm going to skip the grill stuff and the tempura stuff. Right down to the nigiri, because this is what I like about the place. Best fish of the day is what's this is all about. No soy sauce beyond this point. Everything was lightly prepped without heavy taste. This is where you find out if the fish is fresh or not. My favorite of the nigiri was the Snow Crab. Very close to what I had in Hokkaido Japan. Then there was scallop which was lightly seared. Very juicy and almost melted in my mouth (like tofu, but it has a nice caramel scallop taste). Then it was the toro. . . and finishing the authentic Hokkaido Uni. You can actually see that the box had hokkaido sticker on it. Very sweet! We also had a drink with Tomo san. . Be sure to order up the Banana Beer that they have. Nothing better than drinking up with the sushi chef and talking about food. Tomo said he loved izakaya's in San Mateo area.   ~Note~We requested one of the omakase to have more seared and more cooked items since our friend wasn't a big raw fish eater. Tomo san was nice and served up some specials for her. He made sure that each item was okay and that she liked what was served. Wish the server were more prompted on refilling tea. We had to ask for a pot since we kept asking for refills. If I were to do it again, I would do  course meal, use the $ difference and order some different stuff on the menu. You might get more bang for the buck if your a nigiri person. Oh, don't miss out on the housemade dessert and the chocolate. seriously though. . on a serious note. . if yelp was to let us rate a  star for one place and only one place. . itll be this place right here. came here for the boyfriend's birthday and ohh my gosh. . let me tell you it is so worth it. this place is very tiny. its half the size of my room. . . lol jkjkmake sure to sit at the bar if you choose to get the  course dinnerfor a small girl, i have a very big appetite and this place not only made me fulfullingly full but i enjoyed my experience here. like really enjoyed it. i have NEVER ever went to a sushi restaurant and experienced the freshness of seafood like this place. for a lil less than$ for  people. i wouldnt mind doing this every month if they were closer to methe sushi chefs are such sweethearts! they really made me experience incredible. thanks for everything Neither my husband nor I can think of anything we didn't like.  It's a pretty traditional, small sushi place.  Not much else to say than that.  It's definitely pricey, but what good sushi place isn't? Wako has woken me up from my slumber of finding lackluster Japanese restaurants. Sure my wallet took a $ hit, but it was worth it. Since I'm kind of a food snob, I went ahead and chose my own dishes. Like creating my own Lego creation, rather than settling for their Omakase. Here's a rundown of what I had and my opinion, though I'm sure you know it was great since you've already seen the  stars. negi toro : Fresh and deliciousakadashi / red miso, sesame tofu, nameko, mitsuba: Tasted like a hearty broth, an acquired taste since it is red miso, but liked it nonethelessgoma dofu / house made sesame tofu: Great homemade dishankimo ponzu: Yummy with that delcious glazekaisen sunomono: Crunchy and refreshingen chawanmushi: My favorite out of everything. Digging into the various layers was like finding edible treasure at every turnkisetsu no kakiage: fresh but passable. I really wanted more of a shrimp tempura dish instead of a fried pancake thing. All the sushi I bought was super fresh. I ordered one of each seasonal piece nigiri style. (See pic of the menu and of my sushi attached). Each piece was around $ $ and was as good as my other favorite Japanese restaurants. The blueberry panna cotta was small, but had a good creamy texture, and a tart blueberry aftertaste. We enjoyed it immensely. The service was great, and the teapots were cool. Steel, and each table had a different one. Reservations strongly recommended, as we saw people getting turned away left and right. Would I come back again?Do fish need water?Hell yeah! I have conflicting feelings on my experience at Wako. While the food is high quality I feel like the environment and service aren't up to par. Wako is definitely a small restaurant. The center of the restaurant is a sushi bar. Table seating is relegated to about five. Even though the restaurant is very small it is easily a five dynamite stick experience. I've been to party sushi restaurants that are quieter. It's a strange dynamic when you're eating high quality food with the soundscape of a super bowl tailgate. The food is broken down into grilled pates, appetizers, small plates, rolls, and nigiri. This isn't a cheap restaurant. Each piece of nigiri goes for $. But the nigiri does melt in your mouth. The fish has a really high level of luscious fattiness to it. Two of our party, including me, opted for the pre fixe menu. They don't specifically state what you'll receive. It just says the amount of nigiri, small plates, etc. The prix fixe menu is a relatively good value, I think it'd be best to order exactly what you want and adjust as needed. While the food is good overall I feel like it's lacking a bit of that ""oh"" factor. The one standout dish is the chawanmushi. Service is questionable. Even though there seem to be many servers, the experience felt like an ordeal for both staff and customers. One of the difficulties stems from the number of plates. There are so many plates! For the nigiri they even combine customer's orders on one plate. Then the waiters have to discuss each and every piece to the customer. I feel like the waiters would have a much easier time if the restaurant weren't so cramped. We were never really checked up on, but it was mainly because they were so busy trying to bring us our plates and take away the ones we were finished with. _High caliber Japanese cuisine that you'll most likely forget about thirty minutes after leaving. Chaotic service and atmosphere. Is the food worth the hassle? I'm not sure but it's great on its own. Incredible! Best sushi in SF that I've had (or maybe anywhere?)I walked by this place and the decor was so clean and wood y that I needed to come here. DO set a reservation because every single seat is taken! They fill it up to maximum capacity!We ordered  seven course omakase and some separate orders of nigiri. Everything was so fresh and perfect. Service was amazing  our server was attentive and even told me what not to eat (there was an odd plant on the plate). She refilled my teapot like x. The dishes are also very unique (vs. other sushi places that are a bit generic). I need to come back asap. Oddly, they do not serve any soda. . . I came here a couple weeks ago without a reservation. Unfortunately they were all booked up, but one of the ladies there was nice enough to offer us a table if we could eat in an hour. Since we were there already, we thought, why not try it?! We were sat at a table. Since we only had an hour, I couldn't get the seven course omakase and settled for the four course. The roommate got the chirashi sushi. Each came with the following. Four course ($)   small plates,  bincho grill,  pcs nigiri and miso soupChirashi sushi ($)   small plate, assorted fish of the day on sushi rice, miso soupI really enjoyed the  piece nigiri that came with my omakase. Each piece melted in my mouth!  And I loved that each piece has it's own sauce brushed on it! So good! The small plates and bincho grill were good as well, but I didn't love it as much as the nigiri. The roommate wasn't really impressed with his omakase. He said the fish quality was average and the sushi rice wasn't very good. His family owns a sushi restaurant so he probably knows better than me. But he thought it wasn't worth the money. I didn't really agree with him, but he have very different tastes. I also got a glass/cup of sake for $. I told our server I like dry sakes and this one was perfect! I don't remember the name of the sake, but my receipt said IZUMI so I guess that's what it was called. I really wish we had more time since I wanted to try so much more! Since this restaurant is so small, I think it would be smarter for them to not take reservations. That way they wouldn't have an empty table for over an hour waiting for a reserved party. I probably would have ordered A LOT of food if I had more time since I really wanted to try a bunch of things. But it was really nice of them to fit us in. A good  star experience! Hands down, the best sushi I've had in SF. Tomo, who used to star at Sanraku, takes it to another level here. I am very picky about which nigiri I eat, but I had faith in Tomo's mastery and ended up enjoying fish I previously hated  like ankimo (monkfish liver) and pretty much any white fish in the sea. It's expensive and you won't find any dragon rolls or any mayo slathered Americanized stuff (which I actually found to be refreshing for a change), but you won't find better sushi in the City. Plus, Wakako U. (aka Wako) loves the name!I used to complain that San Francisco was something of a second rate sushi town. No more! If you have every seen ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi"" and wanted to experience it. . . this is the place.   Recently we went with dear friends who own their own restaurant and had heard good things about this place.  All four of us sat at the bar and had an incredible evening. The service, environment and food far exceeded our expectations.  Each piece of sushi was presented upon preparation and was not only a visual pleasure but an incredible tantalizing delight. I had a wonderful and memorable dinner at Wako on a Saturday night. It's a small restaurant stuck into a crowded part of Clement Street, so find it and make a reservation. You won't want to miss this. We enjoyed fresh butterfish and sweetfish nigiri sushi, plus several other items from the menu, which changes daily depending on what fish they can get as fresh as they can. Among other things, we had the roasted seafood and vegetables, which were served in an abalone shell. I brought my girlfriend there for her birthday dinner, and while we were not late for our reservation, we didn't have time to go home and dress appropriately for our dinner. I was dressed in long shorts and felt embarrassed to go into such a classy restaurant, but the waitpersons could not have been more gracious and accommodating to us. Thank them  for such a wonderful and memorable dinner. We enjoyed every taste and dish we had, but especially enjoyed the black cod with eggplant, and loved the grilled fish collar, which is sometimes butterfish but happened to be salmon that night. What an elegant, gracious, lovely meal. What a neighborhood gem!  Be sure to make a reservation, a couple was turned away at opening.  Choose the sushi bar, you'll get all the perks and attention you need.  Definitely go with the  course option for $.  You get the  nigiri if you go with the  course also, but it's not the top tier stuff.  LOVED: housemade tofu tempura fig aji aji fried bone salmon nigiri toro chawanmushi, perfect, crab pieces embedded throughout and mochi choco bites at the endWould skip next time: uni crabRequested, but not available: kohada chutoroAdd ons: gindara, beautifully buttery and smoky Drink: try the akitabare, smooth.  Tea comes in a cast iron pot, really heavy, be careful.  If you use your fingers for the nigiri  no finger towels, use your napkin. Improvement: timing of the courses, we had grilled items at the same time as nigiri and before I was even finished with the first course of tofu, tempura fig and veg, the sashimi was waiting for me.  Made me feel rushed and didn't feel like I was doing the food justice, as nigiri should be eaten immediately.  Not only do you get the savory aspect for $, you get dessert & little choco bites. Highly recommended, a bit below the other edomae choices that have sprouted up around town, and leans more on kaiseki, but high quality and supreme service. Made a reservation yesterday. Got in today. After eating, made another reservation in  weeks! (YES that says a lot for me) Probably my first really authentic, traditional ""sushi"" experience. Got the omakase  course with extra appetizers and nigiri and of course lots of alcohol! I must say everything looked delicious and it tastes just as pretty as it looks! If you lahh dat uni, damn their Hokkaido uni. . . So fresh, so god! That sesame tofu. . . Godness, I can die and go to heaven. I lovee tofu in general and their tofu was seriously the tastiest I've ever had! Service was excellent and the atmosphere was comfy and homey! See you in  weeks! A suggestion  make reservations. . . I saw them turn away all walk ins. Do it now or regret ever. :) When I finally spend the time to write a yelp review, then the experience must have been mind blowing.   I eat alot of sushi, and this tops any sushi restaurant in the bay. I was a fan of the sushi chef and owner, Tomo, when he worked over at Sanraku in the metreon building.  He is both a fantastic chef and food artist.  When I heard he left to open his own restaurant, I knew it was going to be great. At Wako, I was a single diner, so they were able to fit me in at the sushi bar, but reservations are highly recommended as many people were turned away at the door.   It's fun to sit at the sushi bar because you can see these two chefs make their magic.    Tomo would explain each course to me, and the waitresses would also tell me where the fish came from.  It was either locally caught, like the salmon and black cod, or it came from Japan.   They also said that they make the wasabi there, from fresh wasabi root.    Their were two Japanese women sitting next to me, and they were both telling me that this restaurant was very authentic.  I believe them. I went with the  course meal.  Everything melted in my mouth.  EVERYTHING! So if you want to treat your mouth to something orgasmic, go to Wako. Go here. Now. Before it becomes impossible to get in. After the Chronicle wrote this week that: "". . . we were a little late to the trend, [but] Japanese flavors are taking center stage in Bay Area restaurants"" we decided to try one of the new, more authentic sushi restaurants that opened recently. We wandered into Wako not knowing what to expect, but with each bite and every attentive bit of service, the dreary mood from the wind storm outside faded away. They should rename this place ""Transcendent Sushi. "" I'm not exaggerating. I will remember our dinner at Wako as my first true sushi experience and one of the best meals of my life. The fish was the highest quality, the preparations were impeccable, and the entire omakase menu was perfectly thought out. We were also thrilled to learn that the chefs / owner came from Sanruku. We recognized some of the recipes (like his luscious sesame tofu), but the food was at a whole other level. This is a joyful place, in a restrained and beautiful way, and I can not wait to go back. We're making our next reservation so that we have a return visit to look forward to. I realized that EDOMAE is a new trend in SF!  In Japan, Edomae is a kind of niche style which chef usually put the sweet sauce on sushi. The sauce here was a bit more salty so I do not have to put additional soy source at all. This style is good fit with Omakase because I do not have to worry about what kind of sauce I should put on to each sushi. Anyway I am so happy to have Edomae in SF! I had high expectations eating at Wako for my first time since my boyfriend came here before me and told me it was amazing (he has high expectations for Japanese food, so no doubt I would not be disappointed). This place is a tiny yet elegant restaurant. We made reservations  minutes before luckily they were able to make it since it was a Saturday and well half an hour before is kind of ridiculous lol but we gave it a shot. Once we were seated, it started getting really busy and the wait was getting longer and longer, so definitely make a reservation in advance. The hostess and wait staff are super friendly and helpful. We had an assortment of nigiris. The toro and unagi were my top favorites.  Definitely coming back ASAP Delicious, traditional Japanese dishes, wonderfully prepared and presented in a cozy but casual yet elegant setting. Excellent and friendly service. We got the  course omakase ($) and enjoyed each course. Stand outs were the house made sesame tofu and the tasty sashimi / nigiri. Make a reservation since the restaurant is small. You won't be disappointed."
Cocotte|4.0|French in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|246|-1|4.07818930041|" I would give this place .  stars. It's a very good place with excellent service and solid French food. We had the duck platter appetizer that was just perfect and what we wanted. We then had the squid. I never order squid but the waiter told us it was special and it really was, an explosion of tastes and something different. HIGHLY recommended even though this place is known for their rotisserie chicken. We also had the rabbit with homemade pasta and I really loved it. Their desserts are excellent, we had the banana creme brulee whcih is not to be missed and the profiteroles (very good but not as amazing as the banana). The wines were good and so was the port. The only dish that was bland was the cauliflower cocotte. Anyone with French roots would be disappointed I was really looking forward to it and it was not up to par. I really like that it is a small, intimate space, it has a lot of character and feels homey which is great because I don't like stuffy French places and sometimes you have to settle for that if you want good, authentic food. Also, great romantic atmosphere. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed ourselves and loved the location, very quaint neighborhood. Parking can be tricky so leave time to find a space. Made a reservation to this restaurant via OpenTable, having this being my first time using OpenTable and visiting this restaurant. Host seated us and spoke very good French and English. Turned out our host was also our waiter, who happened to be very respectful, polite, and very eager for our visit. He was very knowledgeable of the menu, and knew how to address any of our questions appropriately. I first ordered the house espresso and the miss ordered a glass of French wine, both were outrageously delicious. The miss ordered a Rabbit pasta, which I have to say was very very good; it did not have the 'gamey' texture. I had the beef wellington with a complementary seasoned marrow next to the wellington; both were off the charts. I ordered a goat cheese gratin on the side which was a perfect choice to pick on the side. It's somewhat of an open kitchen. The chef cooks/prepares his dishes in an orientation where he is able to see his restaurant and watch his customers's amazing reaction to his food that is just extraordinary. Expect a heavy bill, but don't let the numbers intimidate you! This is one of those places that you have to visit once in your life. I wish I could give  stars to this gem in the wall. This place is called Cocotte, known for their side dishes. Please come here with any type of expectations. I assure you that they will be met, if not exceeded. I plan to come here again next year with my now fiancee, of whom I proposed to later that night in the restaurant after I took the bill. Cocotte, thank you for the exemplary service and authentic French cuisine, we will be back!  stars for the excellent service I received from everybody at this restaurant. I took my boyfriend here on our  year anniversary after reserving just hours in advance, and they ended up putting us in a very cozy corner exclusive for couples. I loved the ambiance of Cococette, as it reminds me of dining out in Europe. . . it's intimate, warm, and cozy. Food and drink were priced very reasonably given the quality of ingredients. I ordered the free range chicken and my bf the squid, and we loved it. Probably some of the best chicken I've ever had!If you're looking to do something romantic, they definitely go above and beyond in ensuring you'll have a memorable evening. Shared a few small plates and a bottle of wine here with a friend for a light dinner. We were accommodated without a reservation on a Thursday evening which was fairly busy. We shared the lobster salad, mussels and duck platter. Everything was well executed and very tasty. The wine list was quite nice as well and we had a nice Spanish wine. The close quarters make it a bit hard to hear and very intimate but somehow it works out. Service is fast and friendly. I give this place  stars, based solely on their rotisserie chicken. To illustrate how much I love this dish: One time , My husband and I made dinner plans and Of course I planned to order the chicken because duh, it's my favorite. I was looking forward to it the whole afternoon. But then when we got there, they were all out!! I was so disappointed and just felt deflated and I just stared quietly at my plate for a couple of minutes. Seriously. Then I ordered my second favorite dish from this place, which is the sea bass. It's really good, but it can't take place of the chicken.  Sigh. Cheese platter and lobster salad. . . perfection! A glass of Oyster Sauv Blanc goes nicely. . . Then Beef Wellington and Coq a Vin paired with the City Cellar Cab. . . heaven! Cocotte takes you to Europe without the airfare! I initially read about this French spot on Yelp then saw it featured on ""Check, Please Bay Area,"" and discovered that this two year old restaurant is much better than the average bistro (and reasonably priced for generous portions) even here in San Francisco. Splurge on a glass of their better champagne, then their Duck Platter, an exquisite housemade charcuterie  of rillette, salami, and smoked duck breast. The lobster and beet salad  (heaven on a plate) contained enough meaty chunks of lobster to generously share with my husband. We both ordered the Beef fillet Wellington (rare) with bone marrow which was sublime and shared carrots with french fried onions and creamed horseradish and Brussels sprouts with anchovies. For dessert, we devoured a lovely tarte tatin more like a baked apple with treacle on a plate of crisscrossed creme anglaise and each had a single shot of espresso in  elegant demitasse cups. The service was exemplary and Yuri, the manager really was lovely and attentive, even giving helpful suggestions on food pairing. Also, the backround reggae music, open kitchen , and slow paced environment really made us feel like we were savoring the experience and not just out for dinner. . . The whole ambiance reminded us of when we spent a summer in Europe really. I was searching for a place that served Beef Wellington.  I hadn't had it for many years & few places (hardly any that I could fine) offered it.  That's how I came upon Cocotte!  In addition, Yelpers seem to like it too. I made reservations for the family.   We walked there as it is very close to where I live.   It's a very small & cute restaurant.   If you like lots of space between tables & like ample size tables while dining  this won't fit your comfort zone!  Tables are very small & not that well spaced apart between you & tables to your left or right.  First, our waiter was excellent!  Very attentive, but not over us every minute.  The wait staff was also great!  We ordered a Endive salad & Mussels to start.  I loved the salad.  I'm not a Mussels fan so can't speak to it.  My son finished it all so he must have loved it!   We ordered my favor  Beef Wellington, the Chicken & Rib Eye.  All the Entrees were excellent, except for the Chicken.  It was good  but it wasn't out of this world.   The Beef Wellington did not disappoint me & my kids really enjoyed the Rib Eye & Wellington.  We traditionally share our meals so we can enjoy everything.  We had the carrots, cauliflower & sprouts as veggie sides.  We enjoyed them all except for the baby carrots.  It just was okay. Cheese cake to finish off the meal. Overall, we really enjoyed this little place.  Great food, great service!  What more can you expect? The food and staff are amazing! Super friendly and very helpful in every way. The drinks were kept full and the food was good. They had things on the menu I had never experienced, particularly with duck. My dad really loved that, and the rest of the family just aren't huge duck people but appreciated it. The cheese tray though was amazing!! The sauces are artistically made with great pride. You can see the chef working so hard!! I had the sea bass which had a Greek influence it felt with the Cuscus (sp?) and spices. Again  the dill sauce was heavenly! My husband loved that and his potatoes  which were amazing. The only negatives were it was loud, parking is hard to come by (but that's true anywhere), and we missed out on dessert. The latter is our own fault though because we had so much fun eating the appetizer and meal that we didn't have room! Would love to go back for more. :) Ate here last night for the first time.  We really enjoyed ourselves.  The Beef Wellington was great, as was the Coq a Vin, and the Rabbit with pasta.  The salads, including the lobster salad were wonderful.  The Banana Crème Brulee was to die for, and the Tart Tatin  was perfect, and the Profiteroles were great also.  The restaurant was small which made it a great atmosphere, and we loved the atmosphere of the neighborhood with the trees and the cable car line.  The service was very good we had no complaints about the speed of the service, and our waiter was very very friendly.  We want to return to try the chicken, which looked and smelled wonderful.  The only complaints were that we had to ask for new wine glasses when we changed wines, and we were not given new silverware with each new course, but other than that LOVED the place, and can't wait to return.  We highly recommend it.  We are big fans of this new find. Had a really really good meal here! The service was fantastic, and the food was good all around. It's been about a month, and unfortunately I don't remember everything we had. I remember the charcuterie platter was really good quality, and the brussels sprouts was fantastic! We had the beef Wellington with bone marrow and I think the rabbit ragu  both were really good. And finally the banana creme brûlée was surprisingly good. Creme brûlée is one of those few things for me where I almost always prefer plain ole traditional. So I figured I wouldn't like this one. . . but it was good! Will definitely be back to try the chicken. I went to Cocotte this past Friday with a group of .  We arrived on time but had to wait at the bar for about  minutes before we were seated.  The restaurant is quite small, so the wait was understandable for a larger table. We ordered a bottle of Spanish red wine to start and later had a California cab.  They were both great, and the restaurant has a great selection of wines, particularly reds. To start, I had the Gruyere Cheese and Thyme Churros (/).  These were served with a horseradish creme fraiche, which I really liked.  The churros themselves tasted similar to mozzarella sticks but were much more subtle and with a much softer, less stringy cheese.  Although I enjoyed the texture of this appetizer, I found the taste to be much too subtle and missing a ""punch"" that I expected.  My tablemates agreed. For the main dish, I had the squid with forbidden rice, which was just amazing (. /).  I love squid ink, and this dish did not disappoint.  The rice was cooked properly, the squid was soft and flavorful, and the beurre blanc was rich and a little tart.  The dish was wonderful, but definitely on the heavier side.  I was not able to finish this dish, but I really enjoyed it. My friends had some other dishes, some of which I noticed that they loved.  A few of my dining mates shared the duck platter, which they actually devoured.  Another friend had the Beef Filet Wellington, which he really enjoyed.  The dish came with a side of marrow, which he raved about. I really enjoyed my first visit to Cocotte.  Overall, a tasty French restaurant with a good selection of reds. Cocotte really has it all. It is a delightful place to eat because the food is prepared with loving care. The wait staff is caring and helpful and we were surrounded by many others eating quietly and enjoying it all just as we did. Although I imagine the food comes from the same kitchen, Cocotte Sud is just not as successful for us as this charming place. Food: If you are going to Cocotte for the first time then you have to order the Rotisserie Chicken! It is so flavorful and tasty! You can order a / chicken or full chicken. I will say my petite friend and I ordered a / chicken to share and we politely fought over the delicious meat and agreed that next time we'd order a whole chicken (it is just that good!). The chicken comes with sauces on the side which I don't think are necessary since the chicken is already so well seasoned for taste. You get a side (or ""cocote"") when you order a chicken which turns out to be a pretty good deal. The Yukon Potato Gratin with Goat Cheese is incredible and one that I can never pass up! I also am a sucker for their French Fries and aoli sauce. Atmosphere: The restaurant is very small. There is a bar where you can sit and enjoy a drink while you wait for your table. It is very odd because some nights it is packed (no reservations available and not a chance to get a table) and other nights you can get a table no problem. I highly recommend making reservations here. Location: Cocotte is located on Hyde Street which is the same street the cable car runs on. If you are visiting and staying in downtown or Fisherman's Wharf you can easily take the Hyde Street Cable Car here for dinner (just make sure to leave enough time). It is a pretty great way to commute to dinner and you can get off right in front of the restaurant. As a heads up, finding parking around the restaurant is not easy. Take Out: Cocotte offers ""Rotisserie To Go"" which is there version of take out and it is awesome! You can call ahead and order a chicken and some sides for a great last minute family dinner. It is reasonably priced for a quality takeout dinner for two given how much food you can order for around $. Heads up that parking is hard to come by in this area and double parking is a big no no because it blocks the Cable Car tracks.  Overall: I give Cocotte a low  for the high quality food that is always well prepared and deliciously flavorful. The food at Cocotte deserves the full five stars, but the service is what gets a two star review. For years my boyfriend has been dying to try Beef Wellington and I'd finally found it as a main stay on Cocotte's menu. I made reservations for an early Thursday evening for my bfs Birthday. We were seated right away and served water by a very nice young man. Then, after moving around the menu, trying to nicely suggest to our waiter, whom we hadn't met yet, that we were ready to order, he finally showed up. After taking our drink order, he arrived after another  minutes with one beautifully poured beer and another that was half foam. My boyfriend nicely asked for a different one, because why would you spend $ on a half a glass of beer? He kindly showed him the glass and the waiter said it was from a bottle, so that's it. That told me that he didn't care, and it was his carelessness in pouring that caused the beer issue. Our food arrived quickly, and it was amazing! The Beef Wellington was everything my boyfriend had hoped for. I'm not sure we saw our waiter again until our table was clear. He asked if we'd like another beer (should've been on the house, considering the other one) but we declined without mentioning why. In all, I felt judged. I felt like our waiter saw myself and my boyfriend as people who scrimped and saved to have a special birthday dinner, and we couldn't know or afford anything on the menu, so why bother. Well sir, that is not the case, and if it were, it shouldn't matter. Treat everyone with the same respect, and give the best service you can, regardless. Customer service is a skill, and one that you choose to only have when a table of two is going to order an entire bottle of wine. Tip of my hat to the chef, but to our waiter, learn how to pour a beer and don't judge a book by it's cover. Fantastic experience. Great service and a really pretty space. We got married at SF city hall on a friday and instead of having a traditional reception we opted for a fancy dinner instead, so we rented out Cocotte for the night and everything was perfect!  All the food was incredible (they let us customize the menu) and the staff were very accommodating.  They didn't give us a time limit and said they would stay open until our guests were done drinking and mingling.  Thank you so much for making our special day so wonderful! Lovely service and amazing rotisserie chicken.  My fiance and I split a whole chicken and we were both full.  Dipping sauces accompanied with chicken was a great touch!  As with most SF restaurants but felt even more so here, seating accommodations were very tight.  Felt like we were on a triple date with the couples sitting on both sides of us.  We will definitely be coming back to this neighborhood treat! If you haven't been, go.  If you have, you know how good it is.  The chicken, ambiance, and service are all worth going. DELICIOUS food! Super nice waiters, and excellent service. Started with the duck platter before moving onto my plate of Coq Au Vin, which was absolutely perfect. For dessert, I shared the banana creme brulee with my boyfriend  I honestly think it was the best creme brulee I've ever had. Had a pm reservations which i got with opentable. com for a birthday party but had to wait an hour :[ because they were just running late, unacceptable. Another great dinner! We sat at the bar again and had the padron peppers with sea salt, Coq au vin, duck confit, and two glasses of wine. Everything was delicious and the service was fantastic. Started with the lobster salad. Really tasty and chucks of lobster but I got a little lobster shell in mine :( Mussels really good. The sauce was great and even better on your bread!Half rotisserie chicken delish especially with the sauces. The green is the best!Potato gratin really creamy and cheesy but not soggyBanana creme brûlée and profiteroles really tastyGreat champagne Very goiod food, all cooked perfectly. I had the beef wellington and i was delciious, nce soft flakey crust and perfectly medium rare. We started with the lobster saald which was quite nice and refreshing as well. nice bottle of wine for the table and my girlfriend got a steak as well. Total was $ a little pricey but worth it. Nice quiet restaurant and cool open kitchen concept. Don't eat often at  $ restaurants, but this one was worth it. Showed up with a reservation and ended up waiting a half hour just to find out they were out of  of their  entrees. We unfortunately left after getting our water because there was nothing my family and I could eat. Delicious meal!! Had the lobster salad to start then the half chicken followed by the banana creme brûlée . Fantastic flavors cool ambiance , quaint small place , handsome employees For the first time I tried French food at this cozy restaurant.  We were celebrating  birthdays and our close friends invited us to one of their favorite places in the city, Cocotte! Our reservation was at : and we checked in,  but our table wasn't ready, so we decided to go across the street for some wine. While we waited we were looking at the wine menu and before you know it, our table was ready :)There were four of us that had to squeeze in a little space, literally our tables were  inches close to the tables next to us. The restaurant was very nice. It was a dressy restaurant,  but was very comfortable. Perfect for a date to remember! For our appetizer we shared the clams and complimentary bread with their olive spread and butter. . . to die for! As we explored their unique and short menu (which makes it much easier to order btw) I decided to order the squid entre. It came with squid ink rice and delicious grilled shrimp,  very good! My friends ordered the rooster,  rabbit pasta and more clams.  It was a nice variety for everyone to try out. Plus we had  bottles of red wine, perfect! The customer service was absolutely the best.  These guys were so polite,  honest and prompt.  Since the restaurant was pretty small and packed, we were still able to get there attention whenever we needed anything.  Definitely give this place a try! There are alot of bars  very close by that are fun to hit up, enjoy! I'm coming back here for the banana creme brulee.  It was like you know what in my mouth. oh, and the food was good too!  I ate a special item on the menu  rabbit with homemade fettuccine. Good service. Good wine. Good ambiance. Good location. What's not to like? Very cute, cozy French restaurant. The service was fantastic and the atmosphere was very nice. The kitchen is open, and although that added a nice touch to the ambiance because the restaurant is so small it made everything very loud. We often had to shout and repeat ourselves to be heard over the noisy kitchen and so many people packed into a small restaurant. I started with the tomato heirloom salad, which was really good. The coq au vin was fantastic. . . Very flavorful and well cooked. Beef Wellington was one of the best I've had, although a tad dry. The banana creme brûlée is a MUST HAVE. The flavors and textures were spot on. The perfect way to end a great meal. We will certainly be back! Watch out for this place!  They will try to upsell you really really badly!  I asked for a $ bottle of wine and our waiter recommended another bottle. Bad on me for not checking out the price but this waiter ended up selling us a $ bottle of wine which we did not realize. During the course of the dinner we ordered another bottle of wine and when the bill came we were shocked. We talked to the waiter who offered to give us a free dessert after he charged us $ on two bottles of wine. We talked to the manager and his response was they don't want piur type in the restaurant and he told us F you . Can't believe that somebody would say that to four people who just spent $ on wine and dinner.  do not go here. They should be putout of business    This is not the way things are done in San Francisco Went here to celebrate a friend's birthday, and I mistakenly made the reservation for the wrong night.  But luckily there were plenty of tables not because it was empty but we were just lucky I guess, because it got full quickly after we were seated.   And the host was nice enough to get us a table right away.  The place is pretty small but it was not cramped, they made it work, it was pretty cozy and intimate actually.  They have nice interior decor and the ambiance is both friendly and very comfortable, I really liked it.  So, the host was very nice, the barkeeper was also nice who was nice enough to recommend the Grimbergen dubbel, which I really liked. It was flavor and almost sweet.  It was really delicious.  The server was also nice, she was patient with me since I'm actually ignorant So, on to the food:Duck platter:duck & sunchoke rillette, duck salami, house smoked duck breast, walnut muffin, red onion pickles, grain mustard.  This is very delicious, I like the rillette the most, it full of flavor yet light and not very rich, which is great in my opinion.  The duck salami is also very good but if I'm forced to choose one, I'll go with rillette.  Good thing it's a platter.  I don't know how they know but the grain mustard is the right condiment.  I took a piece of the walnut muffin and put on rillette, salami, duck breast, the red onion pickles and top if all off with the grain mustard and put them all in my mouth, it's not finesse but it's an explosion of flavors.  Potato gratin with goat cheese:  Very tasty.  Enough said. beef filet wellington:wild mushroom, puff pastry, beef jus.  Never had beef wellington before so I was looking forward to tasting this and it was worth having it here for my first beef wellington.  The beef was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and the pastry was crisp, light and airy, it was great.  It was so good that I finished it in record time, I did not time it but it was pretty fast, my friend was impressed.  Branzini sea bass: Anchovies crust, couscous, sweet' tomato, lemon yogurt & dill  my friend had this but she was forced to share it because I finished my food so fast, I think she felt that I must still be hungry?  So, she gave me a small portion of the dish.  From the amount, I had I can tell it was very good.  I'd have this dish when I return again or maybe I'll have the duck confit.  Oh well, I might have to go back twice. banana creme brulee: Okay, well, if you see the pictures of the after we've inhaled this, you could probably guess it's good, it's not good, it's very good.  Profiterolles: vanilla ice cream, toasted almonds, chocolate sauce  All I can about this is it had ice cream placed inside a crispy, crunchy pastry with chocolate syrup.  The chocolate syrup was just a right amount so it was not drowning in syrup.  I know I said it on all the dishes  it's very good, but that's because it is!Anyway, I am in no way affiliated to this restaurant nor I know anyone who works here, but I was very impressed.  The place is very nice, clean, comfortable, small but layed out perfectly that it did not feel cramped.  The staff are phenomenal, I don't say this a lot because I think staff have to be friendly and nice because it's the nature of their job actually on other establishment they make you feel they're doing you a favor when they serve you, but not here, and I think the staff that were here that night (not sure if there are different staff on a given night) were genuinely nice.  And of course, the main character in this story of this establishment  are the food.  For the dishes we had, they were all delicious.  So, that's why it's a  star review. i was surprised and disappointed by the rotisserie chicken as it had stayed too long in the roaster the day we dined at Cocette (dried out and a little hard).  I am pretty sure that's not normal though because everything else (the 'cocotte') was well executed.  the braised dishes and the duck salumi starter were amazing.  wine is really well chosen and well priced.  it's a nice neighborhood bistro, you know, like to meet friends on a Friday after work, kick off the weekend, nice dinner, nice wine.  Just know it's a noisy bistro atmosphere, so maybe not super romantic date.  AND i think it might be a tough place to bring a large party. i would go back. Undoubtedly the most bizarre experience I have ever had at a restaurant!We selected this place to celebrate the engagement day of my great nephew. The following was our evening:  although informed when booking, the restaurant did not even say congratulations (much less offer anything),  food came we had not ordered. We had great trouble flagging down a waiter to have it removed and given to the right table before it got cold,  several dishes we did order were tepid and had to be rewarmed,  one of us was served the rotisserie chicken  minutes after everyone else was served and half way through their meals no explanation, no apology,   the duck confit entree was so tough it was inedible, and finally,  we were never asked if we wanted something else, told that the problem was we did not have a sharp enough knife, and that we were the first customers to ever complain about the confit. To top it off we were told we ate too much to not charge us. . . . (I promise on my father's grave, we had  bites, one for my husband to initially taste and one for me to confirm his problem!  I still haven't figured out how we could decide it was poorly done with out trying it). I then shared my meal with my husband both of us, of course, left hungry. The waiter  threatened to quit his job if the duck confit was removed from the bill! He is still gainfully employed it wasn't. We gave up, not wanting to have our great nephew's day impacted more by continuing to ask for the item to be removed from the bill. . . . . . . Decent food. Terrible service. Definitely wouldn't come again given the poor experience. Cute small French spot that reminds me of the tiny restaurants you'd walk a few steps down to in SoHo NYC. Solid French dishes but not the best nor the most memorable. But the environment and service was great. Give it some time and I'd probably come back and give it another try. I eat here at least once a month and I've never been disappointed. The menu is simple, the food delicious, the service impeccable and atmosphere relaxed and convivial. I've taken every one from + year old grandmothers to teenagers to Cocotte and all have had a wonderful meal. The menu is great here, you have the get the Rotisserie!! The atmosphere and dining experience is amazing, right off of the cable car line with an elegant and familiar setting that is enhanced with the delicious plate selections and wine. It is apparent that each dish is prepared with care and has a delicate richness. If you like a French cuisine, this is where you will experience traditional elements mixed with an epicurean tongue. They have single dishes prepared individually, like potatoes gratin and other amazing sides to accompany the main course. If you are feeling adventurous there is plenty of options to select, mine being the marrow. I love the farm freshness of this place! There really is something for everyone here, between the rotisserie or seafood, salads and soups selections it is a great spot for a night out. When they have lobster anything on the menu, it is a must have! If there were six stars, I would click it! The restaurant is a bit small, but very charming, and very hospitable. The staff was warm and friendly, and the service was grand. Our server educated us on the menu and suggested great wine pairings for each of us. I ordered the Beef Wellington, which came out rich and flaky and perfectly medium rare. The rotiserie chicken was amazing, too. I know what you're thinking. . . how good can chicken be? This is probably the best rotiserie chicken I've ever had. . . very tender and perfectly seasoned. The sides were excellent, too. This place may is not a high fashion trendy French fusion restaurant. Instead, it is straightforward, honest, traditional food, made with care and served with pride. The next time I come, I intend to order the coq au vin. However, I still think about the wellington, so I guess I'll just have to play it by ear. Wonderful time here. This comfortable little place, wedged into a small space in that very special section of Hyde Street, offers a cozy and relaxing dining experience. Everything we ordered was excellent and served promptly. This place is also a solid  value. No sticker shock here.  Well done! I had an excellent Coq Au Vin here (chicken braised in wine).  It was perfectly braised, tender, and flavorful.  I paired it with some potato gratin, and a glass of their recommended zin.  It was fantastic. My biggest tip here is that the food here is good, simple, and reasonably priced.  But the real deal you get here is with their wines.  I have been here twice, and both times the hosts recommended great wines that were less well known, reasonably priced, but very good.  Do that too when you come here  ask them for wine recommendations, and do exactly that. This is also a cute place for couples' dinners too.  I came here with two other couples, and it was a wonderful evening that was a bang for the buck. I saw Cocette on an episode of Check Please Bay Area.  The food looked pretty good so I decided to check the place out.  Made reservations for dinner on a Wednesday night.  The place was (surprisingly) pretty empty when we got there at :PM.  We were seated immediately.  For an appetizer we ordered the house smoked trout rillette.  It was pretty tasty.  Definitely a nice smokey flavor.  It was served with toast and a small salad with arugula and fennel.  (. /)For mains we ordered a / rotisserie chicken with a side of fries and rabbit and mustard ragu.  The chicken comes with three sauces: gremolata, romesco, and porcini mushroom.  The chicken was good, but just a bit over done so it was not quite as moist as I hoped.  The sauces helped with the dryness and were all pretty tasty.  I enjoyed the fact that there were three very different sauces to mix up the flavors.  The house made french fries were quite tasty with the garlic aioli. (/)The rabbit mustard ragu was quite tasty.  A really nice portion of house made fettucini with mustard seeds and parmigiano.  (. /)The service was friendly enough, but just felt a bit awkward.  Between appetizer and dinner our table was cleared but no one brought back silverware.  Then our main course came and we had no silverware and had to ask. . . No a huge deal by itself, but the waiter also never came back to ask if I wanted a second beer (which I did!).  Total price with tax and tip was $.  I will definitely go back because I feel like the food and value was worth another shot!  If they just picked up their game a bit this place could be awesome. Had a very pleasant evening dining here last week during the dine around town event. The restaurant had a cozy but vibrant ambiance, delicious food, and very friendly staff. We ordered:soup of the day was leek potato soup  very nicely done, classic french twist made it great to start the meal. manilla clams  very well seasoned, brilliant addition of quinoa. wild salmon and squid ink risotto  this was amazing, the salmon was seared to perfection. tagliatelle  also pretty good, but we got tired of it after a few bites because of the parmigiano . banana creme brulee  very creamy, not overly sweet, would be better if its warmapple tart  very nice too. We ended up chatting for a long time with the Sommelier because we tasted a lot of their wines and couldn't find a perfect pairing. He was very patient and eventually shared his surprise finding that his Chardonnay goes well with the creme brulee. What a find! We had a fun night. Will definitely come back and hang out more with the wine guy! Cozy environment on a wonderful European style street. I love the rotisserie chicken take out. Went with the Dine about town set menu. The clam, risotto, and creme brulee were all tasty. The pork belly rillette, pork shank, however, were just average. One word on the salmon risotto. The set menu offers the risotto with seared salmon, however regular menu pairs it with scallop. I understand the cost difference, and why they do it that way. Wish I had it with the scallop though, seems much better pairing than the salmon. New favorite. . . cozy French atmosphere, very friendly French servers, deliciously rich and elegantly crafted food for every course, and great wine! The kir is perfect  not syrupy sweet but tangy with a nice touch of lemon, and a good deal at $. The Chablis ($) was an excellent crisp, citrusy white. From the Dine About Town menu: Starters: Manila clams were excellent, with a delightful addition of quinoa. Pork belly and pistachio rillette was unexpectedly mild but unique and enjoyable, accompanied with delicious pickles veggies. If they ever have pickled veggies, you need to get them! Mains: The salmon was perfectly done with a delicately crispy outside. The squid ink risotto was nice too. The pork shank osso bucco was the most tender pork (not shredded) that we'd ever had. Nice parm polenta with simple but delicious broccoli.  Desserts: Cherry clafoutis was incredibly moist, and the apple tarte tatin was nicely caramelized. Both were not too sweet or big, but rich and scrumptious. Service was very on point, friendly, helpful, and not at all pretentious. Dined evening of June st and the restaurant was quite busy for a Sunday evening which we thought was a good sign of things to come (or maybe it was bc of DAT?). Boy, how wrong were we. . . First, service was really terrible.  After our st pour of water and taking our orders,  the waiter never stopped by once until when we flagged him down to take our plates away and that we are ready for dessert course (all dishes were brought to us by a Hispanic man who works in the open kitchen. . . more on him in a sec).  For savories, we got the mussels which tasted just mediocre, the duck confit which wad decent (was tender, I'll say),  and the coq au vin which was also just ok (also tender).  For dessert,  we got the banana creme brulee which def was the best experience all night.  Oh, I will also give credit to the simple yet tasty tapenade that came with the bread basket. Now onto the Hispanic staff member.  While he was cleaning off the table next to us, he knocked the entirely full jar of tapenade right onto my right leg. Despite it being a small dipping bowl, it was full so all the content was on my jeans and shoe.  Without an apology, the guy looked over at me and went back to bussing the table.  Yes, I understand it's a busy night,  but you can still say sorry and offer to bring a wet towel right?  Nope. . . I had to ask him for one before he was abt to walk away and when he brought it over,  it was as if I was troubling him with a stupid side task.  Since oliver oil doesn't come out easy, I spent time putting baking soda at home on my jeans and shoe with the hope that the stains will come out (I'll be calling you Cocotte if it doesn't).  In the end,  the wife didn't want to leave tip at all but we ended up putting down % anyway just bc I felt generous and assumed that the entire staff including the dishwashing crew have a small cut,  too. Thanks Cocotte for the lovely tapenade. I did like it a lot but you didn't have to spill it on me for effect! A wonderful dinner! juicy rotisserie chicken served with delicious sauce, excellent branzini bass and one of the best paté I ever had! price are great. one of the best deal in the city. will be back soon Wonderful diner we had last Saturday . Place was packed so I recommend make reservation especially on week end. It feel like we went to Paris ! Though the food is fairly solid, Cocotte consistently does not honor their stated business hours. Open till pm? But close at pm? This practice does not lend itself well. If you want to spend your entire dinner turned around trying to make eye contact with the server to grab his attention, and not enjoying your meal or your company, then this is your place.  Took  minutes to even take drink orders. When I asked for a wine recommendation he just quickly directed us to the most expensive glass at $ without any description or nd recommendation. We had the duck platter appetizer. Eh, it was mediocre. The entrees were very average.  Two of us had the beef Wellington and the other had the special which was a steak with blue cheese. Nothing special. The sides were very good. Brussels sprouts in lemon were great and the potatoes au gratin in goat cheese was also very good. The highlight was the banana creme brûlée which was amazing. Everyone seems to agree. Knowing it would take half an hour to get the server's attention again we ordered the creme brûlée and asked for our check at the same time. It only took  more requests for the check before it arrived. The server sensed my agitation as I eyed him down as he moved through the restaurant. He finally arrived and tried to be cute by saying ""voila!"" as he presented the check. Sorry buddy, not remotely funny, and no I will not ever come back to your restaurant even though I live just a few blocks away. Food was average with a few bright spots. Food alone deserves three stars but the service took away from the experience so much that this was definitely a one star dinner.  Don't come here. Way too many other good restaurants out there in this city to bother with this one. Food is consistently excellent. Service is always great too. This is the first restaurant I bring visitors to when they are in the city. . . And the banana creme brûlée is delicious! Food is a bit too pricey for what you are getting but very delicious. Atmosphere is very corporate. . . Maybe that was just one night, but I came here on a date and it was neither cosy/warm nor lively. . . I would come back for the food but only with my colleagues or on a work dinner. Was having dinner her a few weeks ago and found the experience to be far less than what other yelp reviewers had suggested. We seemed to have multiple waiters all at the same who not only would interrupt us  mins after previous interrupting us or their co worker have interrupted us, and then seemed pissed that we had not made our selections from the menu. That really ruined it for us, and the food was ""just ok""; frankly it was a bit too salty for my tastes. Another important note if you're thinking about this restaurant: there is ZERO parking around the area, especially in the evening. I ended up parking a few blocks away on the street, and it took me  mins of driving around to find that spot. There are no parking garages and its a really busy area. Appreciate this is only an issue if you drove in, but still, allow time for it. This place is very nice. Great setting and the foot was delicious, especially the bread!! Highly recommended Cocotte is a wonderfully cozy French restaurant, perfect for dates or small groups. To start off our indulgent meal, a friend and I shared a cheese platter. It consisted of three types of soft and hard cheeses, along with a side of jam, nuts, and an arugula salad with pistachios and balsamic vinegar. I highly recommend tasting the hard cheese with nuts, spreading a piece of bread with brie and jam, and pairing bread with the goat solo or with jam. For my entree, I ordered the coq au vin  the chicken was placed upon a bed of vegetables and potato gratin. SO flavorful and juicy, pairs beautifully with a glass of red wine. My friend ordered the scallops with squid risotto. Had a taste of it and oh my gosh. Definitely ordering this the next time I dine here. This entree had some amazing textures and is great for anyone who loves seafood! We are locals and tried Cocotte for the first time with the Rotisserie take out.  Fabulous whole chicken with its accompanying three delicious sauces.  Two cocottes  peas and carrots and cauliflower gratin.  Superb.  We will definitely make this a regular treat. The chicken and sauces are the best I've had. Went for Valentine's this year,LOVED: The bread. This is important to me. It's what I get to eat when I'm hungriest.  The ambiance. It's simple and warm, but romantic and chic. Not your corner French bistro.  The Valentine's prix fixe menu. Nothing too elaborate, but pretty delicious and with sizes worthy of a man. . . who's not too hungry. I actually couldn't finish the main, though it likely was because I ate so much of that bread. OK: Service. Definitely more positive than negative. Didn't feel like we were being rushed. Also, in their defense, the place was absolutely packed. It must make it harder to be extra nice and attentive.  Personal space. Proximity is part of the warmth and vibe of the place, but it's definitely on the you are also dining with your neighbor side. NOT LOVED: The famed banana creme brulee. Coming from a Caribbean person who loves banana in anything (with soup, next to steak, in omelettes), you have to trust me on this one: it's not for everyone. They had an orgasmic chocolate dessert, so, do yourselves a favor. Overall, wonderful place. For a point of reference in SF: much better on my record than Bistro Central Parc. In town for my birthday weekend and enjoyed this fabulous restaurant with my parents. Cozy, great decor, amazing menu and excellent service. The banana creme brule was out of this world, too! And loved that the chefs and kitchen are open for you to add to the family feeling atmosphere. I felt transported to France with the adorable and sweet French waiters  an amazing dinner and I would highly recommend this restaurant for a date night or any celebration! Great food and service! Seating is a bit tight, especially if you are taller but a nice place to grab dinner! Excellent dinner. Offering French classics as well as specialties, Cocotte has warm atmosphere that made for a great evening. Duck leg confit, half roasted chicken, filet beef wellington, potatoes and goat cheese, and a bordeaux. I will be returning. Fabulous! So glad I found this place!! My boyfriend and I walked in at . pm last night and were able to get a table. So impressed with the food and price! We shared half rotisserie chicken, lobster salad (great!) and THE BEST Brussels sprouts I've ever had! They had lemon in them. . . Too good. Best thing is they do takeout so this could be one of our new weekly dinners, healthy take out with the rotisserie chickens and sides! It is pretty loud in there tho as its a pretty intimate space but don't let that scare you! :) Excellent service with a very intimate atmosphere. I had the Beef Wellington and it was delicious. Cooked to a perfect medium rare as requested with a crispy puff pastry outside. If you ever make a reservation here and they call to ask you to reschedule, then you should either go with the new time or cancel. I made the mistake of wanting to stick to the original time. The table we were given was arguably  the worst in the restaurant. It was a noise attractor. We could hear conversations from everywhere but couldn't hear each other. I would have put up all this if the food was good, but both meals were terrible. I had a seafood stew that was practically forced on to me by the waiter and my partner had the beef steak. Both were so salty and that the only thing I could taste was the salt. Moral of the story: don't piss these guys off by not going with the time they want you to have dinner! Despite of pains finding a parking around the neighborhood this is a gem that is worth it!We really liked the ambience, service and of course a nice selection of wine, appetizers and main entrees. This is a really good spot for a romantic dinner or just hanging out with a few friends. Thank you to everyone, we truly had a great time and will be back soon! Great little gem! We really enjoyed our meal here. The place is tiny but the ambiance is really nice. The creme brulee is really amazing. Pricey but worth it for a nice date night! Wonderful date night! The space is very intimate. Dinner included: duck platter, lobster salad, sea bass, pork belly, side of cauliflower/espelent gratin, and dessert was an apple tartin. For wine we shared a bottle of Medoc. The duck platter was really a trio of duck which included duck sausage, duck rillet, duck belly, a warm walnut loaf, mustard,and pickled onions. This dish was a wonderful start to our meal. The lobster salad was generous in the lobster and burrata,m.  hour pork belly ober lentils, no brainer selection. Their apple tartin was simply Devine, not too sweet perfectly soft apple.  It can be very noisy and be prepared to overhear some of your neighbors conversation. In a nutshell it's great local spot that I hope lasts. small intimate place with european decor.  service was great but the food was a let down.  we ordered the duck platter, mussels, sea bass, beef wellington, fries and red wine.  everything varied from bland, chewy to salty.  AND that included the wine.  maybe we missed the mark on our order or we lack the refined french palate but i dont get all the rave reviews. Such a good find by my friend Jenny!Intimate and cozy atmosphere with romantic (but not too dark) lighting and an open kitchen.  Saw mostly ""girls night out"" tables here but also great for date night. My beef wellington was great, although my bone marrow that came with it didn't have much more than  tiny spoonfuls of actual marrow in it.  Coq au vin was also excellent, as were our potato gratin and brussels sprouts sides.  We finished the meal off with a refreshing banana creme brulee. All in all a great meal and the perfect fix for a French food craving. I felt like I was in France during our dinner at Cocotte.  The service is excellent and we loved everything we ate.  It was my first experience with bone marrow yum!  I will be back!! I almost dont want to write this review as this place already can be hard to get a table at but I just cant help myself. Awesome little French restaurant in Russian hill. Great cozy atmosphere, good for dates! Wonderful food ( love the duck pate and rabbit flat bread) and wonderful service! I'll keep coming as long as I can get a table! Fantastic food,service and wine list. The roasted chicken is superb. Great place for a romantic date night. We had an excellent meal at Cocotte. The restaurant is warm and inviting; our waitress was all smiles and friendly. It was a fab time. We shared the duck platter to start which was awesome. Duck saucisson sec was tasty as was the smoked duck breast. I've had better rillettes but this variation was still quite good. I had the coq au vin (yum!) but also got a taste of everyone else's mains (roast chicken, pork belly, rib eye steak). All were cooked perfectly. The sides were my favorites though. Cauliflower cheese had that nice chewy golden brown cheese topping. Potato gratin was nice and creamy. Brussels sprouts were good too (but lacked a little oomph). Fries were good albeit slightly soggy but were more than made up for by the excellent aioli. We shared the molten chocolate cake for dessert. This was probably my least favorite dish of the meal. There wasn't anything inherently wrong with it but it didn't have the wow factor of some of the others. I'd definitely come back though! Cocotte has that quaint, European vibe that makes it an ideal date spot. My girlfriends and I were surrounded by lovey dovey couples, but we didn't mind. Our attention was focused entirely on the food. We shared a couple bottles of white wine and the following: Green bean salad: Comes with fried potato and goat cheese beignet, need I say more? You can ask for the anchovy dressing on the side, if that's not your thing (but I adored it!) Rotisserie chicken: To die for, with delicious dipping sauces (especially the porcini mushroom) and sides (get the lentils!) Potato gratin cocotte: Surprisingly my least favorite dish we ordered, in spite of the restaurant's name and my love for potato and cheese. It was rich and yummy, but still ultimately outshone by everything else IMOComparisons with Limon Rotisserie seem inevitable. I still favor Limon overall, but it's better for parties/groups, whereas Cocotte is more romantic and intimate. One of our favorite places to eat in sf. Excellent ambiance service and the mussels are delicious . divine. Super cozy little French restaurant on a quaint little stretch of Hyde. The food was great (I ordered the coq au vin) and the wine list has some nice French picks. The chocolate cake dessert was alright, but the coffee was good. Oh, and the cheese plate was killer! It had great variety, plenty of different types of cheeses, as well as unique fruit and nut additions that I don't typically see. Definitely not your boring, average cheese plate. Great for date night, girls night, etc. We went on a Tuesday and had made reservations earlier, but it seemed not super busy. It's a smaller space, so plan ahead if you have your heart set on eating there especially on a busier evening. The wait staff definitely approach service with a French flair . . . they take their time and give you yours to enjoy your meal and wine. Don't expect a speedy dining experience. Unhelpful , rude.  Valentines I could not eat what was on their heavy, rich, valentines menu because  I have severe medical restrictions (many gastric surgeries).  When I told them I'd like to order something from their regular menu (which I had deliberately checked out before coming) they declined.  They wouldn't even give me a green salad or something simple like a plate of vegetables, so I sat there, no food, while my date ate.  More than once I suggested I eat something but it was all or nothing for them.   To top things off they rushed my date through a three course menu in less than  minutes.  Ruined our valentines, rude, unaccommodating. I was torn between ordering the  hour pork belly and the beef wellington, but as two other people in the party ordered the latter. . . I went with the former. Never having seen the beef wellington before, we were surprised that it looked a lot smaller than we'd thought. For dessert I went with the oh so praised banana creme brulee. Everything was okay, but I'm not sure that I'd ever pick this as a *go to* spot since parking was next to impossible. The staff was pleasant, which is always appreciated. It was strange being able to hear the kitchen in the restroom and might I suggest providing seat covers? Really intimate setting.  Its a small restaurant with a pseudo open kitchen, but I really enjoyed this meal.  I was with  other friends and we ate family style.  That is the way to go at this place.  We ordered the lobster salad, clams, roasted chicken,  sides and the tartufo, and I was surprised at how reasonable the price of the meal was after we split everything  ways (+ a bottle of wine).  The chicken was so tender and brussel sprouts were really good.  I would definitely come back to this spot. A wonderful, attentive French bistro. The food was delicious, the service perfect and the setting cordial. The prices are reasonable for the quality of food and service. It's a wonderful venue for a special event J & I were lured to Cocotte by DAT.  I totally did not realize that Cocotte used to be Hyde Street Bistro (which I had dined at during a previous DAT, and left unimpressed). AMBIANCE: Not much seems to have changed between the days of the space housing HSB and now Cocotte.  As other Yelpers have mentioned, space is tight  I had difficulty getting into my seat (the couch side) without booty bumping the neighbors. . . even after shifting our table over.  Oops. SERVICE: Friendly. . . friendlier than when it was HSB for sure.  But also did not seem entirely genuine.  J & I ended up being seated in the somewhat romantical alcove thingy (the small, private space under the stairs?)  It felt at once more intimate, but it also meant that we often felt ignored/forgotten by the staff. FOOD: J ordered off the DAT menu while I chose an entree ala carte. From DAT ($. ): Seafood puff pastry thing: Like seafood pot pie  decent, pretty rich, nothing amazing.  Pork osso buco: This was fine.  J was not impressed, but I felt that it was par.  It came with a few sprigs of broccolini as well as some polenta.  Banana creme brulee: Delicious, as it was when the restaurant used to be HSB. Ala carte: Scallop with risotto ($):  scallops that were on the smaller side seemed like a marginally stingy portion for the price.  The risotto was alright  slightly mushy, but that's ok with me.  Flavors were good, and I enjoyed this dish more than the pork.  Brussels Sprouts ""cocotte"": Eh.  Nothing special.  Portion size is small for $. OVERALL: I left satisfied, but not impressed.  I need to remember that there is no need to return, when there are so many other wonderful places to try in SF! Dine About Town is an excellent way to try restaurants that are new or under the radar a bit like Cocotte!  It's on the lucrative cute section of Hyde Street where there are cozy, mom n' pop restaurants that are fine dining that are reasonably priced.  Cocotte serves yummy French food.  We had the leek potato soup of the day, which was creamy and comforting.  We ordered the coq au vin, which is slowly cooked chicken so it was tender, moist and tasty  most enjoyable!  We also had a side of brussel sprouts, our fave!  Service was cordial and attentive and they answered all of our questions nicely. It's not a fancy place, but the food is definitely delicious!  We had the chicken liver pâté, excellent. And their tarte ta tan (sorry spelling?) the apple pie, is so authentic! The best in sf and outside of Normandy!  Will def return!! This is a cute place with a french twist. :)I came here with  friends for DineAboutTown but realized that the actual menu is actually better. We ended up ordering just  DineAboutTown portion and  entrees of the reg menu. The appetizer, oh my, was this puff pastry stuffed with an assortment of seafood. The dish was drizzled with a savory white sauce that kept the dryness out from the pastry. We got  different entrees:  Hours Pork Belly  bombombombomobmobmobmb, The pork belly was so savory and literally melted in your mouth. Once you take a bite, your mouth explodes with fantastic flavor. I mean it should. . . since it took them  hours to marinate. This was paired perfectly with a bed of lentils. Duck Leg Confit This was my dish and I loved it. The duck meat was tender while the skin was crispy. It couldn't help but lick the plate clean. Salmon ""koulibiac""  This was salmon stuffed in a puff pastry. This was good but I'm not a huge fan of fish when there's duck and pork belly around. For dessert, we all shared the Apple Tarte Tartin. I'm not usually a sweets person but I could eat this all day. It was warm yet cold. It was soft yet crunchy. Just everything in this cute little dessert with a blast of apple. Went for Dine About Town on a Sunday night and had excellent service. We ended up waiting for one person to show up for about  minutes, and the servers were very patient with us despite the kitchen wanting to close up for the night. I felt like they treated us very well and had very generous portions for a nice French restaurant in nob hill. We came here for Dine About Town but ended up ordering off the regular menu because I was in quite the mood for steak. Everything we ordered was off the charts good! The kitchen is open so you can watch your food get prepared, which adds to the atmosphere of this smaller restaurant space. The host and servers were French with thick accents which add authenticity to the experience. I ordered the steak with a side of fries and the Shisito peppers to start. Their wine list is very affordable as well! All in all, one of my favorite new places in the area! + week reservations are required though, so make sure to book in advance. This place is awesome. Came here last night with a friend. It's a small place, and it was pretty hot inside because part of the kitchen is in the same room as the dining room. Other than that, the intimate atmosphere was great for a  person dinner  not too loud or crowded despite the size. The food was amazing. I had the coq au vin and my friend had the steak. Both were perfect cooked perfectly, and so flavorful. I've never had chicken that moist and tender before  it was probably one of the best meals I've had in San Francisco in the  years that I've lived here. Great place for a date or special occasion  I recommend it and will come back! I celebrated my birthday here. Unfortunately, the place is too small for big groups and the staff seemed overwhelmed. We were seated  minutes later than the reservation which is very uncomfortable for me as host. The food was great overall once we finally sat down. The unpleasant surprise came with the bill when the tip wasn't included with a party of  people as it is generally the case. We had to come back and pay an additional amount. Definitely an unpleasant experience for me. My recommendation is go there as a couple, but it's too small for big groups! I came here for the Dine About Town specials with a friend. The place is VERY small. In fact, I requested to sit outside to avoid being elbow to elbow with my dining neighbors, but was told I could not. The atmosphere is nice and dim, so it would be good for a date (and apparently meeting new people sitting right next to you. )As for the food, I recommend the osso buco entree and chicken pate appetizer. We also dined on the salmon dish (with flaky top like a pot pie!), apple tarte, banana creme brulee; all of which were pretty good.  They serve bread with an olive tapenade, which I didn't care for. I just ended up using the bread to dig into my pate like an Italian heathen. It felt like we were transported to a little country farm house in france. There was a rustic feel from the space to the food and all the way to even the service. Everything that we had was great. I especially liked the duck confit, housemade pasta and the seafood vol au vent. Banana creme brulee and the apple tarte tatin were great as well. The chicken however was less impressive. I wish it didn't depend on the sauce as much and would stand on it's own more. Limon's rotisserie chicken is still my standard. Dine About Town is not the way to go here. If you break it down, it would have cost the same ordering everything separately. In some cases, we would have saved money ordering separately. Service was great overall. My only gripe is that at times we felt rushed. The space is really small but it didn't feel small. Street parking really sucks in this area. Love this Hyde street addition  it fits the atmosphere and reputation of the street perfectly with its quaint, warm, and relaxing interior and beautiful open bar/kitchen concept. Came here for dinner during Dine About Town and was not disappointed. We tried the mixed seafood and soup appetizers. These were both good, but neither were hot when they arrived.  Entrees were the salmon and lamb osso bucco  again, no complaints but could have used a few more minutes in the oven.  For dessert we tried the apple tart and banana creme brulee.  Everything was enjoyable and not too heavy. My only other feedback was that I wished they offered their rotisserie chicken as an option during DAT! Service and wine were both great as well! I'd make a return visit to try the chicken. Excellent neighborhood restaurant.  We were coming to the city to go to the theater, our daughter suggested this restaurant.  She described it as a nice cozy restaurant with really yummy food  a favorite of hers.  I can see why!  We were not disappointed.  We started with the duck platter  duck salami is a must!  We also had the scallops with the squid ink risotto.  Best scallops we have ever had.  Cooked perfectly, melting in your mouth.  The basil foam adds the perfect touch.  The flat iron steak was cooked exactly as ordered, paired with the potato goat cheese gratin  wow.  Profiteroles with rum raisin ice cream was the perfect end to a perfect meal.  Service could not have been better.  BTW, next time we are trying the rotisserie chicken, pork belly, cauliflower and banana Creme Brûlée (our daughter's go to favorites!)Restaurants like this are what we miss about the city. Beef wellingtons are hard to find in San Francisco. When this dish was prominently featured on our favorite show of the week (Master Chef: Junior), we just had to get our hands on these coveted wellies. We came here as a party of six for the boyfriend's birthday and feasted on halibut, pork belly, brussel sprouts, wine, almost every dessert on the menu, and of course, the star of the show beef wellington. Since the dim lighting and candles are well suited for more intimate settings, our rowdy ragtag gang stood out from the rest of the patrons. . . who were definitely on dates. The quality of the food is enough to warrant four stars but the patience that the entire staff showed us (again, a rowdy ragtag gang) reinforced the positive experience. . It's a small place so small group works best. If you have your  friends and their dates to dine together, go ahead and rent out the whole place. . Order whatever you want, but you MUST finish with the banana creme brûlée. It'd be the best decision you'd ever make. Oh, and go ahead make that decision for your date as well. Mine really appreciated it!. If you're ordering more than a glass of champagne, you might as well get the whole bottle because it is more cost effective. . We had great service. BUT we get that everywhere because we are kind, charming, and compassionate eaters, well not for the animals we eat. . Have you decided on the banana creme brûlée, yet? MAKE THAT DECISION. NOW! very cute spot on Hyde. However, they KEPT trying to rush us out of our tables.  This are has bad parking and fine. . two of our party guest s was  mins late, but the people that DID arrive ontime, we ordered wines, so its not like we were wasting their time.  We came here for dine about town.  The puff pastry with scallops and shrimp was amazing, and so was their osso bucco with a side of creamy polenta.  Food really was superb, but I cannot get over how rude they were in rushing us out.  Half our party ended up ordering first. . and granted, two girls were late, but that's saying if we were to have a relaxing dinner here. . we can't stay for any longer than what, an hour n half? Location: tough to parkInside: small, clean, cosy, wooden tables very close to each other. Food: scallop over squit ink risottos highly recommended. Chicken liver was good. Service: not attentive. Not personal. Robotic. Value: not good, which is what you expect from any French restaurant. Overall: I would come back only if it was convenient. I would not return due the food, service, or the value though. This place has a couple of things going for it rustic feel and decent wine list. Unfortunately that's pretty much it. The food is okay, at best. You are getting what you pay for. It's a far cry from fine French food. The selection looks interesting on paper but what you get is Applebee's sized portions slabbed together on a plate. There is nothing complex about the flavors and little effort at the presentation. We had the beef Wellington and the Butcher's cut. They were *okay*. There was absolutely nothing special about either dish. The menus are stained, the tablecloths too. Our waiter spilled wine on the table while pouring it for the BOTH of us. He was fillin 'er up like he was topping a glass of Coke. Oh, and when you get wine there, hold your glass up to the light. You'll enjoy gazing at all the lint fuzz from the aged rag they probably used to give the glass a quick wipe down. Gross. I expect more from a place that claims to serve fine French food. First and last time for me. If you are thinking this is a thoughtful, romantic place to dine, it's not. I had dinner at Cocotte last night for a friend's birthday. The chickens were delicious, the beef wellington tasted hella British (in a good way) and showed up with marrow, the sides (scalloped potatoes, cauliflower, and brussel sprouts) warmed my soul, and the wine warmed my heart. The service was great and we walked out full. My husband and I came here on Christmas Eve, it was a set menu and it was a great experience. The server was super friendly and perfectly attentive which really added to the night. We had the crab and avocado appetizer which was really fresh and flavorful and the pate which went great with our wine. The main courses were great too, the fish had crispy skin and came with lentils and a yummy cream sauce that was not too heavy. overall GREAT, we will be back. Stupendous Christmas Eve dinner. Delicious lamb shank and an amazing sea bass were highlights. They followed superb appetizers of crab with avocado and potato goat cheese beignets. Great wine selections and, though extremely busy, we had excellent service. Will definitely return. WILL NEVER EAT HERE! I made a New Year's Eve dinner reservation a few weeks ago for  people, and the restaurant called to verbally  CONFIRM the reservation Christmas Day.  Come the evening of Sunday, Dec . . . I get an email from Open Table saying the ""Cocotte has cancelled your reservation"".  I called them right away to tell that there must be some sort of mistake??  The fellow who picked up the phone was VERY RUDE, and said. . ""We're a small restaurant and can't fit your party of  anymore.  Also, we're busy right now so I can't deal with you at the moment"".  What do you mean anymore?  I insisted that someone from Cocotte called me on CHRISTMAS DAY to confirm the reservation because they are a small place.  The guy's response?  ""Like I said, I'm too busy to deal with this now. There's nothing I can do for you. ""  and then he HUNG UP!!  How do you cancel someone's NYE dinner reservation for  PEOPLE just  days before without even the courtesy of calling?!!  What if I never even saw the email??Wish I could give them ZERO stars! We shared a Lobster Salad which was excellent and the Beef Wellington was very tender and tasty. The Brussels sprouts were sliced which I was concerned that they might be over cooked but they were quite good and sautéed to perfection. Highly recommend Loved this great neighborhood find!Cocotte is great.  It has a small and cozy atmosphere with delicious food and all really reasonable.  We were shocked at how low the tab was when it came.  The staff is great and friendly and helped us pick out a perfect Cote de Rhone to complement the meal. We loved the chicken.  It was perfectly done flavorful and juicy.  The potatoes au gratin were also a must.  Would definitely come back! super good place, really good food, come here a lot with friends and always have a great time! One of the few restaurants, not located in a hotel, that is open on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day! I had a really hard time picking a restaurant for my meat and potatoes, if he had a choice we would be eating at McD's brother, me (half the time I plan my trips around what three star michelin restaurant I can get a reservations to) and his roommate to eat Christmas Eve dinner. I finally settled on this place because while it is french, they did have things I thought my brother would eat on the set menu (beignets and beef wellington). I thought we were in trouble when he asked me what hors d'oeuvres meant. Seriously?! Are you sure you weren't switched at birth? When I explained it was a very common term for appetizer, and that many of the ingredients in the fancily named dishes were things he liked he seemed to be more open to the experience, but I could tell he was reserving judgement till the food arrived. Luckily for me, the food was delicious and he actually ate most of his food until he couldn't eat anymore. Hallelujah! It's a Christmas miracle!The waitress was really sweet and did not laugh at my brother's butchering of each dish's name (although I did). The service was excellent! Attentive and welcoming. . . just as it should be on Christmas Eve. As for the food, I had the Dungeness Crab appetizer, Sea Bass entree, and the Banana Creme Brulee. My brother's roommate ordered the same appetizer and dessert but had the Lamb Shank instead of the Sea Bass. My brother had the Green Beans an Romaine Salad with Beignets, Beef Wellington, and the White Chocolate Napoleon. Even though I chose the lighter appetizer and entree, the three course meal was quite filling and befitting of a holiday meal. The creme brulee is banana creamy custardy heaven in a ramekin and torched by the gods (It is really that good and I've had a lot of creme brulee in my life. . . It's the dish that prompted me to study french and it's the first dessert I ever made when I was ). Everything was delicious and plated beautifully, with one exception. The dungeness crab appetizer was awkwardly plated. While it was delicious, the plate it was on was really big and very brown. This resulted in the three elements on the plate being really far apart from each other with a big brown abyss between them. Also the brown didn't really complement the color of the sauce or the radishes. But that's a minor cosmetic flaw in an otherwise perfect meal. Merci beaucoup Cocotte! You accomplished something that my mom has only accomplished a handful of times in thirty years  gotten my brother and I to like the same food establishment. The only reason I'm giving this review is the incredibly rude service. The food was good with the exception of overcooked duck but here's the breakdown in service:I brought two bottles of wine. When we called we asked what two bottles would cost to cork, they told us and thought nothing of it. When we got there, we were then told we had to buy a bottle or they would open only one bottle. Really? Then we spent hundreds of dollars on dinner. Just paid the bill and was asked how dinner was and was immediately asked to leave. . . . One of our guests didn't even get a chance to go to the bathroom. That may be ok to do in France but this is America and you can't be a rude douche to people that just spent a bunch for dinner. There were a variety of ways to handle that situation, they picked the wrong one. I know they were busy and needed the tables but it wasn't our intention to ""loiter"". I'll never go back and will tell all my friends to do the same. There are ton of french bistros that are amazing and respect their patrons keeping them in business. Small, cozy atmosphere with excellent service and food. Can't go wrong with that! While everyone could order their own, the accompanying side dishes are quite share able, which is a great way to try a little of everything.  Also  save room for dessert, the apple tarte tatin and banana creme brûlée are  star worthy and particularly délicieux!À bientôt, Cocotte! I love the venue and the lighting. It was a cold and stormy night when my partner and I stopped by. The wait staff was outstanding!! And I love that they speak French at that restaurant, makes it very legit. The duck confit was very dry. The chicken was decent. We got a side of the cauliflower which was creamy and good. Sadly, if the mains don't steal the show. . . I can't justify coming back. Omg this place was great! The scheduling is off and there was quite a wait for our reserved table BUT the food was awesome, wine was great and the service was superb.  The tab was amazingly low!  It is a great value for really good food.  Probably best to be early or late in the evening. . . it gets kind of over full in the middle' Been here a couple times for reliably good, casual French food.  The wine suggestions pair well, and the whole meal is fairly priced for SF.  I recommend for a nice dinner in a warm atmosphere. Dinner was fabulous. The beef Wellington and mussels were my favorite. Chicken with mushroom gravy was great too. Desserts were also terrific. All those  star reviews! Oh well. I will make it brief. Service was poor. The Busser  kept picking up used silverware off our plates and placed them on bare table in between courses. Courses served one on top of another. Rush rush rush. Food average at best. The staff needs to understand that joking with clients cannot overcome poor service.  stars is a far too generous of a rating. . Cozy small place with a warm aura. Quite loud.   of us were in a small corner but as all of us are under '"" it worked.  The food was richly flavored  I enjoyed the coq au vin which had a wonderful full mouth feel and fell off the bone.  The serving was not large but was enough.  The service was kind and prompt.  It is more of a .  star for me. So good! I love this place. It's cute and cozy and the food is delicious! The beef wellington is so good! I can't stop thinking about it :P I have also tried their fish and chicken dishes and they were very good too. MmM! It was a slow Sunday night with no wait and great service.  We started with the smoked salmon plate and I'm not a big fan of smoked salmon, but this was excellent!  Then we split the beef Wellington and pork belly.  My favorite was the Wellington and the dipping sauce.  Lastly finished it up with the apple tart, which is amazing. Overall this place rocks and is one of the best date/dinner spots in the area.  I am looking forward to returning here. amazing, a must go! Good food.  Good Service. Yay, finally got to eat here after a failed attempt on my st. Came here with the bf and it was amazing. Granted, we had to drive around the area for / hour to look for street parking  do come early to look for parking or hope that you are super lucky that day. Also, make reservations beforehand!!We ordered the  hour pork belly and half a chicken. The pork belly was fantastic, the skin was crispy while the rest of the meat was soft and literally melted in your mouth. I have no idea how they managed to have such different textures for a piece of meat. Judging from the reviews, it seems that the pork belly is not getting enough credit! We also got half a chicken. Super amazing as well, absolutely no fats on it, and was roasted to perfection. But honestly, I loved the pork belly way more. We also got the two sides  brussel sprouts and potato and goat cheese gratin. I wished I had the dessert that everyone raves about. . . but I was too full for it :( Hopefully I will come back here again next time. This place was fantastic! Came here with my girlfriend after being turned away at Seven Hills because we did not have a reservation. The owner found us a seat on a very busy Friday night. The service was prompt, as well as accommodating. The meals were lovely, however, what I will take away from this place was the creme brûlée. It is to die for. I have been craving it ever since I left. I see it in my dreams. . . I was very pleased with Cocotte, even though I still don't know how to pronounce the name. It is in a nice location (even though parking is near impossible here) and is a very small and intimate restaurant with an open kitchen and friendly staff. The food is above average and is very reasonably priced. They are very well known for their rotisserie chicken, which is a great deal, but the other items on the menu are great as well. I had the Osso Buco special for the night and it was exactly what I wanted and expected. The other diners at my table all had the / rotisserie chicken each, with comes with  sauces and a side of your choice for just $. I tried a piece of chicken with each of the sauces and it was cooked well and very juicy. The wine list was also impressive because, while it did not have any bad bottles of wine there were plenty of affordable bottles along with the pricier ones, mostly from France and California. I would definitely recommend coming here for dinner and plan to be back myself. The only bit of criticism I can give is that they need another waiter/server on duty because there was only one and he seemed to be a little overwhelmed. The environment it very good. It can be a little cramped but if you don't mind tables being a little close together, I strongly recommend Cocotte. We had the seared scallops on squid ink risotto. So good. I took a look at other dishes and they all looked very good. The server was nice and attentive but the star here is the food. Just spent the wkend in SFO for foodie & wine getaway.  I'm so glad my BFF Michele found Cocotte on yelp!.  It was AWESOME.  If you see B. N. 's review, I don't need to say anymore Everything was fantastic, including the service and the view into an open kitchen where the chef's were completely in tune, no fuss or problems with a totally packed restaurant.  Just beware, you are only allowed one bottle of wine per group, no matter if you have  people or .  Please try Cocotte, you'll not only love the food, service, ambience and location, but the prices were great! Sorry for the late review.  Came here last Saturday night with another couple.  As soon as we entered we instantly were smacked in the face with food aromas emulating from the open kitchen area.  Sure enough we were seated close to this open kitchen area.  We started off with the chicken liver mouse, the assorted duck charcuterie platter, and  rabbit ragout with gnocchi.    What a HOME RUN!!   My wife and friend ordered the beef wellington, our other friend ordered the scallop dish, and I had the  hour pork belly.  I also ordered a side of the brussel sprouts and scallop gratin potatoes.  We all shared a small bite of our  entrees and were equally impressed with everything we had.  Desserts were very good also and it was easily one of the best dining experiences we have had in SF.  We will definitely be back the next time we visit SF. Cocotte is a fabulous little French rotisserie in Nob Hill. We ordered the half rotisserie chicken (because, when in Rome), and had the sea bass bouillabaisse. The sweet potato and pumpkin seed side was my favorite dish. Cocotte has great service, and a friendly, local vibe. It's casual but romantic at the same time. It's small, so make a reservation if you can but you should be able to walk in on a weekday evening. Lovely small French bistro on Hyde street. Found it by chance during a pleasant walk back to the hotel. No tables available (would recommend a reservation for dinner) but were able to snag a seat the bar which is also quite nice. Good wine list, fair number of french reds available of good quality. I had a Cote du Rhone and Bordeaux, both good. BF had the lilet apertif, sweet and yummy. Crusty bread with a pesto type dip brought out which was delicious. For dinner, he had the New York Strip with french fries and I had the Duck Confit with cauliflower. Absolutely delicious, everything. Some of the best steak I've ever tasted. Cauliflower was cheesy and rich, fries superthin with parsley and well salted. Confit also delicious with arugula salad on the side. For dessert we shared the molten cake and each had a glass of port. Wonderful  not so rich that was too much, melting chocolate coming out of the inside, warm cake. We consider ourselves lucky for bumping into this place. We love french food and have had some very good examples of it around the country  this is one of the best. My favorite neighborhood spot. Cozy, intimate ambiance. I like how I can see into the kitchen. The chicken for  is pretty decent. Overall, pretty decent food for reasonable prices. Really delicious meal here.  We had the crab salad (delicious and HUGE portion), the gnocchi with rabbit (also good, but I'd say crab salad was better), and then shared the chicken with brussels and gratin.  Sides were AWESOME  brussels were perfect.  My only negative comment was that the chicken was a little salty for my taste.  Wine list, ambiance, and service (especially our French, hilarious waiter) were also great. It was all around a great dinner. The atmosphere was very cozy and great for a date night. It was rather affordable too. We had a $ bottle of wine,  appetizers, I side, pork belly and sea bass, as well as dessert for around $. For  people in the city with  courses I would say that's pretty good. Highlights of the night were the sea bass, served as a whole cooked fish with bone in. Also the pork belly was so buttery and amazing along with the au gratin potatoes. But the most amazing part was the banana creme brûlée, reminded me a bit of bananas foster but better. Everyone who goes there must try this dessert!Given that I live a couple blocks away, I will definitely go back. I recommend everyone to give this place a try! The  hour pork was so soft, moist and delicious. The accompanying veggies were fabulous! The brussel sprouts were the only thing that could have used improvement  they were too salty. The duck appetizer was delicious and my bf had the beef Wellington which he LOVED and raved about. The service was fine, attentive, not super welcoming, but not unfriendly either. The Napolean dessert was good, but not great. This place is a neighborhood gem! The food was great! One of the best meals we had in our SF visit! Second visit to this somewhat trendy neighborhood restaurant. , confirming there are better choices in Nob Hill. The food was good, not great and pricey especially for a restaurant featuring and open kitchen with line cooks and no chef. The service is where Cocotte really falls down. The wait at an uncrowded bar was over  minutes without being offered a drink; that would have been a good cue to leave and go elsewhere. When the meal was served the appetizer took  minutes to come and was presented in a very hot dish without a word, resulting in a minor burn through accidental contact with an arm. The entree was so slow that the desert order was requested not by one but by three different people before the entree came. The entree was clearly forgotten because after  minutes when asked again it appeared  minutes later. The manager // owner seemed to be aware of the problems and offered a weak apology. The check totaled just under $ pp with tip, including a glass of wine and appetizer and entree and no desert. There are many other great choices in Nob Hill such as the Nob Hill Cafe offer much better value and service. I am really disappointed with Cocotte. A group of  of us went on Friday night and were treated very poorly. I do not recommend going here with a group, or really at all. We brought three bottles of wine to enjoy and they would only let us open one ($ corkage fee). We were not planning on going home after dinner so we had to lug around bottles of wine all night. They completely neglected our table, knowing that they were just going to slap gratuity on our bill at the end.  stars because the food and the ambience were ok, but I will not go back to a restaurant that treated our group the way Cocotte treated us. Go to Seven Hills or Frascati down the street. There you will find top notch food, great ambience and wonderful service. Great little place, please order the Lobster Salad, SO good. Have been here ~x for brunch and once for dinner. I'd recommend both, but brunch is probably my favorite: there is never a wait, and they offer deliciousness that stands out from the usual breakfast options  the verde omelette and the soft scramble are my favorites. Also, free bread! Refined carbs and butter for breakfast? thas what i'm talking about. Dinner was good too, but probably more of a four star experience. We ordered the chicken liver parfait ( stars), duck platter ( stars), rotisserie ( stars; I've had better), the coq au vin ( stars. MEH), potato gratin ( stars; creamy and delicious), cauliflower gratin ( stars. . . tasted like the potato gratin. . . ), scallop risotto ( stars!!), steelhead ( stars), banana creme brulee ( stars; I tasted no banana), and chocolate cake ( stars).  da mayor. Brunch at Cocotte must be still a new secret . . . half tempted to keep it that way!  Came here on Sunday and had a thoroughly enjoyable experience with the food, service, décor, pricing, you name it!We had a :am reservation and was shocked/happy/confused to show up to a completely empty restaurant given I the lines I saw dinner all the time.  Brunch must be a new thing  so i'd suggest getting your fill in before everyone else finds out and the famously long SF brunch lines come to Cocotte!Everything we ordered was fantastic and unique, and priced very affordably: Lobster salad ($)  lots of lobster, sweet corn, crisp lettuce.  Made for such an uber refreshing and unique breakfast treat.  I will order again! Duck confit omelet ($)  lots of savory duck, good omelet Pulled Pork Benedict ($)  lots of pulled pork (they are generous with their protein)  great smoky pork flavor.  Croque monsieur ($, with egg)  probably the least impressive thing we ordered, but still a solid sandwich especially given Cocotte's really super yummy bread. Service was great.  Décor was cozy.  New favorite brunch place. Small and comfortably located on lovely Hyde St. in my neighborhood (Russian Hill). First of all I looked for a place to have a pleasant conversation with my friend on that day. And such it was, an important option we so frequently need these days to hear and to be heard. Now to the food, we shared chicken liver for the starter, a decently sized and tasty portion. My friend choose to try the rotisserie wonders while I opted for coq au vin. Not disappointing at all, portion size was reasonable and fries with garlic sauce were lovely. All was accompanied by a nice light Cote du Rhone. Prices are reasonable and in general atmosphere is relaxing, don't feel the usual weight of ""visiting French restaurant""  BTW  Parking is impossible to find after pm but cable car runs nearby (powell hyde line). Definitely consider to come back and interested to try some nice weekend brunching. Great place.  Nice and cozy.  Food is quite good.  Definitely a nice find The food at Cocotte is quite good, but tonight's service left a lot to be desired. Our server announced within the first  minutes that service would be delayed. The ""kitchen was understaffed and wasn't equipped to handle the reservations,"" he said. Very poor planning and frankly the issue tonight was the sub par service and nothing to do with the kitchen. As an SF resident, I'll expect more next time!  As an aside, we can all see into the kitchen and it wasn't that packed! When you see Yelp display the category ""French"" for any establishment  one starts thinking about a meal that will drain the wallet for some petty portions.  Don't get me wrong  I love French cuisine and appreciate that the things their food does for the palate cannot have money governing it. The wait staff and servers were very kind, knowledgeable, and professional.  My girlfriend headed in first for a seat as I knew it would be a journey to find parking.  After about  minutes I walked into the nice, dim lit restaurant to see that we had a pretty awesome table  a little nook behind some curtains with a candle on the table. We glanced at the menu and already knew what we had to get  duck platter for starters, half chicken, pork belly, potatoes gratin, and the fries. The bread is delicious here, but if you ordered what I ordered do watch your intake.  The duck platter sports a lot of delectables but what stood out the most was the duck breast  this was absolutely delicious with the accompaniment of pickled onions and whole grain mustard. Now onto the generous serving of half a chicken.  I sliced this thing up and each piece looked like it was sweating  that's how juicy this chicken was.  I tried each of the sauces but really appreciated the original rotisserie flavor of the chicken  I ate most of the chicken without any of the sauces.  The potatoes gratin I got for a side dish were absolutely amazing  I never had gratins cut so thinly; it is delicious when it is this thin. The pork belly is chalked full of flavor  it actually came off a bit too rich for our tastes but who can blame it the dang pork belly was cooked for  hours.  The fries ordered with this were probably some of the best french fries I have had at a sit down restaurant. Topped with  glasses of wine and champagne, this was a great meal for a random date night in the nice area of Nob Hill. The place is small, snugly warm and comfortable. We missed out on dessert since we came in late for our reservation after many wasted minutes finding a parking spot; so be on time if you want a full experience. Thankfully we were able to finish our course when we received our check, otherwise it would have been awkward still chewing our food while being asked to leave. I ordered half chicken and it was very good. I will definitely come again for it and hopefully on time next time. I was trying to find a nice restaurant on a recent trip to SF and found Cocotte on yelp. I made a reservation here for a Sunday night and it wasn't too busy at pm. The place was super small and dark but cozy with a nice ambiance. Food: They give you complimentary bread and tapenade and it was excellent! That spread was an amazing mix of olive oil, olives and capers. We ordered  entrees: the scallops with squid ink risotto ($), a half chicken with fries ($), and pork belly with potato and goat cheese gratin ($). My absolute favorite was the scallop dish. I've had squid ink risotto before and this was out of this world! And it doesn't turn your teeth black. The rice was cooked perfectly and was rich and creamy and topped with basil foam. These were all flavors I had never had before. The scallops were succulent but a little on the salty side. The pork belly was my second favorite. Thick slices of pork were served on a bed of greens and caramelized onions and veal au jus. The broth was full of flavor and I liked how the pork belly was very lean. The gratin was decent but nothing spectacular. The half chicken was my least favorite. I thought the seasoning/spices on the skin were good but again, nothing special. The meat was also a little dry and the  sauces that it was served with did not stand out. The side of fries were tasty and I loved the aioli is was served with. Prices: Reasonable for french food. Service: We were very pleased with the service. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. Bathroom: The area outside the bathroom was an eyesore and smelled bad because the dish washing area is right in front of it. The bathroom itself was nicely done but the door is tiny. Good thing I'm little. Parking: This was a challenge. You probably won't find street parking since it's located in a residential area but we were able to find a space   blocks south of the restaurant. Enjoyed a nice brunch here.  C had the coq au vin which came with three tasty sauces, and I opted for the eggs florentine with a side of house smoked salmon.  I found their salmon to be rather fishy.  Not sure I would return for bunch, but some of the dinner options sound fantastic  I would come back to try the seafood pot pie and/or bouillabaisse. Really a fantastic spot on Hyde. Very cute but tight squeeze. We went on Sunday night and it was full. Had the muscles for an app, really fantastic broth! Then we split the whole rotisserie chicken with potato and goat cheese gratin. Chicken was really good, and organic! Came with some good sauces. Chocolate molten cake was delicious. All in all, great small neighborhood restaurant. Will come back for sure! I had the Coq Au Vin and the cheese plate, both were beautifully prepared and tasted excellent. The ambiance was great as well. Overall, I enjoyed the small restaurant atmosphere, but it would be nice if the tables were a little farther apart. For such high quality food, the price was excellent as well. The servers were very nice and friendly and understanding that there was difficulty finding parking as I was over  minutes late for my reservation. Overall, this is an excellent restaurant and very enjoyable. Nice little restaurant up Nob Hill.  Friendly staff.  Great rendition of half chicken with various sauces on the side.  Very good meal. Cocotte is one of my top  favorite dinner spots in San Francisco. They check the box on literally every category that matters: () Food  Check; () Ambiance  Check; () Service  Check (note: VERY friendly French servers); () Price  Check; () Everyone leaves feeling like they got a great deal  CHECK CHECK CHECK. I've been here  times and still never tire of it. I highly recommend this place to anyone. Absolutely fantastic.  Wine, service, food, dessert.  Highly recommended. Enjoy this hidden gem of a French bistro!  The portions may be small, but it's just right in terms of flavor and finesse for fine dining with a cozy, quaint and humble ambiance.  Try their Loch Duart salmon ""Koulibiac"", Bloomsdale spinach, maitake , basmati rice, lobster bisque for a seafood version of chicken pot pie with salmon.  Save room for any of their desserts whether it's their banana crème brulee, warm black cherry ""clafoutis"", vanilla chantilly, clafoutis, or Molten chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream, red berries & green tea coulis. The staff is friendly and helpful.  It's a great feeling to sit in a room with a high energy vibe in front of their kitchen.  Bon apetit! Nice little restaurant in a hotspot with no parking. Did get a bit full at  on a Friday so make a reservation. The waiter was patient with us because someone from our group had a difficulty parking. We ordered quite a bit of things; we ordered the duck platter which was alright. I personally am not a fan of salami so the duck salami did not appeal to me but the duck breast and rillette was good. For entrees, I'd recommend the beef wellington and the duck confit. Yum! The bone marrow that came with the beef wellington was delicious and fatty. The rotisserie chicken did not stand out to me, it was a delicious chicken that I would probably compare to costco or boston market (sorry!). For the sides, I would recommend the fries and cauliflower. The potato gratin was a bit weird to me because of the goat cheese but it was still good. Lastly, for dessert we got the apple tart and the creme brulee. Apple tart was amazing and I absolutely loved the caramel! The banana creme brulee was such a disappointment! The creamy base was more of an egg tart than anything. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a small french restaurant. Good service. Good food. First of all, I love small independent restaurant like this. Very under stated, not much hypes, and they let their food do the talking. This is a total pleasant surprise. I was visiting SF, and my friends and I planned to go to Sons and Daughters, but something came up. We had to cancel our dinner. I did not want to stay at the hotel by myself, so I randomly pick a place near my hotel by Nob Hill. I sat by the bar, the manager was very attentive and friendly. He made a few suggestion from the menu. I ordered roasted chicken with side of potato gratin and a glass of Russian River Pinot Noir. My dinner was beautifully presented. I love the ambiance of the place. It's very cozy and lively. I would definitely come back. This place was so adorable.  I recently lost my job and the gentleman I'm seeing was also looking for work.  We tossed around the idea of going to Paris.  Fortunately (well. . . unfortunately), he got a job super quickly  so we settled on going to eat some French food.  Cocotte was where we decided to go. I made a reservation, and they put us in a corner section with super comfy chairs (and some drapes we could draw if we felt like having some privacy  which we didn't use).  The place was absolutely ADORABLE.  I was slightly afraid of the restaurant seeming too fancy/pretentious, but it was exactly the opposite.  The staff was attentive and considerate, the food was just incredible, and the ambiance was spot on.  We were even sat next to a table of French people who drank wine and talked the entire night.  It was a very immersive, very french experience. I highly recommend this place.  I will definitely be adding it to the list of places I frequent. Arrived for our  PM reservation to see only one other party at the restaurant.  They sat the  of us underneath the stairwell, which they painted dark brown and boarded off on three sides. The table faces to the kitchen so we felt secluded and unable to see what else is going on or see any sunlight.  A bit strange since there were about  open tables.  We requested to be moved and they so graciously moved us one table over just out from underneath the stairwell, but still felt secluded.  (Their dining room did not fill up and they had about  open tables when we left so I doubt they had other reservations for the other tables that would prohibit them from seating us elsewhere).  Servers were friendly and attentive. The food,  I loved the rabbit app.  My friend enjoyed his lobster salad.  For entree, I had the beef wellington with bone marrow. . This was my first time having bone marrow.  It seemed to lack flavor and had a thick layer of salt on it.  The beef wellington did not have much flavor either, a bit bland.  The puff pastry was burned in places.  I asked for it medium rare but arrived more on the med well side.  I liked the area the restaurant was located but there is NO PARKING.  We had to circle for   minutes and went several blocks in each direction to find parking.  Not sure we would go back A solid four stars. I came here on a Saturday night for a girls' night out. My gf had made reservations a few days before, and we got one for  at : pm. It was during the Dine About Town season, so I made sure to check out the menu beforehand and was excited. When we arrived (on time) our table wasn't ready yet; took about  mins to get seated. We ordered a bottle of the pinot blanc to start, and decided between the  of us, we would order two DAT sets and add an additional entree and share the appetizers/desserts. We got the Frisee salad  I love this salad in general, and the sliced pieces of duck complimented the salad really well. I also really liked the dressing. Mussels  Good, but just average. My gf commented that the sauce was a little bland for her taste, but it was fine for me. Pork osso bucco  I really loved the polenta. The pork was OK  I felt it wasn't as tender as I would've liked. Banana creme brulee  one word: yum!Chocolate cake  Not overly sweet  we all loved this. Would definitely come back again to try their regular menu. Our waiter was also very attentive and provided good recommendations. A note of caution  we took Lyft here, but I know this area is difficult for parking, so be prepared if you're driving! What great neighborhood gem. I almost feel bad writing about this place  I want to support it and keep it in business, but I don't want other people to find out about this place, so I can always get in. Selfish, I know. Everything we had was great, the duck platter, the half chicken were solid. The coq au vin blew my mind! We also ordered the halibut which was tremendous. I wish they had a full bar, but there wine and beer selection is good. I love how they serve in cast iron skillets and Le Creuset dishes. I plan to become a regular, and with the reasonable prices, that might me easy. I stumbled across this restaurant on yelp & open table.  It looked reasonably priced for a french menu & family dinner.  Decided to go with it.  We were able to get the st reservation on a Sunday evening for .  The menu was simple and at the time they also offered a pre fixe menu for the dine about town event going on.   of us opted for the pre fixe which was ok for the price.  My husband seemed to have the best dish off the menu and he opted for the chicken with the cocotte gratin.  My pre fixe was decent  kale souffle and their banana creme brulee was delicious.  My mom enjoyed the mussels and gnocchi starters and we all shared a confit spread.  Parking could be tough but prices are truly reasonable. This is a hidden gem in San Francisco; the food absolutely delicious. I live in Alaska and haven't had the opportunity to try much French cuisine, but Cocotte made me want to change that! The cheese gratin appetizer was divine, and my dinner scallops with basil foam and risotto was fantastic. I am looking forward to my next visit! perfect place for a french dinner. the restaurant is small ish so it's not super loud inside. the food is slow. we came with some old friends to catch up, so this is perfect for us. we stayed until they were closing, but they didn't rush us to finish. the food is also very good but nothing spectacular. the duck was good. the wellington was ok. the pastry wasn't puffy or thick enough, but the steak was good. the rotisserie chicken was alright according to my friend. you should definitely get the molten chocolate cake for the dessert. you know do what the french do. eat multiple courses, hang out, have long conversations over wine. and you know that it's good french food when the servers speak with a heavy french accent! You just can't believe how good this chicken is until you are stuffing your mouth and wondering if it is wrong to order more. And the sides are terrific! If you can, and you are on a date, try to get the little private table that is tucked away. I sort of hate myself for giving this place such a great review because I don't want it to become overly popular. NB: This is a French restaurant! The service is slow and French, so don't expect a peppy American waitress checking in on you every second. My friend's co worker recommended this place, so I met her here after she got off work in the financial district. I drove up from San Jose and, luckily, found a parking spot on Hyde. I made the reservation for two at pm on a Wednesday evening, and we had no trouble being seated. The interior is cozy and clean. There is a small bar on the right when you enter, perfect for a quick drink after work. The seating area is modern yet tasteful: wooden tables, proper chairs, and just the right amount of light. This place would be great for a date. It's the perfect size, in my opinion  really great layout. Our waiter was French, so it was hard to understand what he was saying most of the time, but we managed and smiled. I ordered the / chicken and butter beans, while my friend ordered the halibut. We are both picky eaters and we loved our meal. The fish and chicken were excellently prepared. She ordered another bean side dish that looked better than mine. I think the butter bean ragu was a little unimaginative, but fresh nonetheless. I didn't like its aftertaste. After only two small entrees and sides we were stuffed! Overall, the total came out to $ with tip, which is not bad for this city! There was a sign that said it's now open for brunch, so we might head back and try it again. Tip: We didn't drink, but the wine list looked tempting and extensive! If you love wine, check this place out. Service was slow. The place is cosy. But the food was very good. The rabbit for starters was amazing. Will definitely come back. This restaurant dazzled us!  The food, service, ambience i unrivld. . . we will be back soon and often! The appetizers were good, I had the rabbit a la coutarde;  my friend had the butter lettuce salad. They were out of the coq au vin at  pm on a weekday,  so, my friend ordered their Creekstone rib eye steak, which she has asked for medium; however, it was over done and a bit on the salty.    Beef Wellington I have ordered it med rare; it came as more on the medium to well done, the brown sauce was salty, and it was not good at all, and Burnt on the pastry crust. The beef was a bit dry. The pastry crust was burnt.  It had few large slices of mushroom.   These dishes were simply disappointing, and my friend felt the same about her creekstone ribeye. Both of their beef dishes were simply not done well, and I don' t thinks I will go back again since there are too many French Restaurants in SF.  I would recommend they work on their meat dishes or just not serve it at the restaurant. Boutique restaurant with delicious French food  we savored every bite which reminded us of our time @ Paris. Everyone was helpful and the ambiance was romantic. Reasonably priced   people with appetizers, entrees and bottle of wine for $ inclusive of tips. Will def go again! WOW! So good. My bf and I walked in on a whim and decided to eat at the bar. I had the half chicken while he had the coq au vin. Everything was great. Especially the dipping sauces that came with the chicken. The vibe was casual yet great for a date night. I will most certainly come back! great atmosphere, yummy food, great service I really enjoyed this restaurant. The service was spectacular, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was very charming. My boyfriend and I shared the chicken liver pate (which was good, but not the best that I've had), a delicious frisee salad and a very tasty half chicken. We also got a side order of spagetti squash, which was unfortunately very oily and barely eatable, and an order of roasted potatoes, which were also a bit greasy for my liking. Aside from the squash and potatoes (which were minor parts of the meal), I really enjoyed this dinner. A neighborhood gem!  Great food and great service within walking distance of my apartment. Who knew rotisseri chicken could be so good. Decent restaurant for the neighborhood. Not necessarily a destination must go place. Food was not bad not good. Good butter lettuce salad and banana Creme brûlée. Found a piece of wire in the beef Wellington. If you live in the hood it's an option place. Couldn't ask for better food or service in SF. So upset I live on the east coast. . . ; ) Beef Wellington is spot on. Great sides, even better dips, wine selection is superb! Romantic date spot. Will be back! Love this little hidden gem! Affordable french food, good wines and great athmosphere. Tips: on a sunny day you can enjoy the outside seatings: ) Great service, but food was just OK. Nice ambiance for a date. Great atmosphere and good food. Not everything I tried here was a hit, but I'll be back to try more things on the menu. We shared a couple of standard French restaurant appetizers. Both were good. * Farm eggs Meurette (egg poached in Pinot Noir, served with bone marrow, brioche, salad)  $* Duck platter (duck and sunchoke rilette, duck salami, house smoked duck breast, walnut muffin, pickles, grain mustard)  $* Halibut with asparagus, peas, morels sauce  $Perfectly cooked fish. Delicious sauce. There were a couple of things we tried that I would NOT order again: * Beef Wellington  $The beef was a bit dry. The pastry crust was burnt. Instead of a layer of mushrooms, duck liver, and prosciutto or bacon between the beef and the puff pastry, there were only a few large slices of mushroom. Luella serves a much better beef Wellington. * Broccoflower with lemon oil and anchovies  $A bit dry. I didn't really taste the anchovies or the lemon oil. * Sorbet trio (apple, strawberry, lemon)  $Yummy! Service was fine, but our server was a bit pushy when making recommendations for food and wine. He told us exactly which appetizers he thought we should order, and he overruled our wine choice too. My family had an amazing dining experience at Cocotte. Everything was the best of the best from the food to the service to the affordable prices. What a great addition to the neighborhood!I tried many dishes and my favorite was the half chicken with cocotte/side. You get to pick a side from a list with things like potato gratin, butter beans and broccoli. I got the french fries as my side and they were excellent! The chicken is a must try, and half a chicken is bigger than I thought. I also tried the roasted cauliflower and it came out piping hot and delicious. Next time I want to try the pot pie. . . The service was very good, attentive, but not pushy. They have many affordable bottles of wine to choose from and we enjoyed the one we picked. Overall, we really enjoyed our meal and will be back! I was very pleasantly surprised when dining here for the first time. First off, they were willing to accommodate my last minute party size change (I added one more person). The service was very helpful and genuine. The wine list was affordable and great!All in all, a very AFFORDABLE neighborhood gem!Order the following:The duck plateRotisserie duck with truffle (this was a special for the night)Duck confitOh gee, can you tell i like duck?!?!I just love love love the fact that you can dine on good French food in the city, and still not break the bank! Such a cute place in Nob Hill! I didn't even know it existed until I was looking for something French in the neighborhood. Good service, good atmosphere, and good food. The Farm Egg Meurette was really interesting and tasted good! Served with bone barrow. I highly recommend this dish. They had a special for appetizer also. . scallops carpaccio which I liked, and pretty presentation with watermelon radish. For dinner I ordered the half roast chicken, a cocotte (side dish) of potato and goat cheese gratin. They also give you  sauces for dipping. Wow I really liked the chicken. . cooked perfectly and tasted really good! I can see why they are known for this dish. My partner had the Hedgehog Pot & Pie. . which is a mushroom haha! It was good but too tiny I think. For dessert we shared a chocolate cake fondant which was yummy. Overall I really liked this place. I liked the sense of adventure we felt in not knowing what some of the dishes were. And their menu is inventive and I think playful. How very French! Excellent!I started with a glass of Sancerre and the Frisée salad accompanied by the bread. It was wonderful. I followed this with the scallops and black ink risotto. It too was absolutely  great. But to end the meal in a most heavenly manner was the banana creme brûlée, Perhaps this was the best rendition of brûlée that I have ever had.  The service was spectacular so I am unsure of other comments that were not good. My waiter was very attentive and the other waiters would be watching as well to take care of my meal without any  requests. They were never too attentive but ""just right. "" Stop by here for a wonderful meal. The half rotisserie chicken has incredible flavor.  I also recommend the beans with ragu and the potatoes au gratin.  Definitely returning here. Such a great ambiance! The restaurant isn't very big and the tables are definitely close together. However, the lighting is perfect and the rustic feel of the restaurant complements the  food. I had the bone marrow appetizer and the rotisserie chicken for my entree. If you're a bone marrow kind of person, I highly recommend! It came with a pinot noir poached egg that made the entire mix just absolutely fantastic. The chicken was good, but I've had better.  All in all, I think this restaurant is perfect for dates. We'll definitely be back soon. Solid French bistro in the Nob Hill area.  Same location as where Hyde Street Bistro was. All the reviews here about this place are pretty much spot on.  Loved this little romantic spot. We started off with some lapin à la moutarde in kale, which was a surprising combination that worked well.  Quite tasty. I went with the Coq Au Vin, while she went for the scallops in ink risotto. We also had a couple of glasses of the burgundy pinot. Finishing things off, we had the tarte tatin along another glass of red, but of the recommended Malbec. EVERYTHING was excellent.  Seasoning was optimal and everything came in hot (not lukewarm. )Service was a definite highlight.  As in VERY GOOD.  Pleasant demeanor and not once were we rushed.  In a town that is all about turning over tables . . . it was very refreshing to feel like . . . back in France actually where you'll have the table for the evening if you want. All in . . . we came out ahead I'd say for around $ + tip.  I gave a pretty good tip considering the unusually strong service. So I actually highly recommend Cocotte, given the overall quality and experience. No real negatives really.  If anything, maybe the decor is just ok, but I thought it was appropriate for a bistro like setting. Moist and wonderful chicken with great sides. It's like the best of a rotisserie place within a swank/classy wine bar/trendy cafe. Highly recommend. After take a nice walk down through Chinatown to Little Italy for gelatto! Ambiance  cozy, intimate, lively, rustic, dark furnishings with warm lighting. Enjoyable with a date or one or two good friends. Food  I ordered the half chicken, mostly white meat. It was well seasoned and came with  different dipping sauces (nutty, pesto, buttery tasting). My friend ordered the steak, cooked medium. Juicy and cooked to order, and great paired with a red. There is a good selection of by the glass. The banana creme brulee was yummy! The caramelized sugar on top had a nice twist to it with slices of soft ripe banana, and the creamy dessert underneath was heavenly. Ironically, I bookmarked this place on Yelp to try the beef wellington and coq au vin but tried neither this time. I would return to try them. Apparently cocottes are simple side dishes. Interesting name and cute concept to name your restaurant after the simple, underemphasized part of your menu. In a word: Fantastic! We loved this place. Parking is a chore given the location, of course. But we arrived right at opening time without a reservation and they sat us a two top in a little romantic nook. We shared everything: a whole chicken, roasted potatoes, cheese plate, wine, and salad. The chicken was some of the best I've ever had. We will likely be back again and again to this romantic little spot on Hyde. I really enjoyed it here. Good service. Great food. And reasonably priced. The frissee salad was super tastyRabbit ragu over spaetzle was unique and deliciousA half rotisserie chicken; moist in the middle crispy on the outside accompanied by three nice sauces. DO try the banana creme brulee!I was impressed. Its not that often that I go to a restaurant and want to try everything on the menu. I'd give this place .  stars. Loved the atmosphere  as other said, tables are close together, but that didn't disrupt us. There is one cool table in this little alcove area, we were sat right next to this one, and because of the design, their conversation was amplified, but still wasn't too distracting. Service was a mixed bag  the waiter was great, very friendly, French and initially it was off to a good start, but it was nearly impossible to get his attention throughout our meal and he never came back to check on our drinks. Even when he would come to grab something off the table when clearly, we could barely catch him to point out empty wine glasses and request another glass. Same thing with the water. We sat with empty glasses for a while before finally flagging him down and asking for another bottle. He just wasn't very attentive and they're probably missing out on additional drink orders. As far as the food, we split the frisee salad with quail eggs and pork belly. This was delicious  a lot of pork belly, though I would've prefered the eggs closer to poached than hard boiled like they were. The bread they serve is really good. For the main, my husband got the rotisserie chicken with a side of poatoes and I got the duck confit with lentils and a side of cauliflower gratin. We both agreed that salad was the best thing we had, but our mains were solid. My confit could have had crispier skin, but the meat was still tender which doesn't always happen. The lentils were a nice compliment and the cauliflower was good, but probably wouldn't go for it again. My husband enjoyed his chicken. We ordered the chocolate lava cake for dessert and while we finished the whole thing, I wouldn't exactly call it a lava cake  even when you got to the center, nothing oozed out. I guess it was a little over cooked. It wasn't bad, but not as indulgent as we were expecting and definitely didn't live up to the name. I think this is a nice choice, but they could improve upon their overall service of checking on you throughout your meal. Can't explain how happy I was to discover this tucked away charming restaurant. The ambiance is rustic, simple and warm. Loved the exposed kitchen, felt very intimate with the chef preparing meals right there. Large wine pours. . . need I say more?The food was delicious. Definitely order the mussels to start and the butternut squash spaghetti side I promise no disappointment there. The rotisserie chicken is perfectly prepared juicy large pieces of white meat accompanied by three ridiculously tasty dipping sauces. I plan on being a regular at this place! J'adore! Cocotte was a solid .  stars but the price pushed it up to  stars for me.  I am slightly biased towards French food but this means one of two things: If it's mediocre, I won't be back; if it's delicious, I crave it until I have it again. This fell closer to the delicious side for me and the wine cemented its place further. The wait staff was attentive and very knowledgeable about the dishes and wine list. Their menu was somewhat limited regarding entrees but the options they do offer are flavorful and filling.   Also when I go to a good French place, I expect that it could take the better part of  hours for a meal, because it's French culture. Not saying it took that long but be warned, don't come here if you're in a rush We started things off with the cheese plate which had a fair assortment of french cheeses and both my date and I liked them all (especially with the bread). We ordered the half chicken with two sides (potatoes au gratin and broccoflower) and  and a bottle of their Malbec. In a word: delicious. The bill at the end came out to an almost even $ for two people (which is less than it would have been for just about any other French place of note in SF).  I will most definitely be back and would recommend this place to people who enjoy fine dining and good wine at a reasonable price. Tried out this restaurant since they were featured in SF's Dine About Town.  Good service, Great Food at a reasonable price.  Everything was delicious from appetizer to dessert.  Their creme brulee was soo good. . . very fattening and full of calories, but it's worth it.  You should come to this restaurant just for it's desserts, if you like sweets as much as I do.  =) dinner was good, simple, clean. The rotisserie chicken w/  dipping sauces was definitely the highlight of the evening. The roasted chicken is fantastic, and well priced. The entrees are more expensive so I'd recommend just going for that chicken with some sides and appetizers. I'd order one side per person and share. The cheesy cauliflower is amazing. Had take out food  nights ago and I am here to give it a thumbs up!  I ordered half a chicken with a romanesco broccoli and potato with the chicken drippings side (one side of your choice is included with the price of the chicken). The chicken also comes with  types of dipping sauces, which I thought was an interesting gimmick.  But after trying them all out, I'm here to tell you that this gimmick rocks!  Though my favorite is the garlic and parsley (gremolata) sauce, both the roasted pepper (romesco) and the mushroom sauces are also quite fantastic. As for the chicken, it was moist, flavorful and meaty.  Everything you'd want from a roast.  The sides have subtle flavors so as not to detract from the star of the meal but were still able to be enjoyed distinctly.  The sauces were used whenever we felt the urge to dip with all  dishes, with very satisfying results.  So, what are you waiting for? Good food. Nice ambience. . . . . . This is sort of typical for a smaller place but just something that drives me a bit nuts. . . . . I really do not want to hear the next table's conversation or be sitting  inches from the next table! (I'm just saying)! Other then that, the cheese plate is great and my clams had a very good sauce. The service was good, a bit on the slow side getting started but otherwise the staff is helpful and attentive. Cocotte is definitely a sweet neighborhood spot, no question. I was excited to dive into the menu after perusing all the reviews and photos. We had a : reservation on a Sunday night and when we got there the place was poppin'. It's cozy and intimate, the menu reads all kinds of deliciousness and the wine is mostly French, yay! Ultimately, the I find a fair value in this place, given that San Fran can be pricey. The food was nothing revolutionary and the service could use improvement, but all in all it was good. We started with and order of mussels and smoked salmon. My only memory of the mussels is that they were unremarkable. There was nothing really notable about them. I expect more from the bay area. The smoked salmon on other hand was easily the highlight of the evening. Served with blood orange, creme fraiche and dill it was buttery perfection. Three of ordered the roast chicken to share. It comes with three sauces  gremolata, romesco and mushroom  I enjoyed all of them . There was plenty of chicken for the three of us and for real, it every bite was juicy. Was it the most flavorful roasted chicken ever? No. But it was a solid roasted chicken none the less. We also ordered spaghetti squash and goat cheese potato gratin for side. Both were tasty. I would've liked to taste more goat cheese on the gratin, but it wasn't a deal breaker. Service was a bit disjointed. We were seated, the server took drink orders literally one at a time and brought them to the table one at a time. Perhaps because the bar was at arms length from out table? Still. . . . awkward. . . and inefficient. He disappeared a lot throughout the night and really hurt his check average because I could've easily ordered more vino. , but if ya snooze you lose. All in all, Cocotte, is a nice, but in a city that offers so many culinary and service experiences, I won't necessarily be rushing back here on my next visit. If I live in Russian Hill, I'd maybe I have been to Cocotte twice and will be going back. The first time I ordered take out and ordered half a chicken, the goat cheese potatoes, French fries, and spaghetti squash. The food was spectacular. My friend and I were basically fighting over the chicken. It falls apart effortlessly and is so well flavored you don't even need the sauce they give to you on the side. It is a pretty good deal if you share half a chicken and some sides. The second time I went I ate there. I made a reservation and was seated right away. The service was great and the waitress was really helpful in guiding us through the menu. My mom and I split the chicken and again it was outstanding! I usually shy away from eating meat on bones but not with Cocotte chicken. It is divine. My dad ordered something else on the menu and although it was good he said he would get the chicken next time since it was exceptional. The goat cheese potatoes are also a personal favorite. Great place to eat! The service was excellent and friendly, the food also excellent.  This is a cozy small family owned restaurant, my favorite type.  A nice find.  They specialize is rotisserie, mostly chicken, duck and quail.  The wine list is great. Phenomenal! You absolutely can not go wrong with anything on the menu. The Egg ""Meurette"" (Pinot Noir poached egg and a side of roasted Bone Marrow) was very very good and the Beef Wellington was incredible; cooked to absolute perfection. The Rotisserie Chicken was perfectly cooked (moist and the skin was nice and crispy. ) The Coq Au VIn was very good too; very flavorful and not soupy like how most places serve it. Their Chocolate Cake and Apple Tartine was a perfect end to the night. The wine list consists of a very good selection from all over France and Local Napa varieties. Service was outstanding! What a gem that we stumbled upon during a poorly planned Saturday night on Hyde. Despite our Open Table neglect we were able to slide into an : reservation while down the street and I'm so glad we did! We ended up sitting at the tall table with stools up against the wall where the kind French Maitre d' offered us to sit while we waited for a proper table in the dining room  but honestly the spot was comfortable, and the vantage point was great, overlooking both the bar and the dining room, and, well, we were hungry, so there we sat. Features included service as unhurried as proper French service should be. A nice terse selection of French and Californian wines by the glass. A rotisserie and cocotte menu meant to be shared. We ordered the half roast chicken with frites, and I couldn't resist the coq au vin. Simply divine prep, incredibly tender chicken across the board, and my coq came on top of gratin potato that was to die for. I almost forgot  the meal started off with a delicious and substantial frisee salad with hardboiled quail eggs and big chunks of pancetta. The whole evening summed up one of the reasons why I love SF dining so much  surprises abound in every neighborhood and sometimes, a poorly laid plan can result in a wonderful experience. David, our server, was lovely. There when you needed him and not bugging you when you didn't. The food was divine. Four of us had the mussels (insane!), cheese plate, rib eye, Wellington and duck absolutely everything was cooked to perfection and delight. Suggested wine pairing was superb. Can't wait to go back. Seriously the best food we've enjoyed in California in years. Excellent! We had the cheese plate, two half chickens with the roaster cauliflower cocotte and fries, and shared a delicious banana crème brûlée. The place has a nice mellow vibe, we'll be back! It's easy to review Cocotte: good food; good service; good value. I started my meal with a bowl of butternut squash veloute (soup to you and me).  The serving was very ample and most importantly I could close my eyes and know what I was eating.  That to me is the test of a soup. An endive salad with dungeness crab and avocado was very well done.  Again the serving was ample and everything on the plate was fresh and delicious.  That is me test for a salad. Coq au vin was also very nicely prepared.  The chicken was falling off the bone and the vegetables were tasty.  For a stew like this my test is whether the vegetables retain their taste or whether it braises away.  Here everything retained taste and texture as well. A side of cauliflower gratin was lovely and my pour of pinot noir was generous.  Cocotte is a winner. Nice  remodel and very yummy chicken. My crab salad starter had an atrociously long hair buried in it.  So minus one star. Our new favorite neighborhood spot. We used to live in Cow Hollow and haunt Gamine, and we are thrilled Cocotte is nearby our new place. Sit at the bar. Drink Chateauneuf du Pape. Eat the liver pate and beef filet Welli. Sigh. Relax. Re do following week. We had a Christmas Evening dinner reservation for pm. Let me repeat that. pm on Christmas. When I walk in at :pm, I expect to be seated within   minutes. . . because guess what? Thats why you make a reservation. When we walked in, we knew this wasn't going to happen. Three other couples with reservations were at the bar waiting for a table to open up, too. This was going to be a   minute wait. . . with. . wait for it. . . a reservation. . . on Christmas evening. Not acceptable. So, after the pudgy bartender/waiter/hostess told us we better have a drink from the bar because the wait will be a while, we left. No apology, just a smart ass offer. If this were  in a saloon, I would have grabbed his bowtie from across the bar and reminded him what the word ""reservation"" means through a Clint Eastwood esque whispery tone. May I remind you, it's Christmas. Here are some tips for Cocotte:) If you expect it to be crowded, make your reservation intervals longer than  min. ) Don't accept reservations. Be like a Chinese restaurant in Inner Sunset and use a white board as a waiting list. ) Apologize when you make people with reservations wait. Especially on Christmas. . . ) Close shop. I'm telling everyone I know to go to Chapeau. My co workers and I went to this restaurant last night and I don't think it will be worth the money or the time to go again.  The service was terrible and the food was mediocre.  We were the first customers to arrive when they opened for dinner, there were  of us and waiting on  more to arrive.  We got seated and offered something to drink while waiting for our other friend to arrive. The waiter kept approaching us to ask about what we wanted to drink after we said ""just water for now"". Then started pushing if we wanted to get some appetizer. We ordered the dine about town and an extra appetizer so he'll go away.  Soon after that our friend came and our meal started to come.  In the middle of dinner, they switched our plates for clean ones since we were all sharing the food.  Which was a nice gesture, all but one friend.  When she requested/asked why she didn't get a clean plate the waiter replied, ""because you got the scallops. . . "" Wait. . what? You should have seen our faces in disbelief.  So she demanded for one and he brought one over. We weren't even done with our food when the waiter kept coming back to our table to ask if we were done with the dishes.  Um. . . no!  We still have food in there!! So towards the end of our dinner we had some leftovers and we asked the waiter to put what was left in ""to go"" containers.  The waiter brings the food back in which seems to be a used or old plastic container.  When we asked the [manager/owner?] if we can get another container because . the top of the container didn't close all the way and . it looked like a used container.  He told us ""this is the only one we have"" then walked off.  I guess no one else for the rest of the evening is going to get a ""to go"" container because ""there's no other ones left""?Anyway, this restaurant was a total joke for what we paid for.  And on top of everything we experienced the waiter had the ordeal to add % on top of our bill.  We did not have a party of . . . !  There were only the  of us. . . . maybe he needs to go back to school to learn how to count.  ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS people. . . . ! Went here and had the half chicken with my family. The owner was there and was very friendly. He gave us great recommendations on wine and some of the side dishes. The chicken itself was amazingly tasty and even for a big eater  the half was plenty of food. I hear you can get take out chicken, which I am definitely going to do some night on my way home! Since we only had time for one DAT choice this year, I finally chose Cocotte after poring over multiple restaurant menu choices.  We had reservations for  but still had to wait about   minutes since the place is small and was completely packed so reservations are definitely a must on a weekend if you have your heart set on this place.  Despite our intentions of just doing the DAT menu, I ended up reconsidering while going over the regular menu as we were waiting.  Everything looked so good that we wanted to literally try everything but settled for a sampling of  dishes.  Food:  Hubby ordered from the DAT menu while I ordered  apps and an entree from the regular menu.  .  DAT App  Goat cheese spinach souffle which was a light, airy, and savory souffle that I wish was on their regular menu.  Hopefully the owner is reading this and will consider adding it on as it was that good!! .  Chicken and liver parfait  Creamy and rich ""pate"" and so deliciously complimented with the red onion and marsala jam.   We could've used an additional piece of toast so you might want to save a small piece of your regular bread for what doesn't fit on your levain toast  .  Farm Eggs ""meurette""  One egg poached in Pinot that again could use more brioche to absorb all the delicious egg yolk that mingles so well with the bone marrow.  I literally did take one of the pieces of baguette from our bread basked and wiped up every morsel of flavor left on that plate .  DAT Entree  Porc Shank Osso Bucco with potatos gratin and cauliflower  Although good, it wasn't as tender as I expected and not as flavorful as our other dishes and therefore the least memorable of all so for DAT entrees, you may want to go with one of the other two choices which the couple next to us raved about. .  Coq Au Vin  I rarely order chicken when I go out since there's usually something else that catches my eye so I was pleasantly suprised at how much I enjoyed Cocotte's Coq Au Vin.  It was fall of the bone tender with a stew of carrots and mushroom that blended so well that sometimes you visually can't even tell if the piece you are spearing with your fork is mushroom or chicken so just let your taste buds talk to you.      . DAT Dessert  Banana crème brulee  Visually, this is a dessert for the eyes as much as the stomach, so much so that the couple next to us changed their order once they saw ours.  (BTW, if you were the couple next to us on Sat, would love to friend you on Yelp for more of your great recommendations).  Unlike most creme brulees, they had a thin layer of bananas on top before torching it so the bananas are still warm when you first bite into it and the rest of it still cool and creamy. Parking:  Unless you have great parking karma, allocate yourself at least   minutes to find parking and expect to walk a good   blocks so wear comfy shoes or get dropped off at the restaurant.  Service:  Although we had to wait a little bit even with reservations, they did periodically come by to give us updates which was nice and definitely make reservations.  Ambiance:  Because it is small, once it is packed, it is noisy and the spaces between the tables are small so may not be the best place for a quiet romantic evening out UNLESS you get the  person table in the alcove or maybe if you go right when they open.  But if you're there for the food and the energy, it's got both. Love it!  Owner is a nice guy. Cook  is hot :) And food is delicious and good size of portion. We were happy with what we paid for. Will definitely come back  to try other dishes. Ingredients are fresh. I'm loving the reinvention of the old Hyde Street Bistro. Cocotte is wonderful! The roast chicken is amazing  a total must try. Their selection of French wine is also great. We've been to Cocotte twice and will certainly be back. The service could be a little more friendly but it's definitely adequate. They also do a to go option of roast chicken and sides! Before the December holiday madness reached a feverish pitch, I booked a table at Cocotte for five. Despite the space being small, it ended up being a great pick for a group. We skipped starters and moved right into a whole roast chicken, coq au vin, seared scallops and sides of roasted cauliflower, dripping roasted potatoes and spaghetti squash. The roast chicken comes with three sauces  gremolata, romesco and porcini mushroom  my top pick was the mushroom sauce by a mile. The standout dish at Cocotte for me was the coq au vin. Their rendition departs from the classic but is as tasty as any coq au vin I've tried (I'm a big fan of the dish). Service was rushed in the end  confusing given the tables wouldn't turn again (our reservation was at :). And we ordered the lava cake and profiteroles to share but the profiteroles never arrived. All in all though, I enjoyed Cocotte and would return, especially if I lived in the neighborhood. Totally reasonably priced French restaurant on Hyde street. The interior is cute and quaint, but just a little small. If you're having dinner for two be prepared to hear the conversations from either side of you. We decided to share some of their appetizers and entrees. Originally we were going to do Dine about Town but decided that we preferred their other dinner options over their DAT options. Appetizers:Chicken liver parfait: If you have read my other reviews, you will discover that I LOVE chicken liver parfait. The chicken liver parfait at Cocotte is not bad, but definitely not the best I've ever had. It comes with a sweet jam (which is typical) and a couple pieces of bread. I would have preferred a little more fat content in the Chicken liver parfait, but it definitely satisfied my cravings after not having it for a while. Farm eggs meurette: Bone marrow with egg poached in pinot noir? Sounds intriguing. The bone marrow was tasty, but a little small for my liking. Not a huge fan of the wine y egg, but it was definitely unique. My favorite part of this dish was scooping the marrow out of the bone with bread. Entree:Duck confit: Flavorful duck over a bed of lentils (?) and pork belly. Very little pork belly, but generous portion of duck. My only gripe is that the duck was a little dry. However, the skin was crispy and done well. Overall the meal came to be around $ which I believe is a steal compared to the dishes we tried. I'll definitely come back to try some of their other options (definitely scallops with squid ink risotto!) and whenever they decide to bring lunch. Dine About Town, my favorite time of year :)There were many new restaurants on the DAT list this year, Cocotte included.  The space is pretty small, including a table tucked away in a little nook.  We were seated quite close to our fellow diners  and they were having some interesting conversations!From the DAT menu I ordered:. Mussels Provencale. Steak Frites. Apple Tarte Tatin. I had mentioned that I would have loved to make the three appetizer options into my entire meal  they all sounded fantastic (the mussels, spinach and goat cheese souffle, and a duck salad).  The mussels were a great choice, though  very flavorful, and a generous portion as well. Unfortunately, the meal was downhill from there.  The steak was overcooked (I had ordered a medium and it was completely well done and stringy) with standard fries and an over dressed side salad.  The tarte tatin was very sweet, with nothing to cut the sweetness  a scoop of ice cream, a dollop of whipped cream, perhaps?Service was fine. . . when our waiter was able to get to us  he was running around frantically!  He was the only waiter (in addition to a sommelier and a host) and this restaurant sorely needs another. My one star rating doesn't have anything to do with the food at this place.  Unfortunately, we never made it that far.  Had a reservation yesterday for :pm.  Showed up on time, and was told that there were no tables available, so there would be a ""short wait. ""  When asked how long, they told us about  minutes.  We waited. . . . and waited. . . and waited. . .    minutes later, the host/server/bartender  guy came out and told us there were still no tables.  And that he had no idea when anything would be opening up.  By this point in time, I'm starving and starting to get annoyed.  The host was pretty apologetic, and invited us to come have a seat at the bar.  He offered to pour us a couple of glasses of wine while we continued to wait.  So finally,  minutes after my reservation time, we went inside to discover there were two spots open at the bar  but only ONE chair.  We stood there for a while, waiting for someone to take our drink orders, and no one ever did.  Finally, we flagged a passing server to ask for another bar stool, and she replied with a shrug, said they didn't have any more, and walked off.  That was the final straw.  We left. Maybe their food is good. . . and the ambiance seemed nice enough.  BUT COME ON!  They need to learn to manage their reservations better.  Any place with service this bad doesn't deserve my business. Cocotte's DAT menu looked pretty amazing, and they got pretty stellar reviews but unfortunately the food was overshadowed by the atrocious service. Cocotte  not worth it even during Dine about Town, unless you enjoy the bad after taste of poor service. To begin, it took at least  minutes for the waiter to even stop by, and when he did he was visibly irritated and gave us attitude as he took down our order. Side note: food came out slow as molasses too. * Wine: The wine's are pretty affordably priced (~$ ); a Yelper warned he was scolded by the waiter for trying to order wine before his entree, so I waited until after I placed my order but the waiter walked away without taking drink orders, and could not be flagged down for another  minutes! Great. More waiting. * Mussels: I was impressed by the hefty portion of (mostly) fresh mussels, simmered in a flavorful sauce that goes perfect with the complimentary bread. Don't judge, but I hate being wasteful so I asked to wrap up my leftovers (which I usually toss later anyway). My waiter responded with something like, ""Really?! Are you serious?? You know you will get sick, and if you do, don't even try to come back and complain to us because I told you so. "" That was the cliff notes version, tried to cut him off as he publicly dismissed me in front of everyone, but he talked over me. He might have been right, but it was so absolutely rude and unnecessary. * Flank Steak: I liked the sauce wasn't a thick puddle of gravy like at most French restaurants. There were  pieces on the plate, one was cooked perfectly and I have to say I enjoyed it, the other was overdone. The fries were fried in what tasted like  day old oil. My friend asked for her steak to be cooked longer, and instead of taking it back, he proceeded to school her on what medium rare is and how she didn't know what it is. After an awkward and tense exchange between the two, he took the plate back and returned with overcooked steak. * Salmon in Puff Pastry: What a unique and interesting concept, I loved the contrasting textures of the buttery pastry and the salmon. The flavors were good but the salmon was slightly overcooked. * Banana Creme Brulee: Way overrated. Needed more banana flavor and the texture was grainy, not smooth. * Apple Tatin: This wasn't so much a tatin, as it was a roasted whole glazed apple on a thin crust. Disappointing. * Chocolate Mousse: Meh. The food might be pretty good, but you can find other restaurants that serve the same quality at an equal or lesser price point. Though I came in knowing the waiter might be a bit mean, I still got yelled at. Do not come to Cocotte. Very cute & cozy place for dinner. It's a tiny restaurant but serves quality food. The waiters and staff are all very nice. They walk you through the menu if it's your first time here. Two of  my friends ordered the scallops and squid ink risotto and it was delicious! We also shared an order of  potatoes and goat cheese cocotte and it was amazing! I ordered the rainbow trout and mussels in lobster bisque based upon the recommendation of the waiter after I decided I should order something different from my group. Unfortunately, I was not impressed by the trout and barely ate any of it. The waiter noticed and asked me how my trout was. I was polite but honest and told him I wasn't crazy about it. When he brought us the check at the end of the night he informed us that he did not want me paying for food I had not enjoyed. I was not expecting this at all and thought it was above and beyond what they needed to do. In summary, I will be returning to cocotte and recommending it to my friends :) LOVE. Used to come before the name and decor change and it's even better than before! Some of the most authentic french food in the city much better than all of the ones in the FiDi. We sat next to a group of about  French people last time if that's any indication. Everything I've had is delicious $ chicken liver parfait I mean you can get bad spring rolls for that price. They let us stay well after closing time one night even suggesting dessert  when i'm sure they all wanted to call it a night. . .   bookmarked . . Let's get the bad out of the way.  They need more servers and cooks.  There seems to be a lag in between drinks and courses.  Long, noticeable lags. And. . . onto the good.  We started with a butter lettuce salad and the farm eggs meurette (yelp. com/biz_photos/coco…).  The salad portion was big enough to share, and the meurette was the highlight of the night.  Eggs poached in pinot noir.  AND bone marrow.  What's not to like?I had the roasted quail (yelp. com/biz_photos/coco…) stuffed with chanterelles, grapes, and drizzled with chicken jus.  This little dish is rich and jam packed with texture and flavor.  You won't regret it. Glass or two of viognier for $ a pop.  Good complement to the meal. So, add some staff and it'll be a solid five. This my new favorite restaurant in town. Wow, the food was exquisite (don't use that adjective often) and the atmosphere is romantic and relaxed. This place serves the type of food that I want to cook  refined but rustic dishes full of soul and love. We arrived on the dot for our reservation and were seated immediately. Our waiter showed us to the best seat in the house, a two seater round table in an alcove. That certainly put a huge smile on my face, definitely a huge plus!! He went over the relatively short menu with us in some detail and offered a few suggestions. We decided on the duck platter, the trout and the half chicken with cauliflower gratin. The duck platter had duck salami, house smoked duck breast and duck terrine. Three slices of a warm, heavenly multi grain biscuit. My favorite was the terrine, it was delicate and well balanced. The duck salami was my fiancé's favorite  it wasn't too fatty and packed a punch with intense flavor. The smoked duck slices was almost like prosciutto. It was a bit too salty for my taste and drowned out the delicate natural sweetness of the duck. All in all, a great start to the evening. After the waiter cleared the appetizer from our table, our mains arrived quickly. The fish skin was so crispy and not fishy at all. The flesh tasted buttery and the wonderful seafood sauce perfectly complimented the delicate fish. The mussels and potatoes were yummy, also. The chicken came with three amazing sauces  mushroom sauce, romesco sauce and a gramoleta. The chicken was moist and flavorful it didn't need the sauces to be a great dish, but the sauces took it over the top. I've had romesco sauce before, but nothing as good as this, it's a bit nutty, a bit sweet and % crack. I could put that over frozen patty of dry veggie burger and it would be good. The cauliflower gratin was fantastic too. The cheese compliments the natural sweetness of the cauliflower and the cauliflower itself wasn't mushy. From reading the other reviews, I couldn't resist and ordered the banana creme brûlée. It was heavenly. The banana were thinly sliced and a bit overpowering on the first bite, but the vanilla flavor really comes through after another few bites. The custard was smooth and not too sweet. It was certainly a great end to the evening. I love this place and hope to come back soon!! It's a true neighborhood gem and I hope it all the success :) Cocotte is a hidden gem. It's a cute and cozy neighborhood bistro that has somehow remained under the radar and fits nicely into the Hyde Street restaurant scene. My girlfriend and I have been to the restaurant twice and have ordered their rotisserie chicken to go. We're generally quite picky with restaurant choices and have been looking for a 'go to' neighborhood spot for reasonably priced, high quality and delicious food with a laid back atmosphere. The ambiance is understated, but warm and casual and the staff friendly. It's a french bistro through and through, so If you're looking for a more upscale and refined dinning experience, I'd recommend Frascati up the street. But for a more casual neighborhood experience with good food and reasonable prices, Cocotte fits the bill perfectly. The menu is varied and everything we've tried has been well received. The highlight so far has been the Farm Eggs 'Meurette'  poached in Pinot Noir with bone marrow, brioche, frisee salad, raspberry vinaigrette  which should be a strong candidate for the x top  dishes in the city in my opinion. The endive salad with crab is a great start and we've found the chicken to be moist and nicely cooked with the trio of sauces a perfect complement. Oh and if you live in Russian or Nob Hill and are tired of Lemongrass, Aux Delices or your standard Asian takeout option, they have an awesome rotisserie chicken meal to go. A chicken, with three different dipping sauces and  sides cost $. For sides, the cauliflower or potato au gratin should definitely be in your order. Pick it up on your way home and you'll have enough left over for lunch the next day. I was a big fan of the owner's previous restaurant in this location, Hyde Street Bistro, and they have indeed built another great restaurant in it's place Cocotte.  They recently re opened after completing a charming renovation to their restaurant on Hyde St between Jackson & Pacific. I have been unable to dine in house yet, but we recently had a fabulous take out dinner of their new 'signature' rotisserie chicken dish and it was fantastic.  A whole chicken roasted with delicious seasonings and accompanied with  flavorful sauces.  Additionally, they feature a number of side dishes for $ each most are various styles of potatoes, and vegetables.  The sides are small enough (and inexpensive enough) that you should order a sampling of at least   with a whole chicken (for a dinner for   people) so that you can experience a few different flavors.  Bravo to the new Cocotte!  I'm a fan and I will see you again soon! Excellent service, food, and atmosphere.  Enjoyed the small, alcove seat for discreet couples; ) very nice! overall good. I enjoyed my dinner here at the restaurant. We had to wait for about  mins even with a reservation, but didnt mind. The decor was great! it was cozy, sophisticated and intimate. the service was also superb. food: great! we enjoyed everything but their chicken. I rarely get a chicken dish at a restaurant, but since they were making a big deal out of their rotisserie, we decided to give it a shot  I thought it was a bit dry and flavorless. Tomato tatin and egg appetizers were really excellent. . and I thought the dive scallop with squid ink risotto was just heavenly. I would definitely recommend this place for a romantic date although it could be a bit noisy. DELICIOUS!! My boyfriend and I dined here this Christmas and it was magical to say the least! We had the sea bass and the vegetarian option of the night, which was an amazing pastry filled with mushrooms. We also ordered the Buche de Noel and Banana Creme Brûlée, both of which were incredible. While I was said to learn Hyde Street Bistro closed, I was happy Cocotte is carrying on the torch. The decor and seatings have changed for the better.  Like the rustic look, soft lighting, the bench seatings. . . Our waiter was very helpful and friendly.  After asking if it was our first time, he went over the menu with us.  The bread is warm and served with a small dish of something like a tapanade. What we had:Mussels mariniere, white wine, shallots, garlic, parsley, salted butter  $  good, mussels were plumpBelgium Endive Salad, dungeness crab, avocado, pomegranate dressing, herbs  $  very good and refreshing.  A mix of cut endive, crab & avocado is served over endives with a light pomegranate dressing with grapefruit wedges. Seared day boat scallop, squid ink risotto, basil foam  $  good, a little on the salty side for me but hubby said it was fine for him.  The basil foam is flavorful and the squid ink risotto is different, cooked right. Roasted quail, stuffed w/ chanterelle mushrooms, grapes, chicken jus  $, served in a small cast iron dish, it was delicious!  The skin was crispy, the meat was tender and the juice was sweet but wonderful. Profiterolles with rum and raisin ice cream, hot chocolate sauce  $  goodThe host was very friendly and has a sense of humor. Look forward to returning soon. This place caught my eye driving by it every day for work. I decided to give it a shot and incredibly glad that I did! Absolutely everything we ordered was fabulous I had the rainbow trout with mussels, my party also had the lasagna, the chicken and the wellington. We could not get enough of each other and our own dishes so we ended up sharing everything. It was fabulous! I wish we had had room for dessert! It's small inside but very charming. I definitely recommend this place! I went with a group of seven. The waiter forgot two of our entrees, which were not brought out before the rest if their party finished their meals. Then, we were informed that as an ""I'm sorry"" gesture we wouldn't be charged for the two meals that were never brought out to us. Truly despicable and shameful customer service. This would have been a prime opportunity to turn an honest mistake into a positive and instead led to a foul experience. This is such a cozy restaurant, the service is excellent and the food and wine are also great. We ordered three cocottes to share and the roasted chicken I especially loved the brussel sprout cocotte, but thought the cauliflower one could have been a bit more flavorful. Fortunately, they serve four very flavorful sauces alongside the chicken and a really good tapenade with the bread. I'm glad we made a reservation because I imagine the wait can be long since it's such a small space. I wanted to love this place, I really did. We showed up on a rainy cold night and were literally the ONLY people in the place on a Saturday night. Although it started filling up by the time we left, it was still pretty empty. There were three of us, so we decided to just order an assortment and share. We got the sheep's milk ricotta salad ($), ravioli ($), rabbit ragu ($) to start. The salad was so small that the three of us only got about  bites each, but it was delicious. The ravioli was more of a soupy mess with some pasta thrown on top of the small dish, not very good, but the presentation was enough to ruin it for me. The rabbit ragu, however, ended up being the biggest disappointment of the night. Not good or inspired and quiet expensive for the  bites we each got. Don't get me wrong, I know these are small plates, but it just felt over priced for the quality. For the main we shared a whole chicken ($) which was very delicious with the  special sauces it came with. We got the side of fries with the chicken which came with garlic aioli, which was a hit at the table. We kept passing the aioli around the table :)The service was ok, but being the only ones in the restaurant, it was very surprising when they forgot our rabbit ragu until the end of the meal and when everything came out at once instead of in the right order. It also felt a little pretentious for what it was. Overall, there are so many better restaurants in the neighborhood that people don't need to go to a mediocre place for food. Sad. I have mixed feelings toward Cocotte. We made reservation for  on a saturday night. It was my first time there so I didn't know that Cocotte was so small. The guy, whom I believed was the owner, was surprised when we said we had a reservation for three. . . . . . because their system had assigned us to a  people table even thou it said  next to my friend's name. To be honest, that tiny little table was a bit small for . . . . how did you expect that to seat  people? And I think they were fully booked so that's our only choice. BUT. . . . food was awesome! The eggs ""meurette"" was so good pairing with the bone marrow. Beef wellington was delicious. The beef filet was finely cooked (medium) and the meat was so soft. The rainbow trout was not fishy and tasted so good with the lobster bisque. The day boat scallop dish was a little too salty, but portion was generous. Desserts were good too~ We had the apple tart tatin and banana creme brulee. The apple tart tatin was a bit too sweet for me but i liked how they made it. I was a bit disappointed with the banana creme brulee but it was still pretty good after all. One comment  if coffee is on your menu, you should always have brown sugar instead of just white. I don't know if i will come back. . . . . . it took my friend  hour to find a parking spot in that area. . . . . . . and with that tiny little table. . . . . . but I will miss the food for sure! I'll never understand a service business that doesn't do everything it can to make customers feel comfortable, welcome and valued.  Here's a tip for the management at Cocoette: pushing four  top tables together does NOT create a table for .  Our group of  made a reservation at Cocoette weeks in advance.  We arrived spot on time for our : reservation and stood outside waiting for our table until :.  When we were finally seated, our table had been created by pushing together four little rectangular tables for two.  For the benefit of Cocoette manegement, I'll help with the math at this point.   x  = .  Had we been a group of  adults,  children and  pygmy marmosets, this arrangement would have been great.  We were, however, a group of , full grown adults. I alerted the manager to the problem and he came up with a brilliant solution.  He had the waiter rotate each table  degrees.  This had several effects:) The overall table length was improved by about  feet (again, adequate space for a pygmy marmoset, but we left ours at home and brought friends instead). ) All of the plates, glasses, silverware, etc were relocated as the tables were rotated.  No, no, don't bother moving things back to where they belong . . . we'll do that ourselves. ) The WIDTH of the table was now extra skinny and there was no room between my wine glass and the one accross the table. )  If you weren't one of the lucky  people sitting at the end of the table, you had the unparalelled pleasure of eating dinner with your plate sitting on the seam between two tables. In short (too late for that I suppose), when I make a reservation for , I expect a table for .  Cocoette provided a table for , and it detracted from our comfort and thus our enjoyment of the meal. Oh, and the food?  Adequate at best.  It wasn't bad; just unremarkable.  You have effectively unlimited choices on where to dine in San Francisco.  I recommend you choose elsewhere. This place is wonderful. The food is good and so is the atmosphere. I selected the Beef Tar Tar, Rotisserie, and Fondant. Five stars for each course! I'm a huge fan of Cocotte.  I arrived a little before my new culinary friend, Victoria C. , and took that time to enjoy a glass of wine. I explained what I was looking for and the nice man poured me exactly that. The owners/staff make you feel very welcome, like you are coming into their home. The space is small and intimate  perfect for a date! Victoria C. has beaten me to this review so I'll keep it short. We shared the ravioli for our appetizer.  It was delicious but I would probably order something else (like their rabbit ragu). Coq au vin was definitely the star of the meal. Traditionally made with chicken, root vegetables and potatoes. The sauce is TO DIE FOR. Beef wellington was good but didn't blow me away like the coq au vin did. Flaky pastry crust and quality meat cooked perfectly medium. Bonus points to them for that. We went for the apple tart for dessert. I would definitely recommend this! SO good! This place is so cute I want to stuff it in my pocket and take it home! I ate here for dinner on a Saturday night, and found the staff to be very friendly, accommodating, and French which only added to the cuteness factor. The menu had a wide variety of options, and you can find a lot of reasonably priced options if you're not in the mood for a large entree type dinner. We had the cheese plate (amazing), ravioli, and half roasted chicken with green beans. Everything was cooked well, and the chicken was moist and tasty. We didn't have room for the dessert, but from the other reviews, it sounds like we really missed out. Overall, a great little spot in a nice part of town. I'd gladly return, if only for some cheese and a glass of wine. Stopped by early last Saturday on whim with my brother in town and a friend.  It seemed that everwhere was busy and fully booked that night.  We popped into the newly opened Cocotte and were offered  seats at the bar.  This turned to be the best decision that day.  Wonderful service and all three of us were happy with our meals, coq au vin, / chicken and I had the wonderful  Farm Eggs Meurette (  poached in Pinot noir, bone marrow, brioche, frisee salad, raspberry vinaigrette) with the potato and goat cheese gratin.  Delicious!  We talked with the very enthusiastic owner afterwards and truly enjoyed the experience.  I will be back! Don't let the size of this place fool you!  Not only does its popularity fill up the joint after about  PM, but its food keeps them staying. My new friend Sara P. and I decided to try this place after it appeared on our ""New Places in San Francisco"" feed.  After I saw that they had Beef Wellington, I was instantly drawn in and wanted to try it so we thought we would try it together.  That's Yelp people for you.  Kind people that want to make friends and try good food.  My kind of people indeed.  You wanna make friends?  Join Yelp. It wasn't an easy feat though, considering our schedules and the fact that the holidays are almost upon us but it was sure worth the trip!The authentic French staff is so friendly and welcoming.  Get a drink at the bar first.  They have a great selection of wine and their specialty cocktail is a must try.  They don't have a cocktail list above and beyond this one drink, but this isn't really the place to sit and drink.  This is a place where you will be whisked away to South West France, where the food is good and the wine is plentiful. We tried the ravioli appetizer which was a bit different from traditional ravioli.  Much thinner.  Almost like a wonton.  It had some type of beef in it, as well as mushrooms.  I felt that there was too much lemon in the broth, not the ravioli, but it was still delicious.  Especially for an appetizer. The COQ AU VIN is a MUST try!  The sauce is so delectable and pairs really well with the Beef Wellington.  I recommend getting the Beef Wellington, eating half of it and mixing it with the COQ AU VIN sauce.  In fact, just request that they put the COQ AU VIN sauce with the Beef Wellington.  So delicious.  Back to the COQ AU VIN though, the meat was ok.  Dark meet that came with a few carrots and gratin potatoes.  Incredibly delectable.  I loved it. The Beef Wellington was cooked to perfection.  A flaky pastry puff filled with beef.  I got mine medium, which I don't normally do but I think for this dish you really need to get it this way.  Only because the pastry is so delicate that you need to the beef to be softer.  Too tough and it throws off the balance of the dish.  Comes with mashed potatoes and some sauce stuff that wasn't really as good as the COQ AU VIN.  So really, request the COQ AU VIN sauce!Dessert was good but I didn't want to eat too much so we got something light.  The GOLDEN DELICIOUS APPLE TART TATIN was the perfect amount of dessert.  Basically just baked apples with a very thin crust/pastry at the bottom.  The perfect end to your meal. I really enjoyed this place.  I had great company, I really got to know my new friend, atmosphere and menu weren't too intimidating, staff was great and the food was just so delicious. I highly recommend to anyone in San Francisco.  Whether you are visiting, have people visiting or just want a delicious holiday meal.  Try it.  You won't be disappointed. Amusez vous! J'adore cet endroit. Came here with a small group of friends on a Sunday evening and the restaurant was not crowded.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  Food was delicious and nicely presented.  We ordered the chicken liver pâté as our appetizer, sea bass, roasted quail and roasted duck breast as our entrees.  The chicken liver pâté accompanied with toasty bread and red onions with marsala jam was a pretty good substitute for the foie gras that is now banned in CA.  The quail was served in a cute little cast iron pan which well preserved the heat of the meat and kept the skin of the quail crisp with a delicious and not too heavy chanterelles mushroom and grapes stuffings.  The sea bass was grilled to the right texture, slightly crisp on the outside, moist in the center.  The typical oily consistency of the sea bass was not presented, the flavor was excellent.  Didn't try the roasted duck myself but from my friends' comments, it was well prepared and tasteful.  We also ordered their profiterolles (rhums and raisins ice cream on puffy pastry. . .  yum yum!!) and chocolate cake fondant (moist and flavorful) to finish our meal with a sweet and satisfying touch.  Price was reasonable and will definitely come back to try out some more of their dishes. I left a stellar review for the original, Hyde Street Bistro, and Cocotte continues to earn the five star distinction.  The service, food, and ambiance is impeccable for the reasonable price.  I arrived  minutes with a reservation for two, but they sat us without hesitation in a cozy nook in the back  perfect for a romantic dinner.  The server was a French gentleman who kept us entertained with his frank assessment of each dish.  We tried the rabbit ragu, which was to die for  easily six stars (out of five).  We also had the hand cut beef tartar, which was delicious, though following the rabbit, didn't overwhelm.  For the main, we died the / chicken rotisserie with three sauces with a size of brussel sprouts and french fries.  The chicken was deliciously moist, and the sauces gave us each something to love. We each had a glass of wine.  I wasn't too impressed with their wines by the glass menu, but can't speak to the bottles.  All together, I couldn't have asked for a better meal.  But then I got it  with dessert.  The banana creme brulee was perhaps the best thing I have ever eaten in my life.  Absolutely unbelievable  you must get it, no matter how full you are.  (see photo) Love, love love,Nice neighborhood gem.  Comfortable, good food,good company.  Unpretentious  country French, with wonderful food.  Definitely a return in the future. I was a little bummed originally when they rebranded as ""Cocotte"", as I was always a fan of the Hyde Street Bistro.  It was nice to be able to get some old school country French food amidst the preponderance of uninspired California/Continental cuisine in Russian Hill.  That said, we went to Cocotte last night for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised by the way they updated their concept without losing what made them unique in the neighborhood.  It's the same staff, % of whom are right off the boat from France.  They do an authentic French rotisserie chicken, which sadly we did not sample but will certainly do the next time.  They also put a bar up front with a focus on generally inexpensive French wines and cocktails. We tried the lamb ravioli appetizer, which was excellent. Truly differentiated and perfectly done.  For dinner, my wife got the sole special, which was prepared lightly breaded and pan sauteed.  Light and delicious.  It was like taking the classic sole meuniere and making it lighter for the California palate.  I ordered a duck breast with fig slices and some kind of pork belly crisps.  Obviously super rich and over the top, but as to be expected.  At $ it was a steal.  We got the Brussels sprouts side dish, which was a tad salty for out tastes. The wine list looked interesting too, but I was getting over a cold and my wife is pregnant, so we did not get a chance to sample any.  It's mainly inexpensive bottles from the big name regions and vintages, where it's always fun to look for value.  Bordeaux, Rhones, Sancerre, etc.  Looking forward to trying them all out on the next visit. Great food  great prices  excellent service  minus one star for being a bit salty or it would be a five. So let me start by saying I'm a bit jaded to this whole process as someone who both works in the industry and finds that far more people endeavor upon this just to vent their ""justifiable"" rage than actually provide an objective review; though I am aware that objective review is basically an oxymoron. With that said I will now join the throngs who need to have their voices heard in hopes that I can be part of a solution to this problem. My wife and I have been trying to find a reasonably priced high quality place near our neighborhood (Tenderloin) with no luck. During a walk one day we stumbled across Cocotte, which granted isn't quite our neighbor, and surrounded by other establishments that I know are of good repute. Either way it was walking distance so we gave it a shot. Definitely worth it. The place is a quaint (ten tables and and a small bar) French place known for its Rotisserie. When we walked in the host was very pleasant and sat us in a dining room that was a bit dated looking, but I think that was the intent. Ill take dark and minimalistic over obnoxiously modern anyday (pardon the overt subjectivity. )The server took a little while to approach the table, but he was clearly busy. Now I understand that the server in me is making excuses for what is a poor decision in staffing, but I say this more to point out that he was working hard opposed to just being nonchalant or lax. The server took our wine order and while I couldn't ascertain his level of knowledge for wine because he was rushing, the pleasant host/manager was happy to talk to us about the bottle. The wine was great though the glasses were a bit underwhelming. I don't mean to nit pick but nice service vessels, of all sort, are a touch that really makes a different in the overall aesthetic appreciation of a restaurant. Cocotte really could use an upgrade here. My wife and I are a bit gluttonous when we dine out so we ordered our standard three apps, two entrees and a side. Apps: Cabernet poached egg on brioche with bone marrow, a sheeps milk ricotta salad with beets, and chicken liver mousse. ) all three were very good, with the poached egg being the highlight, liver is hard to botch which makes its execution actually a bit scary but they nailed it. Park Tavern has the best but this was very good. The salad was tasty but nothing to really espouse about. Entrees: Beef Wellington, Rotisserie Chicken and a side of Cauliflower. The Wellington was very good, the meat was cooked properly and the pastry was perfectly textured, I would have liked the sauce to have a bit more vibrancy to offset a dish the is a bit muted by its nature, but once again just a preference not meant to really be a criticism. The chicken was great, it's not easy to ensure with chicken that it retains its flavor once you go sub dermal. This chicken had flavor to the bone.  It came with three sauces: Bordelaise,creamy porcini, and roasted bell pepper. All three were tasted though the bell pepper seemed out of place. Cauliflower was salty but good. We skipped dessert. Opting to imbibe a bit more. All together our experience was very good. The food was consistent, tasty and well executed. The service was friendly though a bit rushed. Our bill was less than a $.  for everything. Well worth a visit. Like reuniting with a long lost friend, having a great meal just a stroll down the street was very welcome.  Been a fan of the Hyde Street Bistro for years and was excited to see them reopen their doors (new huge sliding glass doors) and be greeted by one of the warmest and most welcoming maître d' in the city, Philip!   The new setup has the entire experience spill out on to Hyde Street, great for warm evenings! It also provides a more open feel and the bar area is very enjoyable.  Not to mention the food. . . beef tar tar, butter lettuce salad (great dressing!), the scallops are fantastic and don't forget the profiteroles (to die for) to finish things off. I'm so happy this place is right in my neighborhood! Spent an awesome Saturday night filling up on wine and beef fat :) Cocotte has taken on the modern, causal, hip atmosphere, but instead of struggling to find new permutations of brentwood corn, heirloom tomatoes, and little gem lettuces like every other new SF restaurant, this place is making tried and true french bistro food. And it was so refreshing to see!RECOMMEND: Farm Eggs ""Meurette"" is a beautiful thing.  Perfectly poached, wine soaked egg to spread on brioche toast with some roasted bone marrow. I know bone marrow is having a moment in SF restaurants right now, and I think this might be the best version I've had. I know egg yolk and bone marrow sounds a little overkill, but they work together beautifully! Tartar with quail egg: great! Flavorful, but not over seasoned so you can still taste the meat. Steak Frites: perfectly medium rare, juicy rib eye and deliciously crispy salty fries for dipping in all that green peppercorn meat juice. Simple. Happy. Apple Tarte Tatin: More like a soft apple cake than the flatter tart I was expecting, but it was delicious! Love the simple sauce of creme fraiche.  Paired it with white dessert wine (of a name I had never seen before and of course forgot). ATMOSPHERE:  I really like the casual atmosphere. Have to walk through the kitchen to go to the restroom. . . which I like for some reason. It was a little noisy.  We ended up opting for seats at the bar since we were afraid we wouldn't be able to hear each other if there was a table between us. *Bar seating could be improved a great deal if there were coat hooks under the bar!  Purse and jacket just ended up in a pile on the floor. . . . : /SERVICE: A little disorganized upon our arrival. Although we made a reservation, they table wasn't quite ready.  We opted to sit at the bar, so there's no telling how long the wait might have been.  Bartender was very enthusiastic and friendly, but I had I had to help him out a bit and request menus and a wine list on my own. Since they just opened, this is totally understandable and I'm sure this will quickly improve. I used to come here back when it was Hyde Street Bistro, they had the best happy hour mussels, but for dinner the place was a bit too stuffy before, for me, at least. . . NOW, it has been remodeled (same great chef) with more of a rustic modern feel, and the restaurant itself looks great. . The feeling you get when you walk in there is much more appealing than before. . As for the food and service this is where the  stars come in. I decided to try a lobster arugula salad they had as a special that night which was very tasty and not too pricy, and then I had the beef tartar. I had the beef tartar there once before and it wasn't that great, but I noticed that they had it with a quail's egg this time (instead of a regular egg) so I wanted to see if the makeover of Hyde street Bistro to Cocotte was also in the new recipes or just the restaurant itself too. The beef tartar was exquisite! It was already mixed with the spices that are normally served on the side, and I thought they did a perfect job on it. I hope that they don't change the beef tartar! It was really, really delicious. I also had a couple of glasses of wine, the white I think was a pinot blanc, which was pretty good, and the red, was perfect. It was a Syrah, I think, from Oregon. The red wine was absolutely delicious and reasonably priced. Although, I did end up leaving there with two apps, two glasses of wine, and a dessert for about $.  (not including tip), so, it is definitely a splurge for me, not an every day thing (although if they had a slightly larger selection of cheaper wine I might be there every week!). Now, I know that the chef (and I think owner as well?) is the same, and he has shined with his exceptional taste and knowledge in french food, but I have to give credit where it is due to the wait staff as well. The cheery Host at the door with a helpful and kind demeanor greeted me with a big ""Bon soir"" and sat me at the (new and improved) bar. And my server/bartender Phillipe exceeded my expectations as a server. He was knowledgeable, patient, and extremely friendly but let me enjoy my meal as well, and made my dinner so pleasant! Really, he made the whole experience so much better! I have had him as my server once before when it was H. S. B. and he has always been absolutely perfect. I am so happy that they re did the place and I can't wait to come back for the mussels, and to try one of their delicious looking main dishes as well! Good job to whoever designed the place! It was definitely a good move. Even the bathroom looks better!I will be back soon!Bon Apetit!"
Monsieur Benjamin|4.0|French in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|146|-1|3.75|" If you ask me, i'll tell you : ""don't eat here, it's a bad idea""But in my mind, i'm saying: ""MUAHAHHAHHA, no one will get to enjoy this delicious food except for me!!""The food  super sexy. I wanted to roll around the floor in pure Ecstasy. Though I felt pretty barbaric eating them hunks of bone marrow, trying to suck every bit of succulent fat. Left my chin nice and shiny. . . i'll probably get a bunch of zits now, but it's well worth it. The quail, seriously? Like OH MAH GAH. . . eyes rolling back into my head kind of deliciousness. I also had the mussels. I really wanted to just take the bowl and slurp all the broth as if it were cereal milk but that would have been too fat man of me. The service was friendly and helpful. Ugh, I wish I could have Monsieur Benjamin for dinner every night, but then I'd end up being  lbs and have to wash myself with a stick and a rag. Parisian bistro with a modern twist. Reminded me of my favorite things from Paris. The fresh seafood, the wine, the richness of bistro food was all reminiscent of Paris. I enjoyed the fresh patter, bone marrow and the steak frites for a walk down memory lane. The steak tartare was spectacular as well as the fresh sea urchin. Waitstaff was attentive and helpful. .  stars. Rarely do I have a meal where everything is seasoned and cooked perfectly, but this was precisely the case during my dinner here. We ordered a smorgasbord of smaller dishes  sea urchin, frog legs, escargot, sweetbreads, chicken liver terrine, and shared one entree steak frites. To my surprise, every single dish was excellent. My favorites were the frog legs and steak frites  the former was deep fried in a honey like batter and the latter consisted of the most tender medium rare steak accompanied by a mountain of crispy fries. I ate so much that one might have mistakenly thought I was preggers, but NO. I really hope not. Knock on wood. Rabbit on the menu, seriously? What year is this? .  stars. I have been here twice and the dishes can be a bit hit and miss. % are fantastic. % solid. And % is too experimental  novel but missing the mark somehow. So when you come here, you would want to know what to order to avoid the % (subject to your taste of course). Some of the dishes can be quite rich, I would share wherever possible and balance some of heavier more meaty more buttery ones with lighter dishes on the menu. The ambience of this place is fantastic with amazing service. The tables around the door can get a bit cold given the open architecture and glass wall on one entire facade. I love the situation of the chefs and kitchen staffs being ""one"" with the patrons of the restaurant. The service is always excellent with fantastic staff. Added bonus  open until am. I heard a lot of the restaurant staff in SF come here to eat after their shift. The best dishes:Escargot bordelaise  after living in Paris for  months, I am super critical of escargot and these are pretty spectacular. Not rubbery, not too greasy or too drenched in sauce. Just perfect texture and balance of subtle flavors. The mushroom duxelles added another level of complexity that are not often used in traditional dishes. Chicken and vegetable soup  seemingly a simple dish but with a lot of aroma and depth of flavor that showcase the best in Californian produce. Solid dishes:Chicken terrine  served with fluffy brioche bread. I like my terrine on a slightly harder surface with a bit of crunch and less sweetness in the bread. But this version is solid and made with care and thought. Palmier ice cream with caramel  creamy smooth ice cream without being too doused in caramel. Liked this one quite a bit. Good for sharing. Dishes that can be skipped:Quail a la chasseur  we ordered this without knowing that this is stuffed with cabbage. I am not a huge fan of stuffed birds but if you like a stuffed turkey, this may be your thing. Steak tartare  I have had a lot of versions of steak tartare. This one looked great on presentation from the kitchen but just totally missed the mark. The gooey sous vide egg yolks were not very complimentary to the steak tartare and added a heaviness to the dish. Do we suppose to bind the steak pieces together with the yolk? The gooey pieces were so overwhelmingly abundant in the dish that it ruined an otherwise solid steak tartare dish that would have been a bit lighter and appreciative of the natural flavor of an excellent piece of beef. I'm a big fan of Corey Lee's food I love his restaurant Benu.  So, along with a couple of my friends, we'd been bugging him about when Monsieur Benjamin was going to open for a while.  A friend & I were walking through the neighborhood before they opened & figured out where the restaurant was located, so we were trying to peek in between the boards at the restaurant in progress hidden behind them.  So, needless, to say, some of us had been waiting with bated breath for the opening. I'm finally writing this review because a friend who is dining there this evening asked me what to order. So, I got the opportunity to dine at the soft opening back in July, then at my next visit, a bunch of us tried to dine before a going to a show in the area, but it was crazy busy, so we weren't able to dine as walk ins, but we ended up coming back later that night after the show for drinks.  Otherwise, I've had the chance to return two other times since for dinner, sharing food with my dining buddies, so I've had a chance to sample a large portion of the small dishes on the menu, which is classic French Bistro fare. Here's a list of what I've tried so far. . . Beausoleil & Shigoku oysters Plateau oysters, shrimp, crab Pickled vegetables Oeufs Mayonnaise Camembert Beignets Potato & Leek Croquettes Frog Legs in Aigre Doux warning for the squeamish that the legs still have feet attached & come in a container like pencils in a cup Chicken Wings Persillade Rabbit Rilettes Pate de Campagne Steak Tartare Seafood Sausage Escargots Bordelaise Beef tongue Dijonnaise Sweetbreads Grenobloise Marrow Bones ""Blue Ribbon"" Blanquette de Veau Lobster Ragout w/ Spaghetti, Mirepoix, Fine Herbs unfortunately, I don't think this made to the menu, but it was really good. Duck Confit & Sausage Steak Frites Lemon Tarte Crepe Facon Gateau Gateau Marjolaine w/ Creme Anglaise Sorbets Palmier Ice CreamCocktails/Drinks My Morning Sun The Ace Dagger of the Day Bordelet Brut Tendre CiderAll of the food & drinks have been fantastic.  I believe there is some crossover with the Benu staff, such as Benu's master sommelier Yoon Ha taking care of the beverage program and pastry chef Courtney Schmidig doing desserts for both Benu & Monsieur Benjamin.  The place has a modern feel to it, with lots of glass.  The outside walls of the place are predominantly glass, including glass doors.  The bar is in the middle & divides the dining area into two rooms.  I also like the fox logo. Service is pleasant & accommodating.  The last time I was there, we were a party of  initially, but then a friend joined us partway through the meal, & added the  top next to our group on so that we wouldn't be too squished.  Granted, it was late in the evening & no longer gangbusters, & that table had cleared out, so they had the table to spare. It's open late (til am), so it's a great addition to the few late night dining options here in the city!  And if you want to walk in, I recommend doing it later in the evening, not during peak dining hours.  But yeah, it's been busy since they opened, & getting reservations isn't that easy unless you plan ahead or dine on the later side. Restrooms:  single room restrooms, one for men, one for women, with a communal sink areaParking:  street parking or garages nearby Located on the northwest corner of Gough & Ivy. Beautiful marble bar and tasty cocktails.  Scrumptious deviled eggs and porcini powder camembert beignets. I think there are literally  staff people for each diner.  Service is uber. But, intentionally very traditional French style cuisine = meh. Honestly, I thought this place was pretty overrated. My sister and I stopped by for a pm seating after the opera on a Saturday night. The place was still pretty packed. I enjoyed my duck confit, but you can get just as good a rendition at Chez Papa Bistro. The complimentary bread and butter was tasty, but you have to ask for it. THe other entree we tried, some sort of flounder with gnocchi and a lobster sauce was odd tasting. So odd tasting that we didn't finish it. Our side of potato and artichoke gratin was cheesy and rich, but would have been better with a dish. The only saving grace was the dessert we got: a hazelnut, praline, and chocolate cake with creme anglaise. That was quite delicious, but also really pricey at $. . I think that the decor is beautiful and rather striking with the hanging Edison bulbbs, and the service is good, but if you're all about the food, there are better French places in SF to visit. Delicious food and great service!Our evening started of with good luck. We were waiting for our table at the bar and the bartender offered us  free aperitifs that he accidentally made. The dinner was fantastic and the service easy. No Absinthe pretension here. We went there on Monday night but it was enormously busy and waited a little bit to sit at the bar. I was really glad we were seated quickly even we didn't make any reservation. Well, waiter( bartender) asked us what to drink and start taking orders. He seemed enthusiastic and knows a lot about dishes. Chicken liver, beef tongue and oyster was amazingly delicious but so small ;). But it's price deserves their service and restaurant atmosphere. I would give them  star for food and  Starr for service. We came here for  times in the last month or so on Saturday. I ordered the mussels and fries. They were delicious! My hubby got their roasted chicken and it was great. The meat was tender and crispy skin. We also got the chicken soup (just love it!) again as a starter and the ice cream for dessert. The whole bill including  drinks came to $ something including a % tips.  We couldn't get a rsvp because it was an opera night but we showed up right before they open for dinner and got seated right away when they open. Service is impeccable again. I've had the burger, french dip, pork rib, and the epoisses toast. Great wine list. Highly recommend the burger or the pork rib. The epoisses is SO MUCH. . . somehow I feel a little dirty after eating it. It's a must every time though. The ambience was great.   It felt very bustling and trendy; a stylish place to be seen.  Great wine list.  I also love that they serve food until am, but the actual food was just meh.  My table shared the escargot, camembert beignets, frog legs (for some adventure), vegetable coquettes, and pickle plate.  I had the roast beef dip sandwich.  All of it just ok. Where were you when we did it?When our Giants did our every other year thing and clinched #torture #dontstopbelievin the  World Series. I was right here chewing on a frog leg while being served by Colonel Sanders mullethawk kitchen dude and Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter socks waitress. Entire resto resounded with clapping. Next up, let's go Giants World Series ! Food: Service: Ambiance: Butter Lettuce Salad: fresh, acidic, light, good but nothing spectacularMarrow Bones ""Blue Ribbon"": delicious and indulgent, but unfortunately of our three bones only two really had any sort of marrow, and we were disappointed that this was not checked more closelyArctic Char Amandine: standout dish of the night, fish cooked perfectly and so flavorfulPomme Frites with Aioli: really subpar, nothing specialPalmier Ice Cream Calvados Caramel: unique and delicious dessert, love the palmier cookie touchOverall impressions were that the food was okay but underwhelming for all the hype and a little overpriced.  The service was friendly but a bit slow.  We loved the open kitchen and being able to see all the activity.  Our dinner did not leave us itching to return and try Monsieur Benjamin's other offerings, but overall an enjoyable meal. Like:The small plates we shared were delicious: frog legs, mussels, croquettes, beignetscocktailsatmosphere/spacelocation near several bars if you want a night cap afterwardsDislike:small portions for high costparking in neighborhood can be a hot mess on a weekend night Small plates with big prices. The food was good and service was great. Chips w/ chicken liver moose This was really yummy. I love how they put a ton of chives. Super light and flavorful. Mussels They actually gave alot and it was really goodThe lobster pasta very meaty. Something different, but really goodThe burger with fries Cooked perfectly, but nothing special. I like that the fries are skinny fries. Got a side of grilled little gem lettuce we needed our veges. This has so much flavor. Dessert Lemon Tart perfect dish to end the meal! I really liked the atmosphere and decor of the place. The food was not amazing per se, there were a few dishes where we really liked. We had:Steamed mussels: SOO GOOD. The mussels were perfectly cooked, and the sace is so flavorfulSteak tartare: a little bland, but the presentation was goodLiver mousse: also bland, but i'll take it since there are no more foie gras :( Bone marrow: good. I'll order it again. The entrees were steak frites & artic char, both were good but not phenomenal. I would come here again for the appetizers. Had a decadent but not overly filling meal at monsieur benjamin with a few friends. Among the three of us, we shared and loved (all were great but in particular recommend the first four listed): the crispy duck confit with sausage; the duck skin was crisped so perfectly, and I loved the duck with the gravy served on the side bone marrow (tasty with the preserve, but also just tastes delicious by itself) escargot (the snails were blanketed with a lightly breaded garlic and butter layer  yum!) frog legs (fried in slightly sweet batter; loved the presentation and thought it tasted great too) the pork rib  pretty good, but not as amazing as everything else was the crepe gateau for dessert; a unique combination of crunchy, cold, and meringueAmbiance was wonderful; dusky lighting for the diners, and bright lights over the open kitchen, with a beautiful bar lined with wine bottles to set the scene. Loved that they seated me even though my whole party wasn't there. ""Do whatever floats your boat, as long as it doesn't sink mine. ""  I've really grown to love this quote and try to follow it, though taking this to heart may still have negative consequences.  I was trying to keep in mind when I was trying um. . not to ease drop or judge what I think was a couple sitting next to me.  We were trying to figure that out, I heard arguing and mention of another woman the dude was dating, but they'd be all flirty and then yelling at each other, and blah blah.  Anywho. . yes, Monsieur Benjamin looks to be a good people watching place, also helps when the tables are really close together.  Onto the food. . I've always wanted to try Benu, but am glad to see Cory Lee open up Monsieur Benjamin, and plus I do love some good French fare.  We shared the Potato & Leek Croquette & Gruyere with Herb Creme Fraiche ($).  I ordered the Duck Confit w/Sausage, Prunes, Turnip & Sauce Au Poivre ($), and he got the Roast Chicken w/Frisee & au ju ($).  We initially held off on sides, but were pretty hungry after our appetizers and looked the portions when we got our entrees and decided on the pommes frites with aioli ($).  The croquettes were indeed categorized correctly under the small bites section. They were small and a lot lighter than other croquette and risotto balls we've had before.  Everyone was right about the portions being small here.  Though  out of  times I have a small appetite, I only started to get full as our fatty butts were walking to Schulzie's afterwards.  My duck confit was excellently prepared, I did dip some meat a couple times in the gravy, but it didn't even need it. The skin was perfectly crisp and the meat moist.  It was only a quarter though.  I did enjoy the well seasoned meaty sausage.  The prunes weren't my thing though and the greens were fine though a little bitter.  He enjoyed his chicken as well, though moist, he wished that the majority of the skin was crispier.  The au ju sauce was excellent as well.  He also got a class of red wine ($). The pommes frites were seasoned perfectly and some were super crispy.  Loved the aioli and well made pommes frites like this are always a wonderful comfort food.  Our original waitress left for the night shortly after we finished our croquettes, so not much going on our end, but service from our relieving waiter was great.  I like the mod sexy decor and the huge glass windows of MB, but it's a very loud restaurant and I didn't like how close the tables were together.  The food was delicious and the quality is there, but I think the price is still a bit high for what you get.  I would not mind coming back, but honestly, we preferred our meals at Absinthe across the street more. I was expecting a lot more.  But maybe it was because I was comparing this place to Benu which is just. . . Actually there's no words to say about Benu.  I did love the food.  You can see what Cory Lee is trying to accomplish on the plate and menu by providing us the guest his version of French cuisine with a modern day twist. The only problem with the restaurant is the smug servers and the rude hostess. Monsieur Benjamin does not look like your classic Parisien brasserie.  It's very modern, very glass and steel and dark wood look.  It's also quite noisy, which may or may not be a bad thing. We shared some beausoleil oysters which were good.  The escargots were wonderfully cooked.  Even my  year old enjoyed them.  The mussels were large and generous.  Crab Remoulade did not look like a large dish but was actually quite substantial.  Camermbert beignets were not what I was expecting: I was thinking gooey cheesy fried doughs, but in actuality they looked more biscuit like and had a strong salt and pepper flavor.  I was hoping for more of a doughy texture.  My husband raved about his duck confit.  Prices are very reasonable, but dishes are on the small side. So don't hesitate to order a few small plates to share. The food is fabulous, and the atmosphere is just the right mix of casual and fancy for a weekend dinner. We loved everything we ordered. The veggie pickles were refreshing and a fun way to begin dinner.  The chicken and grain soup was comforting and delicious. The grilled lettuces were amazing. My burger was also perfectly cooked, and my husband enjoyed his arctic char very much.  All in all, M. Benjamin is a lovely addition to the neighborhood, and we will no doubt eat here again. We walked in at about :pm after a SF Symphony concert for dinner. They were able to seat us with no resevation on a Friday night with little wait time. Great wine selection  I went with the Cote d Rhone and also we had the Fronsac. A mixed platter of the  different oysters to start were incredibly fresh. Vegetable pickles and olives were delicious. A good serving size of the steamed mussels, gluten free along with the best pommes frites and aioli. We also had the pork ribs which were incredible. Big kudos to the wait staff and maitre d who were very friendly and did not have the airs and graces that some fine restaurants exude. Definitely coming back :) .  STARSI've been meaning to try Monsieur Benjamin since they opened. When I found a table for two on OpenTable at pm on a weekday, I immediately took the reservation. Drinks:*The Ace: rye, calvados, sloe gin, honey, lemon, rosemary ($. )*Cotes du rhone, la manarine  ($)*Pinot noir, rossi wallace, napa  ($)The Ace was nice and refreshing. Very light. Was contemplating another cocktail after the ace, but ended up having wine with dinner instead. Both reds were good and paired well with what we ordered. *Steak tartare: egg yolk, pissaladiere lavish ($. ) Pretty to look at, but I found this bland. I wish there were pepper on the table since I wanted to add some. There is salt on the table, so do not mistake it as pepper and oversalt this dish like I did!*Escargots bordelaise: mushroom duxelles, garlic, parsley ($. ) The best part about Escargots is the garlic parsley butter! This version had more of a parsley paste which I didn't care for. *Sweetbreads grenobloise: sweet onion, capers, brown butter ($. ) The only dish that seemed to have balance. The richness of the butter, the freshness of the green, the crispy texture of the sweetbreads. It all worked well together. *Marrow bones ""blue ribbon"": bacon marmalade, country bread ($) Huge! You get  big bones. Definitely a nice portion! Almost too much marrow for just two people. But I love bone marrow, so the roommate and I finished it all!*Steak frites: jus aux herbes, watercress, sauce choron ($) I loved the steak. It melted in my mouth. Perhaps it was wagyu? The fries were also nice. A little bit on the salty side, but I enjoyed them. *Mediterranean sea bass: leeks, mushrooms, sauce genevoise ($) I thought I'd love this since I love sea bass, leeks and mushrooms. But the fish skin tasted burnt. Didn't leave a pleasant aftertaste in my mouth. *Lemon tart: mint chantilly ($. ) I enjoyed this. Tart with a hint of sweetness! Just the way I like my lemon tarts!Be sure to ask for bread if you want some. They don't automatically give it to you. Parking here is horrendous. We got lucky since we showed up right before pm. Got a spot on the side street next to Monsieur Benjamin after circling around a couple of times. Some solid dishes, but others didn't quite deliver. I would love to come back and try their other offerings. I was eyeing a bunch of them. Next time! Fabulous fabulous fabulous. Brasserie style food with a light hand. Everything we had was a winner: started with the Ace (rye, sloe gin, rosemary and lemon) + my dining partner had the Dagger of a Day (bitters, cognac almost grapefruity in taste). Both really well done croquettes: simple and great camembert beignets: surprisingly light mussels: dear god, delicious broth bone marrow: scraped those bones dry (fantastic bread too) arctic char amandine: perfectly cooked all around, crisp halved almonds on top steak tartare: absolutely divine. I walked past the kitchen on the way to the bathroom and saw the chef piping egg into the tartare, I mean turn down for whaOur server couldn't be more helpful or pleasant, and the front of house was on it too. This is brasserie done super sexy, an ideal spot for a date, a seat by yourself at the bar, a night before the opera or symphony. It's a Michael Jordan from the free throw line slam dunk. Way over rated.  I don't mind expensive if the value is there.  It is not at Monsieur Benjamin.  Food was good but nothing extraordinary.  Frog legs were cold.  Beiignets were pathetically bad. The long waits between courses were not the fault of our server, who was excellent.  Check came  hours into the meal as we were finishing deserts.  A few seconds later, the front of the house manager arrives at our table and starts removing dessert plates. 'Um, excuse me,"" says the wife.  ""I'm not quite finished. ""  The front man says, ""There's nothing left but whip cream"" and tosses the plate back down. on the table.  If they want quicker turns of the tables maybe they should work on timing the courses.   Good bye Kitty. My boyfriend and I came here on Halloween night for our anniversary. My boyfriend had heard of Corey Lee's new restaurant and really wanted to check it out. The ambiance is very simple and clean with lovely lightbulb fixtures hanging from the ceiling that put off a warm glow. The open kitchen adds an element for those curious to watch the processes and techniques of the chefs. We also really appreciated how approachable the staff was and the humble attitudes they displayed. We ordered the butter lettuce salad, steamed mussels, and the bone marrow, all of which were fantastic but slightly under seasoned. The portion sizes were very generous and we left feeling perfectly full from three starters and a bottle of wine. The next night (last night), we decided to return as we were both craving more bone marrow and we really enjoyed the time we spent there the night before. We showed up again without a reservation around  pm and were sat right away. A man with a French accent made us feel very welcome and was very hospitable. We ordered the steak tartare, the butter lettuce salad, and of course, the bone marrow. Again, we felt that everything was just slightly under seasoned. The steak tartare craved pickles or acid of some sort and the butter lettuce salad needed a pinch of salt to make it pop. When the bone marrow arrived, it was a major disappointment. Each of the three canoe shaped bones were missing about half of the marrow. Either the bones were overcooked and the marrow melted out or the bones were simply the runts of the case and lacked significant marrow. When we expressed our dismay to the waiter, he seemed hesitant to remedy the problem (but he did). He proceeded to explain that, ""it is the luck of the draw, you win some you lose some. . . "" We are bone marrow fiends and my boyfriend is also a chef of ten years. We have had a case of bone marrow bones in the freezer from time to time and are quite familiar with the product. Some bones are bountiful and some bones are skimpy. However, I find it ludicrous for restaurants of this caliber to not be able to achieve consistency. Even if you do ""win some or lose some,"" in a case of bone marrow, it should never be the customer losing. When a cook pre roasts the marrow for the night, he/she should discard the skimpy bones that aren't suitable for a paying guest. Feed them to the staff if you have to. We still really love this restaurant and will be back, however, the hesitancy in our waiter to meet our desires and his verbal response was stunning. Consistency in a restaurant is vital to its success. Having experienced superb and plentiful marrow the night before and returning to receive half the portion was weak sauce. Aside from this encounter, the waiter was a great waiter and we thoroughly enjoyed his service the night before. Great new place in Hayes Valley. Order the burger and the ice cream dessert. The chicken dish is also great  heavily smoked, so a unique taste. Great service. I was excited to try this new restaurant by Chef Lee, but I wasn't very impressed. Came with fiancé tonight with :pm reservation. It's pricey for okay good food. Service was okay/unremarkable. Most blown away by the half shell Shigoku oysters that were raw. Escargots were nice! and lemon tart was tart, the way we like. We also ordered the chicken liver pate and fried frog legs. . . eh nothing really special. For main entree, we order the artic char amandine fish was cooked perfectly, but I think the sauce was a bit rich. Customer service is alright, waitress was not super friendly, but was attentive. Noise level was pretty high. Service  .  stars  it was pleasant and efficient but neither warm nor friendlyWines by the glass   stars  they had  options for bubblies by the glass and both were terrible.  $ and $ per glass?  It tasted like something that is only served at happy hour for $ a glass. . . . . and even then I wouldn't drink it.  Cotes de Rhone red is also dull and boring.  The Som needs to be replaced. Food   stars. Frog Legs   stars nicely fried but frankly not particularly interesting. Though I did think the presentation devilishly funny with the little legs sticking out. . Beef Tongue   stars  tongue itself was not interesting (it had the consistency of Spam) and the goo they put on it made it worse (think Spam with a can of creamy vegetable sauce). Arctic Char main  .  stars  fish was cooked perfectly and the first few bites were delicious.  But as the meal progressed, it became very apparent that the dish was a little too greasyThis would be a good place for dinner before/after opera/symphony but I would not go out of my way for it. Overrated. Overpriced. Overdone. We had an awful meal here. Just awful, and we were hungry nearly right after because the portions were tiny. I think this place is set up to catch the net of rich tech, but it was just a terrible place and we won't be going back. Arrogant service as well. Go down the street to Absenthe. We learned our lesson and will go there next time first. Cool vibe, but the food overpriced and hype was overrated. Everything was fresh but I was underwhelmed by the taste of the food. The one dish I do recommend is the bone marrow. Still deciding if I'd give this place another whirl. Ever since x featured Monsieur Benjamin (twice!), I've wanted to try Monsieur Benjamin out. And I was quite pleased with everything we ordered. It's a solid ""New American"" with a French twist restaurant (but aren't all new restaurants in SF with a French twist, ""New American""?"" hah). The camembert beignets  little pockets of cheesy goodness. A must order as an appetizer. Arctic char amandine  yum yum yum! The fish was so tender and the toasted almonds gave it so much more flavor. I originally wanted the lobster ragout (but the ragout is pre made  blah and has meat in it : (), but I had a teensy bite of lobster from my friend and I'd have to say, Arctic char amandine all the way!Gateau mariolaine  I'd pass on this again, but then again, I'm not a fan of coffee and this was mixed in with some coffee if I can recall correctly. Crepe facon gateau  really light and yummy, I quite enjoyed this. Palmier ice cream  YUM. Palmiers are so good, and palmier ice cream, even better!Side note: I did not eat all three desserts by myself : ). My husband and I love this place!We always have to go on dates late at night, and more than often our date nights happen very last minute, so it's never that easy to find a nice restaurant to go to. The first time we went there, it was actually our second restaurant of the night :) We weren't satisfied with our first so we went on yelp to see what other restaurants that were still open at that hour (I believe it was sometime after pm), and sure enough MB came up first. I wasn't sure if I should trust Corey Lee again since I did not enjoy Benu, but I was very happy with this place. This is a pretty casual place, at the time we went, it was very easy to find parking, and without a reservation, we were seated right away. Here are what I think of what we ordered (for the three times we've been there):Awesome dish Sea urchin, chicken liver, beef tartar, steam mussels, sweetbreads, and marrow bones (a bit too greasy, should order when there are more than  people)Good dish  Escargot Dessert  I enjoyed the palmier ice cream and my husband, who likes sour stuff, enjoyed the lemon tartFor the raw dish, they are just simply fresh. How can you go wrong with them? Anyways, I am only giving it a  stars because I have not yet tried any of the main dish because every time I go, it's pretty late. Definitely after dinner time. But so far it seems promising to me and I will definitely try them later. I guess we went on amateur night or something.  I had high hopes for this restaurant considering I had just gone to Bistrot Urchin and was thinking I was going to enjoy this place a lot more.  But that wasn't the case.  Had reservations for a Friday night and surprisingly the restaurant wasn't all that packed at :p, which was surprising because there were no available reservations.  The hostess seemed kind of stiff and cold when we walked in.  Congrats to Corey Lee for his new Michelin stars at Benu, I think they're well deserved.  But I can't help feeling that he's kind of phoning it in  with this restaurant.  Our entrees came out lukewarm, which is a pet peeve.  For this price point and the caliber of the chef, come on. . . bring the food out while it's still hot.   The food itself wasn't anything to write home about, it tasted under seasoned. Our waiter seemed distracted and wasn't at all attentive.  There were a lot of restaurant staff walking about and I couldn't quite tell what they were all doing, especially since they weren't packed at all.  They just seemed to be milling about actually.  With both Absinthe and Chez Maman nearby, I'm not sure this restaurant adds anything interesting nor new to the area. The name sounds like Hercule Poirot's lost lost stepbrother who has been accused of murdering Madame Lafarge with a penknife behind the armoire. Mon dieu, j'accuse Monsieur Benjamin! Mais non, it is master chef Corey Lee's latest culinary venture, a casual brasserie that is anything but casual in execution. In fact, Lee's immaculate culinary skills  so beautifully presented at Benu  can't help but inform this stylish new spot in Hayes Valley. He brought in Jason Berthold of RN to assist, and the results are most worthwhile even if there was a glitch or two along the way. As you would expect from Lee, the space is sleek and modern, not as minimal as Benu but more open and with definitely the same contemporary vibe that's like a porn palace for any salivating foodie (photo: bit. ly/DzQO). Jamie W. took me here for my birthday. Wasn't that nice of him? No Chipotle burrito bowl that night. The menu is still on a piece of folded paper, but it was chock full of appetizing delights, but first, Parisian style cocktails were in order. Jamie went for the $ Pass the Hat, a tantalizing mix of aged rum, Aperol, Fino sherry, Bonal (an apperitif) and lime (photo: bit. ly/tYHpjz). Not a huge kick there but refreshing. I preferred mine, the $ Special Forces, an ideal blend of calvados, sweet vermouth, apple and walnut that was smooth and naughty at the same time (photo: bit. ly/sKtCB). No amuse bouche for us that evening, so we started our meal with a petit plat, the $.  Pommes Gaufrette with Whipped Chicken Liver (photo: bit. ly/qYYJe). They were lightly crisp potatoes prepared in a waffle like fashion and accompanied by a creamy pâté covered in chives. Delicious and most addictive. Those taters honestly would have tasted good with Lipton's French onion dip mix. However, the star of the evening came early for a change, the $ Steamed Mussels with MB Bière and Garlic Sausage (photo: bit. ly/ZppnyH). A healthy portion arrived, and the mussels were fresh and succulent. The beer lent a nice accent to the seaworthy broth as the sautéed garlic sausage was crumbled all about. Dare I say that these may be the best mussels in the city, and I've had plenty in my day. What's rather ironic was that the entrees were not quite as singularly sensational, the flaw in raising the bar a bit too high. Jamie ordered modestly, the $.  French Dip Sandwich, shards of fresh roast beef served in a torpedo roll with horseradish and melted Gruyère (photo: bit. ly/tqip). The sandwich was a modest creation, nothing to write home about except that the au jus had a nice earthy body to it. The $ Pommes Frites that Jamie ordered as a side were surprisingly drab even with the full lubrication of the aioli (photo: bit. ly/tYHMdZ). I ordered the $ Lobster Ragoût, which was a simple bowl of spaghetti with mirepoix,bacon and herbs with chunks of lobster that didn't quite marry well enough with the tomato sauce (photo: bit. ly/sbwTHP). Considering this was Corey Lee, I was a little surprised the dish was only marginally tasty hamstrung as it was with the slight incompatibility of the flavors. Dessert came to the rescue with two that were genuinely stellar. The simplest was the $ bowl of Palmier Ice Cream with Calvados Caramel, three scoops of sheer creamy decadence (photo: bit. ly/sbwVQ). The fancier one was the $.  slice of Gâteau Marjolaine with Hazelnut, Praline and Crème Anglaise, a perfectly layered cake that could have come from a high end patisserie in Montmartre (photo: bit. ly/sEpdx). Not too sweet and oh so flavorful without the fussiness one would expect from a nine layer creation. I gave passing glances to the duck confit, the steak frites and all the other French fare one would expect from a brasserie, and believe me, a return visit is in the cards. Even Jamie said he would forego his burrito bowl one night for an order of the mussels and the ice cream at the bar. I need to take him up on that before he forgets. FOOD   stars. . .

While the flavours were French Bistro  the San Francisco twist is that the prices would be considered ridiculous in any actual French Bistro. TL:RL review over priced but tasty French inspired food served in a cold atmosphere. The French Spouse and I strongly disagreed about the food here. The FS thought the food was very good while I found most of it one note. I do agree the lobster ragout tasted just like the ragout you get in Marseilles. We started with three ""small plates"". Camembert Beignets I think most Americans who are used to the beignet found in New Orleans will be surprised by these tiny square pockets of cheese. The FS liked them, I found them to be average. . Potato and Leek Croquettes nicely cooked but not exceptional in terms of flavour. . frites decentWe then had two apps. Sweetbreads a decent portion of two pieces with an acidic sauce that was a good balance for the richness of the sweetbreads but a bit one note. Escargot The preparation was actually quite traditional but was a bit heavy handed. We finished our savory dishes by sharing the lobster ragout which I found to be overly salty. For dessert we had the gateau marjolaine, a very traditional slice of layer cake with thin layers of sponge and cream served with a Crème Anglaise which was unnecessary. It was a very good version of it but not worth the  dollars for the thin slice. Like the prices, the decor is nothing like an actual French bistro. It's in a modern building and takes inspiration more from Bauhaus and edison bulbs than a French bistro. They have sound baffling on the ceiling but the sound is still very bad. The single stall bathrooms are still gendered for no good reason especially since they share a sink. The lighting is also poor with a ton of edison bulbs. All in all, I would rather spend the same amount of money eating at Corey Lee's other restaurant Benu and get real French Bistro food when I visit my in laws every year in the south of France. Delicious Camembert beignets very addictive. Everything else we tried was just ok: wings, lobster pastaGood option before the opera or ballet If I had it all, and food no longer satisfied me, I would still travel back to Monsieur Benjamin; a bistro where the starters are simple yet experimental, and the dishes are clean yet flavorful. Seafood Sausage: scallops, shrimp, and bits of lobster, made into a sausage and enhanced with pine nuts & a smooth Beurre Rose sauce.  Clean & subtle, a magnificent starter. Beef Tongue Dijonnaise: soft beef tongue on top of rye crouton, with herbs & a fine Dijonnaise sauce drizzled over the dish.  One of the best beef tongues I've had yet. Lobster Ragout:  Fine pieces of lobster, herbs, mirepoix & bacon.  Good, but no unique flavors  possibly overshadowed by the duck. Duck Confit and Sausage:  Highlight of the savory part of the meal.  The duck was perfect.  The grape and sauce au poivre fused beautifully with the dish, and prevented the duck from tasting too salty. Gateau Mariolaine: Save your appetites for dessert, and order this cake.  You will not regret it. Palmier Ice Cream:  A creamy, chunky caramel ice cream that finished the meal off beautifully. Thank you for the meal, and thank you for the patient service. Ordered the steak tartare, sweetbreads grenobloise, steamed mussels, and lemon tart. Also got the escargot compliments of the chef. Steak tartare was the best  unique flavors and well cooked. Steamed mussels were also flavorful and very filling. Lemon tart was acidic which I like. Thinking of eating snails makes me gag so I passed on the escargot. There was bread to eat with the escargot sauce, which was not my taste either. Great service and modern venue  I would go back for the steak tartare and to try other dishes. I've heard so much about this place that I felt i needed to go. The first thing I felt were the very uncomfortable chairs we sat on.  The noise level was so loud that we screamed at each other throughout the meal to communicate. I also noticed that only one person on the wait staff was smiling and enjoying herself. Now the food. . . . . this has to be the worst food I have ever eaten in San Francisco. We ordered an eggplant cavier whichtasted more like wallpaper paste than eggplant. The sea bass was dry and completely tasteless. . . . and worse, it was served in a heavy red wine sauce. when I asked for olive oil with my bread they serve the cheapest olive oil imaginable. I don't recommend this place at all. I expected more. The slight twists on the classics are interesting, but nothing was memorable. The dishes were perfectly executed, but the proteins were obscured and ultimately unimpressive. Comments in [brackets] below:Pommes Gaufrette: whipped chicken liver mousse with waffle chip [Pretty to the eye with its covering of minced chives, but it is whipped so light as to lose almost all liver flavor. ]Steak Tartare: egg yolk (molecular), beef fat dust, Pissaladière lavash [Beef fat dust had no flavor and was thus a failed conceit; the yolks were interesting yet felt unnatural; did not like the  flavor of the lavash (cracker); and the minced cornichon overwhelmed everything. ]Escargots Bordelaise: mushroom duxelles, garlic, parsley [Delicious bread crumb coating, but it could be any protein buried under there and it would have tasted exactly the same. ]Marrow Bones ""Blue Ribbon"": bacon marmalade, country bread [It's bone marrow and it was done properly, but there is no need for the marmalade. While the marmalade is tasty, it is far too strong and overpowering to accompany the marrow. ]Lobster Ragoût: spaghetti, mirepoix, bacon, fines herbes [Very thick with bisque  boiled down lobster shells and cream  which is, again, very tasty, but far too rich to get any pleasure from the lobster. ]Gateau Marjolaine: hazelnut, praline, crème anglaise [Exceptional. Did not use much of the crème anglaise  it's completely unnecessary. ]In conclusion:It kills me to say it, but I expect to be far more impressed by Corey Lee. I'm willing to try again and reach deeper into the menu, but my expectations have been tempered. In the tiniest details of this meal, I feel I have seen the ceiling to Lee's style. The tasting menu at Benu might be the best meal of my life, but it doesn't follow that the dream who can waltz can tango too. .  rounded down. Hailing from The French Laundry and Thomas Keller acclaim, Corey Lee has a reputation that precedes him. It is a reputation that comes with some pretty high expectations. So rightfully so, this was my mindset when we came to dine at Monsieur Benjamin. I have been to TFL, but not Benu, Lee's other  star restaurant in the city. I'm a hard sell on the  star asian fusion scene but I was willing to bite when I heard he was opening a restaurant with his own take on classic French bistro fare. Lee's interpretation isn't much of a deviation at all and you can find the usual classics featured on the menu such as escargots and steak frites but also some interesting items such as the lobster ragout. My wife and I ordered each and they were both solid dishes. My flank steak was perfectly cooked, seasoned, and tender. Her lobster ragout was flavorful with a generous amount of chopped lobster mixed in with the pasta. For starters we shared the bone marrow which included  long bones cut lengthwise to reveal the fatty treasure within. These bones had a good amount of marrow in them which is my main hangup when ordering this appetizer. Often the bones seem almost anorexic or are rendered down to almost nothing. Lastly for dessert, we finished the evening with the palmier ice cream which was simple yet refreshing. A strong effort by chef Lee which I'm certain will quickly become a mainstay in San Francisco's food scene. Delicious!  had so many small plates and dishes and plate changes I can't keep track.  the highlights;shingoku oysters are my new favorite small and so rich. shrimp cocktail  yes, expensive, but very large and meaty. tasty. steak tartare  fresh and very good, the egg yolk blobs add flavor when you get some, but you also taste the beef with out it. mussels plump and a great value for those on a budget and sharingsquab  so tender, something about a special oven.  my fav entreepalmier ice cream  yes, as good as they say. made fresh dailymarjolane cake nice mix of chocolate and the burst of nuttiness.  may not be for everyone, but like eating a box of chocolates. Chef Corey Lee was there on Sunday, most Sundays? I really really liked Monsieur Benjamin. Authentic French bistro food meets new American. Corey Lee's done it again. The ambiance is gorgeous and contemporary  very appropriate for San Francisco. Make a reservation or be prepared to sit at the bar or communal table for walk ins (which is what we did but we were prepared for this). They have a variety of cocktails, wines by the glass, and obviously an extensive wine menu as well. They have some ""small plates"" as well as first courses & main courses. Since we popped in here casually, we just shared a couple of each  the uni, bone barrow, and chicken mousse were outstanding! Everything was delicious and presented beautifully. The service was top notch  friendly, welcoming, and knowledgeable staff. I look forward to returning here soon! very posh, had me feeling grown eating here. Lovely big glass windows and sophisticated layout of the restaurant and cute custom plates. the beef tartar is new and exciting, instead of an egg mixed in and crostini, it was served work this egg yolk gelee and these thin brown wafer like sheets. Very very delicious. I had the quail and it was tender and the vegetable/sauce pairing was tasty. The lobster pasta was whatever. the service is good, and then wine list is good, but nothing special. this is a good fancy date night spot. Coming back for that tartar tho. Fantastic service and food.  We shared the steak tartare, chicken liver, bone marrow, lobster ragout and palmier ice cream.  Everything was great. And the liver was surprisingly light and smooth.  It was a lot of food for  people so I'd probably nix an app next time around.  True to other reviews, the marrow was pretty skimpy on the marrow so I wouldn't order that again.  We were checking out what others around us were ordering and everything looked good!  No doubt I will be back multiple times.  The service also stood out as genuinely friendly and welcoming. . . Very refreshing. My new favorite restaurant in Hayes. I went in for a late week night dinner around  after working a long day and it was just what I needed. A large and unique menu made with quality ingredients. I wanted to try everything so I ordered a bunch of small plates, a burger, dessert and a cocktail. Steak tartare was delicious as were the waffle like potato chips. The burger was juicy and flavorful and made just right. The ice cream is hands down the best I've had in the city and my favorite part of the meal. Slightly better than Smitten and Bi Rite, seriously. The ambiance, decor and design of the restaurant are fun and unique. Definitely trendy and contemporary. I was most certainly underdressed, bordering on looking homeless, as I had been painting a condo all day, but the staff made me feel right at home and welcome even with a little paint in my hair. The best service I've received in Hayes in a long time. Bottom line: A bit pricey (it's Hayes), the food is good and unique, the design is fun and trendy, they have a full bar, and are open til am daily. What's not to like? Oh and I love the name. Service was great. Food was good, but nothing to write home about. Everything was cooked well, but was really disappointed in the flavoring of all the dishes I ordered. I had the tartare, chicken wings, and the pork ribs. The tartare was really lean and seemed slightly under seasoned. The chicken wings had no special flavor, but cooked perfectly and the dipping sauce was good. The pork ribs fell off the bone perfectly, but the flavor was not really anything amazing. Friends had duck confit, deviled eggs, beignets, and lobster. Deviled eggs and duck confit were the winners of the meal  but everything else was underwhelming. Cocktails were really well thought out, but otherwise an average place with great service that failed to live up to the hype. Love this place! A wonderful menu & fantastic service! p on Wednesday and this place was packed all night! Beautiful restaurant with a large open kitchen and dining area. Floor to ceiling windows facing the streets and the lighting reflecting on the windows made it romantic trendy and contemporary. Steak tartare was really unique and deliciousSeafood sausage was fantasticLobster ragout Steak fritesPalmier ice creamMarjolaine cake Highly recommend all those dishesWill try the mussels next time, they looked so good! Def a new fave! I can't say enough good about this new restaurant!  Having been to France on so many occasions and loving their food culture, it is a delight to see so many classics of the French repertoire. . . and done so extremely well.  I loved the oeufs mayonnaise, the poulet roti, and the blanquette de veau. And Mon Dieu, the crepe gateau with creme fraiche ice cream was outstanding!  I mentioned the roast chicken because I believe in trying the simplest dish first because it is the truest measure of a restaurant's merit. The wines by the glass are well suited to the menu and affordable.  The decor is so beautiful in every detail. . . right down to the little red fox logo on the plates. Everything is a delight.  No review would be complete without a shout out to the staff. The open kitchen is brightly lit and hums with a choreographed efficiency. . . no small feat after only three months. A special mention to Adam, a bartender, and Megan, the hostess. You make the restaurant truly feel like a neighborhood favorite.  Thank you! Highly recommend! Had a fantastic dinner here over the weekend and I already can't wait to go back!We Ordered:x Beau Soliel OystersBone Marrow L'escargotSteak TartareLobster RagoutAll dishes were really delicious and I couldn't fault any one of them. In particular the l'escargot had a memorable, rich flavour. They also came served in their own little iron pot, keeping them piping hot from the kitchen to the table. The lobster pasta was also another of my favourites. Simple and light, yet perfectly executed. Although the dishes are relatively simple, each one is made to perfection and perfectly seasoned without being too overwhelmed with other flavours. The service was flawless. Upon arriving at our table there was some water on the tablecloth, but this was instantly noticed by the hostess and was promptly replaced. The wine choice I was recommend by the waiter was delicious too! Our water was also frequently topped up. This is a super trendy restaurant that I think it is more suited to a younger crowd as it's quite loud. But I love the ambience, service and the food and can't wait to come back and try some of the other menu items!! I had very high expectations for this new place as it looked very nice and always looked packed. The food was nothing special and many items were too salty. The service was also just okay. I was disappointed considering the prices are fairly high. I don't think I will be returning. When your main location is Benu, how do you follow it up with another location in the same city? You do just what they have done with Monsieur Benjamin! You take the experience, quality and style and put it in a newly built out spot where good food is needed at a price point that is acceptable and approachable. The duck confit was brilliant in that is was cooked exactly as I would expect it, and there was enough meat to make it a meal. The experience from start to finish was terrific and I can't wait to go back! Well done folks. Impeccable service, amiable staff, unassuming, beautiful array of wonderfully executed dishes,wine list is broad without being confusing and over the top. Clean, smart and receptive staff! Internal architecture/ambiance is unpretentious, urban, fresh while still being very warm & alluring. Truly my new favorite restaurant!  Pictures with comments in gallery! Bon apetit! Agree with David L. Mediocre food, over salted, ridiculously expensive prices. Won't be back. The food is perfection but unfortunately had some pretty cruddy service. I'll try the bar next time because the food is worth revisiting. I loved the design. . . loved and even though the food wasnt super fabulous, it was good. Yes, the server was weak and she seemed out of place in terms of her dress, demeanor and even name however she did the job fine. I was just happy to be in a new place in hayes valley that doesnt sell kabab and I felt as though I was in ny which is fun.  Jardinere etc have held the symphony scene for too long hence I like a new clean fresh fun option to those nights. For my friend's recent birthday, we all chose to celebrate here at this Parisian bistro inspired spot, wearing bow ties and all dressed up for our reservation. To accompany our Cep Pinot Noir from the Sonoma Coast, we decided to share the following dishes: Frog Legs en Aigre Doux Escargots Bordelaise Marrow Bones ""Blue Ribbon"" with Bacon Marmalade Lobster Ragoût Seafood Sausage Quail à la ChasseurIt was my second time trying frog legs, and they were quite decent, not far from chicken flavor. Their quail was spectacular, and watching the waiter pour the sauce was a spectacle in itself. I enjoyed the lobster ragoût in part because it included bacon!Normally, I'm not a mushroom fan (part of the escargot dish), but somehow, they made that work here, too. Seafood sausage just flat out works. The only dish seemingly lacking  not in terms of flavor but in quantity  was the marrow bones. Their portions appeared very minuscule, though the bacon marmalade applied tasted fantastic. I also liked the Monsieur Benjamin cat iconography applied to the plates. Was a wee bit costly, but appropriately so! I hear this restaurant was formerly part of a parking structure  this is definitely a cultural improvement that can stick around. I had very high expectations for this place considering my husband and I celebrated our anniversary at Benu in .  My family and I came here on Sunday, September th with a  PM reservation to celebrate my birthday.  This restaurant did not live up to Chef Corey Lee's reputation.  Oeufs Mayonnaise Pimenton, Chervil  pretty good, but at $.  for  pieces it was not as impressive as the price. Pommes Gaufrette & Whipped Chicken Liver  my kids loved their ""potato chip"" but the texture of the chicken liver needed something much harder to contrast its softness. Bone Marrow   pieces of marrow rather than , but I don't feel like the bacon marmalade complemented the marrow atop the burnt toast.  I've had better. Our main courses were the Arctic Char, Lobster Ragout, Steak Fites and Braised Lamb Shank.  All the dishes were executed well but lacked flavor and creativity. If I'm in Hayes Valley again, I will stick with Chez Maman or Absynthe.  If I'm craving a french bistro I will go back to L'ardoise. We sat outside for dinner on a nice night, which was pleasant (but beware the outside curfew is :pm).  The GM, Tomas, is so friendly and informative.  We loved the escargot and mussels and fries.  Lobster ragout was not my favorite, but the artic char main was tasty.  Cocktails were delicious.  I would return for the cocktails and appetizers and friendly service. After much excitement about this restaurant, my husband and I decided to venture in on Friday night without reservations and try our luck.  The place was packed but we were offered seats at the bar for cocktails, and after our drink they were able to find a table for us.  The ambiance is unique for San Francisco  chic but not formal.  I have to say, Monsieur Benjamin did not disappoint.  We started with oysters and the potato and leek croquettes, then went a little more daring with the seafood sausage and sweetbreads.  The flavors were unique and spot on.  I keep thinking about the seafood sausage in particular.  For entrees, my husband had the arctic char and I did the mussels, which were probably the best mussels I can remember having and they're a dish I will frequently try.  The garlic sausage and flavorful broth were to die for.  Be sure to get them with fries to soak up the broth.  I was stuffed but found a way to finish them!  My husband was equally happy with his char.  Finally we finished by sharing the palmier ice cream, which was light and perfect and a fun way to get the flavors of a palmier.  Our server was on the ball and able to answer our onslaught of questions about the menu, as well as make some good wine recommendations to go with our meal.  All in all, I'm thrilled Monsieur Benjamin has come to town.  We've been waiting ages for a quality French option and I think we've finally found it! My new go to restaurant in the neighborhood, when I'm feeling spendy, and it's cold and foggy outside, after watching a performance at SF Symphony a few blocks away. SUMMARY: Over rated, over priced restaurant. Don't go. We went there with high expectation. We put our name in the waiting list and waited for  minutes. We were taken to a communal table. I don't mind a communal table but they were packing customers. There wasn't comfortable space between us, sitting across the table, and the next couple. I felt like I were in casual pub in Tokyo. The couple was friendly but spoke rather loud. My ear hurt. We had hard time conversing with each other. The service wasn't very attentive. Our table surface was sticky. Service was slow. Description of wine by our waitress wasn't even accurate; she described a wine that is usually described medium bodied, full body. Foods are interesting but the taste lacked balance. Bone marrow was a bit too salty while lobster ragu was a bit spicy. We liked bread and butter. We liked wine and wine was actually priced right. Other dishes were overpriced. We weren't very hungry and we shared  small plates and  main dish,  glass of wine,  bottle of sparkling water, cost over $ after tax and tip. By the way, the portion was rather an American size than French. Maybe this is a plus. By the time we arrived, only  table was left  our reserved one  and we only had a little over an hour before curtain time. We asked the wait staff to fire everything at once rather than serve each dish in a separate course.   Like raw oysters, I prefer my raw sea urchin naturally seasoned by the sea, but they were unexpectedly served dressed in a lemony vinaigrette. Not bad at all, but not  at all expected. The sea bass with mussels and the duck confit were perfectly executed.  Our favorite side dish was the grilled little gems salad.  I was disappointed that the pomme frites came in a clump, glued together with little seasoning to bring out the flavor. Our waitress brought a dish of high quality sea salt to our table which allowed us to season them to our own taste. The servers and roving staff were very attentive. The front and back house worked expertly together to serve our meal to us and deliver the check within the all too brief time allowed. We will return again but, next time, with more time to spare. Another overrated, overpriced place in Hayes Valley.  My fiancé and I could not wait to go since it opened in our neighborhood not that long ago. We were left completely underwhelmed. . . . to say the least.  We split an order of mussels which were pretty good but I prefer the mussels are Chez Maman up the street.  We also split an order of Frittes which we thought would come out with the mussels but didn't at least that is what we asked of our waiter. They arrived first and it was at least  minutes before any other food came out.  My fiancé wanted to try the chicken wings gross, ugh I could barely eat one.   They were overcooked and had basically green mayo dip served with them.  Then arrived the mussels after almost an hour and then the roasted chicken quite a bit after that.  The roasted chicken was ok.  It's $ and doesn't come with anything except a side of oil & fat (supposed to be gravy I guess??) We ordered a side of roasted beets to go with the chicken. . . meh.  The whole meal was $ for  cocktail each, fries, shared mussels, shared chicken with crappy side and delivered to us over  minutes.  We arrived at :pm and didn't leave until almost :pm.  The place was somewhat busy but definitely not packed and no wait.  Besides paying so much for ok food, there was an adorable older couple sitting next to us.  They were from out of town and just went to the theater.  They had to be in their mid 's early 's.  What completely topped off the less than desirable experience for us was when the woman politely asked the waiter if he could call them a cab back to their hotel (A very nice thing that most restaurants will do in major cities) and he said ""um we don't do that. You should be able to stand outside on Gough and hail a cab"".  I was so pissed.  What happened to the exceptional service and going above and beyond ?  The couple obviously has not adapted to the Uber or Lift generation, they didn't even have cell phones or they were so old school they don't need take them out in public places (Another rant for another occasion).  I just kept imagining this waiter saying what he said to my grandmother and I didn't like it.  I absolutely do not mind paying for amazing food and service.  This place has neither.  I will continue to go to my favorite neighborhood places like Chez Maman, Ottoro or even Hayes & Kebab. The Most OverRated New Restaurant in SFBAD service. Mediocre food at high prices. Don't go. Well one thing is for sure, Monsieur Benjamin is no Benu not even a mini me Benu.  Oh my, disappointing! of us went and we ordered  appetizers.  The only one really, really good was the deviled eggs, ($.  for  halves).  We got  orders of those, I had  /.  YUM.  We also got the Poached shrimp ( for $. ) and unlike Michael Bauer's assessment they were not the best shrimp any of us have ever eaten.  However they were good.  The fried chicken wings ($. ) were a bit odd.  Deep fried but not really battered. They were crispy but they looked like deformed tiny chicken wings.  I think it was how they were cut.  I bet they got  pieces out of  chicken wing, yes that small.  I bit into  and it was very pink inside, so forget that one.  They did come with a tasty green sauce.  Next came Pate de Campagne ($. ).  No flavor. Thank God for the great whole grain mustard. We all love beef tongue so we ordered the beef tongue diionnaise ($. ).  Well it is not the slightly chewy kind we have in Japanese restaurants but the kind my Mother made us growing up in the pressure cooker, so tender.  Which could be good, but again, it lacked flavor.  We all agreed, thumbs down. I just love mussels ($. ) but after the ones I ate here I may take a hiatus from them.  It sounded so good!  Butter, garlic, and sausage.  Well the best thing about it was the charred bread it came with.  First of all there was so little of the broth which is usually a favorite part.  So boo to that.  Next the sausage, though plentiful, had no flavor and worse no fat.  LOL  And then the saddest part, the mussels themselves were way too strong tasting, Some were not, but too many were.  And they were a bit dry because the broth was way at the bottom unattainable and hardly any.  So there I had a big bowl of mussels with lots of sausage and it so sucked.  LOL  Woe was me.  Next came the entrees.  Well again, woe was me.  I had decided long before coming here that I was going to get the duck confit.  But being weak and easily swayed, when our friend ordered the lobster ragout, it sounded so good.  I asked the waitress if there were big chunks of lobster in it.  And she said ""oh yes,  it was so good and oh so much lobster. ""  One of the best dishes there she claimed and made it sound like it beat the duck confit hands down though that was good too. So my husband who was going to order the French dip sandwich and I the duck confit, immediately switched and went with the lobster ragout with bacon (was hiding) and mirepoix (chopped celery, onions and carrots) ($. ).  First bite I could taste lobster flavor but not in a pleasurable way, second bite all I could taste was too salty weird pebbles of something, not reminiscent of lobster at all.  For $ I would think you would get fresh chunks of just cooked lobster.  In my opinion this tasted like it was made with canned lobster rejected little bits, all pebble size and the liquid from the can was poured in the tomato sauce for that so salty canned lobster flavor.  And yes there looked like a lot of these pebble sized so called ""lobster"" nodules.  My husband was aghast, he never got any lobster flavor.  Our friend was laughing at the so untrue description the waitress had given me.  It reminded me of cheap canned crab I once bought that was not edible.  I literally had  bites and left the rest.  I sent it home with my friend.  Thank God we had ordered the french fries.  I ate some of those and they were great. The only original one in our party ordered the pork rib ($. ).  He was expecting pork, as in pork ribs.  And instead he got a ham bone.  LOL  Yes, it was ham.  He gave us all a piece in disbelief.  Maybe the fact that it had choucroute, (sauerkraut), was the tip off, but we all missed it.  I do not think it was bad, but it was no pork rib.  LOL  For dessert we had the lemon tart ($. ) which actually did not disappoint,  I think it actually had real and just squeezed lemon juice in it, shock!  I loved it.  We also had the Crepe facon gateau ($. ) which was great too. So in conclusion, our entire table agreed, the only good dishes were the deviled eggs, french fries and the desserts.  Service was fine, timing was good.  Chairs a bit uncomfortable. Great food, this place can definitely give Absinthe some competition. We were lucky to be seated right away (Monday night, late), but the place was still bustling. Good service, good menu recommendations . . .  stars only because I wish there were more vegetarian options. Went here after work on a Sunday. I was very appreciative of them being open until am. Our server was great and made all the right suggestions. He had the attentiveness and timing down perfectly. But he left /rds of the way through our meal, which was kind of a bummer since liked him and we were left with a handful of awkward wait staff that couldn't read us. The food was amazing. House picklesSweet breadsOysters Escargot Eggplant caviar Steak tartareQuail Gateau marjolaineEvery dish was delicious. Very French but contemporary at the same time. The portion sizes are perfect. I love that we ordered several plates so we could taste many dishes and not be  overly stuffed. The wine selection is very nice. Their muscadet by the glass was very very dry  (so yum and just how we like our white wine). ""Clinically refreshing"" I wasn't sold on the cocktails. The decor and ambiance feels like you're in a French cafe. Love the red tiles in the bathroom. I loved benu and I love this place. I will be back soon. My new favorite french bistro. Loved the seafood sausage!! Tried two main courses so far, the quail and the duck confit, and both were excellent. Will definitely come back to try more dishes. Oh. . . One more thing, they open late (until am), awesome! And I said to myself: oh putain. Let's be honest, French restaurants in San Francisco usually range from mediocre to average. Monsieur Benjamin is way ahead of the pack. Nice, refined and friendly yet not annoying wait staff. It's quite impressive for a place that's only been open for a few months. The food is truly excellent, everything we had true French food and if there was a twist, it was modern and not stupid. Special mention for the pork ribs (which are not really a usual French cut) came out really well (maybe because they cook it for  hours?). While the wine selection is a bit short (and very French), they make up for it with a great beer and cocktail list. Keep some room for dessert because it's worth it, especially the Gateau Marjolaine and their novel Palmier Ice Cream. Now if only they could and did serve foie gras. . . There is really not much to say because everything is spot on. Their French GM, Thomas is extremely nice and helpful and keeps everything in check, like a true professional. Now a tiny bit of advice: pommes sarladaises with the confit, more garlic in the escargots and maybe some sort of stew for winter time and you'll earn a th star. Good job guys! Delicious meal.  Absolute must tries include the camembert beignets and palmier ice cream. Service was excellent without overwhelming.  Staff was friendly and attentive. Only issue was parking, but that's to be expected on a night when there is a performance at the Opera House. I love French food and bistro style restaurants but this place has a few kinks to work out before it can be great.  The space is gorgeous, lots of light, open kitchen, windows and even outside seating.  I wish it was a bit better in absorbing noise, it was a bit loud. The service was not very attentive, the food came out too fast and not spaced out since we were sharing all our dishes.  It took the waitress a while to come take our order and she was always running around, we had to ask for new plates and silverware in between dishes. The food: Frog legs: deep fried, dry and no flavor, presented like french fries.  I prefer the classic preparation with butter, garlic where they melt in your mouth. This poof frog gave up its life for nothing. Beef Tongue: It was tender but hard to tell what you're eating, the sauce was nice, but could use more flavor, very flat. Sweet Breads: one of our favorites, tender, great sauce, beautiful presentation. Burger: great classic, we loved it, the medium rare prep was perfect.  Beets: another miss, they were served hot and that created a very strange flavor.  We did give our waiter feedback and the flog legs and beets were taken off the bill, so that was nice, but I would have rather had great dishes. The desserts didn't seem inspired so we skipped and went to Spruce for the beignets. With large menus it's often hard to create great dishes all around, but we did aim for the classics and I hope this place does well, always love French food. A new resto in Hayes Valley! A restaurant opened by Corey Lee?! Sign me up! Parisian style bistro without the excess butter, well there's butter of course but I said ""excess"" so I didn't feel like I needed to be rolled out of the restaurant. The restaurant has an open kitchen, awesome menu, great ambiance, friendly service, what else do you need? I spend alot of time in Hayes Valley and never even noticed they were building this on what used to be a parking lot. Thank you Chef Lee. We've tried alot of their items and we were not disappointed. I don't even know what to recommend because they were all so good! Also save room for dessert! . We had no reservation and expected to wait .  While they encourage you to have a drink, there really is no place to,wait out of the way of servers . Still we enjoyed excellently prepared manhattans, and were happily surprised that the manager kept his eye on us and sat us when someone failed to,show for a reservation at  a very nice table. And we loved the classic French bistro food.  Steak tartare , chicken  liver, seafood ragout. We did not have courage to try the bone arrow, thought it might be just too rich with other choices, but definitely will next time. We are in the civic center area  often for various performances and this exceptional restaurant is an exciting, excellent  addition to many other good choices.  I just hope it won't always be impossible to get a reservation! A wonderful modern French bistro. Decor is minimal yet cozy and inviting. I opted to try the range of small dishes on my first visit. My friend loved his arctic char and butter lettuce salad. Potato croquettes were perfectly round orbs  crispy on the outside, soft and buttery inside. Camembert beignets were a little bit of a disappointment; the pillows of dough were hollow and overly dusted with the sweet cinnamon powder. Had hoped for more of the cheese flavor. Steak tartare was plentiful; as others have mentioned, portions were larger than expected. The yolks were cleverly solidified only to the point of not oozing all over the plate. They still mixed easily with the rest of the ingredients. Slightly too acidic though. Bone marrow was fantastic and well complemented by its accompanying jam. Three canals to scoop through was decadent! Bread was a bit over toasted though. Wish I had read up on the escargots  was very sad they weren't soaked in garlic butter. I thought the green puree was pesto, rather it was some cucumber combo. I couldn't even finish all  (and that was a first!). I'll be back. Was too full to try palmier ice cream but it looks and sounds fantastic. My friends probably left JFK right before dinner since their arrival time to SFO was pm on a Fri night.  I had a feeling they may be hungry, so I took a chance and made a reservation here at pm. I was so excited to find a new place that serves food past midnight and literally a min Uber ride away; perfect. I had to warn them that this restaurant has only been open for a month and that I have not yet dined here. When our Uber ride dropped us off, I have to say I was immediately excited. From the outside, you can see the entire restaurant; cool glass windows throughout.  It looked completely modern & voguish; different from any other restaurant in Hayes Valley or for that matter, any where in the city.  We were greeted by the host; I was happy I made reservations because it was packed. So we started off with cocktails. They chose their signature drink which everyone seems to Yelp about, (I did have a sip; can't remember the name of it, but it was very good), but I continued to drink red wine.  I must admit that my review is based purely on the fantastic location and ambiance of this place.  I am not as experienced with French cuisine as I am with sushi  or wine bars.  And since I just had a whole lb lobster at Morton's, I wasn't about to eat. But the dishes looked delicious from other tables; and my friends agreed they enjoyed their food.  I believe they started off with the croquettes and shrimp cocktail; as their entrees, one had the steak frites and my other friend had the duck. We pretty much shut down the place, because we continued to drink and reminisced on my last visit to NYC this past April.  The type of music playing was jazz, but it seemed to change a bit when the restaurant started to clear out. Overall, the service was very friendly and attentive. I look forward to coming back so that I can personally taste the food while enjoying the vibrant ambiance. Exquisite! This is the only word that is befitting of this modern, French bistro.  And to be quite honest, there really isn't anything like it around. The food here is not only beautifully executed and presented, but also really delicious! Our chicken liver was light, fluffy, and just gorgeous. The steak tartare was the best I've ever had, with beautiful, hand cut cubes of beef and dollops of sous vide egg yolk. The seafood ragout was another standout rich and flavorful. And not to be outdone, our dessert was amazing!  I didn't expect the crunchy morsels of meringue in the filling of the crepe, but I relished in the surprise. I knew to expect good food at this restaurant, because after all, the people of Benu, the French Laundry, Per Se, and RN are at the helm, but actually I was a bit surprised at the level of goodness. I was thoroughly impressed!  Cannot wait for another visit! Good portions for apps and great to share. The food is not bad, but I think the service could be better. The servers were not very attentive. Sigh. . . . I did so want to like you, M. Benjamin.  Your space is sleek and sexy, your wait staff attentive and friendly, and your menu ever so French.  But, unfortunately, your food was just. . . . not quite right. The good:. Palmier Ice Cream. Sea Urchin. The meh:. Sweetbreads  sauce was far too sour. . Lobster Ragout  I've had better. Specifically, at Bix. . Camembert Beignets. . . had just an aftertaste of camembert. Potato and Leek Croquettes  forgettable. . Escargot. Call me a purist but I like em drenched in butter and garlic. The huh?. Steak tartare.  Came with a bunch of somewhat cooked egg yolks that had a gummy texture, and leaned a little too heavily on the cornichons. . . The wine list. I was expecting a baller wine list. . . theirs was very thin and not very french (I mean, except that it was thin). Honestly, Mr. Benjamins reminded me of RN when it opened  awesome space, good concept, and meh food.  But, I am hoping they can pull off the same food turnaround, because I really do want them to win. Super over rated and even more disappointing that it was a Corey Lee restaurant.  This makes me rethink trying Benu. First the service was SLOW.  For a restaurant that had more workers than customers ( ish customers at pm and easily  workers ), it took  minutes for our server to even come to us and say hello.  This was great indication of what we were to get the rest of our time there. Secondly, the food was SALTY.  Like this morning I am still insanely dehydrated from the over use of seasoning on the food we ordered (beignet, escargot, beef dip and fries).   I would say pretty much inedible.  This is really unfortunate given that they are open late, it would have really been nice to be able to make this spot a regular option for late night dining.  However, I would never recommend this place to any of my friends unless they are looking to gain  pounds of water weight the next morning by being salted to death the night before!Next time I am looking for a great late night dining experience I will just go to nopa!  That place never disappoints. Very nice ambiance and space but the food is inconsistent. Love the bone marrow, camembert beignets and the sweet breads but disappointed by the deviled eggs and the sea urchin (it wasnt as fresh as I'm used to). The bar is also slow despite having   bartenders behind it. We ordered  drinks and didnt get our drinks until  out of the  dishes were done. Great location and space.  I was really excited to finally dine here.  Reservations weren't too hard but the space was packed for a Tuesday night.  The staff was all very nice.  The menu is vast  a lot of choices.  The  of us shared more small plates: CroquettesBeignetsTerrinePateBone marrow w/ bacon chutneyLobster raguAll in all I thought everything was good but I would like to go back and try more.  It already has great potential. Prime dinner time slots are often booked up on Opentable but I was able to snag a (what must've been a last min cancellation) :pm reservation last night.  I'd walked past Monsieur Benjamin quite a few times as I'm often in Hayes Valley and was excited to try it out. The restaurant itself is beautiful  bustling but not too crowded and the kitchen/bar looks impeccable.  Waitstaff was very friendly and attentive. We ordered the Rappahannock River oysters and the Shigoku oysters, steak tartare, escargots bordelaise, blanquette de veau, quail â la chasseur (would've probably ordered dessert too if we weren't full).  While both oysters were fresh, we both prefered the shigoku oysters.  Overall, the food was quite good  full disclosure: it was my first time trying escargot bordelaise so I can't actually speak to the quality of the snails but my boyfriend who is no stranger to escargot said they were pretty good.  The blanquette de veau was good but didn't necessarily blow my mind.  The steak tartare was pretty darn good and would definitely recommend.  Portions aren't ""huge"" which I appreciated but are generous enough that if you being with hors d'oeurves/petit plats and get a main course you should be just fine. Restaurant professional and my truthful experience of one of my co worker and myselfs dinner experience was poor and I might come back in  months or so when they get their stuff together. . . . . maybe. We walk in and the host guy remembers me from other places I've been to eat around the city, so that was cool. And then my friend Robin recognizes a server she used to work with. And I see a line cook I knew from presidio social club. It's cool to see how us industry peeps come across everyone we've met at some point or another. Anyways we sat down and I ordered a glass of wine and my friend wanted to taste two different wines. The waitress brings my glass and then it takes her  min to get my friends first taster. She didn't like it and asked for the other.  The waitress then takes another  minutes just for that! So she has been sitting there with no drink for  minutes. Meanwhile, the other tables around us were given their drinks in a timely manner. Finallyy she got her glass. Moving on. . . we ordered so much food! Being chefs/cooks ourselves, we are always curious and want to try as much as we can. I really hate the fact that we paid $ for two pieces of sweetbreads about the size of a half dollar. Really?? Who are you trying to fool? Not us, cause that didn't work. Let's move on again, escargot tasted like straight grassy parsley. Not great. The chicken liver mousse was disappointing. . . if people order mousse, they obviously like the Taste of that particular organ so why try to lighten it up so much and put it in a canister and whip it?? It tasted like nothing. It was like airy, fluffy butter.  No real liver flavor. And all this time out waitress has not come over once to check on us but mind you she has checked in to all the tables around us several times. Has to ask a food runner for bread. And my friend finished her drink and since we couldn't find the damn waitress she asked the bus boy if she could order a drink (obviously that wasn't gonna happen but we were getting desperate). He had to go pull her out from around the corner and we got another drink. There's so much more food we had but it would make this review even longer and it not worth it since nothing was amazing, just good. After we were done with our  courses, yes TEN!!, the waitress finally comes to is to ask about dessert. We order and eat it and get the bill. Paid and left the most crappiest tip I have ever left in my life with a nice hand written note at the bottom of it. I honestly believe that's what she deserved because I have been every where in the city and that lady just sucked. And kind of put a downer on our experience.  U have friends at Benu who recommended this place to me and I let them know afterwards of our experience and he was even shocked.  whatever. After wards we were still hungry due to the tiny portions so we walked to jardinière, since my friend had worked there for a long time, and got greeted with excellent service and dessert and cocktails. . . . . should have just went there from the beginning. I suppose that my expectations were pretty high given Corey Lee's reputation. We tried  dishes plus dessert.   The menu was ok.   Not great, just ok.  There seems to be a creeping trend in SF restaurants where there's a lack of 'oomph' on the menu.  What is 'oomph'?   Its that element a great dish has where its outstandingly good.    In other words, 'You have to go to (Nopa/Foreign Cinema) and try their (pork chop, burger, fried chicken etc)'.   The lobster ragout was the closest dish that captures this and yet wasn't quite there.  On a separate note, the service here was impeccable. I had a very lovely meal here. First of all my Ace cocktail was DELICIOUS. Started with potato leek croquettes and some kind of beignet which due to the powdered cheese topping tasted like amazing fancy Doritos. I had steak tartare and frites for my main, very pretty to look at, tasted fine. Fries were perfect!  Our server was totally on point, she was around but didn't hover, we had a time issue and she was sensitive to it and took care of everything. Overall, it's a fun, loud, tasty new place to enjoy great drinks and good food.  Ps. The little fox on the plates and the matches is super cute. Chef Corey Lee did an awesome job creating the concept of this restaurant. It's no Benu, but it is a good solid French bistro. What a hipster joint though. Who am I kidding, I am a hipster! Oh well. . . Anyways all our appetizers and small dishes were amazing. The mains are small depending on what you get. I got the Duck Confit and it was not fulfilling and probably not the best choice of mains. The GF got the Lobster Ragout and that was pretty good. Must come again to try other mains! Until then,  stars. Slick place, close to theaters and symphony, open late. Service is OK, although could be more efficient considering how many members of staff are strolling around in various uniforms. My food experience though was mediocre and I couldn't detect anything french about it. Pate de Champagne was dense, salty and practically tasteless. I liked grilled chicken better but it was on a salty side and rather dry. Steak frites was few pieces of cheap hanger steak with soggy fries ($ feels like real bad value here), again too salty for my liking. Probably not the best things to order in this place but I am in no hurry to go back. This place is a gem. Are you understanding? I mean, they are one of the few restaurants in SF that is not a diner (gross!), open until am and serves amazing food. Um, if you are planning on finally eating and taking a day off from your green juice diet then this is the place. IT'S f* MAY HAYY JOR! Like it's better than any other French Bistro in the city. You just order Quail á la Chasseur, eat it on an empty stomach, and you feel like a trillion bucks. Go try it yourself!P. S. Thanks Erol A. for introducing me to Monsieur Benjamin. I felt refocused enough after that horrendous Friday CF class. We need to go back here soon! THE ONE THING YOU SHOULD KNOW. . yes yes, the decor is amazing. . FOCUS. . Go family style & Go heavy on the appetizers.  Here's why. . The portion of the mains were not large, very much so on the small side.  The appetizers (most) however, where on the large side. It's very simple. . . to make it even easier, we all enjoyed the apps more than the mains we ordered. If you need another reason, its also significantly easier on the wallet. ORDER THESE (imho):HIP HIP HOORAY for. . () BONE MARROW  (holy smokes, HUGE portions!) and the ""jam"" it comes with REALLY tops it off, was first time I enjoyed it this way!() lobster ragu (main)() MUSSELS  another holy SMOKES huge mussels and broth is outstanding!() deviled eggs() palmier ice cream  ignore those who say this is too sweet. seriously. SKIP THESE: duck confit (main) lamb (main)  if you are feeling like a nice piece of meat, by all means. just didn't feel ""special"" at all to me for the price.  escargot (if you're a ""i can take it or leave it"" about escargot in general, id say pass on this one. . its not your typical buttery deliciousness type. . ) I was disappointed that they don't use the proper wineglasses, especially with a nice (not many, however) French list  but Burgundy out of a small generic wine glass was appalling. . . . otherwise the service was friendly and efficient. The roasted chicken and duck terrine were very good, however the $ quail was not as memorable. Loud place  better for friends than romance. If you want a French meal that isn't too heavy, with a NYC vibe where the tables are close but not intrusive, and where the staff is beyond friendly and has good recommendations, then go here."
Verbena|4.0|American (New) in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|179|-1|4.01869158879|" Stumbled upon this gem after dinner and had excellent cocktails. I believe I had ""Thirteen Blooms"". Exceptional ambiance and service as well! I've eaten in a lot of places with terrible service but none that I bothered writing a review about. This placed was so bad that I really feel the need to write this review. Extremely rude host, we walked in for brunch waited for almost  minutes in an empty restaurant as the host was on the phone. . . No one else bothered seating us, when the host finally kept the phone down he offered the seat us at the bar, before he could answer why we couldn't sit on one of the  open tables he decided to take another call. . . horrible service. We walked out obviously. . . . never going back to this place again. My whole family had SUCH a fantastic culinary experience last night at Verbena It was truly divine, every single dish and every drop of drink, we talked about it all day today and will surely continue to do so for years to come.  The staff was knowledgeable and early very experienced.  After a million delicious dishes we were then blown away by the ginger cake dessert and the house made vermouths to finish the meal.  We're all now obsessed with the seed bread that started our meal and want to know where we can get that on the regular. . .  Cheers to a fantastic menu, divine preparations and solid service!  THANK YOU! novel tastes, edgy Great service, innovative food. All around a night to remember . Food was superb!To start grilled bread with spreadable Salumi. Next we had a delicious beef tartar with fried tofu skin (pure genius) and oysters that adds salt spikes. Pork chop was perfectly cooked and delicious! Very good meal and great bartender.  Met some friends initially at the bar and the bartender was helpful and informative.  I went the wine route and really appreciated their well thought out wines by the glass. Once seated, we started with bread with spreadable salami, which may have been the highlight of the evening.  Perfectly toasted bread with what can only be described as spreadable salami.  We then had the shrimp scampi, which was good but not remarkable.  I had Duck Wings as a main course and although messy I really enjoyed them.  Overall an excellent meal on the line between  and  stars but not memorable enough to get the full .  Still highly recommended. Have been here  times now. Verbena has nice offerings and likes to modify their dishes according to what's in season. Prices are standard SF new American (not cheap but somewhat affordable depending if you dine family style or choose your own entrees).  Breads are $ , Small Plates $ , and Entrees $ . Service is excellent. Great for brunch/lunch, dinner, or just even drinks! The space is romantic/darkly lit and great for a small group or date night. I was taken there for my birthday.  The first thing I noticed was the low lighting.   I couldn't read the menu. I couldn't see how the dishes were prepared.  They should, at the very least, have a candle on the table.  I enjoyed the Little Gem salad and the Rabini.  The lamb meatballs had no flavor whatsoever.  The scampi was served whole so it was left uneaten.  Maybe the kitchen could slit the shell so it's easier to eat?  Would I go back or recommend it?  I don't think so. I'm always excited when, as a vegetarian, I can eat at the hip, new restaurant and not have to settle for a $ plate of mediocre risotto. Yay for the creative veggie options at Verbena! Service was great, it seems like they work as a team which is nice. They explained the menu well. Cocktail and wine choices were delicious, the only part that fell short was the desert menu. Nothing sounded appetizing. . . . and I'm a huge fan of deserts. I don't recall all the options but there was something involving beets and goat cheese. We will be back for sure. If you're two women dining together, expect to be offered the worst table (next to the kitchen and bathrooms) in an otherwise empty restaurant. Service is intrusive and overbearing. On a positive note, the space is beautiful, acoustics are great and vegetable dishes are excellent and inventive (but price point is too high). Meat and seafood dishes are poor and need work.  You can have a good meal here if you're dining with a husband/boyfriend, stick to vegetables and don't mind the constantly in your face wait staff.   Otherwise, Polk Street offers friendlier options with better food.

It seems like the bad luck had began with Marbella, over priced under delivered. Food went down and picking wrong staff. Nice decor for sure but lack of flavor and unprofessional poor customer service. You may have a good time at Chopstick House only a block away. Because the Chopstick House is a little hit or a lot miss, like Verbena, Chinese version. But a lot cheaper and better service, if you don't mind roaches. I recommend, don't go for both. De blah blah blah, and meh meh mehIs all I want to say to you, period. Before I came here I told my wife ""I don't get excited about food anymore, because I feel like I've had it all"". I was wrong. I came here and was blown away. Chef Sean is the Bay Area's most creative chef. Brunch review only!I've been to Verbena for brunch before, and was sorely disappointed that my second visit was a miserable affair. I'm basing this review simply on the fact that:a. they have almost no gluten free/dairy free options on the menub. they screwed up my simple salad (the only thing I could eat) and had to remake it when they made it incorrectly with bread crumbs. c. they insist on serving everything family style, which for brunch is not really my thing. when we stated we weren't doing family style, they still insisted on presenting everything in the middle of the table. Very awkward for a brunch of . Otherwise, my companions loved their french toast and said everything else was delicious. I'd give them another chance to do better, but only after they update their menu. As my co worker who frequent here warned me that it's a hit or missed depending what chef is cooking up that day, I arrived with no expectation.  We had reservation but decided to sit at the bar for a fun fare.  The mixologist was charming and talk us up in to sitting there for fun, and mixed up some connotations for us that was not on the menu per our request, after we ordered some that was on the menu too.  The drinks was just a okay for us considering all the raves. We proceed to ordered the beets salad that was delicous, he recommended us to get some bread so  (half)slices of the artisan sourdough ($) to dip was a nice way to clean the plate and soak up the alcoholnot sure about $.  for a half inch slice of sour dough though. The Fried pepper with eggplant was also good. We also had the duckwings but that reminded of the chicken feet at dimsum somehow so it was just okay for me.  The pork rib was tender but other than being tender it was just so so flavoring.  We also ordered dessert, it was a deconstructed chocolate cake. . . well, one word ""interesting"".  There were hop on the cake, we both didn't really care for the bitterness of the hop for dessert.  Perhaps because we sat at the bar and foods feel more like bar bites than an actual dining experience. So for a okay food and okay drink, nice bar tender and friendly staff, good service I am not sure if I will be running back soon given there are so many more places to try. Horrible never got main course after  hours. When we asked where our food was, The waitress scurried away and didn't come back for another  minutes, telling us that our food was on its way. We could tell that meant another  to  minutes so I politely asked for the check. The manager returned and told us our food would be a few more minutes, at which point we alerted him to the fact that it had been two hours since we ordered our food. Cocktail menu was a bit over designed, you really had to read each recipe to understand what you were getting. I love artisan  cocktails but these were just a bit to bizarre wine pours were very skimpy. Best brunch I've had to date in a new restaurant in Russian Hill. Unique dishes carefully prepared, warm service, and great wine/drink choices. Started with sprouted seed bread, a piece of warm nutty bread, dark and hearty, served with goat cheese. For the main dish, I had the corn pancakes with persimmon, fluffy and decadent. My friend went a little healthier with the little gem salad, cabbage and avocado, and claims it's the best she's had (I'm not big on lettuce, but this was quite good). They also have a fantastic wine selection, I chose the Hirsch Gruner, a respected producer in Austria, and it did not disappoint. The Bloody Mary was a solid interpretation of the classic. Can't comment on the decor, since we sat on one of the three sidewalk tables. My partner and I came in for dinner on Halloween.  I was surprised to find Verena as one of the best restaurants that I have been to in SF in a long time.  Everything that we ordered was perfect.  The menu is vegetable heavy but not exclusively vegetarian.  The food was very creative and satisfying.  The service was great as well. Been there twice now.  The second time was an accident because I forgot we already went and are not fans.  We just didn't leave because we had friends joining us and our second experience  was the same as the first.  Overall, the food isn't great and because of that the price value is really off because of the portion size.  I've now had about  different dishes from here and frankly, nothing was that great.  There are so many great restaurants in that neighborhood not to mention the city that it isn't worth going back. Verbena is probably the most beautiful looking food per dollar you'll find in SF. Artistry, beautiful layering, great use of negative space. Amazing vegetarian selection  very rich and hearty to please a very meaty person like myself. Magical sauces you'll remember every detail of. After several visits to Verbena, I'm still waiting to be impressed.  there has been a few odd staff incidents. . . It's such a pretty room, I'm hoping the food and service come up to meet the ambiance of the space. Brunch review only!Came with three friends for a brunch reservation at a on a Saturday. They opened right at a so we were the first ones sitting. But the place definitely filled up fast. FOOD: Everything the brunch menu is amazing. Sprouted bread  this is their specialty; made in house; you have to get it. It is surprisingly delicious. For the dishes we got grilled country bread with pork belly, poached eggs over braised beef, duck confit with rice grits, and french toast. Everything was outstanding  jam packed flavor, beautiful presentation, nice balance of meat and veggies. And a side of their potatoes, which were crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. ENVIRONMENT: Not terribly large, but doesn't feel cramped. They get a lot of natural light, which I like. There's a private dining room upstairs. There's a handful of tables outside if that's your thing. But it definitely seems like reservations are the way to go. SERVICE: Way friendly and energetic. Answered all our questions. Gave great recommendations. So attentive with the coffee and water refills :) This is a beautiful quaint by energetic restaurant with terrific service and some of the most unbelievable eclectic food I have had in a long time.  We arrived ahead of our party and there was none of that ""we have to wait until everyone is here crap,"" we were seated immediately. Our server, Rebecca, was absolutely amazing. Rebecca has one of those warm smiles that will melt cold butter on pumpernickel bread yet she has a great sense of humor and was very knowledgeable about the food.  Speaking of food, oh my God; I fancy myself to be quite a cook and often after eating ""Baby"" looks at me and says ""I liked it but I bet you can cook that. "" After eating at Verbena we both agreed, I had a better chance of staying upright while leaning on a slender reed than making any dish that we had a Verbena. I would highly suggest sharing plates and you just have to have the: () eggplant; () duck wings; () air dried beef; () grilled chicken; and the fish stew. Notwithstanding the the horrific parking experience I absolutely loved this experience. My fave new restaurant I went to recently. I love the seed bread with goat cheese and caramelized onions. Whatever they do with that is magicAnyone who knows me knows I'm not  a huge fan of salads but surprisingly, their vegetable centric dishes are my fave here, including the summer tomato salad. The guinea hen sausage platter, grilled squid, and peaches  and blackberries pop corn icecream were crowd pleaders too. I came back for brunch and was totally sold on the pork belly fried egg sandwich. Them poached eggs with grits were ok, but the French toast was a pass for me completely tasteless and left a weird aftertaste. Overall, a great space to check out, esp for dinner. A friend recommended we eat at Verbena a few days ago and I was skeptical after checking out the menu. The ingredients in many of the dishes seemed a little like the worst of ""Chopped"": make a desert that includes kale and mustard or an entrée with durian and Brussel sprouts. Fortunately Verbena's dishes weren't quite that out there but needless to say I arrived pretty skeptical.  But oddly enough, everything worked, to the point where you wouldn't even notice the components that made up the dishes if you weren't paying attention everything was that good! Even the deserts, which are often most vulnerable to odd ingredients, were delicious.  We will go back, and soon! had a fabulous birthday dinner in Verbena. All the dishes are amazing and beautifully done. Will definitely come back. Wow, Wow, Wow!   This is my very first Yelp review ever.  The food was so amazing at this restaurant that I felt compelled to sign up on Yelp and give a  star rating! I've now been here twice. The last time I came was with my parents on their latest visit to San Francisco. All I'll say about the food is that it is flawless. We ordered five or so dishes and were pleased by the fresh vegetables and unique sauce and texture combinations. What Verbena excels at is the service. Our waitress overheard that we were from D. C. , and passed along the message to their service manager, who also hailed from our nation's capitol. The service manager then brought us his favorite dish and chatted with us about home. My parents were delighted! Pricey, and the menu is limited. BUT if quality is what you're after, this place has it in spades. I've been following Chef Sean Baker since he worked at Millennium  and later when he opened Gather at Berkeley. He is perhaps my favorite chef in the Bay Area. I like the way he cooks high quality, creative and flavorful food for both omnivores and vegans. I tried Verbena for brunch and didn't disappoint at all. It was in fact delicious. The frittata and the red corn pancakes were particularly outstanding. The Rose I had with my meal was also quite good. I've browsed the menu for dinner and it looks tempting and seems to cater well to omnivores and vegans. I will definitely try it in my next trip to the Bay Area. However, a new concept dish, like the Vegan Charcuterie,  seems to be missing in Verbena. Chef Baker should seriously consider reviving it in Verbena now that it has been removed from Gather's menu. I think it would give the WOW factor that seems to be missing in Verbena and that was definitely present in Gather until chef Baker left. The day that the vegan charcuterie or something similarly creative appears in Verbena's menu, I will definitely give this restaurant the  stars it deserves. I'll say first of all: beautiful space and design, excellent service, nice wine and drink selection. Other than that, our food was consistently disappointing. Our main entree was the corn cream in carrot juice that could have come of out a truck stop. No creativity with the cheapest ingredients one could possibly ask form (sweet corn and beans!) with zero flavor (except for the cheap sweetness of the corn). We also ordered the shelling bean plate which neither of us could finish. That duck egg was not a good decision and the flavor of the sauce was essentially vinegar. We also ordered the tofu pasta dish, which was very good actually, but for $, we should have gotten three times more than what was on the plate. (Really?)For what what it costs coupled with the Gather reputation, I would expect more creativity, quality and even quantity. They are clearing cutting corners on the food to save on costs. Not just in quantity, but in quality and content. I should note that we said something to them about our experience and they we were very nice, understanding and accommodating and took off one of our meals from the bill (which was not our intention). Verbena if you are reading this, know that our  intention was  to make you better and to  help you create something with more quality and creativity in your menu. I know your space is expensive, but it's obvious you are cutting corners on your food costs to save money. Hope to check back in a few months and see some changes and return! Great date spot but a bit pricey for what you get. My date ordered a bottle of wine and they didn't have it so they gave us a discount on another bottle which was nice! We ordered the josey baker bread, one veggie inspired item (apples and cucumbers), two meat inspired ones(pork and chicken), and a desert. We shared all of our plates. It was just about perfect dinner with maybe one more plate for the hungry eaters. Cost was around $ with tip. fyi: the table was really small and the plates come out in big fancy serving dishes so it was a bit hard to get situated with food and drinks on one tiny table. I would suggest immediately dividing up all the serving into your individual plates so there is room before the next plate comes out. expensive, but really delicious food and drinks with a bright, lovely environment perfect for a lazy sunday meal (brunch, to be exact). i went for the Tymes Cure cocktail, X.  it tasted so refreshing and yummy i almost forgot that there was vodka in it.  i love how verbena legitimizes a stiff cocktail on a sunday morning outside the usual concept of bloody marys and mimosas.  for entree i ordered the french toasts.  i was pretty much sold once i saw ""hazelnut creme fraiche,"" since i love hazelnut anything.  and the toasts did not disappoint.  the fellow diner ordered the one of the last two orders of duck confit with shishito peppers and a fried egg.  and man, was that delicious.  may be the best savory brunch food item i have ever tasted.  the bill was a bit high, but the quality of food and service lived up to it. Swipe right. I want to meet you. I want to date you. I want to commit to you. Red corn pancakes topped with strawberries are that good. Such a rich, indelible flavor that was arguable one of the best pancakes ever enjoyed. But there is competition. Just as incredible was the scrambled eggs, chicken skin, tomatoes, cheddar puree and avocado on grilled bread. All at the once. In each bite. Absolutely incredible. Yet even more. We started with bread and lemon marmalade. We scooped. We spread. We marveled at how good something could taste. If Tinder were for dining out you'd be swiping this five star brunch right all day long.  stars for the food, drinks, and atmosphere (big, high ceilings) but the service was what knocked it down for us. First, the food  we went with  people and everything is meant to be shared, so we got to try a lot of dishes.  Standouts were the: shishito and padron peppers with okra, chicken thighs marinated in koji buttermilk, and for dessert, strawberry with tomato cake and fig & chocolate.  The only thing I would say we did not like was the huckleberry sundae, it was just too tart.  Everything else was good.  We did not try the salmon much (weirdly) to the server's dismay (see below). Drinks were good too, the only one we did not like was the aviatrix.  It kind of sums up what we did not like about the restaurant in general, it just seemed like they were trying really hard.  The food and drinks tasted good, and if they just stuck to that instead of making it really crazy/stand out as far as presentation, it would all probably taste even better.  The bar is nice as well, if you just want a place to have a drink. Our main issue was with the service.  It was to the point of annoyance.  For example, as mentioned above, the waiter tried REALLY hard to sell us the salmon. . . as in, he offered it at least three times, all the way through our meal.  He also kept coming back to ask if anyone needed anything  while we appreciated the attention, it was to the point where he was interrupting conversations.  I know service is a balance, and lack of attention isn't good either, but it would be helpful to read the patrons body language a bit better. We were very excited to try out this restaurant and came for dinner. The place looks nice and intimate. And the service was very lovely. The only thing negative was the food. My husband had the chicken, it was undercooked. I had the air dried beef; i found many pips. Then we ordered the fig & chocolate dessert (with peanut butter). It was way too salty! It's unlikely we would come back After walking  miles around the city, and desperate for a delicious cocktail and some appetizers, we stumbled upon Verbena in Russian Hill. Nestled amongst many other restaurants and cute shops, this was a great find. The cocktail list was of the savory nature, so my husband thoroughly enjoyed a old fashion. The bar tenders take the care and precision of making cocktails like a high end speakeasy. The bar is complete with hard to find liquors and a thoughtful wine menu. The JK Carriere Rose was the best Rose I have had, highly recommended. Since, we only had appetizers, we don't have a ton to go on, but the breads were delicious, and the shishito and padron peppers in an Indian curry with cow peas were scrumptious. Just watch out for those hot peppers every once in awhile! I love small plates when they're tasty and appropriately priced.  At Verbana, most of their entrees are small plates that sell at entree prices.  Nothing we had was better than average.  I live in the neighborhood and was hoping for better, but we won't be back. wow. the food here is just amazing. we tried a few items originally but after a few bites, we went ahead and tried everything on the menu  the food was just that good. i have absolutely no complains on the food. amazing and delicious. classy, clean decorum, good atomsphere. be warned though, even with a reservation we had to wait an extra  minutes. . not sure if it was just the day we went that had this issue. . ? but the place is small so it really depends on other patrons leaving in order for you to get seated. but notice that even with the wait, im giving this place stars because the food is really just that good. I dunno if others have found the customer service here to be as terrible as I have, but both times I've tried to give this place a shot they've done something to completely make me not want to ever go there. Latest example: I went there today with my girlfriend's parents who are in town. We get there at : and the front door is closed/locked, but there are clearly people in there. One guy comes to the door, opens it a peak, and I ask if they're open. He says, ""sorry but we open at :. "" At this point it's  minutes to : and there are clearly people in there. I sit there dumbfounded and say, ""isn't that like five minutes from now?"" He says ""yes"" and then closes the door in our faces. We proceeded to cross the street and go to La Folie Lounge, which was delicious. Screw you Verbena. Bring back Rex Cafe. I've been on a new restaurant binge lately, from Urchin to Aveline to Alta and I think Verbena so far has been my favorite because the food is really unique and executed perfectly. Verbena is a beautiful, modern restaurant perfect for a date  upon opening the heavy doors I was shocked at how empty the restaurant was on a week night. Opentable reservations were easy, and similar spots like  are always packed. Verbena serves various dishes which are meant to be shared, they recommend two plates per person although some items are bigger than others. * FIREBRAND BREAD ($)   STARS:Served with Verbena butter. Firebrand is a bakery in Oakland, Verbena serves  pieces with their own Verbena butter. I wouldn't say the bread is especially unique, but I love carbs in most forms, and I loved how fresh these thick cut slices were, and how it was slightly sour and served with a very soft whipped butter topped with large flecks of salt. I would encourage you to get it if you're looking to fill your stomach because the recommended two plates per person was not enough for me. * TOMATO AND FENNEL ($)   STARS:Seaweed cashew tonnato, lobster mushroom & saffron vinaigrette, rice cracker. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I typically hate anything with saffron (tastes like betadine to me), but this had a really light and unusual tasting dressing, heavy on the seaweed flavor. I didn't taste the lobster and I almost broke a tooth eating the rice cracker, but it was a very interesting take on a tomato salad. If you like seaweed and tomato I would recommend it, the tomatoes were incredibly fresh, but $ seemed hefty for a glorified tomato salad. * SHISHITO AND PADRON PEPPERS WITH OKRA ($)  .  STARS:fresh cow peas, fermented lime mayonnaise, curry leaf. This kind of reminded me of Spanish tapas, it was creamy but very flavorful. Like every other dish it was a combination of ingredients I've hever had before and I wanted to lick the plate clean. I wish the portion size was bigger. . . * SHELLING BEANS ($)  .  STARS:sunchoke peel dashi, duck egg, chanterelle. Beautiful dish of a large, slow poached duck egg topped with flower petals, and served on a bed of large beans. It wasn't salty enough for me, and it would have been infinitely better with meat, but the duck egg was cooked to perfection. * GRILLED SQUID ($?)  .  STARS:Served with squid ink compressed watermelon (didn't really taste the squid ink). This was nice and refreshing but kind of pricey for the portion size. The squid was on the fishier side and I think needed to be grilled longer to get the edges burnt. * FIG AND CHOCOLATE ($)   STARS:Peanut butter cookie milk jam, fig leaf chocolate ice cream. Milk jam apparently is a caramelized milk, then mixed with crumbled cookies. It is served with their homemade fig leaf chocolate ice cream, which is made by infusing the flavor of the fig leaves during the ice cream making process, then straining them before freezing. The chocolate ice cream was really smooth, rich and decadent and paired well with the thin buttery PB cookie, and milk jam is just a genius idea that topped it all off. Really good but I wanted more!Overall great date night place, really unusual but interesting dishes. Their menu is seasonal and changes often  would definitely return to try other things! Absolutely amazing!  We went here for brunch after we discovered that Sean Baker, the chef at Gather, is now at Verbena.  We had the squash and potato, mushroom and corn frittata and red corn pancakes.  Everything was superb!  The flavors in the squash and potato were what I would expect from food prepared by Sean Baker  incredibly flavorful, creative and innovative.  The mushroom corn frittate was very tasty.  The red corn pancakes were the best pancakes I think I have ever had.  Five stars!! Another solid meal at Verbena. Must haves:sprouted breadShishito pepper and padron pepper with chickpeaAvoid:Watermelon and squid with senise pepper, tomato vinegar, garum, mint  the squid was a bit fishy and the grapes and watermelon a bit too sweet and too strong,  overpowering the squidOK:Air dried beef with eggplant tartare smoked zinfandel grapes, cress, grilled bread  nothing to brag about. so so. the grapes are too sweetI feel like that the chef should bring back more vegetables from the garden, which are the best on the menu. I know how quickly I write off starkly negative Yelp reviews when I'm looking at a popular new place, so I'm a little leery of writing this. . . but my goal is simply to be honest and balanced. Ambience: .  stars  while becoming over done around town, the Edisonian lights, muted wood and earth tones work well here with the lofty ceilings and intimate table seating.  Food: .  stars  neither myself (vegetarian) nor my wife (omnivorous) gets what the hype is about.  our seeded bread was indeed tasty, but the tomato and fennel tripped up by a strange, almost repulsive sauce.  could be us but the ingredients were not complimentary.  i found myself wishing the succulent heirloom tomatoes came sans appetizer with only a pinch of salt and pepper.  We found the this year's shelling beans to be interesting and comforting but not ""transcendent"" or however the waiter described it.  My wife had the salmon and thought it good not great.  As a vegetarian, I had my entree self selected, the corn creamed in carrot juice, and really found the small sampling of side vegetables to be entertaining for but a second and then wondered what had happened to my $ and when was my entree coming.  Service:  stars  generally attentive, our napkins were folded two out of the three times we left our seats.  the staff were frequently present but didn't intervene at all the opportunities (e. g. cocktails drained, time to represent a menu or inquire about another desired drink) which is not too much to ask for this level of dining or this small a place. Overall, I'd head up the street to  instead in a heartbeat. . I'm not quite sure how this place only has  stars. We had  dishes, and I was shocked at how flavorful every single one of them was. Especially the salmon. Stop reading this and order the salmon already. The service was impeccable. I had told our waiter that I had a food allergy, and even the food runner was aware of this, confirming that each dish did not contain the allergen. This might be my new favorite spot in SF. I'll be back soon. Hue L. , our NYF, and I had our ""monthly"" dinner here last night.  PM reservations on a Friday night. We were a little late because parking is a b*tch in this neighborhood.  Although, technically, we were late mostly because we left late.  We actually found parking a couple blocks away within   minutes.  Just lucky, I guess. The place was packed when we walked in, but we were seated after a couple of minutes.  There were two vents under the seat where our NYF was sitting.  She was wearing a dress, so the hostess offered to turn down the air, so the vents wouldn't blow up her dress.  That was very considerate.  Our NYF mentioned later that one vent was blowing cold air and the other vent was blowing hot air, so it was an odd feeling on her legs during the meal. Our waitress recommended we have about   plates per person, so   dishes.  It seemed excessive, but she should know best, right?DRINKS:  Our NYF and I both ordered the Via del Rio  watermelon mezcal, cilantro, citrus, pineapple.  The watermelon drew me in.  It was tasty, but I couldn't really taste the watermelon.  It definitely had more of the citrus / pineapple taste going for it.  Hue L. ordered the Ruby Sour  bourbon, lemon, bitters, port  which he didn't say much about, so I can't give you much of an input on that. FOOD:  We decided to go with  dishes to share.  Tomato and fennel (seaweed cashew tonnato, lobster mushroom & saffronvinaigrette, rice cracker).  Basically a tomato salad.  I'm not the biggest fan of tomatoes, so it wasn't my favorite, but it was very flavorful and I liked the lobster mushroom.  This year's shelling beans cooked in last year's shelling bean miso (sunchoke peel dashi, sunflower hearts, soft cooked duck egg, chanterelle, summer savory).  We pretty much ordered this just because we liked what it was called.  This year's beans and last year's beans?  That's a lot of years worth of beans!  I liked the duck egg.  Oh!  And it came with sunflower petals on top.  You can eat sunflower petals!  I'm going to eat my flowers from now on when I'm hungry! ;) Smoked duck wings (strawberry early girl tomato hot sauce, last year's cucumbers, rau ram).  I loved the duck wings.  Saucy and flavorful.  Not too difficult to eat, although it's definitely finger food.  They bring moist towels to wipe your hands with when you're done eating.  Also, last year's cucumbers!  I wonder if they taste better than this year's cucumbers? Meatballs and clams in fermented green tomato broth (overgrown mareko fana peppers, new oil).  Only one meatball and clam per person, so it's definitely a small plate.  Good, but not my favorite.   Air dried beef and eggplant tartare on grilled bread (bone marrow vinaigrette, arugula). I liked this one!  I liked the toast that was covered in bone marrow vinaigrette.  I did not taste the eggplant at all, but I liked the beef.   Chicken thighs marinated in koji buttermilk (rice grits, pickled eggplant, shishito pepper, thai basil, sea spinach).  This was one of the bigger servings.  Two pieces of chicken which we cut into six pieces, so we each had two pieces.  It was very moist and flavorful.  The grits were pretty tasty as well, and I'm not a fan of grits. DESSERT:  We were totally and completely full.  We probably could've done with  plates, versus .  But we HAD to have dessert! Poached gravenstein apples, ginger custard, huckleberry, almond.  I actually liked the poached apples.  And the custard was good, even though I don't like ginger.  I liked the crunch of the almond and the sourness of the berries.  Yum!PRICE: $pp including tax/tip/drinks Loved this place.  The service was outstanding and the food was even better.  Stars for Service  I had made a mistake with my opentable rsvp and booked for the wrong night.  These guys are true professionals.  In a booked restaurant on a busy Friday evening, they managed to find a place for my party of .  Bravo fellas. . . . bravo!Food  flavors were interesting and unique in a lovely way.  I have found that with so many new places popping up all over SF, sometimes, the creative food can be too out there for me.  That was not the case at Verbena. .  stars  Chilled frog skin melon and eggplant soup  a nice start to the meal.  It was a bit sweeter than ideal for me but I still enjoyed it stars  Pink pearl & gravenstein apple with cucumber  nice and refeshing. A charming balance of sweet, tart, and nutty.  stars  Smoked duck wings  now this one was my absolute favorite.  Top notch and wonderfully unique flavors.  stars  Meatballs and clams in fermented green tomato broth  this was nice but I did feel the price was a bit steep for how much food was presented.  stars  Fort Bragg king salmon  this one, though likable, in my opinion it paled against the other items. Overall, really enjoyed it.  So happy they took over the space and can't wait to return. Met my meat and potatoes husband here for dinner.  He arrived first and was grumpy about the menu, it is not very extensive and is a little challenging.  But we ordered all vegetable dishes and loved everything, both of us!  The cocktails were good, the service very nice and the setting homey yet rustic, modern and  attractive.  We'll be back! Warm atmosphere, very friendly service. Had some wine and appetizers at the bar. They were super nice. The menu has a lot of unusual choices. The food is meant for sharing at the table. We tried many thing and the quality is excellent. Portions are small, bit good. The bread with seeds is an option to order and it is great. Meatballs & clams, chicken, green beans, hen etc is some of the items that were good. It isn't cheap, but what is in SF. The service was exceptional. Rachel really knew the menu.  The chocolate and fig dessert is excellent. The menu changes and isn't very extensive. The four of us went ahead and ordered the entire menu minus   dishes that didnt sound appealing to the majority. Everything we had was pretty good, as we progressed into the night the dishes definitely got more impressive. I enjoyed the fried chicken, they warn you that it might seem a little undercooked/red (considerate since once of the girls was preggers) the way they prepare it but it was DELISH and seemed fine!Typical dark/romantic vibe that you often see in SF ( for example). . overall no complaints.  Only  star missing for the fact that you had to order bread. . and I think it was pretty basic for $.  Also some of the starters were good, but not  star quality. . .  is still solid/repeatable though! :) I live around the block and was very excited to try out this restaurant.  I was blown away by the service and expressed as much  our server, Rachel, was by far the most attentive and knowledgeable waitress I've encountered in a very long time and it made the experience that much more delightful.  I joked early on that my gf is a super taster (which is true) and Rachel immediately understood and pointed out specific dishes that wouldn't overwhelm her taste buds.  Which was precious.  The great service extended to the rest of the staff as well, refills were prompt and everyone wore a smile. As far as the food goes, the menu is ever changing and loaded with fresh combinations of ingredients.  I thought the duck wings and meatballs were particularly tasty. The atmosphere is another plus  it's refined yet unpretentious with a lot of wood and exposed brick behind the bar. I really enjoyed Verbena for a friend's birthday brunch. I was a bit dresses but didn't feel overdressed with it's classy, upscale ambiance. I ordered a mimosa and it was so tasty. I think the minty leaf makes such a difference in making the drink so refreshing. All three brunch dishes were fabulous ordered the French toast which tasted very different from most French toasts I've had in the past it's actually the best I've had (I may change my mind after my brunch at Nopa next week). The egg dishes were a great compliment to the savory French toast. Can't get enough of Verbena! I've never been there for dinner, but it is one of my favorite places for brunch in San Francisco. All the dishes are well executed and have incredible flavor. We shared the French toast, with figs, hazelnut crème fraiche and mint; and the guinea hen boudin blanc, accompanied by perfectly fried eggs and potatoes.  Their menu changes often, so there is always something new to try. The red corn pancakes have been on the menu the last couple times we've been and they are pretty fantastic as well. Aching to try their dinner menu, will be back! Came for brunch , we eat at the bar and the bartender was very helpful and made some great suggestions. Even the drinks we tasty. This is a very cute place, They even have outside seating. Since we were a party of , we were able to try several dishes.  The portion size is small so great for sharing, kind of like tapas style.  Overall, everything was solid.  Very unique flavors and ingredients put together to create great concoctions. Not your typical menu items, all very innovative dishes.  They also change up their menu regularly so a great place to re visit again.  Definitely a place you should try. Came here for weekend brunch.  The space is cute and service is attentive.  I thought brunch was fine, but nothing spectacular.  There are some interesting combinations of ingredients on the menu.  I had the biscuits and sausage, which I found fairly underwhelming.  It was salty, a bit too heavy, and the gravy was not that flavorful.  The mimosas were good.  Overall, I might try it again, but I think there was just a bit too much of a ""look and see what I can combine together to make a dish!"" going on as opposed to thoughtfulness of what makes a dish really work. Second time there. First meal was delicious but squid and watermelon combo last night was out of this world. Just try it. The Octavia cocktail was good too. The Slovenian wine sounds interesting but just skip it. This could easily be the best farm to table restaurant in the city. It's a must try. Excellent cooking here, with emphasis on vegetables. Beautiful space. Great cocktails. Wonderful service. We had the sardines, the beans, meatballs, and the salmon. Everything was great but the meatballs were my favorite. It comes with clams on a bed of fermented green tomato sauce. Delicious. I'd love to come back and just have that dish at the bar. The food is definitely pricey for what you get at Verbena. I found myself asking why I paid so much money for vegetables at the end of the meal. At the same, my friend and I raved about how we ate the most delicious peas and carrots the entire meal. It is also a welcome change of ambiance and type of food on the divey north end of Polk St. We weren't rushed through out meal there and the wait staff was friendly and not overbearing. I made it back to Verbena last Fri night to grab dinner before a movie. We had an early reservation at :pm and the place was pretty quiet when we arrived. Again, I couldn't help but notice the airy and well designed interior and got to enjoy it more this time with a table inside. For eats we ordered the Firebrand bread ($), tavera beans & plum ($), meatballs ($), Chicken thighs in buttermilk ($) and rose ($/glass). Our server was super friendly, attentive and confirmed that we made some decent choices. After training for a / marathon, my husband was famished and tore into the bread  it really was quite good with shaved salt and butter made in house. Worth the additional $ in my opinion. I saw the seeded bread at the table next door and it looked pretty darn delicious too. Anyways, on to the other plates! The beans & plums were fresh and well presented. It felt good to balance out the meat dishes with veggies. Nice, but not a standout dish. Speaking of standouts  we were blown away by the meatballs. They were tender and flavorsome with hint of spiciness. We learned that they're made of chicken, bacon and pork belly. How can that not be amazing?! To wrap up, the chicken was delicious, crispy with a creamy texture. I really like how it was presented with two thighs and two sides of grains  perfect for sharing. We didn't love the grains, something about the flavor (maybe the hazelnut miso?) was a bit overwhelming. Once we were on our way out, the place was popping with people sipping drinks at the bar and practically every table was bustling. Definitely recommended for a date night or catch up with girlfriends. I'll be back to try more dishes soon! Came here last night and was pleasantly surprised as the previous place at this location was a flop.  Ordered the Seed Bread, Tomato and fennel, Squash and corolla potato with pumpkin seed milk, Meatballs, and Fort Bragg king salmon  more than enough food for  people.  The food was good  simple flavors, and nothing too over the top.  All in all, very filling our eyes were bigger than our stomachs.  The waitstaff were VERY accommodating and served us even after the kitchen was technically closed (:pm).  Our server also let us try a couple different wines before we settled on one.  The decor inside is great  slightly more upscale but (like the food) still simple and not over the top.  All in   stars for great service and ambiance.  The food is very good, though slightly underwhelming for the price given the abundance of great dining choices in SF.  I would % come here again good date spot or place to grab a drink a few food plates. I think I could give this restaurant a five star, but I reserve opinion  until I  have dinner there.   Today for first time, we visited Verbena for brunch.  Even though we arrived  late, after pm, we were welcome!   The food was superb, and so was the service.  I never had a better frittata.  It was presented  in such artistic and way too!  Every bite was a delicious delight!  My husband had the pork belly and egg sandwich.  Unique and delicious!  I don't know where they get their bread, but is is superb!  We are looking forward to a dinner at Verbena, next week.   We don't want to wait too long, this place is great!  Well done Verbena! this highly anticipated new dining place was a bust. . sorry to say. Verbena looks great yet simply does not deliver great tasting cuisine. The salmon and chicken dishes were undercooked. Sure, the place is beautiful and well appointed with mod wood and a slick bar. Yet again, the food is not indicative of Verbena's appearance. Too many other places in SF that seriously rival Verbena. Cheers,Sam I enjoyed the dining experience at Verbena, as everything is professionally prepared and the service staff is great, but the food simply wasn't that appealing to me.  Perhaps it's a matter of personal taste, but I don't understand what everyone is raving about  the flavors here are kind of weird and weren't the type to ""grow on me"".  The duck wings were the only thing that were very good.  Watermelon and squid was alright, while the meatballs were very odd tasting.  The chicken thighs were decent but again, contained odd flavors that I wasn't a huge fan of. Great food, cocktails, and service!  All I ate were vegetables, and it was super tasty, and I was stuffed.  My carrots tasted like. . . BBQ ribs?  They were really ""meaty"".  And the bread made completely out of seeds  I've never tasted anything like that before.  Everything was fantastic.  Our server, Becky, was so super nice, and very accommodating.  I told her I was vegan, and she didn't even flinch, and knew exactly what to order and what to modify (if necessary).  She even brought me a cherry sorbet for dessert, and told us about the farm where their veggies come from.  Delightful!  I will be back, a lot. I cannot say enough about this place.  So, I have always been the one to make fun of vegetarians, but I could totally live the life if my food was as inventive and tasty as this place.  There are meats on the menu, but their true talent is with vegetables.  Service was attentive to detail and very good.  Chef Baker stopped by the table twice to answer questions and even brought us a dish to try.  What a wonderful experience for our group from such a talented individual.  I can also say it is the first time I have had cucumber and tomato for dessert.  We ate every bite. Came here not sure what to expect, and left feeling lucky that we had ""discovered"" this little gem. The food was beautifully presented, combinations of ingredients masterfully blended, and each dish was a creative artform. We shared each dish, everyone a winner, and must say the Meatballs Mole was especially creative, and could become addictive. The Popcorn ice cream dessert was WONDERFUL. We will return. Norma S This restaurant is named as one of best brunch places in SF. We came here on a Saturday for brunch with high expectations, but I was not impressed by food, but impressed by the interiors: earthy, exquisite, and yet low profile. We ordered pastrami, pancake, and scramble eggs. I've eaten at Verbena several times now for dinner and for brunch. Each experience has been delicious and satisfying. The staff is excellent and takes care of every detail. The decor and ambiance both earthy and elegant, by favorite combination. The food is unique, creative, and most of all delicious. Sean Baker creates divine dishes out of simple ingredients. . . his genius shows on the plate. He is a master with vegetables but there is so much to like on the menu including fish, meat and poultry. My favorite right now is the green beans with cherries. . . but that will change with the seasons. Just go. I've eaten at scores  of restaurants in San Francisco over many years and this was one of a very few times I ever sent food back and certainly the first time I ever got in a polite disagreement with the staff about whether  chicken was cooked sufficiently for the diner's taste .   What was served was both cold  and very red (bloody) at the bone.  I know what juicy looks like and I know what undercooked looks like. We were told by the server that  this red flesh was either the marinade or the brine; yet the outer flesh was not red in the least.  The most incredible moment was some  ten minutes into this topic with staff when my friend's meal was  already eaten and when the manager (?) finally came and took the uncooked chicken back to the kitchen.  She finally returned to tell us that the chef had confirmed it was properly cooked.   The evening felt a little like a skit from SNL.  The salad was OK. Awesome, innovative food.  It kind of reminds me of a less rich and heavy version of TBD. The design is kind of subdued and minimalist.  It can have different vibes depending on who's in there. . . Sometimes  really quiet and feel like a fancy upscale place, and then sometimes more bustling and lively and more casual feeling. Either way, always some delicious, interesting dishes you can't find elsewhere. The service was great and the decor pretty, but our waiter guaranteed us the best meal of our lives and this was far from it. Everything was very fresh and flavorful, but the combination on flavors felt sometimes like a stretch. Oh and the duck wings were waay too salty. This place was really great, we came here on a whim when another place we planned on eating at was too long of a wait for some in our group.  The bartender was extremely nice and gave one of the people in our group a new glass of wine when they did not like the original glass they ordered.  Our waiter and manager were very helpful in dealing with a food allergy in our group and offered to make items off menu as to make sure there would be no problems. Additionally, our waiter was hilarious and made the whole meal more entertaining.  Just about everything we had was amazing, they pickle and ferment a lot of items and put some combinations and flavours together that none of us had really tried before.  This is a restaurant for sharing and most of the plates are on the smaller side.  We were all very satisfied by the end of the meal.  It is not the cheapest restaurant in town but the ambiance, food, and service were all fantastic. Came here for brunch on Father's Day, and it was INCREDIBLE. The service was amazing, and it was just a wonderful experience all around. The red corn pancakes, porcini and pastrami with friend eggs, and the poached eggs over kale and pancetta were all to die for.  The Verbena mimosa is also delicious. I can't wait to come back. Food here was surprisingly good despite the menu (didn't really contain my favorite foods).  Came here with a group of  girls and we left spending about $ a person WITH drinks. We went family style on everything and it was a great value and food was definitely an improvement over marabella.  Would return. Impeccable service, great vibe (somewhere between laid back and nice date spot), fantastic food. I generally don't like to repeat restaurants, but I came here twice in one month, once for brunch and another for dinner, and loved both meals. THE COST: About $ for  drinks,  starter,  share dishes, &  dessert. A very filling meal for two. MUST HAVES: Green beans & cherries, Meatballs in Mole, Chicken thighs!COCKTAILS: yelp. com/biz_photos/verb…* Emerald Remedy # (gin, pimm's chartreuse, celery, lemon. $)   starsI told my server I like something well balanced with tart flavors. He went straight to this one, which hadn't jumped out at me when I looked at the menu at all, but I trusted his recommendation and this was perfect for me. * Octavia BLVD (bourbon, gran classico, amaro, orange. $)   starsNormally I find these old fashioned type drinks too strong, but we were both surprised that this had a fairly strong citrus presents that balanced the boozy taste really well. DINNER: yelp. com/biz_photos/verb…* Firebrand artisan bread (verbena butter. $)  .  starspic: yelp. com/biz_photos/verb…This would be great as free bread, a soft sourdough that serves to soak up the sauces really well, but since were were paying I expect something much more amazing. * Seared squash (penelope peas, vadouvan squash flower sauce, last year's Manzano peppers. $)  .  starspic: yelp. com/biz_photos/verb…A rather visually stunning dish, but I found the squash to be undercooked and too hard. The peas were really fresh and the sweetness and slight crunch went well. My friend didn't think the squash was undercooked and enjoyed this. * Green Beans & cherries (charmoula, black walnut yogurt, black olive honey. $)  .  starspic: yelp. com/biz_photos/verb…Doesn't look very impressive, but this was really, really good. All the different types of peas had slightly different tastes, and all were fresh and crunchy. The olive honey was surprisingly amazing  a denser texture than regular honey, with a hint of savory. That mixed with the black walnut yogurt and the crunchy green beans was great. * Meatballs braised in black mole (hominy cooked in whey, kale. $)   starspic: yelp. com/biz_photos/verb…cross section: yelp. com/biz_photos/verb…I've never liked mole but I ordered this (somewhat hesitantly) because everyone raves about it  and they're right! I honestly had no ideas that meatballs, just as a concept, could be this amazing. The texture was soft, and the flavor was crazy intense and delicious. I loved the hominy (they use this well  it also came in a brunch dish with duck) and the texture of the soft chewy bits mixing with the cheese and thick mole sauce. I can't truly describe what made this so good since I don't completely understand it myself  just try it!* Chicken thighs marinated in koji buttermilk (sonoma grains cooked dirty, red corn & red padron sauce. $)   starspic: yelp. com/biz_photos/verb…cross section: yelp. com/biz_photos/verb…Another amazing dish! Plus this was huge, very filling for two. The thighs were perfectly juicy and tender, and WOW the crisp on the skin and its slightly charred flavor was like heaven. The texture of the soft grains was really nice and all the flavors fitted together seamlessly. DESSERT: yelp. com/biz_photos/verb…* Squash Cake (chocolate ice cream, squash blossom anglaise. $)   starspic: yelp. com/biz_photos/verb…A very intense chocolate flavor in the ice cream (which melted WAY too fast  should've been kept colder and maybe put together and brought out more quickly). The squash cake was definitely unique, its texture a little dry though I like that these were edge pieces that had a little bit of that hardness on one edge. The little drops of anglaise were a nice flavor complement as well. The worst service I've ever encountered in a restaurant a this price point. Check in host didn't know how to use computer. Told me I had no reservation. Turns out, he didn't know how to set the computer to ""today"" and was really saying I didn't reserve another day. Server was strange, fidgety, not knowledgeable, distracted. Felt like he was on crack. When he poured my wine, it splashed all over the place, on the table, dribbled down the outside of the glass, he didn't even seem to notice, or if he did, made no effort to wipe it up. Wine list was horrible. Not a single decent option on the menu. Food was mixed. A few dishes were good, others were boring. Food was the high point of the experience but all the other stuff distracted from it. I'd say, overall, the people running this restaurant don't know how to run a restaurant. Very solid brunch option. The menu is clever and the execution of everything was beautiful and delicious. I will be back. Went there for brunch. SoWe came with a quiet baby that slept the whole time. The head guy gave us the evil eye. Fine, not everyone likes babies. The wines, $ $ for a wine glass. I know the winery and the guy who makes itand he charges $ for a bottle and $ wholesale. So drinks are overpriced. The food, my wife had pastrami and porcini fried eggs. Which was a piece of meat, with eggs and fried potatoes. I had, fried egg and pork belly sandwich which came with fried potatoesand our friend had a frittata. The food was ok but nothing much above you making some meat, egg and a potato at home. So  people $ and the drinks were too expensive so we left quickly. So ok, but wouldn't go back. I'd simply buy crab and make crab Benedict at homealong with  bottles of expensive wine. So three starsIf you can't cook and have just sold your first startup. Well then this place is for you and  bottoms up! Can I extoll the ways that my dining experience was stellar last night? Okay, here are a few: Impeccable, attentive, and patient service. This is *rare* in SF. Rare. Usually, my feeling is that servers here have are disinterested in the customer's dining experience. My experience at Verbena was the opposite of this, i. e. , attentive, impeccable, and patient. I could have frustrated a person with ordinary patience by repeating   times that my fiancee and I were gluten sensitive.  He handled it with kindness and skill. Also, he checked on us throughout the meal and ensured that our dining needs were being met. Also, the hostess helped me right away. This is rare in SF restaurants, and something for which I am grateful. Usually, I wait   minutes for a hostess to come to the front of the house and talk to me about my reservation. As a former New Yorker, I find this to be annoying. The food! Delicious! We all relished every bite. The chef changed his creations to be GF so that we could enjoy them. Thank you! Decor  A great mixture of grounded dark, heavy furniture and spacious verticality. Teal green tiles in the bathroom are a rich touch. Letting us sit. We closed down the restaurant. The staff didn't interrupt our long sobremesa. This is much appreciated, because one of our party was in town from Spain. Good service, great ambiance, good food for about   a plate, family style  menu changes. Outdoor seating is nice. Must orders:. Meatballs in smokey delicious sauce. Carrots and Pea deliciousness (if choosing, I prefer the carrots/pea dish over the charred carrots). Mushrooms (also smokey deliciousness)Drinks are good and creative at around $Also enjoyed the sprouted seed bread. Delicious vegetable forward restaurant, that also serves tasty meat dishes. Ingredients are locally sourced from nearby farms, or gathered wild. Some of the dishes may sound like strange combinations (such as beets with strawberries, or molasses charred carrots), but are surprisingly delicious.  Be adventurous.  The duck wings and mole meatballs are also a delight.  There are an inventive selection of cocktails on menu as well.  Can be a bit tricky to get reservations, but worth it if you plan a week or two ahead.  Also, they have a new private upstairs dining room for large groups (up to ). i've had Verbena bookmarked since it's opening late last year. today i finally got my chance to check them out for brunch and my expectations were more than met. i'd been to Gather in Oakland so i knew the food would be good but didn't want to get my hopes up. in my opinion, the brunch at Verbena is better than the brunch served at Gather. i got the pastrami and porcini with fried potatoes, fried eggs and a horseradish sauce. the portion was generous and it was SO DAMN GOOD! the flavors just worked well together. my friend ordered the french toast with strawberries and rhubarb, which was also really great. i cannot wait to go back to check out their dinner. Wonderful flavors and great ambiance. Especially loved the meatballs in mole. OMG! I have been anxious to try brunch here for a long time.  It was worth the wait.  Holy cow! Nothing short of amazing.  Our waiter, a very cool guy from Australia was superb, made nothing but great recommendations that were right on point.  He was awesome!  Despite all the mediocrity that occupied this space perviously, Verbena is far from mediocre, its STELLAR!  I will be back! It was perfect to celebrate my birthday with my husband alone. Decor and silverwares were rustic and contemporary. It was a hip and yuppie San Franciscan scene with excellent service and quiet ambiance. And the best part was food; we had sprouted seed bread, duck wings, cucumber salad, mushroom & bean, meatballs and their bite sized cheesecake with edible flower pedals and fruits. . . all delicious, wholesome and thoughtfully put together. They seem to make their own variety of pickled vegetables which were served with various dishes. We didn't order the special, Kimchi tartar with squid which I wish I had. The menu changes every week with chef's favorites so be open minded. Review of bar only. Wine list organized by winery  who orders wine that way?  Especially when the wineries are rather obscure.  Totally pretentious.  WAY overpriced.  $ for a bottle of average wine? (we couldn't find a light red for anything less. )  Oh, and the waiter tried to upsell me to a $ bottle. . . Having loved dinner at Verbena, I was excited to try their brunch. I wasn't disappointed! I went with a group, so we were able to try nearly every dish. I was pleased to find a diverse cocktail and wine/beer list, just as at dinner. Although the menu was now brunch worthy with several egg dishes, it still represented what this restaurant does best  let quality, seasonal produce shine. Service was still prompt & friendly, the decor welcoming and comfortable, the noise level was moderate allowing  of us to converse with ease. Of the dishes we had, here's what stood out: the little gem with snap pea and green almond salad, the pork belly with fried eggs and english peas, the french toast with kumquat & strawberry with hazlenut creme fraiche, the cauliflower and cheddar fritatta with crispy potatoes, and the buttermilk biscuit with saugage and an herb bechamel sauce (see photos). So basically, skip the carrot pancake and order everything else! Delicious and inventive food that has a refreshing focus on vegetables. You really don't find many non vegetarian restaurants who elevate vegetables like Verbena does. Every course was creative and delicious. The atmosphere is simple, lit by the ubiquitous Edison bulbs that grade most SF restaurants these days. The one thing that took away from our experience was the service. Not awful, but definitely rough around the edges. Some plates were delivered to the wrong table, and others took very long to arrive. Make a reservation and try a plate from each section :) Would give .  stars if I could.  Came in for brunch on a busy Saturday morning and got seated pretty quickly.  Hostess, waitstaff, and bartender were all very sweet and friendly, but the service was so slow.  We waited a good while to put our drink/food order in.  Once we did, the food came out pretty quick but we still hadn't received our beverages  pet peeve. We split the chocolate granola and cheddar frittata.  The presentation was fun and flavors were good, nothing really wowed me though.  Definitely glad to have made the stop in but won't be running back.  Hoping they expand their menu, or at least the portion sizes, in the near future! A group of three enjoyed a refreshing brunch here this past weekend. The indoor atmosphere was calm and soothing, with several trees in the sunlit room. I ordered the Fried Egg and Beef Sandwich, with jalapeño aioli. Not too spicy, but was still immensely flavorful, just right. My friends ordered the Poached Eggs with Braised Duck Legs, and Grilled Boar Ham and Fried Egg, respectively. Seems eggs are part of everybody's orders. We also all shared a side of bacon, which was crispy and delicious. Even thick!Must say, they put great effort into their tasty cocktails to make them unique. Tried both their Bloody Mary and their Mimosa, and each were inventively above par. Looks like they even serve a bev called ""The Gilded Lily""  too perfect! Lovely place for brunch/lunch: Warm staff with good recommendations Nice relaxing interior space Generous portions Excellent fluffy frittata Not too sweet carrot pancakes, nice nasturtium butterDefinitely would be back.  Relaxed, top notch ingredients, simple, but with an elegant finish. Enjoyed a wonderful date night with Hubby and ate about % of the menu which was DELICIOUS! The ambiance is nice and mixology drinks were a nice touch to kick off the evening! We'll be back! I really hope this restaurant stays as I know this particular location has turned so many times. Everything was totally amazing. Their seed bread is made in house as is the goat cheese. All the dishes were savory and cooked to perfection. Their dirty rice should be served as a side because it's that freaking good! There's chopped up liver in the rice and OMG I wanted MORE! Also had the asparagus and button mushrooms and they were both so good. Their dessert with the peas was daring. . . . not sure what I thought about it but it didn't stop me from eating it.  Overall this place is definitely worth giving a go. Their cocktail menu is just as amazing. Do I remember all the drinks I had? Nope because I was pretty toasty by the end. All I remember was a burnt sprig of rosemary. . . Bartenders are adorable and attentive. Everyone there obviously appreciates good food. Give it a go! This place is excellent all around. I ate: bread w/ cheese (i forget the name) but the bread had seeds and it was served with a soft a mid cheese and I believe pickled onions. carrots: served with a couple of different sauces, delicious. squid with asparagus and ink: served chilled. delicious mole pork meatballs: I love me some mole! mole mole mole !All paired with excellent selection of wines.  Only downside is that there are more options by the bottle. .  starsreally beautiful restaurant, exceptional service, stellar food.  price point could be better. standouts:beetslamb sausagekoji chickenchocolate dessert with nettle ice creamwith all the new california small plate type restaurants popping up (Alta CA, Stones Throw, etc), it's easy to be underwhelmed by the similarities.  this one definitely stands out, a must try. Wow we were really impressed with Verbena!  I think Michael Bauer needs to come back  he'll nudge his review up to three stars.  The worst part, hands down, is trying to find parking.  After driving around for  minutes, we headed home and called Uber.  The restaurant was great about it  we'd kept them updated and they saved our table, which was waiting for us when we arrived  minutes late. Other than parking, almost everything was fantastic. The ambiance is delightful  rustic chic with gorgeous wood.  We were seated upstairs with a terrific view of the restaurant below.  The carrots are beautifully presented and amazing!  The meatballs in mole were out of this world.  We also loved the seeded bread (an upsell by our server, totally worth it) and the duck wings were much meatier than we'd expected.  We tried the molasses cake with carrot sorbet for dessert  beautiful and delicious.  Two minor downsides: small beer and (relatively) small wine by the glass lists.  Would love to see more; also, the coffee service was a bit off  our dessert arrived first, then about  minutes later the coffee and about another  minutes later, cream and sugar.  Overall, though, one of our best dinners out in SF in recent memory and we've already made reservations to return. At last I got to eat here and try their culinary repertoire! And what a range of flavors to sing in.  Out of the five dishes that we ordered four were excellent. Strawberry, beets in rhubarb was rich and full flavor, plus arugula was a nice touch. Same goes for squids. Excellent pairing with light vegetable aioli bed, with a bit of bite to close out the full range of flavors. Ginger bread crumbled too easy, but the flavors were astonishing with a colorful citrus sorbet and strong kick  of ginger. Swordfish was well worth the wait with a very pleasant sauce that complements the spices of the fish. Presentation was key and I would highly recommend you try this rotating menu of well though out cuisine. I can't wait to go back and try more of these culinary delights! Um, Yeah, I mean, ok,, Its good. Is it mind blowing? No.  Is its better than most?  Maybe. . . ?  Maybe+?I think the fact that Verbena has been open for how many months now? ? ?And still only has  reviews on Yelp ( with mine) kind of says it all. Its not so amazing that you go home, open Yelp, and write a killer review. But then again, you don't feel the need to do the opposite either, which is run home and write a really bad review. For those reasons, Yes, I will reiterate.  Stars. I will say the cocktail I got with jalapeno was quite good. The wine list?  It felt like i had to spend $ bucks to get anything decent and we all know that is silly. The food?The Carrots and Meatballs were yummy. The Quail was really good. The mushrooms and the Trotter thing were just ok. Service was attentive.  Maybe a tad overly attentive, but I'll take it over rude or non existent. Will I go back?  Sure.  When?  When somebody else invites me. Not rushing back on my own. Went back a second time and glad to say still as impressed as the first time. Food fresh and creative and absolutely delicious.  Excellent service also.  Look forward to our rd time in a few weeks. Had a great date night here, very welcome addition to Polk St. Only ""miss"" was the squid dish. Loved everything else. Edible Art.  It was date night, and I couldn't have asked for a better vibe or a better meal.  The decor is sexy, the staff were super attentive and friendly, and the food and cocktails were delicious.  Seed bread, carrots, beets, gem lettuce, brassicas.  All excellent.  Great vegetarian meal. We had a late brunch, and opted for the bar.  Everything we ordered was delicious, and I don't do brunch, typically.  I like lunch. Anyhoots, we had biscuits & gravy, broccoli frittata and trotter terrine and drinks, duh. Perfect portions for the three of us, and the bartender was training new employees he was patient, funny and kind to the newbies, which I loved. This is a very well run, comfortable place. Inventive dishes in small portions. #sanfrancisco #restaurantreviewIt's difficult to share these plates with more than another person. The portions are, for the most part, quite small. If you're in a sizable group, you'll definitely need to order multiples. The meatballs in mole sauce and the duck wings were great. Nice selection of vegetarian dishes. Try the carrots! They're smokey and taste like sausage, in a good way. Cool, modern vibe. Great service. Full bar and good cocktails. Service was friendly and attentive, drinks were unique and tasty, food was flavorful and multi dimensional! Amazing selection and quality! Highly recommend for a new ish restaurant in town!"
Beso Bistronomia|4.0|Tapas/Small Plates in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|55|-1|4.07272727273|" Great all around dining experience. I recommend it! This place is so amazing, the Fideau Negre is to die for. Great staff and really cute ambiance. I will definitely come back Wow, just wow! An awesome tapas bar, in the Castro? I stopped in with two friends and we just ordered off the happy hour menu and we all left very satisfied. Excellent service, attentive without being cloying. And to top off our meal with the churros? Delightful! I'll be coming back for more! So here's some good news. . . I *did* get my Bulgari gift bag back :)  That's great that they kept it.  Not sure it warrants another star actually, no  but maybe a sign that at least they're somewhat trustworthy? Awesome tapas! Loved the porchetta, squid ink wild rice, steak (with delicious brussel sprouts) and tons of other goodies. Also, hands down the best churros i have ever had! Besos tapas are fresh with complexity in flavor while the service is friendly and energetic. One of our absolute favorites in the Castro. As a sidenote, highly recommend the carrots. (Yelp needs to get on top of half stars  this is not a four star or three star review/restaurant. . . it's somewhere in between). Overall, it was a good experience. Our waiter was friendly, helpful and attentive, without being annoying. He was very accommodating with the wine  it's almost all Spanish wines, which I'm not terribly familiar with, so he brought over a few bottles of wines available by the glass and let me take a taste of each. The space is cool  I liked the decor, it feels homey but modern. The food was a bit up and down: Valdeon Blue Cheese: fair portion of cheese, but came with lousy bread, and not enough bread. Get better bread.  The kale, squash and apple salad: very good. It was a little over dressed for my taste, but the flavor was terrific, the portion was large, everything tasted fresh.  Mushroom Toast thing: fantastic, those mushrooms were SO good.  Brussel Sprout Special: terrible. I mean literally inedible. Overcooked, soft, mushy, soupy, salty, acidic, gross. Do not order.  Pork Belly  holy cow, fantastic. Melt in your mouth texture, delicious flavor. Definitely order this!  Garlic Shrimp: meh. This was fine. Portion was tiny,  very small shrimp. Not enough garlic flavor.  Chocolate Desert Thing with Salted Caramel: Super delicious! I'd go back. I think they're doing a good job and will likely improve the longer they are over. Except for the Brussle Sprouts. I don't know what they were thinking even serving those. YUCK. I found all the plates to be overly oily / greasy. The presentation is nice, except for the fried potatoes that would look at home next to an order of buffalo wings in a sports bar. Wines were good. Restaurant is really noisey, I guess because of concrete floors and ceiling. Over all I think there are many many more better restaurants in SF for the price. Try Contigo for tapas. OK taste, tiny portions crazy expensive. I would not go again.  Had to share a table to boot.  Spent over $ for four and still went and got something to eat at Eureka across the street directly after. What a warm and inviting restaurant.  I was really impressed by the good as well. The service was good, everyone was friendly.  The food was really good too.  I really loves the pan con tomate (which is one of my fav tapas. . . so simple but tasty), the patatas bravas and the garlic shrimp.  For our main course we had the paella which was delicious. Definitely coming back to try some of their other menu items. Amazing ambiance, as many Castro restaurants tend to have. Food that leaves a lot to be desired, as many Castro restaurants tend to serve. We ordered:  paella: good variety of shellfish (I only tried the shrimp, which were plump & fresh. ) Over salted rice, though I did enjoy the spice combination. Texture was very firm & chewy, similar to a grain like farro. Would not order again.  gambas al ajillo: too few shrimp in a portion (six. ) I'm only complaining because I thought they were very good. Liked the light wine & garlic broth. hanger steak: did not try, as it was prepared medium rare. Zero enthusiasm from his side of the table for this dish. Manchego trigal: cow's milk, hard, not too sharp. Loved the accompanying quince paste (or was that guava?) If they had a sampler of three cheeses, we would've loved that. I'd come back to try their non meat items like toast points with a mushroom medley or their fried potatoes with garlic aioli. Quite underwhelmed with what I tried, but I enjoy Spanish tapas, & I feel there is more to be discovered on Beso's menu. We had a good visit. No reservation but the hostess was helpful in finding a bar spot that worked for the  of us. We only ordered the Happy Hour items (it was snack time) but those were great and the service and attention was bravo. The fried potatoes are to be commended. SO good, I'm thinking about them now! (why do so many places serve tasteless potatoes?) I look forward to going back and trying some of the real menu items. SUPER addition to the Castro! I have eaten here twice now. Great tapas. Everything I have had here has been outstanding.  The pancetta is amazing.  The ensalada de pulpo was to die for.  It is not a cheap place even if it is tapas but for the price you get plenty of food. horrible acoustics and equally bad service with just average paella made for a rather poor dining experience. stunning buildout and furnishings and our califrito desert were beso's only saving grace. perhaps i'll lower my expectations and return to see if i was wrong. . . nice restaurant  a converted garage! go for the paella and pulpo a la plancha. YUM. The octopus and mushrooms with egg yolk were some of the best I've ever had. Would just suggest pacing out your ordering if you're not in a rush or they are almost too efficient. Love the churros for dessert too. It's not cheap but the flavors were explosive. Two words. PORK BELLY. Okay, I'll add two more. GOOD TAPAS. I think that really says everything I need to say. Great date/double date spot. Wouldn't recommend a larger group than . Nice wine/beer menu & excellent food. You should definitely try the toast point w/ chorizo & quail egg! I have to say, they nailed it with this place. I have been there a few times now and am still delighted by how all the staff make you feel like family.  Of course, the food is delicious, and the tapas style menu is perfect for those of us who want to taste a bit of everything, but don't need a pound of it. Great addition to the neighborhood! Love this new comer, just great!Walked in early for some food, greeted and seated, interesting menu, and the wines!We had a great time, the food was perfect, the wines we tried were excellent, and our server was friendly, well trained and helpful. Wonderful food and wine, come check it out. Enjoy! Must get the pork belly. The softest, tastiest, melt in your mouth piece of pork you'll ever have. Period. All around fantastic food. We had the Spanish cheese (Garrotxa), bread with crushed tomatoes and garlic (pan con tomate), chicken skewers, wild mushrooms with egg yoke, potatas bravas, and garlic shrimp. Not one bad dish. The service was top notch as well with a cool inviting atmosphere. Best tapas rest I've been to in the city. Let's face it, the Castro isn't exactly known for having the best food in the city, but Beso is definitely setting out to change that!Overall the meal was great  everything from the service, to the ambiance, to the food.  The staff is very welcoming (even got hugs on the way out from the owner) and the waiter was knowledgeable on the food/wine and made some great recommendations. In fact, everything sounded so good on the menu that we went a little crazy ordering before the waiter told us to pull back. I really appreciated him actually telling us we were ordering too much food vs. trying to just upsell us to make more money. FOOD:Montado de Atun (/)  two small pieces of toast topped with spanish cured tuna, pickled shallots, roasted tomato and an aioli . . . very fresh, tangy and deliciousEnsalada de Zanahorias (/)  roasted baby carrots, yogurt sauce, cilantro, marcona almonds, vinaigrette . . . amazing flavor, carrots are from their farm in Napa and the quality of the ingredients definitely stood outPanceta (/)  this is a giant portion of braised pork belly, we found the garlic in either the mashed potatoes underneath or the aioli to be a little overpowering, but the pork itself was delicious.  It was almost too much pork belly, I would think they should cut the portion down and make it more of a $  dish and not $.  Paella (/)  this was the star of the night!  heaping portion of seafood (clams, mussels, monkfish, shrimp, squid), perfectly prepared.  It's $ and perfect for  people, but could easily be shared with a party of  if you were ordering a bunch of other small plates to go along with it.  Definitely some of the plumpest, juiciest, sweetest mussels I've ever eaten. Chocolate Brownie + Horchata Ice Cream  I rarely order dessert out, but this sounded too good to pass up.  We weren't disappointed! The brownie comes out in a cast iron pan, piping hot from the oven, topped with homemade ice cream that was the perfect compliment to the rich chocolate brownie.  The brownie had some crispy, toffee like topping on it that added a great crunchy textural component too. WINE:The by the glass options are limited but we had one glass of white and one glass of red.  Nothing really that exciting, so I would say the wines left something to be desired. All in all a fantastic experience in a great neighborhood space.  We will surely be back to try the handful of other dishes we wanted to order. Beso is one of those places that make me regret I no longer live a block away. Quick summary: amazingly delicious food, beyond expectations service, and creative/inventive space. FOOD (for ):Olives  for $, couldn't ask for more. We definitely enjoyed the variety. Setas  wild mushroom a la carbonara!  Ok I made that up, but when you mix the raw yolk topped with pecorino with the shrooms underneath, you'll think of exactly the pasta dish. And how lovely it is!  The earthiness was balanced by the citrus nicely. Paella  generous portions and very flavorful!  The seafood was cooked to perfection (shrimp was succulent, mussels were plump, squid was tender, and fish was flaky) and the rice, oh my. Each kernel seemed to have been injected with flavor and cooked al dente. And the crispy bottom (socarrat?), wow!  Dessert was a chocolate bomb!  Forgot the name but it was the brownie with chocolate ice cream. The crispy sugary bits were a nice texture contrast and the hot brownie/ice cream gave the temperature contrast. Yum!SERVICE:Everyone was great, super attentive, and really just wanted us to have an awesome time. I ended up having a mini wine tasting because () I didn't know half the grapes, and () I wasn't sure what would go with our dinner.  Talk about service!SPACE:What can I say, I can't believe that space used to be a garage!  They did great with the brick wall, wooden beams, lighting, etc. I'm impressed. Happy they're here and can't wait to be back!  Thanks guys! Incredible food, awesome atmosphere, and the partnership for fresh vegetables is a welcomed treat. Francisco was warm and inviting. Will definitely be back!! Pleasantly impressed by Beso. In my ventures into the various Spanish/latin themed restaurants in SF, Beso has been my favorite thus far. I enjoyed the atmosphere with red brick walls, an open kitchen and great lighting. The design allows for an airier feel and date ambiance that I liked. If I lived closer I'd be back often and probably be the creeper in the corner drinking his wine, eating his cheese and reading a book. They carry Idiazabal cheese here! It's so rare for me to find a place that offers it on menu and allows me the opportunity to polish my cheese snobbery. The squid dish was well cooked and delicious and just briny/vinegary enough without being overpowering. The star of the evening; however, was the paella. More often than not I'm disappointed by different renditions of paella but Beso's was fantastic. They got that crispy, slightly charred (Soccarat) bottom layer cooked perfectly and it was topped with generous helpings of seafood. Those mussels were enormous and delicious! All in all, great food and a strong wine selection to accompany great company. First Tip: Make a reservation!This place is pretty small and getting very popular so a wait started forming soon after we arrived for our :pm reservation. Trust me, it'll be worth the extra step of making a reservation! I went with a party of  that all love to eat so of course we ordered a ton of items. The waiter had to stop us while we were ordering and tell us that we were ""bordering on way too much food"". My favorite dishes for the dinner portion:Setas (mushrooms) a very tangy twist on mushrooms. Must try if you like mushrooms. Pancheta (Pork Belly) So flavorful and crispy! Pimientos de Padrón (peppers) These are so classic, a must try! They are tiny little peppers that aren't too spicy but still are kicking with flavor. Patatas Bravas (potatoes) I'm not the biggest fan of potatoes because they tend to be so dry but these had a great aioli sauce which really added to the flavor. Plus they were so crispy, it really helped with the texture of the dish. Paella Probably one of the best paellas I've ever had. The seafood was so fresh and they had that delicious ""crisp"" from the rice. Second Tip: The Paella takes  minutes to make so order this as soon as you sit down. Trust me, you're going to want it. We probably ordered it  minutes earlier than all the other dishes and it still came out last. Third Tip: Order Dessert. . . . ALL of them, if possible! We ordered  desserts. The churros, the chocolate brownie, and the orange cake. They were all amazing! The orange cake with the blue cheese was very original and had so many complex layers of flavor. I was very impressed even though I really dislike blue cheese. The brownie was probably my favorite as it was crispy but still gooey in the middle. One of the best parts about this place is that they are fast. The first dish probably came out  minutes after we ordered. Also, the service is fantastic and all the waiters that served us were really friendly and helpful. I love tapas, but I usually think most tapas places are overrated or overpriced. Beso was a pleasant surprise. My date and I were able to walk in and were seated right away at the bar overlooking the kitchen area. I love the open kitchen and rustic charm of the restaurant. The ambiance was great and not too loud  perfect for cozy date nights. Our waiter recommended   tapas per person, so we ordered a few dishes to share. * Jamon Serano charcuterie platter* Chorizo con tinto* Patatas bravas* Txipirones  Seared squid* PancetaThe portions were a good size and we were full by the end of the meal. My favorites were definitely the Txipirones and panceta. The squid was grilled perfectly, with a nice char and tender, chewy bite. The panceta was AMAZING  super tender, with a lovely crispy skin and I loved the apple and vinaigrette. I'd come back just for this dish alone. Overall, great service and good food. Would definitely come back. Beso didn't disappoint.  I am a big fan of Bisou, its sister restaurant, in part because of the delicious cuisine and boisterous environment and also in part because of the gregarious host/owner.  Beso has that same energy when you walk in, he has translated that element into this inventive tapas restaurant quite well while forging a new identity in both cuisine and decor.  Dim amber light settles in against the electic but elegant array of red brick, marble, and brown wood creating a warmth and soft tone.  This is in contrast to the buzz of activity as waiters rush past you with sizzling caliente plates and fresh frias plates.  We enjoyed pretty much everything we tried:   Aged Manchego Trigal (cow's milk, hard, tangy, intense, sharp, citrus)  quite good Montado de setas (toast with wild mixed mushrooms, grated tomatoes, goat milk cheese, pinenuts)  surprisingly served cold but quite flavorful nonetheless Ensalada de zanahorias (roasted baby carrots, labne yogurt, marcona almond, cilantro, avocado, citrus vinaigrette)  a standout because of the savory carrots Chorizo con Tinto (Seared fresh chorizo, sunchoke purée, baby bell pepper, red wine reduction)  succulent sausage with perfect accompaniments Patatas Bravas (Fried Yukon potato, spicy tomato sauce, smoked paprika, confit)  a staple tapas dish and done well, reminded us of the flavors of BarcelonaReally well done, not a single complaint.  Service was exceptional and food came out seemingly instantly, without a drop in quality which is impressive considering how busy they were.  Highly recommended. Some of the tapas we had tonight were a twist on originals, nice surprise! Service was fast and friendly, the kitchen was jammin', and we were outta there in  minutes! Dimly lit, wooden tables, an open kitchen all give this place a warm, family dining room vibe. We started with the aged Manchego trigal. Que queso! Creamy, not too sharp, accompanied with grapes, bread, and lil' chunks of guava jelly. Yes, yes please. Patatas bravas: they did them justice. For a second I was transported to Barcelona. Fried potatoes mounted on a bed of salsa brava, topped off with dollops of garlic aioli. Rico. Ensalada de zanahoria: this carrot salad ba lew my mind. Cilantro, Marcona almonds, labne yogurt, avocado, roasted exotic baby carrots, and citrus vinaigrette. Gwow, mama. Gwow. Lovely Spanish restaurant near the heart of the Castro. We went on a Sunday evening and had OpenTabled a pm dinner reservation, and good thing because the place was packed! Server said it's been like that since they opened six weeks ago. From the rustic sign out front and open entryway, to the different kinds of tables and booths and wine collection that makes up one wall in the back, I felt a lot of care went into creating an exciting space, while being approachable and intimate. There was a robust enough tapas and other Spanish dish menu, though not the typically overwhelming selection of tapas that you sometimes see. We passed on the seafood paella for two, and instead opted for sharing five dishes between the two of us. The chorizo iberico was delicious if you like cured meat with a ton of flavorI have to have patatas bravas any time it's on a menu. While this was doused in red and white sauce, it was still crispy and I could have ordered another oneThe cauliflower dish was good  can't really mess up roasted cauliflower but also nothing spectacular. Pulpo a la plancha was fantastic. It's hard to cook octopus well, and it came out perfectly tender and not overdone at allCarne a la plancha was medium rare as suggested, and also quite flavorful and a great meaty end to the meal. We should have just gone for a bottle of wine, but ended up with two glasses each. They have a wine list that is % Spanish, which I don't know well, but the server was great with recommendations and letting us try the glasses. I wish I remembered what they were but both on the lighter end and quite good. All in $ per person My husband and I went to Spain this past May, and ever since our trip we've been struggling to find a Spanish restaurant that comes close to the delicious tapas we experienced while in Spain. To be fair, nothing truly comes close to some of the culinary experiences we had in Barcelona, Seville, and Madrid; however, this place is the best Spanish food we have come by in San Francisco. FOOD:My husband and I ordered the following:Pan con tomate (delicious; great tomato topping, texture of the bread was spot on   stars)Jamon Serano (ok; amongst the other dishes, this didn't stand out  .  stars)Marinated Spanish Olives (as expected, nothing special   stars)Carne a la Plancha (just ""ok""   stars)Patatas Bravas (piping hot, crisp outside, soft and creamy in the middle   stars)Pulpo a la Plancha (perfectly cooked octopus; loved the smokey flavor   stars)We were hoping to try the Panceta (pork belly dish); however, they had run out.  We'll definitely be back again to try this dish.  Sounds phenomenal. Of the above dishes, we'll re order the patatas bravas and pulpo; however, for the remaining dishes we'll try out other things on the menu. EXPERIENCE:The ambiance of this restaurant is very nice; love the exposed brick and pendant lamps.  The bar is also very nice.  Sound level was average; it was very easy to hold a conversation between the two of us.  Our service was also very good; the waitress was very attentive, and she was also very generous on our refill of wine (which by the way was amazing  I had the white blend and my husband had the Albarino; I preferred my wine, but both were stellar). This place is awesome.  It was Friday night, there was three of us, and we didn't have reservations.  They said it would take  minutes so we ordered wine and waited by the door until our table was ready.  After some confusion about our table, we finally got sat (right around   mins after we got there).  Our server was really nice and we ordered a bunch of appetizers and one large plate.  We were worried if we ordered the right amount for three people but he said they would bring out the dishes as they were ready so if we were hungry we could order more (I like that he didn't upsell us).  Here's what we ordered  WE LOVED EVERYTHING!$ Pimientos de Padrón: Fried pimientos with Maldon salt$ Montado de setas: Toast point, wild mixed mushrooms, grated tomatoes, goat milk cheese, pine nuts$ Pinchos de Pollo:Seared chicken skewers, pickled shallots, salsa verde$ Gambas al Ajillo: White shrimp, garlic, guindilla sherry vinegar, fresh lemon$: Carne a la plancha: Hanger Steak, hazelnut romanesco sauce, heirloom tomatoes, purple beans, basilWe literally ate every bite so we ordered dessert, imagining that it would be as good.  And it was.  I don't see the menu online but it was the brownie with caramel ice cream and the citrus bread.  Both were amazing. FOOD, SERVICE, AMBIENCE: Everything was SPECTACULAR.  Absolutely worth the  minute wait.  (Even better if we had made a reservation haha!)Can't wait to go back.  :) So close to four stars. There is a dearth of good tapas in SF and Beso is good and they'll get better. First, parking will suck. It's in the heart of the Castro and you can expect your parking experience to last longer than your dinner. Given all the construction that's been going on in the area for the last year it's even tougher. So, assuming you get in, the ambiance is bit suboptimal. It almost seems like a cellar. . . very little light, very few windows. Ceiling seems a tad low. And the floors. . . polished concrete with a pattern that can only be described as 'large blood vessels'. Hard surfaces and parallel walls (when will restaurants learn?) means the room is louder than it should be. OK. On to the food. This is the good part because the food was very good. We're both big lovers of patatas bravas and these were good. Crisp and a great sauce. the pan con tomate. . . good but a bit too much tomate which made them a bit runny. The lomo Iberico was very good but the portion was small and the bread needs a rethink. Too ordinary and a bit dry. The Pimientos de Padrón were perfect. The right amount of charring and the right salting. The Gambas al Ajillo were excellent. So, the food could use a touch of tuning but on the whole it was really good. Wine was fine. We opted for a couple of glasses of a recent Monastrell. The service was very good. Beso has only been open for seven weeks. I imagine in a few months this will be an easy four star place. My boyfriend and I ate here late on a Sunday. It Can be crowded and hard to get service, but only because the food really is that great. We started with a cheese plate. It was accompanied well with membrillo and fruit and the cheese was great. Perfect way to start. Advice to owner: A cheese sampling plate would be an excellent addition!We had the cumin carrot salad and it was fantastic. tangy vinegar  and yogurt combine well with the avocado and earthy smokey carrot. We also had the frisee salad with gem lettuce. Good but the carrot really took it away. For warm plates we had the garlic shrimp and cauliflower. Both excellent. The hosts are accomadating if you want more bread to soak up the juices. For dessert, we ordered something that sounded like custard filled churros, but wasn't. Be advised, the dessert that says it's churros is more like a flan or creme brulee. The couple next to us ordered a chocolate brownie with ice cream for dessert and that seems to be the way to go. Overall, we loved this place and will definitely be back for the paella, carrots, more cheese, and other dessert. If I have a food mecca, it would be Barcelona. I have never had a single bad meal there ever. So of course anytime I see a place doing tapas or really any Spanish or Catalonian inspired food I have to try it. And I try to lower my expectations. TL:RL review Good food, portions too small for the price. Opening a restuarant in the Castro is a pretty good deal. There isn't an expectation of amazing food although there is one of decor. Most places in the Castro are good, not great and that goes for Beso. Other than an overuse of Aioli in many of the dishes, the food here is mostly as good as an the average Barcelona bar except for a much higher price. $ dollars for six pieces of octopus being the worst value. The octopus was tender but could have had more char on it. The toasts were all good but so tiny. I expected  not  toast points for the price of $. Their potatoes Bravas was spot on with a good romesco sauce. Of course in Spain the portion would have been twice as large for the price of $. The food is by far more authentic and a better value that a rip off like Coqueta but still palls in comparison to the average Barcelona eatery. The service was absentee but that might be due to it being empty and early when we got there. The host said that we had a choice only of the bar and the communal table but five minutes later offered two tops to other walk in diners. We choose the bar and then got to share it with servers folding napkins and having conversations in Spanish that I guess they assumed we couldn't understand (never a good assumption in San Francisco FYI). The decor is the usual hipster restaurant style, wood everywhere, steel and concrete floor. Does not make for a quiet space.  It's wheelchair accessible, very poor light for reading or signing. Some of the two tops and the communal table are at bar height and not wheelchair accessible. Parking is horrible unless you know the side streets in the Castro. Plan at least $  per person. It's a good addition to the Castro and I'll probably be back when I am in the Castro and hungry. Tried out Beso for the first time yesterday.  Since it's relatively new, it's really busy.  We walked in shortly after pm and were seated at the bar.  Right now, it's best to RSVP if you want to dine during primetime dinner hours.  The decor and ambiance is appropriate for the neighborhood with wood and exposed brick.  The cuisine is Spanish, so there's lots of flavor with minimum spice.  We had the following: Young Mahon, Chorizo Iberico, Cojonudo, Pinchos de pollo, Chorizo con Tinto, Hanger Steak, and Panceta.  Now, that probably seems like a lot of dishes right?  Well, it's not because they serve really small portions here.  Even at  dishes, we didn't leave full.  The entree sizes are really more like appetizers, so don't show up really hungry or you'll have an astronomical bill.  With the  dishes and  glasses of wine, my bill was $ before tax and tip.  That's pricey for the amount of food consumed.  I'd recommend this place and I'll go back, but I definitely won't make the mistake of showing up hungry. We had nothing short of a fabulous time at Beso! Our very large group visited for a birthday celebration.  First of all, our server was absolutely fabulous.  He was patient with our large group arriving at different times, made sure our wine glasses were perpetually full, and ensured that our nosh was served promptly.  Since our table was so large, we relied one person to order our tapas plates. . . . we pretty much ordered the entire menu!  Every dish was presented in a lovely fashion and I didn't have anything that I didn't care for.  Highlights were:  Aged Manchego Trigal: I absolutely adored the cheese on this platePinchos de Pollo: chicken skewersPatatas Bravas:  potatoes!  Txipirones: fried calamari with chickpeas Paella: obviously I live about a block away from Beso so I've been watching construction with eager eyes. When they opened, my roommates and I wanted to drop in for dinner. I absolutely hate that any decent restaurant in SF seems to require a reservation, preferably way in advance, but we were able to get three seats at the bar really great because we got to watch dishes being made and plated. I was most impressed with the pan con tomate. Such a simple dish, but the olive oil they used with the tomato was excellent. This was definitely my favorite. I also ordered the rosemary manchego, which was lovely, and jamon serrano, which was a bit on the stiff side.  I had a Rioja red, which was nice but not the most amazing thing I've ever had to drink. My roommates had the paella I personally prefer a less seafoody paella so I only tasted the rice, which was flavorful but a little on the wet side for me. (I ate tons of and learned to make paella while living with a family in Madrid. )We shared two deserts the brownie with salted caramel ice cream (so rich and delicious) and the absolute best creme brûlée I've ever had. The ambiance was nice and the entrance in particular draws people in like a fly trap. The owner was there, and while friendly and clearly passionate, he kind of killed the magic for me he kept messing with the lights, interfering with the staff, etc. He should just let his place be the wonderful creation he's shaped without getting his hands in it during prime time. Beso completely exceeded my expectations and I will go back again soon. Food in the Castro is kind of hit or miss, so I was not sure what to expect of this new restaurant. I love Spanish Tapas, and have been looking for a favorite spot in San Francisco. . . well I've found it. My boyfriend and I were able to make a last minute reservation on Open Table. We were promptly greeted by Ivana (like Trump she said). She let us decide if we wanted to sit toward the rear of the restaurant or at the community table (because the dinner rush hadn't really started yet. . . we arrived at :). We picked the community table because it had a better view. The table sat  in total, and ended up seating four couples, which was nice. Sitting at this table did not make our experience any less romantic. Ivana quickly offered us water, and I asked her, assuming she was our server, about Sangria. She said that the restaurant is still working on a Sangria recipe, but she was able to recommend some wines for us and even let us try a few before we ultimately decided on a bottle of her favorite, the Carmenair, a smooth medium bodied red wine out of Chile. Our server, Brandon, then stopped by and introduced himself. We let him know this was our first time dining at Beso, and he told us about the special, an heirloom tomato salad, as well as some of his favorites. We ordered the heirloom tomato salad, the panceta (crispy prok belly) (recommended by Brandon), valdeon (Spanish blue cheese), idiazabal (sheep's milk cheese) cured in olive oil (recommended by Brandon), and the paella de pescado. We finished our meal with two espressos and some kind of sponge cake (recommended by Ivana). All of the food was delicious, but the panceta and paella were my favorites. The bill came out to $ for a bottle of wine, four tapas, one order of paella (which we shared a little with the couple sitting across from us because the portion was generous), two espressos and one dessert. I felt that this price was just right considering the quality of the food, ambiance, and service of this restaurant. The food was amazing and the ambiance was nice, but what made this experience really stand out was the exceptional service. Ivana and Brandon both added to our night. I wish I knew the names of some of the other staff members, because several others came to our table and made sure we were enjoying ourselves throughout the meal and were very kind. My bf and I commented that the staff was genuine and pleasant and seemed as though they were having a good time while doing a great job. My boyfriend and I love eating out all over the city, and this honestly may have been the best date dinner we've had yet. It's rare to find a restaurant where every detail is done just right, but Beso has done that. I can't wait to go back again soon! The food is just to die for.  The staff is super friendly.  The prices are reasonable.  I can't believe someone compared the price to Frances.  Our meal cost us ~/ of what it cost us at Frances.  I loved the Paella, carne a la plancha, Serrano ham, patatas bravas, pementos, marinated olives.  The wine was really good too.  We have been there twice already since they opened and we will definitely go back. I will say that I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant and the wait staff was pretty attentive to our needs. That is where the good ends. . . We had three dishes and a dessert for two people. We ordered the Montado de Atun, Panceta, Patatas Bravas, Pulpo a la plancha and a Saffron custard type of thing (like a creme brulee). The Atum was basically tuna on toast with a flavorless mayo (aoili) under. The Panceta was dry and pretty flavorless too. The Patatas Bravas could not be ordered because they were out of potatoes. How a restaurant runs out of potatoes is beyond me. . . The Pulpo (Octopus) was cooked beautifully, but sadly the plate looked sloppy and basically gross looking and oh yeah, flavorless. . . Oh this plate had potatoes on it, so not sure why the other dish was not available. The custard came out and looked burnt (blackened) but they used a blackberry sugar mixture, so if you have ever tasted burnt blackberries you will know they get very bitter. I broke the sugar crust away and the custard was again, flavorless. I put my spoon down after three bites. . . Overall I really wanted this place to be great, but like Bisou (the owners other restaurant) it falls flat and flavorless. Tapas are supposed to be packed full of flavors. Add this place to the ongoing lackluster mediocre restaurants in the Castro. . . We are truly doomed to live with medicre food there forever. . . We stumbled on Beso after realizing all of the other spots we'd planned to check out during our honeymoon were booked solid due to the Labor Day weekend. What a happy accident! Our server was incredibly kind and knowledgeable, as was the owner who came out to chat with us post meal. Highlights for us: Pickled anchovies, vegetable ragout and goat cheese toast points, paella to share, chorizo, and a knockout salad with cucumbers, grapes and a lively cumin dressing (sounds boring but I can't stop thinking about it). My only suggestion is to somehow cover up the florescent lighting that spills through the open kitchen. It makes an otherwise romantic, cozy atmosphere a bit harsh (if seated toward the back of the restaurant). We'll definitely recommend this place to all of our foodie friends as a destination when they're in the Bay. My new favortie.  The food and wine are sumptiously delicious.  The tapas are divine.  I love tapas in the fact that tapas are meant for sharing (or not).  One can taste several different dishes when going with friends instead of just one or two.  I can't wait to go back!! Great tapas; efficient, seamless, and well paced service. We had the Pan con Tomate, Jamon Serano, and the Paella with a bottle of dry Spanish white wine.  All were truly excellent. But. . . if you feel that dinner is a social experience and having a good conversation with your friends or loved ones should be part of a nice dinner out, then you will be disappointed.  The restaurant is loud.  You need to lean in to hear and you need to raise your voice to be heard.  I guess that's the trend these days, but be forewarned it can be exhausting. This place has a great buzzing energy going on with a crowd that seems eager to try everything. We gays are glad some good food has found its way to the 'stro. I loved the tuna on toast, the mushrooms, the shrimp, the cheese. . . really everything was top notch. It would be great if hey had sangria, or a less expensive wine option. Very friendly service too. My only complaint is that the interior design looks just like every single other new restaurant and bar in the city  reclaimed wood and exposed wire lightbulbs. . . z. Why does every place have to look the same now days? I heard good reviews about this place but I was not sure if it was worth it to try ""another typical spanish place"" in San Francisco, after been in so many other ones in the city and at the end I was never completely satisfied neither with the food nor the service. I must say I was surprised since the beginning, as soon as I got there, Martha, the hostess was so nice and welcoming and right after I got my table the waiters came and offered something to drink. Three very important aspects to highlight about this place: The food is delicious!!  The staff is friendly, efficient, professional and extremely nice.  The place is perfect, clean and very well located. I will definitely come back to this place and highly recommend it! .  stars. Love the airy feel of this restaurant especially before the sunset time. Super friendly staff (one is reminded of the spanish hospitality when you go there). Must have:Gambas al Ajillo (White shrimp, garlic, guindilla sherry vinegar, fresh lemon)  very simple dish but done with fresh gambas. Cooked with a bit a white wine and just the right amount of garlic. It's served on cast iron small pot, which kept it warm. Love the small details here. Setas (Roasted wild mushroom, grated manchego cheese, egg yolk, lemon zest)  amazing flavors / good texture. Can't get enough of this. Solid:Sliced green beans salad with grains (wheatberries?): nice and light. Wish that it had a bit more green beans proportionally. Very refreshing. Even though I liked this, the dish could also benefit from a bit of cilantro and a bit more lemon reduce. Dark chocolate cookie with oaxaca ice cream: quite rich. Good for sharing. The texture is between a fondant au chocolate and crusty cookie. decadentThe albarino by the glass was probably one of the best I have tasted, with just a hint of sweetness and plenty of complexity (quite rare for Albarino). My friend and I each had  glasses with our meal without even trying! Pretty decent food.  Really friendly staff.  I thought the pricing was a bit high and there was a lack of more substantial food, so I actually left hungry and spent over  for  people.  It's still nice to have a new option in the Castro though.  But for the cost, I'd honestly rather go to Frances. Beso (Kiss) is a tapas bar in the Castro featuring Spanish (Catalan Tapas). I ate there last weekend with a friend of mine and although walk ins, we were seated at the communal bar tables which was actually quite nice thankfully my side of the table was not full however. I have a mix of feelings about the place. On the one hand the décor is great and well chosen and contemporary. You can dress casually or dress up if you want to. They have a decent wine selection and some beers and although beer is my favorite, I opted for wine. My friend and I ordered several plates. Montado de Atun  very good and the cheese on the crouton brought the whole thing together  Recommended. Pan con tomate  Um bread with a sofrito kind of spread on top  Although we ate it, along with our Jamon Serano and Rosemary Manchego combo plate which was really yummy and look forward to trying others, the Pan con tomate was really boring. Really, really boring  PASD. For my entrée, I had the Gambas al Ajillo. Shrimp in garlic and oil. While I ate this too and I did like it in an odd way, the shrimp was WAY overcooked. I should have sent it back seeing as how my friend's entrée never arrive. I was eating and  minutes later she's like. Um, where's my food? We got the waiter. . . . key word being WE got via the runner/busser. Because in general he was nowhere to be found, did not offer drinks, did not apologize for my friend's meal being forgotten and essentially after we ordered our food he never returned. The only person to come back was the busser/food runner who was far more help than our waiter. When he told our waiter, about  minutes later the waiter comes over and says, ""I was told something about your food being missing?"" Yes, you have that right he didn't even know it was missing BECAUSE he never checked back. When he did bring her food, he didn't offer an apology nor more wine. He got far more than he deserved in his tip and far less than I would give for good customer service. The prices are about  $ more than they should be for entrees. My friend liked her baby squid entrée but she didn't say she loved it. Would I go back? Eh, I can't see myself ever dying to come back here. Would I put up a fight if a friend said they are dying to go there? No but hopefully that visit would be far better than this one and their customer service has improved and their overcooking resolved. Hey Now, Another first Review!They did a beautiful job on the dinning room.  Once you are seated, you soon forget this was once a car garage.  Lot's of custom metal work which makes the room cozy and warm.  My dinning companion and I ordered about  small plates.  Some were hits, some were misses (too salty), service was what you would expect from a new staff, learning their craft.  I look forward to returning in about six weeks to see what changes they have made.  It is very exciting to see real, quality, food available in the Castro.  Thank you Beso for investing in the neighborhood. We went to this brand new location to try out what they might bring to the Castro neighborhood.  The space looks pretty good but since they have concrete floors, walls and the ceilings are wood it is extremely noisey.  We ordered a bottle of champagne and got served the same brand but a non sparkling variety.  They quickly corrected this for us.   We ordered the Olives which were good but basically two tablespoons of tiny olives for $.  We also had a cheese plate with had  triangles of wafer thin slices, four grapes and three slices of baguette. We also ordered a beet salad that was mostly flavorless. Then came the $ prawn plate,  shrimp (not prawns) sauteed in olive oil with a couple shavings of garlic.  Finally came the seafood Paella $ and said enough for .  I will say it's flavor was good.  But the portion was what you would expect for a single persons entree.  End result spent $ for four people and we went out to eat at another establishment right after as everyone was still hungry.  I know their rent must be high but don't waste your money on this place, even in the Castro there are far better choices. This review is based upon the opening day of the restaurant. Huge fan of Nick Ronan and Bisou.  Ever since LIME closed and Bisou became the next hottest thing, naturally with the new opening of its sister restaurant it was quite intriguing.  I usually do not go to new openings of restaurant because my mother always gave me advice to visit restaurants after a year so the pots can be broken in and the chefs hands can be familiarized with how to cook the food.  I took a close friend of mine who has lived here for + years to the opening.  We went around :p with OT reservations and it was packed (obviously).  Good thing we reserved (some advice). Greeted upon arrival within  seconds by our server (bonus points). No other alcoholic beverages except for wine and beer (a little upsetting).  Not even a lick of sangria. . . . which definitely did not settle well with my friend. Ordered: App: Rosemary Manchego ($) recommended by our server. Meat: Carne a la plancha ($) . . . MR . . and it came out made to orderSeafood: Gambas al Ajillo ($) . . . great tasting, but could have done without. Everything was tapas as stated and I love that about Beso. Had an amazing time, although hard to have conversation and mood lighting when you're sitting right where the open faced kitchen's harsh lighting is.  The ambiance was loud because there is no sound barrier in the restaurant.  Points of feedback:. Staff was eating at the table next to us.  I was a server and we were never allowed to either take breaks or eat on the dining room floor.  It was a little tacky.  . No Management came to see how the food was prepared or how it was tasting.  Usually for a new restaurant opening, you would think any leadership would be on high alert. . The expeditors or other servers who came to place ordered plates down, were in such a hurry, they literally almost threw the plates down and ran off.  Again, it was busy, but all but another   seconds could have been spared. . Omar, our buser, was amazing!  Was on the refill of water like no other!. Not sure if the server had time, but no history of the restaurant was given or highlights for the evening (dishes, alcohol, dessert).  Had to ask for recommendations. Overall the experience was pleasant, but not sure if I would rush out immediately just yet. . . PS: there was no indication of where BESO was (sign of the restaurant).  So it's a little harder to find. . . directly right across the street from Midnight Sun and next to Brandy Ho's. DIned on the second night the restaurant was open  with a few opening restaurant pains  we enjoyed overall our meal of small plates that included fresh sourced ingredients along with some classic spanish charcuterie. Everything about the food was near perfect  our only negative was our order was taken out of order with several other tables and after we ordered, several items were no longer available.  Would recommend the anchovy toast, the hangar steak, and the mushrooms. The shrimp (gambas) were delicious but I'm going to stick to my favorite place in Madrid for those. We will return without hesitation to try several of the items that they had run out of and update the review. Three things I can count on when going to the Castro:() Hot gays() Massive schlongs. . . (more info on that later)() Non pretentious, friendly restaurants and barsGrand opening today, Beso, a Spanish tapas restaurant comes from the Bisou (French bistro) folks. As soon as we arrived yesterday, we were graciously welcomed by the staff and was told to pick any table we wanted to sit at. The Spanish Tapas menu is categorized into small bites ($ $), charcuterie ($ $), cheeses ($ $), toasts ($ $), salads ($ $), meats ($ $), veggies ($ $), and seafood ($ $). There's also one paella ($) on the menu for sharing. Portions are small and three dishes are recommend per a person. Each dish is ok to share with just one other person; you will need multiple orders for a group of  or more to share. There's a good list of wines, beers, and non alcoholic drinks but there's no full bar. OUR ORDER:*Charcuterie: Lomo Iberico & Chorizo Iberico ($, $): bit. ly/rvuLZD*Mentado de Secas: toast points w/ wild mushrooms, manchego & pine nuts ($): bit. ly/oRlaq*Txipirones: Grilled Monterey squid, fried baby radish & citrus aioli ($): bit. ly/mMPNL*Gambas al Ajillo: Shrimp, garlic, sherry vinegar & lemon ($): bit. ly/oxamG*Panceta: Grilled pork belly w/ olive oil mash, sliced apple & smoked pimienton vinaigrette ($): bit. ly/kDSEQc*Patatas Bravas: fried potatoes w/ spicy tomato sauce & garlic confit aioli ($): bit. ly/puhqTOur favorites were the Txipirones and Panceta. The Txipirones (squid) was perfectly grilled, creating a smoky and tender squid. The pork belly was uber tender with a delicately crispy skin. The apple and vinaigrette nicely cut through the porky richness. I just wish there was more than one bite for the each of us. The Patatas Bravas was a good filler. I really liked the creamy garlic confit aioli but could of done without the tomato sauce which was pretty sour. Another good filler was the Mentaso de secas. I really liked the combo of the earthy mushrooms, salty manchego, and buttery crunch of the pine nuts. Our least favorites were the charcuterie meats which we found both mediocre for the price. Skip the Gambas al Ajillo. The shriveled shrimp was very much overcooked and the sauce was overly acidic having both sherry vinegar and lemon. All in all, the food was pretty solid for their soft opening but for the portion sizes, I think the prices could be a $ $ lower; especially for the meat and seafood dishes. Service was great. The staff was super enthusiastic and attentive. No food service timing issues as we had a very early dinner. Beso is great for a date as the ambiance is contemporary rustic with the red brick walls, rich wood furnishings and the dim lighting. We sat at one of the round tables in the front to do some hot gay watching. There's also a communal table, two tops in the back, and counter seats at the charcuterie bar or in front of their open kitchen. Difficult street parking after  pm on weeknights and all day on the weekends. Mr. NSS: ""How come you never look at me like that?"" (Yes, he asked that again when I was hot gay watching. )Me: ""Wave a massive schlong in my face and you'll have my undivided attention. ""*Takes my hand and leads me to: yelp. com/biz/hot cookie …See, straight guys know what's up!"
Pabu|4.0|Japanese in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|188|-1|3.7625|" Get the miso black cod. Chuwanmushi is good too but I wish it had more ikura. Good sake selection. Juicy chicken heart & thigh skewers. Aji was not as good as I hoped but it was ok. good food and service We ordered the chef's tasting menu and it was terrific. They were able to swap out a few allergy issues and didn't hesitate to make a few accommodations to make sure we loved every bite.  The seemingly never ending sushi was the perfect size to give you a real taste of each fish. The only issues we had were early on, the pace of the dishes felt rushed but they adjusted/improved quickly.  Also the one scallop sushi was so salty it was borderline inedible.  Regardless a definite  star because of our server, Coleman. He was so passionate about serving us/ensuring we had a great time. He had a nice balance of engaging but not too much as to disrupt our personal dining experience.  It makes a huge difference to have a server that you know genuinely loves his job.  I've eaten at Pabu a handful of times at the bar. So being served at a table  esp by Coleman  really made it a new/better experience.  My ""must eat"" suggestions (they will add it to the tasting menu if you ask!) is the grilled squid (under small hot plates) it is cooked to perfection and the oyster ""happy spoon""  incredible. So good! Enjoy! Brought the bf here for his birthday dinner since he's a huge sushi lover. Service was great; they gave him a birthday card signed by the staff and an additional dessert at the end. The omakase is pretty worth it here if you like nigiri. Unfortunately, I'm not a huge fan so my bf basically got to eat two pieces of everything. $ for appetizers,  pieces of nigiri, a small pot of shabu shabu and dessert. By the rd course of nigiri, I was ready to explode from eating too much. Make plans accordingly if you do decide to do omakase because the meal will take at least  hours. I was excited to try this new Japanese restaurant out, but was left disappointed. I've eaten better sushi and izakaya for much cheaper all around the city. I think this is a great spot for happy hour after work, or if you're able to expense a business dinner, but I'll be sticking to cheaper, hole in the wall Japanese places from now. The decor inside was beautiful, with high ceiling and dark wood, and the service was also wonderful  very attentive servers, and my water seemed like it was refilled after every sip I took.  I almost felt bad drinking out of my glass since they were coming over every  minutes to refill. The dishes were good, but nothing super impressive to me. Everything seemed priced double what it should have been at a normal restaurant, which just seems excessive to me. I understand paying for ambiance and service, but $ for a shrimp tempura roll (or almost any other roll) is like highway robbery. I ordered a few small dishes so I could try a few things;Happy Spoon Oyster ($): $ for a small spoon of uni, caviar and some other unidentifiable things is a rip off. I could buy a bowl of ramen somewhere else for a little more than $ and it would be my entire dinner. Ahi Tuna Poke ($): I thought this was one of the more ""normal"" priced things on the menu compared to other restaurants. It was good, but nothing memorable. Chicken Thighs ($): This was good, and the meat was flavored well and tender. I still prefer Ippuku in Berkeley for izakaya / robata, but this was pretty good. Pork Belly ($): The meat was really tough and not really fatty. I would definitely not recommend this, I was disappointed in the quality of this meat. My friend got the the shrimp tempura roll ($) which was just meh  I could get a shrimp tempura roll almost anywhere else in the city that would be just as good, if not better. The miso cod ($) was good, but again, nothing to write home about; I prefer the cod at The House or at Nobu. The $ just got you the one piece of fish, no sides or anything else. All in all, I wouldn't come back here again or recommend it to my friends, unless I was able to expense my meal or had a lot of money to throw around. I think there are better restaurants and better, smaller, sushi & izakaya places in SF. Maybe I ordered incorrectly or should have done the tasting menu, but unless someone else is footing the bill, I will say ""Next"". m, came here for lunch with my mentee from work, so needless to say, we were prety liberal with our ordering. shared a carafe of house sake on tap, and they brought around a selectton of sake glasses for us to choose from, which was interesting and a unique touch. we ordered two rolls from the lunch menu, the nigiri and scallop roll combo, and three things of nigiri  tamago, eel and uni. they brought out the nigiri first?! it was ) surprising cuz i wanted the tamgao as dessert and ) who ever brings out the nigiri first. . ?!anyho, the fish was obviously quite fresh tasting, and the rice was all right, but lunch for  was $, whereas it would've been around $ for akiko's for VERY similar quality and perhaps better knowledge of how to serve japanese food. so iono, i will probably be back to try some of their dinner selections, but honestly. . . way overpriced, and im not sure justifably so. . . meep! Happy Hour starts at PM here  woohoo!  During a recent free afternoon, I met a friend here to catch up.  We had glasses of HH red wine and a few things from the HH menu: hamachi hand roll (cool, tasty, m!), steamed pork bun (I liked this a lot, the pork was super tasty), and chicken thigh skewer (tender, sauce was a great).  The food was soo good and I can't wait to come back here again!!  The only minus was our initial waitress sort of disappeared and didn't come back to check on us after we ordered our drinks first.  Maybe she saw us chatting away and didn't want to interrupt us, but I was hungry and wondered where she went.  We had to flag down a different waitress instead.  But I will be back! I can't give this place more than  stars due to how overpriced this meal was in relationship to it's portion size. Started with the Happy Spoons, which were oysters served with roe and other garnishes. These had great flavor and set the meal up for success. Next we had the octopus pancake, grilled octopus and pork belly. These dishes unfortunately were not up to expectations. Sizes were small and forgettable, nothing really stood out to me. I have had my fair share of Japanese food and this just wasn't hitting the spot for me. From there we had pork belly skewers. What a major disappointment. I would recommend not having these. The skewers lacked flavor, and I felt like I was eating street food in Asia, a huge miss. Our game plan was to share a bunch of small plates, and then dessert. The dessert interestingly, all came in a mouse form. That being said, dessert was probably the best thing about this dinner, aside from the free champaign that was given to us in celebration of a recent promotion. Overall, I left unsatisfied and still hungry. I don't think I will be coming back here again. tho a little pricey and loud (trendy) we enjoyed our meal there. . . . Ken's roll, special robatayaki (wagyu and scallops), seaweed salad, and edamame as well. . . . This review is for lunch only.  I have to say this is one of the most mediocre lunches I have had for such a pricey establishment.  I'm not saying I didn't enjoy my meal, I did.  I just expect excellence when I'm paying for excellence.  The service was just so so, and the food was nothing notable.  I wish I had something that was just WOW to my taste buds but memorable, it was not.  Unfortunately, I would not recommend because the price alone was not worth it in my opinion.  I've had much better for a one third the price.  But If you like overpaying for mediocre service and food that is not so ""top quality"" then this may be your place.  But remember, nothing here was bad just not any where near the excellence I thought I would be experiencing.  Oh well, NEXT! My one line review: a pricey Japanese restaurant. . . . worth every cent!Now for the details: It was a birthday treat, so expectations were high. We weren't disappointed. My partner had the sushi tasting menu, of which he enjoyed every single morsel. It's a steep price, true, but he said (and from what I tasted, I agree) that the sushi was so unique, the fish so divine, that he would absolutely pay it again.    There were fish that he'd never had before and never even seen offered anywhere else. I had a more ""conventional"" menu of appetizer, fish entree and dessert. Appetizer and entry were superb. Dessert, well, it might have been the weak link in the entire evening. Way overpriced. The oysters were not fresh. Tasted a bit too fishy. The unagi to me also did not taste that fresh. We also had the tounge, pork belly skewers and several sushi rolls. They were average at best. The service was very  good. I will not be returning. OverpricedRaw oysters had a fishy tasteBeef tongue was toughSushi was nothing special The edamame and sake was goodI will not be returning . Wowza, Pabu is amazing!! I went here for my birthday and im in love. We started with few things from the cold plates and warm plates and then moved to the larger plates. Everything we ordered was great. /The only thing I wasnt a fan of is the desserts there. Im a huge fan of dessert. Somtimes I wont go back if the dessert isnt great!! We ordered two different ones and I would give dessert a /. Hope you guys can work on this part. Service was /. The food was /. Dessert /. Regardless, ill be going back very soon. I got the opportunity to try out their happy hour food and drinks for a work event. The place isn't cheap as it's in the Financial District and of course a Michael Mina restaurant. With all that said, the happy hour foods were pretty good. The selection is small, so we tried everything out from the hand rolls, to oysters, to skewers, etc. The drinks were decent and very pretty. . . decorated with little flowers and such. I know it's all for show, but it was still nice. What a disappointment. Heard this was a great place for sushi and jumped on the opportunity to try it with a friend. We sat at the sushi bar and ordered a selection of dishes and some omakase creations. My friend ordered different cuts of toro and found two fish bones in separate orders. The chef didn't believe him the second time around and reached into my friend's plate to grab the partially chewed tuna bone. Then he apologized and that was that. The fish was mediocre and, given the price and poor service, definitely not a place I would recommend. For quality food and service, try Kusakabe. Delicious is delicious, no doubt about that and Pabu definitely delivers on queue for deliciousness.  But OUCH!  Does it have to cost so much?!  Eating here will set you back a few good meals, even the happy hour menu!  I came here for happy hour and at pm on a Friday night, it was bumpin' with FiDi patrons thirsting for some booze and small bites. There were barely any room to squeeze my tiny butt across the bar, so, me and my BFF ended up sitting outside under the stars with crisp SF air breezing through our hairs.  And yes, I caught a cold from this!Our $ ""Happy Hour"" bill bought us a good time and an opportunity to say I ate at a Michael Mina restaurant.  But truthfully, opening up a Japanese restaurant under his name is overrated!  Why?  Because these exact same items tastes just as good as other quality Japanese restaurant I've dined at.  There was nothing unique in flavors that made me want to turn back and say I want to eat THAT again.  In fact, I was straight up pissed that I paid % more than for the same quality, taste, and service.  Yea, I was upset.  STARS!  Japanese Chuhai  this is a bartenders choice of drinks.  It was whiskey with lemon juice and something else that made this taste GREAT!!  Chicken karaage   small pieces that came out piping hot served with a wedge of lemon and a delicious spicy aoili sauce!  Salmon handroll  perfectly cooked rice rolled in a seaweed with freshly chopped up salmon!  Spicy tuna handroll  perfectly cooked rice rolled in a seaweed stuffed with spicy tuna!  Chicken oysters robata skewer   tiny pieces of perfectly charred chicken glazed with teriyaki sauce!  Chicken shouulder robata skewer   tiny pieces of perfectly charred chicken glazed with teriyaki sauce!   tiny oysters drizzled with ponzu sauce and lemon wedges.  It was a mouth full of ocean and super freshAs you can see, my bill did NOT include delicious sashimi.  When I hit a Japanese restaurant, fresh sashimi is always eaten.  And you betcha that the bill would had doubled if sashimi were to be included!  Did it, done it, not going back. . . Good service, good ingredients, and a solid pick for a business lunch. Everything here is well done here, but that is perhaps the biggest complaint.  Everything is safe and takes no chances, so you get some pretty good food but with nothing that wows you.  Yeah, it is a Michael Minna establishment without any true imagination.  I guess I just expected more adventurous dishes with the name tag.  There are already way too many Californian Japanese restaurants in the City, and I have not yet tasted anything here that distinguishes it from the others. Come here to get business done, as it is in the heart of the Financial District.  But if you are expecting to wow a date, you are more likely to wow them with the price tag as opposed to the food. Everything was amazing. I love when restaurants have little private rooms that perfectly fit groups of about . It's so much nicer than when you are put at a table for  in the middle of a dining room because it makes it much easier to hear conversations happening all around and you can talk to  or  people rather than just the ones to either side of you. Pabu has this. Pabu also has some really delicious food including, but not limited to the following, Bloomsdale Spinach, a Seaweed Salad, edamame, Maitake Mushroom Tempura, Chicken Meatballs, and pork belly skewers. I speak from experience here. I have also heard that ALL THE SUSHI is delicious as well, but I refrained from eating it during my visit as I was early on in a pregnancy and still in the paranoid mode that eating things could make me feel really queasy. And make sure you save room for dessert because our group tried four (Soy Caramel Custard, Sake Roll Cake, PABU Chocolate and a Cherry Sorbet) and not one was bad. Great food, great service, and a lovely atmosphere  it's easy to see why Pabu is a new favorite of so many of my Bay area friends! Came here for my boyfriend and I's anniversary dinner on a wednesday night. Place was busy, I hardly saw any open seating so make sure you make reservations in advance. Our reservation was at :pm and we were seated around  mins before and we got to sit at the sushi bar which we requested right when we walked in. Our waitress was really nice explained every menu to us (about  menus lol) and we already knew we wanted the tasting menu & a appetizer. We ordered:Grilled Squid  comes with lemon and spicy mayo. . . I could've ordered  more of theseTasting menu  CRAZY GOOD. MUST TRY! Comes with  piecesTamago  Best tamago I've ever had plus they give you a sweeter piece of the tamago which tastes like sponge cake. YUMMIkura & Quail egg  Perfection! Must try. Cocktail I ordered the smoke cocktail. SUPER SMOKEY, i would have gone with something more sweeter but I wanted to try this cocktail ALTHOUGH i wouldn't order this again lol. Great food and great service. Minus  star for the dirty and low maintenance in the Women's bathroom. Paper towels every where, the stalls were dirty, and no more toilet covers.  I know its the end of the day but please keep the bathrooms nice and tidy since this is a Michael Mina restaurant. Came here with a few lady friends for happy hour. It's a swank, modern Japanese sushi place. One half of the building is the bar, the other is the restaurant. Since we did not come for dinner, I can't very well speak on it. I will say it was busy, busy, busy so the food must have been good. Though I arrived during happy hour and placed my order during the respective time, my wine was not part of the happy hour menu! Apparently there are only two red wines, my Pinot was not one of them. After receiving a $.  happy hour bill, I was a little shocked. The wine Pinot was excellent, so the sting faded rather quickly. Service is prompt, although they are not bending over backwards with . I think they are just very busy at that time but no mistakes were made. If I were in the area I would pop in again, but I wouldn't venture there just because. . .   bookmarked . . A farewell lunch to a team member is a cause for celebration. We started with some Happy Spoons and the okonomiyaki. Both excellent dishes that I highly recommend. No trip of mine to a sushi place is complete without some uni. Pabu did not disappoint. I wish my wallet was deeper so I can have more!My go to dish is usually the chirashi  it gets me most fish that I want to try in a beautiful presentation. Michael Mina, you've done it again. yelp. com/biz_photos/pabu…Total damage for two: $ A small spicy salmon roll for $? Overpriced for sure. Looking at what everyone else ordered and you can immediately see that the portions here are definitely lacking. Half of our group left to get more food afterwards. The service is subpar; the bartender never cracked a smile and we had to pass down the sushi menu because there was only one. All of our food came out at different times. Paying was uincredibly slow, as in it didn't happen until I finally waved down the person to take my money. With that said, if you come here without a budget or a big appetite, you will probably be pleased with the quality of food. The location is also prime and the interior is nice. This place tries to sell liquor more so than sushi/sashimi.  We were not interested in drink on a Sunday evening.  The portions are very small and over priced.  Staff is not attentive, messed up our order, and insisted to the table next to us that they ordered the food where in fact it was our order.  We were seated at a table for two near the sushi bar and random waitstaff would step on our feet, bump into us, yet none of them apologized. Manager seemed to be more interested if we lived in SF (which we do) and insisted that we provide her detailed feedback; well here it is.  Overall, poor service, small portions, expensive elaborate liquor lists, and high prices.  Where is the focus on the fish and service? Not here. I was very excited about Pabu as an addition to Michael Mina Group.  We have been to Pabu a serveral times and really enjoy the experiences. I love the chic mordern atmosphere and how open the restaurant is.  If you want a quieter space ask to sit out in the solarium. I really live the cocktails and their extensive sake selections. The sashimi are very very fresh and all of the food that we ordered are just deliciously prepared with great balance with flavor, texture and taste. Service can be a bit slow, sometime it would take a while to flag down our server. But overall staff are friendly. My fave are the sashimi for sure ( pricey but very fresh), the miso cod was melting in your mouth.  The pork belly, but who doesn't like pork belly right! The okonomiyaki with the sunny side up on top, I can eat that everyday! So far all of my visit has been a pleasant one.  Can't wait to go back for more some more of that delicious food and drink I was very excited to have paid PabuSF a visit while I was in the area.  I was a regular at the Pabu in Baltimore before they relocated and excited to see some familiar faces as some of the servers moved with the restaurant. The improvements from Baltimore were much needed as I felt both the menu and restaurant culture were better fit for SF than Baltimore.  All I can say is a job well done.  Although the price is still expensive, I feel that the service, quality and the personal experience can justify it. tips: take advantage of their happy hours! The food is four stars, but service and price knock one off.  Came here for lunch, ordered a few small plates and an entree per person.  They forgot my entree and didn't check in for fifteen minutes to see if I had received it.  To their credit, there was no charge. Sushi is solid, but extremely small portions at an extremely high price.  Best value is in the small plates which are more reasonably priced and excellently prepared. I'll be back, but only on the expense account. Just wanted to say I went back again and it was still AMAZING, the grilled octopus was BOMB, and the drinks are on par (if not better) than those at Rickhouse/Bourbon & Branch/Local Edition. I've been to PABU twice  once for normal food and again to try the tasting menu (never had a sushi tasting menu before!). I probably won't be going back again because while the food is delicious, the service is a little slow for sushi, and the sushi is expensive. Atmosphere is pretty cool  they have lots of comfy booths, high ceilings, sushi chefs for viewing, and a bar. Sushi is fresh and delicious. I recommend the happy spoon  it's a happy combination of yummy things like oyster and uni. Also recommend Michaels Negitoro  has fatty tuna, uni, and roe for extreme yumminess. For non sushi, I haven't tried very much, but PABU does really great things with burdock. Overall, I've had two fresh, delicious sushi experiences here, so I recommend trying it! The tasting menu is a fun way to sample all the different fishes they have! We ordered  signature drinks off the menu. We got one that looked like toilet water. It was brown and putrid and tasted like a cross between leather and medicated vaseline. The other drink was served in a ton of crushed ice. It looked like a glass of milk and had the alcohol content of a wine cooler. It tasted like weak rosewater. The third drink was yellow and was served with an ice cube with flowers frozen in it. It tasted like bandaids with antiseptic. What a horrible experience for $ a drink. ! First I have to confess that I have the tastes of a peasant when it comes to food. Generally I am happiest in the divest of dive bars. Hence my experince with sushi is limited. Here is my take given my limited experience:. The atmosphere is fun and lively with comfortable seating the good accoustics. A. Service started out a little spotty but pick up quickly.  A. These folks have an excellent selection of beers, wines and liquors. I had an excellent Japanese scotch. A+. Food: Here is my weak point. The sushi was fresh and delicious although I would have left starving if I only had sushi. Their hot chicken dish with spicy mayo was terrific as an addition. . Holy smokes is this stuff expensive. When I got the bill I decided to put it on my personal card. Accounting would have fainted if I submitted the cost of the meal. Good stuff but not that good and I am not very price sensitive. BOverall nice experience. Here's my take in Pabu  I give them .  stars  I want to be fair to them so I'll just say I've just had their lunch menu versus the dinner Omakeze. Came here for lunch on a Wed, res is recommended as it gets very crowded. My friend and I tasted about  dishes and I was highly impressed by one  the happy spoon oyster. The miso soup was definitely not instant, great big chucks of tofu and lots of fresh green onions (love that)! But it was a tiny bit fishy for some reason and I thought it could be what they use for broth base or the seaweed. Plastic piece came out of my miso soup, manager did come over apologize, it was fine. The spinach was some parts too sweet and some part too salty and over marinated I think it could be perfected but not the one we had. Happy spoon oysters, great blend of uni, oyster, ikura and some yogurt mix didn't mind the texture, tasted warm and fresh. The Kanpachi was great. Yuzu didn't overwhelm fish and the fish was amazingly fresh and well done, not to mention the beautiful presentation. The miso cod, nigiri plate, okonomiyaki, spicy ahi tuna they were okay, not too exciting. Visuals are beautiful but I wasn't impressed. *I was mostly disappointed with nigiri  especially for the Saba  too much ginger on top and any good Saba should not be this fishy. I think (until I try their dinner Omakaze). . This will be a good happy hour place for me in downtown with good warm/cold dishes but not for nigiri or sashimi. Not fully convinced yet! Cool decor, hipster type of place after work but I went for lunch.  I doubt I would go for drinks even though their cocktail menu did look inventive.  I'm glad I was treated because the prices are very high.   Our host ordered two of the rolls and after that a ""Happy Spoon"" for each of us.  The sushi was amazing but small for the price.  The Happy Spoon was not for me but I ate it. . . done and never again.  There were three of us and we ordered the tonkatsu, salmon and beef short ribs as our entrees.  They were lacking at best. The tonkatsu was dry, the short ribs looked like hawaiian bbq but a lot smaller, the salmon did look good.  The service was good but extremely slow.  I would only go back if I was being treated. Too pricey for what you get.  Oh, almost forgot, cute bartenders! After checking out Ramen Bar also by Michael Mina, and next door to Pabu, I was a little unsure about keeping my Pabu reservation for my mom's bday. But I gave Pabu the benefit of the doubt and we ended up going. I was pleasantly surprised at how well executed it turned out to be. We ordered the tasting menu which is ~$/pop. (They raised it a little from $ to $ recently. )I looked around and wanted to give Pabu a try because they offer  pieces of nigiri compared to many other tasting menus around SF which often offer ~ or so. Pabu's tasting menu is an eight course menu. It starts off with their trademark Happy Spoon which offers a great explosion of different flavors, albeit the uni portion is a bit small. Following that is a small salad appetizer with two pieces of kampachi. Starting from there is a series of four nigiri dishes each with four pieces. It goes through four different themes. My favorite was the shellfish theme. The baby shrimp sashimi was new to me and one of my favorite. To end the tasting menu you're treated to a mini shabu shabu which is nice after a series of cold dishes. It also comes with some carbs, handmade udon, for those of you who are not full from the nigiri dishes. The dessert was also quite a surprise: sparkling sake with ice cream and asian pear. The combination was new to me and very good. Nice place. Cool vibe. Great service. Neat decor. Expensive food. Overall some good dishes. Some meh dishes. But at this price I would hope there aren't so many meh dishes. At this price the fish should be so fresh it walks out to the table on water. Kanpyo maki  well made simple maki sushi. A Japanese wagyu beef nigiri  a little tough at first but the slightly seared meat melts in your mouth. $ for  buttery pieces of high quality cow. I'd do it again and again!Burdock  lacks flavor. And it's a huge bowl of root. I would skip it. American shabu  little bowl, not very hot (meat takes forever to cook) and broth gets full of meat junk since it sits there forever. Meat rolled in little rolls  kinda cool but inconsistent if it was one or two pieces. Noodles w it congeal into a big starchy ball. Kind of gross how the noodles ended up. Grilled squid  tasty and that Japanese spicy mayo wow!Assorted nigiri  spot prawn, uni, hamachi, scallop. All fresh but none were out of this world. Hamachi was cut pretty small. Happy spoon was ok. The creme fraiche made it creamy and sweet. Interesting concept. And yikes they charged $ for a bowl of plain white rice. Sit at the sushi bar so you can watch and talk with the sushi chefs. Reservations on opentable. Valet parking on California St. For $ Came here with high expectations, and am sad to say i was a little disappointed. Not that the food wasn't good, but there just wasnt a dish that completely wow ed me. Appetizers:Happy Spoon oysters  This was a good, but the oysters were unfortunately not fresh enough. Would have been much better if the oysters were fresh to bring out the sweetness. Homemade Tofu  This was Okay. The tofu was a little tasteless and they tried to make the sauce more salty so it blended well. Unfortunately, not the best homemade tofu I've tried. Definitely check out kappo nami nami in Mountain View for the best home made tofu I've had so far. They were out of ankimo, which is very disappointing since it is one of my favorites. The okonomiyaki was delightful, it was served with a sunny side egg on top. One of the better okonomiyakis for sure. Definitely order this. We had the skewers tasting platter. Unfortunately, the food was barely warm when it was served, which is rather disappointing. We initially ordered  plate, which was good, so we ordered another one and the second one was cold. The platter is served with a raw egg and some chilli powder which is a great sauce for the skewers. I liked the beef tongue best out of all those we tried. The chicken meatball was cold inside while the steak was overly done and it was tough. We had two orders of the american wagyu beef shabu shabu and it was completely disappointing. The beef was cut in different sizes and rolled up together, sometimes  slice in a roll, sometimes  slices in a roll. Japanese food is supposed to be about the art of precision and execution. This was a complete lack of attention to detail. They gave a small pot and the fire was not strong enough to boil the soup, so the soup jsut stayed warm the whole time, which meant that the beef took forever to cook. I'd say give this a miss. Most disappointing dish of the night!Miso black cod  This was extremely well cooked, definitely worth ordering and giving it a try. It was soft, juicy and tender inside. I didn't quite like the spinach bottom but my friends liked it. Spot prawn sushi  This was yummy. But really, definitely not the freshest of spot prawns. The waiter forgot/ messed up our orders a couple of times. Forgot about my wine order, forgot about the tea refill. Messed up our order by serving only  pot of shabu even though we ordered  portions. I also found it weird that they served the sushi last (after the shabu) instead of before. Wait between the appetizers and the rest (black cod, shabu, skewer platter) was about min. We ate from  to , which was ridiculous since it really wasnt a tasting menu/ fine dining where you expect to be eating for more than  hours. Probably wouldnt return again. Came here once for an impromptu dinner, and was pleasantly surprised by the food here.  The pork belly was awesome, and I also had a  piece nigiri (chef's choice) as well as the Ken's and negitoro rolls.  Absolutely no complaints here, and I would gladly return to try the omakase another time. Not a hater, not a lover. And for the price, I should be either one or the other. We were given a table at : after making our reservation that afternoon. . . which was rare for a restaurant with a reputation, but once the meal started, Pabu's front door continued to let in a draft which made our entire meal cold and unpleasant (and if you know how much ambient temperature changes your food experience you're with me on this one). Calamari appetizer was unbelievable. Insane. Better than the entrees. Sashimi was tasty but overpriced and warm. . . not ""holy crap you have to try this"" good. Dropped $ on two of us including drinks and didn't think it was worth it. We came here with a group of five celebrating two birthdays and as a team lunch. Opentable reservations were easy to reserve a table the day before. As we arrived, we were quickly seated and the decor was beautiful! We ordered a couple of small and large plates to share. We started with the ahi tuna poke, dungeness crab cake and monterey squid okonomiyaki. The dungeness crab cake was the best and freshest crab cake I've ever had with spectacular presentation. The okonomiyaki was scrumptious and down right delicious. For the large plates, we ordered two sushi rolls (rainbow roll and Ken's roll). Ken's roll was simply divine with the spicy tuna on top that just melted inside your mouth. It is definitely a must order! The last large plate we ordered was the miso black cod. It was nothing special but it was tasty. Since there were two birthdays, the restaurant hand written a card for the birthday ladies which I thought was nice. They also surprised them with two chocolate whoopie pies with a scoop of ice cream. I'd come back for omakase and cocktails next time. I'm guessing I'm an outlier on such a named restaurant. The location is ideal and the service was everything you would expect of such a high end place. I wasn't blown away by the food, given the prices. Trendy. Interesting menu, wide variety, some unusual Japanese food items. Service was ok. Noise level very high as combination restaurant, sushi bar, and regular full bar. Full bar area was party area including music and loud conversations, so difficult to hear people at your own table in restaurant area. Food overpriced. Valet park or walk there. Great food, wonderful service, class act. Had the tasting menu, mostly sushi. After two rounds I remembered that sometimes I have an allergic reaction to raw fish. Did not want to take a chance on two more rounds, so i ordered the chicken meatballs (excellent) and mushroom tempura also perfectly done. We were not charged for those two extra courses. It's a hopping place with lots of energy and great food and service to match. Highly recommended. A vast and open dining area looked a little quiet since most tables were empty when we went in for lunch.  Perfect place for a business lunch, perhaps, judging from the professional service and pleasant ambiance.  It's a restaurant in FiDi after all, so I wasn't expecting it to burst with personalities. It's like hiring someone to decorate your house.  It looks impeccable, but at the same time, it's hard to find any distinct personality to it. Food: chirashi bowl is simple and to the point.  Rice was superb.  But the fish was only okay.  It reminds me of a date lunch I had with my husband at Saru not too long ago, where we sat in a fairly cramped little place, enjoying a really nice chirashi bowl.  The fish there was better. Pabu, is perhaps better suited for a Happy Hour drink with friends or coworkers. I, maybe should have tried some cooked dishes. I am not sure how they received  stars.  I was very disappointed with the food and service!  All our meals came staggered so we had to wait for the other dishes before we could all eat.  The food is overpriced and quality was okay.  I have had way better sushi and did not have to pay $ for a roll.  I feel that Michael Minna is forgetting about why people come back; good food and service. I really hope Michael Minna still reads his reviews.  I am beginning to believe his sole purpose in life is to just open up restaurants and not care about the experience we have.  I am not sure he is striving for repeat customers. Food was delicious. The sushi was fresh and melted in our mouths. The service from Emily was excellent. Very lively and has a great vibe at every corner. We went there specifically to try the sushi and threw in few small plates from the main menu out of curiosity. While I think the sushi was boarderline good, the main menu was truly amazing. Not purly Japanese but a true fusion. We tried the Karagge chicken (small bites but full of flavour served with Japanese mayo) the squid was grilled to prefection and beyond (still dreaming about it!). Size wise their small plates are easily shared between two people. Spinach salad was quite sweet for my liking and the dessert was a coffee creamy custard goodness. . . I liked it for about  spoonfulls then I was done, too rich for an already heavy dinner. The service was also faultless. They had a cocktail area for what seemed to be a private event. . . very New York. Pabu has a lively and casual atmosphere. Both the large space and the menu offer plenty of variety for a range of moods and occasions. Take your pick of beer, wine, sake, cocktails, liquor, izakaya dishes, nigiri, sashimi, rolls, yakitori, shabu shabu, large plates (similar to those served at Michael Mina), and dessert. Stand near the bar or sit at a lounge couch, dining room table, semi private booth, private room, or sushi counter spot. All of the small plates that my friends and I shared were very good. Listed from most to least favorite:* Grilled squid with kewpie, togarashi, lemon  $: Perfectly cooked squid, paired nicely with spicy mayo* Kinpira burdock with umami soy, togarashi chili  $: Nice spicy kick * House made tofu  $?: Surprisingly creamy * Monterey squid okonomiyaki with pork belly, sunny side up egg, bonito  $* Pork gyoza  $The rolls were just average. The nigiri was good, with fresh fish and nicely cooked rice that was a bit sweet, a bit vinegary, and not mushy at all. However, I'd rather go to Maruya or Ichi for better sushi at comparable prices. There were a few hiccups in the meal. A couple of drinks and dishes were slow to come out. The server apologized nicely and comped one of the drinks that was somehow forgotten. The bathroom was surprisingly dirty for a restaurant of Pabu's caliber. Very nice atmosphere & attentive service, but the cuisine does not live up to the expectations: had the tasting menu  much of the sushi / sashimi was fresh but lacked flavor/character, with a few pieces being downright disturbing in their loose texture (the crab in particular); the rice with the sushi was not complimentary  poor flavor & consistency.  The desert was refreshing, but more so for cleaning the palate from a disappointing meal. . . Definitely not the quality one expects for the price  hunger was the best seasoning with this meal. Delish! Modern, sleep, upscale and a great addition to the restaurant scene in SF. I loved the tapas and the sushi. The service was great. Attentive staff and super helpful when we asked for suggestions. Highly recommend. Yummy food and excellent service. We went for the happy hour today and sat at the bar. The drinks were awesome and the apps (fried chicken, mushroom tempura, oysters, and hand rolls) were all amazing. The shabu wagyu was okay not my fav but the server on her own got a  so we averaged to a solid  (I would even give it a .  if I could). Def a go back location! We came here on a Sunday night for my mom's birthday.  It was funny because when we told the waitress who took our dessert order it was our mom's birthday, I think she didn't know who it was and put the birthday dessert in the middle of the table.  We were promptly seated for our reservation.  There were two booths next to each other and ours was not set and closer to the kitchen so we asked if we could take the one closer to the door that was set for five.  The hostess refused.  Not sure how difficult it is to remove a place setting and reset the empty table for five but oh well. Servers are dressed down in crisp white shirts and jeans. Our server was friendly and very thorough. One of us opted for the tasting menu. We also shared a chawan mushi and grilled squid to start.  both really good. chawan mushi came with ikura which was a highlight for me.  the squid was grilled perfectly and not too dry. For mains we shared the lobster and wagyu, seafood shabu shabu, and also a robatayaki sampler.  Some pieces of the wagyu were blue while we asked for medium rare.  The shabu shabu was a cool concept but the sterno never made the soup boil.  The seafood cooked, I think. The sampler came with tsukune with raw egg (so good and juicy!), negima, kokoro, bonjiri, harami, gyutan, eringi, and butabara.  I didn't know bonjiri was chicken butt only way after I ate it. We also shared a Miso black cod which was good.  the turnip greens underneath were bitter.  It is not as buttery as other miso gindaras I have had.  definitely very flaky. For desserts, we shared a birthday dessert, soy caramel custard, green tea, pabu chocolate and sorbet. All were delicious.  The green tea was way too sweet for me.  The green tea white chocolate was too sweet then the accompanying huckleberry jam was too sweet. I much preferred the custard with coffee jelly and sesame candy.  So delicious. I love coffee jelly. The sorbet had a sake sauce and pears.  super refreshing. I didn't get a chance to taste any of the sushi but it looked good.  I am sure their quality justifies the price but all in all felt the meal was a bit expensive. Pabu's outdoor seating is my new favorite Sunday hangout. For our early dinner, we ordered my usual sure win dishes and also discovered some new ones! Futo maki* don't let this all veggies maki put you off. It is packed with flavor and goes well with skewers! House made tofu: MUST get this if you like tofu!! It's so well executed and you can really taste the soy bean.  Yakitori: chicken wings & chicken meatballs are both a must! Tried their skirt steak yakitori this time and I liked very much. It was lean yet flavorful.  Pork gyozas: I appreciate gyozas with a very thin skin. These precious pieces go so well with a bottle of Dassai  sake.  Tempura main course (great for sharing as an appetizer for two): This was divided into two courses, a seasonal veggies course and a protein course. I recommended getting a bowl of PABU Gohan rice that has hijiki, carrots and peas inside to go with the lightly battered tempura. I liked how the tempura came with its own dipping sauce and green tea salt in case you wanted more seasoning. Very satisfying if you're having tempura cravings. These dishes, along with the Michael Mina roll, always super fresh sashimi platters and PABU desserts will keep me coming back again and again. Thank you PABU team and Nicole for always looking after us! :) This is solidly a .  star restaurant. I had lunch here with a few of my colleagues. Though I wasn't feeling sushi for lunch, they had some other amazing entrées. I had the Crispy Cod which was very good. It was soft and buttery, excellently done, and quite flavorful.  All the dishes were beautiful made and everyone had nothing but positive things to say their food. The desserts are pretty legit too. The service was very good as well. Would love to check this place out on a Friday evening, pretty sure it's great. Highly recommend this spot if you desire an upscale Japanese experience. Atmosphere was elegant, staff was top notch, and presentation was chic. The staff were very attentive which suits the whole ambiance of a restaurant in this neighborhood. The food, although we enjoyed the presentation, was nothing to write home about. Nothing really special here, but we did just order sushi. We didn't try any of the main dishes, so maybe we'll have to try one of those sometime. I'm not sure if I would come here again unless if it was to impress someone from out of town. First of all Japanese cuisine is my all time favorite, so when I heard that Michael Minna was opening a new restaurant that would serve dishes from Japan, I of course was super excited. I have gone here several times and have not yet been disappointed.  The location is ideal in the midst of FiDi. I absolutely love the modern loungy bar area especially great for HH because the spectacular floor to ceiling windows allows one to still enjoy the sunlight despite being indoors.  But they also have a patio area too; good to know if you want to bring a canine friend:)I have yet to experience the dining area or sushi bar, but I will.  Lately I prefer restaurants that have a bar area; the ambiance is always much more lively. I'm ususally at the bar in front of Carlo (fabulous mixologist) and with my girlfriends for HH. So ""summer"" is my favorite drink on their menu.  But I'm sure that's about to change, now that summer is over.  The only negative was that I wish they had a more extensive wine by the glass list. As far as food: I've had most of their skewers, gyoza, and tuna tartar which were all delicious.  But my latest favorite is hands down, the grilled squid.  OMG this was off the charts super yummy!  The service was equally amazing; not pretentious but very friendly, attentive and accommodating. Most memorable experience was when I double booked and had my young date meet me amongst all my girlfriends at the bar.  Not a new date, I would never do that to someone new. Well 'never' is a strong word.  We dated a long time ago, so I knew he could handle being around my friends.  My most recent experience was dodging the bullet, when my friend said my Ex BF was there.  Please, if this was any other shabby restaurant, I may have walked out with the sight of him, but Pabu is now one of my favorites in the city, so ignoring him was painless when the food, drinks and service far exceeds the pain of bumping into a recent Ex. . . Leaving and not getting to eat the grilled squid, now that would be more painful! Lunch:: Awesome sushi (highest quality, fresh, delicious and generous portions) and the liberty farms duck breast I had this week was superb truly amazing flavors!Happy Hour: HH wines are quality wines and a terrific bargain for $.  (and I know my wines) and bites are reasonably priced and excellent quality YUM!Music: INCREDIBLE sound system and great music playing every time I have been in. Only problem is that I want to dance lol.  Can you say JAMES BROWN  Get on Up! Thanks for opening up right below my office! I LOVE PABU.  One of my awesome gfs treated me here last night and it was wonderful.  It's ""Hot and New"" on Yelp and I can see why.  It's right next to the Ramen Shop and the interior has clean lines and high ceilings.  The wait staff is excellent and attentive.  All of the dishes were fantastic.  Someone different served each dish but they all were knowledgeable and really pleasant.  The timing of the dishes were impeccable.  Every detail was taken care of including hot hand towels to start and the wait staff always keeping the table clean, which I appreciate very much!We had the seaweed salad (more taste and moisture than most seaweed salad), burdock (like the Korean side dish but lighter), house made tofu (OMG to die for), grilled squid (perfectly cooked and cut  beautiful presentation), pork belly (delicious), Ken's roll (delicate and not overwhelming) and green tea mousse with huckleberry jam.  We were so full and satisfied.  They have quite an extensive sake menu as well. I want to come back and try the rest of the dishes.  Between two people that do not eat a lot,  small veggie appetizers, one roll and either one other entree or side dish will do.  And you can't forget dessert!  The green tea mousse was not too sweet and the huckleberry jam gave it some texture and a tart kick at the end.  I love this dessert  one of my favorite now in the city!  I want to come back and try the rest of the dishes.  And not to mention, there are plenty of beautiful people here to scope out. Pabu is a new and swanky Japanese restaurant located in the heart of San Francisco's Financial district. The decor is sleek and modern, complete with high glass ceilings and a spacious bar. This Michael Mina collaboration serves izakaya style Japanese small plate dining and serves a large selection of Japanese whiskies and sakes. Much to my surprise, Pabu has an amazing happy hour. Even better than their happy hour is their customer service. There were no seats available in the lounge upon our arrival however the service staff graciously made a table available for my group and I. I assure you, we were very happy!For happy hour, I recommend:+ Japanese Chuhai (A bourbon type of drink was being served on the day I visited)+ Happy Hour Spicy Salmon & Spicy Scallop hand rollsThank you Pabu for making my first happy hour experience absolutely amazing! First off, I am a huge Mina fan, I have dined in  of his restaurants. Michael Mina's name is being thrown around all over the place lately. I celebrated a nd going away dinner with friends here and since this restaurant was the talk of the town (being that it's  months old) it only seemed idea that we had a dinner here. High quality sushi but I can't say the price is worth it since high quality sashimi is high quality sashimi. At a $ per person average, I would say there needs to be more stuff going on the plate. I want to see more than just a piece of fish lined up with rice on a white dish. Their pot stickers were way to salty for my taste and their ""fresh fruit"" dessert sucked since it was just a  few pieces of fruit with sauce on top. Where is the creativity and thought? This place is an over priced Japanese restaurant located in dtown. The hosts were dressed very sexy but they were not friendly. The waitress who served us was very nice and professional (I gave her all  stars). Nothing special about the food. Sashimi was fresh but I can get it elsewhere with half of the price. The menu is a bit overwhelming, fortunately we went in knowing we were getting sushi.  We started with edamame, Tokyo Fried Chicken and Grilled Squid.  The highlight was the Squid.  The presentation was fantastic, and it tasted great too.  The other dishes were good but the squid was the highlight for me. We then moved on to a the skewers.  We had the chicken meatballs, Mushroom and pork belly, for me the chicken meatballs were great. The egg really added some great flavor, not sure if I would order the other  again. We then had a few maki rolls.  The Ken's roll was great, definitely recommend that.  Such great flavor.  The crispy spicy was just ok.  It was lightly fried, but for me the fried tempura was really all I got out of that roll.  The rainbow was really great as well as the spicy roll.  All the fish was incredibly fresh and delicious. I would definitely go back. Just finished my lunch at pabu. We shared a few plates ahi poke (pretty standard), crab cake (delicious) came with tasty heirloom tomatoes, squid okonomiyaki ( blew me out of this world if you order one thing, you Must order this dish) not only is it gorgeous but flavors play so well together. We also had black cod which was ok, I felt like it lacked flavor. service was outstanding, make sure to make reservations this place fills up I'm giving Pabu a solid four stars. Came in on a Monday night and the place had a pretty good crowd aka must be doing something right, right? Bar Area: Very chic and modern. They have high top tables and round sofa ones as well. You can order food at the bar area if you don't want to wait Bartender was sweet and knew her way around the drink menu American mammoth jack is my new favorite drink! Delishh! I even got it twice! Unfortunately,  man friend and I were seated in the very last booth in the restaurant area which somewhat concerned me (being ignored, hard to find wait staff, crappy service, etc. . . )Well, our lovely waitress Jaime (can't remember too well) was very pleasant to talk too and helped us out. We decided to go for the omakase tasting menu. Now, I'm not usually a huge fan of tasting menu's so this was a very big leap for me. Tasting menu:Happy spoon: What looks like a pile up of poop, egg balls, some extra cream with oysters, this actually tasted quite good. You can definitely taste the flavors of each component. The goods: Kanpachi plate and the tuna plate. Absolutely delicious! The toro was my favorite of the night. I'm a sucker for fatty tuna, and this place sealed the deal. The bad: The mackerel plate (Dari) and the shellfish plate (Ronji). I spit the fresh scallop out, and only ate the snow crab. The mackerel plate I gave to man friend. Way too exotic for me. Palate cleanser: Water infused sake with melon. Very refreshing and tasty. Shabu: They were nice enough to sub the waygu for me. I instead got the seafood shabu. The broth needed more seasoning as it did lack flavor. I've had some better shabu closer to home, so I expected to be blown away. Dessert: Tasty sake cake infused sorbet. I tend to skip desserts at Japanese restaurants but nonetheless, this was pretty good. We ordered the ahi poke as well, which I became a fan of. Wish it had a larger portion though,  but easily enough for two people. Man friend did the sake pairing with the tasting menu, and I was lucky enough to taste some as well. Now, I am not a huge sake fan. Usually i just drink it with beer, but that night, I realized their is more to sake than just a good buzz. Some were light, some were crisp and airy, and some were fruity. But Pabu definitely made me open a new door to sake and I have found a respect for it. All in all, Mina has outdone himself again. I will come back and try their a la carte menu, sake, and cocktails for sure. Would I try the tasting menu again? Probably not. But their is a first for everything. Will come back again! P. S.  Was lucky enough to meet Mina himself that night! Popped my cherry here!I mean my omakase cherry here!Celebrating my b'day, my friend invited me to take my maiden voyage here on a recent Friday evening.  After a quick glance at the regular menu and a quick study of their tasting menu, she immediately asked, ""Are you game?""  Those who know my competitiveness know that I don't like to step down to challenges so, yes, GAME ON!  Here's the tasting menu that we enjoyed:.  Happy Spoon (yelp. com/user_local_phot…)  Kusshi oyster, uni, ikura, tobiko, ponzu craime fraiche.  Rich first bite. .  Kanpachi and Kinpira burdock (yelp. com/user_local_phot…)  Good start with the smooth sashimi and crunchy burdock. .  Nigiri st plate  Sea bream, Butterfish, Alfonsino, and Grouper (yelp. com/user_local_phot…)  Starting with the lighter textured fish. .  Nigiri nd plate  Horse mackerel, Japanese mackerel, Striped jack, Flying fish (yelp. com/user_local_phot…)  Heavier flavors which non mackerel (fishy) fans still enjoyed. .  Nigiri rd plate  Bluefin tuna, Big eye tuna, Fatty Bluefin tuna, Wild bonito (yelp. com/user_local_phot…)  Hearty tuna progression with toro being favorite. . Nigiri th plate  Fresh scallop, Snow crab, Baby white shrimp, Sea urchin (yelp. com/user_local_phot…)  Interesting change of pace with scallop being fave and crab being least.  Had double uni portion from friend. . Wagyu shabu shabu (yelp. com/user_local_phot…)  Garnished with mushrooms, watermelon radish, and Goma Dare in a Kombu broth, this hot course was perfectly apportioned.  Broth was not overly salted. . Cherry Sorbet (yelp. com/user_local_phot…)  Enjoyed the summery sweetness of various stone fruits (plums and pluots) which are in season. Besides the above, there was a refresher spoon mid meal and two bonus sweet endings.  Loved those azuki bean cookies.  All I can say is that we both were grinning after our meals. . . she perhaps a bit more because she enjoyed the sake pairings.  Full props to our server Emily C. who explained the intricacies of the journey as we went along; she taught us newbies about eating our sushi from  left to right.  The only hiccup was some confusion on our shabu shabu. They made up by giving me a double order of the noodles and, well, you know me and noodles!Yes, will be back and it'll be awfully hard NOT to have this meal again!  Big thanks to my dinner host too! Take the tasting menu next to the barThe freshest fish you can getTraditional creativity and great service Eh, I think I got my hopes a little too high because I drank the Michael Mina koolaid. The place is very pretty, contemporary Japanese. But the food didn't live up to it's ambience. They didn't even offer white tuna. The cod and the veggies were bland and oily I had to ask for salt which took  minutes. The ahi poke was not ahi poke. It was just ahi. The Moscow mules were sour. The beef strips were too large and the whipped egg dipping sauce was interesting but a little desperate and unnecessary. There are better hole in the wall sushi places in SF. . . that even offer white tuna. Mina needs to stick with what he does best, which isn't Japanese food. Excellent dining experience.  The menu is full of delicious creative dishes with ingredients that compliment each other perfectly.  The service was attentive and the staff was very knowledgeable which really enhanced the entire experience for us.  We would have overlooked the happy spoons and they are not to be missed and the Sake Master was spot on. This place is good.  I love good sushi and bad sushi, but this restaurant shines as a place I'll go and eat even after having already eaten in the last hour (as I did last night after eating at barbacco). I went here for the first time on July , shortly after the restaurant opened.  Neither my boyfriend nor I were particularly hungry, so we initially decided to order nigiri off the menu.  After the first few pieces arrived, however, I realized that I would definitely be wanting the  appetizer +  pc nigiri + shabu shabu omakase the sushi chef had originally recommended.  A few highlights are hard to pick from the amazing omakase, but here goes:) The Happy Spoon: kusshi oyster, uni, ikura,tobiko, ponzu crème fraîche.  I like all of these things, and it turns out I like them all even better when they come on a cute soup spoon on a leaf in a bowl of ice.  Order it off the izakaya menu if you don't go all in for the omakase. ) The tuna course: bluefin tuna, bigeye tuna, fatty bluefin tuna, fattier bluefin tuna.  This was eye opening for me to be able to compare different types of tuna side by side.  I've always loved maguro and toro, but understanding subtle differences between the different fish and cuts was interesting and delicious. ) I am a sucker for shellfish, AND the bottle of sake (Yamahai Nama ) we'd ordered was intended to pair with this course, so this was a clear winner.  hotate, ama ebi, snow crab, and clam were expertly prepared and seasoned. The service also happened to be amazing.  Near the end of the omakase, we ordered some uni nigiri.  The chef opened a new box, gave us ""samples"" before the actual sushi, and then proceeded to put double the amount of uni any other restaurant puts into our nigiri.  We were in heaven. Suffice it to say, I'm a huge fan and will happily eat here any day, any time. Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the omakase. Had some nigiri I'd never tried before that blew me away (horse mackerel is amazing). Love the wine list as well get the gruner veltliner Michael Mina had developed specifically for his restaurant group pairs amazingly with the sushi! PABU on SF FIDI #FAIL We were excited to try this new restaurant in the SF FIDI.  We arrived at noon. There were about  parties in line.  When we arrived at the Host/Hostess station directly inside the door we explained that we did not want to sit on a high stool.  My friend is not as tall as me and stools simply do not work.  We were then told ""Oh, there is room at the Sushi Bar, but oh that has stools!"" Really? Yes, we said we don't want to sit on stools.  We scanned the entire restaurant and there was plenty of table and booth space, yet the two hostesses seemed overwhelmed with the influx of the crowd. We were NOT offered anything but sitting on a stool.  Really?  Both my colleague and I have worked in the FIDI for over two decades and we have NEVER been turned away from a restaurant. YES, I said ""turned away"".  We were simply told ""we cannot seat you"" and NOT given a wait time which is the norm at lunch hour in the FIDI.  Anyone who owns a restaurant in the FIDI hopefully should know that there is going to be a lunch time rush and make accommodations for such and offer a time wait or some type of courtesy for the future other than ""we cannot seat you"".  We were publicly embarrassed due to a lack of planning, ill equipped staff and savoir faire on the part of PABU and we left feeling that there was more at play.  I am a Gay man, my friend is a Latina.  I'm just sayin'.  #PABUFAILS High end JapaneseExpensive ( already expected )Services was wonderful Ordered miso black cod ( had to send it back and get a new one) okA nirgri  stars Shabu Shabu:   stars Ahi tuna:   starsOverall is pretty good !! The entire time I was at Pabu, I had the distinct feeling that I was at Hooters (except ample breasts are poured into black low cut tank tops instead of orange). My male colleague definitely took notice and was quite cheerful about it. Depending on what you're looking for  this could be a plus or a minus! But for a business lunch in downtown SF at a high end Japanese restaurant it feels out of place and awkward. The service was good, everyone was nice and the food was mixed (sashimi platter was ok and the spicy sushi roll was lacking, while the miso cod and okonomiyaki were yummy). Lunch for  was $ (tip included) without alcohol. It wasn't so special that I would necessarily go back. This is based on lunch. Very good food and service. Nice Ambience. The Okonomiyaki and Cod were my favorites. My companions enjoyed the sashimi especially the Uni. Would return We are huge fans of Michael Mina's after eating at his Seattle RN restaurant. I was excited to try this new restaurant because it was a break from the cuisine at his other restaurants. It did not disappoint. The decor was very trendy with a Japanese influence. We ordered from the main menu. It changes often so some of the dishes may not always be available. We decided to drink Sake for the night. The restaurant has a sake sommelier that can help you decide which one to order. That was super helpful because we are not very knowledgable in the sake world. The waiter was very helpful too. We saw a few dishes we wanted to try and the waiter helped us create a harmonious meal. We started with the Ahi Poke. Delicious! You can taste each individual ingredient. It was so well balanced and delicate! Our other small plate was the Sake steamed clams. Again, another well balanced dish. The flavors were great!We had to try the Shabu Shabu because it's not often that we see it on a menu. We ordered the seafood one with snow crab, scallops, and hamachi. My favorite protein of this lot was the hamachi. It just soaked up all of the flavor of the broth. Don't forget to use the dipping sauce! It has some great flavor!Another main dish we ordered was the Black Cod. It was nice and delicate. The beans added a great contrast of texture to the cod. We still had a little room left to try a sushi roll, but we wanted something really simple. We got the hamachi and scallion roll. It was just the right size to cap off the night. A wonderful experience from the ambience, to the staff, to the food. We'll be back and I've already recommended the place to friends. Bravo! Big, beautiful and boisterous!  Even when half empty this restaurant is so loud and by pm when in full swing it was almost unbearable.  That being said, there is an undercurrent of fun here.  We sat at the sushi bar and enjoyed their tasting menu.  For $ it is a great deal for all the fish you get.  We also loved the sake pairing for $.  We sat with the very affable Ron.  We enjoyed talking to him and his neighbor Chef Chris. Compared to other high end sushi restaurants, nothing was really stand out.  The fish was very fresh but the preps were not very innovative or complex.   Though no wasabi or soy was offered with the tasting menu, the fish dressings were not that flavorful and a few times I missed a quick wasabi soy dip.  However, the fish was so fresh, the fish would have been enjoyable totally on its own.  Watching the sushi chefs, it seemed that rolls were the big pull here.  So popular, they had what looked like a couple pounds of spicy tuna in a huge pastry bag to squeeze onto the rolls.  The Happy Spoon started the tasting menu and it was great.  The sparking Michael Mina curvee was served with it, and this made an elegant start!  The kusshi oyster was so fresh.  The uni was too scant though.  Ikura and tobiko were added.  I noticed a huge difference in the size of the uni piece and amounts of tobiko on each spoon.  My husband was too quick for me and got the big piece of uni, SHOOT!  A pretty presentation of kanpachi sashimi with a side of kinpira burdock was next. Then the sushi chefs took over from the kitchen with serving  pieces of nigiri.   All good fish, simply presented,  nothing real fancy here.  My only real complaint was a mushed mess of uni I was served.  I only like picture perfect tongues of uni and will not eat ugly messes.  Thank God for husbands who will switch with you even if it is only so they do not have to hear about it for the next hour.  LOL!  After a whole lot of nigiri, the last savory course was such fun.  Along came a fairly big production of a small shabu shabu pot of broth with a few vegetables and tofu.  A small bowl with  pieces of American waygu, that was highly marbled.  Also  small bowls of dipping sauce for the wagyu after you cook them, not needed.  Another bowl had noodles that must have had sesame in it for it had that great peanut butter flavor.  This was a fun way to end the meal and also if by chance you were still hungry, this filled you up.  BTW, we were not still hungry at all!  Dessert was also served, a delicious sorbet covered in fresh nectarine.  Would we return?  Perhaps though I think this restaurant is more aimed at the younger crowd.  The fish was very good and the price was right!  I think we were served more food than we have gotten with the omakase at Akiko or the tasting menu at Kusakabe though the fish preparation was not nearly as interesting. ,  And we spent about $ less which could in part be due to ordering the sake pairing instead of more expensive bottles we usually order and in some ways we preferred the sake pairing.  Pabu was so much better in every way than our visit to Maruya, another of the no soy/wasabi new wave of high end sushi restaurants!By the way, the sake pairings were really fun!  And so good.  We enjoyed all of them and they did not skimp.   Service was timely and friendly.  All in all, the entire dinner was really an excellent value. I am a little torn as I write this review. . . . I LOVE Michael Mina. I've loved him since I first tasted his lobster pot pie. . . his beef tartare. . . his root beer float. . . . just thinking about those dishes makes my heart melt a little. So when Pabu opened, I was sure I'd fall in love all over again. . . but I didn't. First let's start off with the positive. The restaurant is beautiful. High ceilings. Cherry blossoms painted on the walls. Cute little booths. It wasn't too busy when the man friend and I went (over Labor Day Weekend) but I can see how it can get very lively and loud when it's packed. The drinks are cute! I love the square shaped ice cubes. They are also innovative and tasty. The staff is friendly and attentive. They were quick to serve the food and clean up the plates when we were finished. We sat at the sushi bar and got the Omakase ($). We added the okonomiyaki, tamago and ikura to our Omakase. The okonomiyaki with an egg on top was a nice twist. The tamago was meh. Not sure if the man friend liked the ikura (I didn't try it). Maybe the man friend has just spoiled me with some mind blowing sushi (Shiro's in Seattle is a m a zing or semi locally there's Akane in Los Altos and Yume in Alameda) But there's just something amiss with the food here. . . Everything was good. . . . just not great. And for the reputation and price point, I expected great. I expected umami. I really don't understand why people keep knocking this place.  Came here with my husband on Saturday for our anniversary and we were very well looked after.  I had come in previously with coworkers and we really liked our server, Chris, so I requested him again.  We had the tasting menu with sake pairings.  Everything was just perfect.  People kept stopping by our table to wish us  a happy annviersary. OK, so the food.  Happy Spoon wins for best single bite!  The  course tasting menu was  (?) courses of nigiri and it all featured very fresh, firm, delicious fish.  Comes with their nectarine and sparkling sake dessert but we also had the coffe jelly  love!!  They were so great at explaining the sakes!  I am really a novice in that area so it great to try a bunch of different kinds, know what I was drinking, and not get sloppy drunk in the process. Service was impeccable, and the ambiance was so warm and inviting.  Next time we'll sit at the sushi bar (our favorite spot) to get the full effect. Out of all the ratings I've given on Yelp this is easily the one that gave me the most consternation because I'm really conflicted about this place.  Ultimately I've chosen four stars but really it's a  / in my book because while the space and drinks are two of my favorite things in SF, the food itself is often pretty underwhelming. Pabu is almost guaranteed to make a good first impression.  It's on the corner of some prime real estate in the Financial District so you can already see something lively happening inside before you even get that close.  Once you can see inside, the interior design is really quite striking with a beautiful modern bar occupying one half of the space and the other dedicated to seating and the sushi bar.  It has a very tastefully considered classic Japanese motif blended with typical understated aesthetics of Michael Mina's other places.  The end result is a interior that is simultaneously lively and calm  it makes me feel good just sitting around in here. The star of the show is the bar.  They have a wide selection of lots of libations here but really you should head straight for the cocktails and Japanese whiskey.  If you're a fan of Suntory they've definitely got you covered here, with my personal favorite of all whiskeys, the  year Yamazaki, available and ""reasonably"" priced.  The cocktails are all very well prepared and delicious, with special care given to presentation.  I've seen many cocktails some complete with a crafted piece of ice with some of the spice and herb components of the mix embedded in the piece, which is not only beautiful but melts over time to keep mixing the contents inside.  My favorite, the Yakuza . , is a mix of whiskey, spirits and, of all things, chamomile tea that comes served in a wine class with a very large ball of ice  the name might suggest something edgy but it's actually the most subtle, refined whiskey based cocktail I've ever enjoyed and highly recommended!  If you're not coming in for a full meal your impression of Pabu may shoot way up because the bar is quite special. Unfortunately, food is a really mixed bag here.  I've tried pretty much everything here, including going omakase, and you're definitely best off talking to folks who have been here before for recommendations than going in cold because some of the selections are underwhelming.  I can't say that I've had anything here that would indicative of a world class chef. Good: * Ken's roll: pretty standard shrimp tempura + tuna roll but with a little pine nut on top that is paramount in making the bite stand out  it is really striking what a difference that little thing makes to the texture and enjoyment of the roll!* Strawberry Scallop: clean, fresh, just a touch of sweetness and a % crowd pleaser.  If this is the first thing you order your dining party will probably be thinking ""this meal is going to be great!""* Toro: you will not be disappointed with the taste and melty ness of the Toro here  bite the bullet and spend extra for it. * Kinpira Burdock: It doesn't look like much but Burdock root, properly prepared, is always tasty and this is no exception.  Bad:* Gyoza  this is one the more fascinating failures in SF.  On the way in the delicate nature of the dumpling will have you thinking you're in for the most spectacular preparation of this classic bite ever and then. . . wow, that's bland.  I'm comfortable in saying that this is my least favorite Gyoza ever. * Happy Spoon  this is probably the most gauche thing I've ever consumed.  When it arrives all of the components (uni, ikura, tobiko, oyster and ponzu crème fraîche) are sitting on the spoon like some alien entrails.  When you consume it all in one spoon, none of the flavors combine in any way and it's as if each occupy a different region of your taste buds, and each of them was equally unpleasant for me.  On top of that, something in the mix made my mouth very dry for some reason, a sensation that continued on for some time.  Maybe you'll like it but for me the adjective ""Happy"" was the opposite of how I felt. That's just a small selection.  Also good is the Black Cod, chicken skewers and all of the deserts.  The sushi is mostly underwhelming. I know it doesn't sound like it but overall I'm a fan.  It's taken some navigating around the menu to come to selections that I feel really make the meal.  Maybe the best thing to do is come in with a large party and try to order as many things as you can to get a sampling of what Pabu has to offer because as I've described, you can go pretty good or really wrong very easily. I made reservations fully expecting to love Pabu completely. The tasting menu was well portioned and paced with a variety of flavors and textures. The kampachi with burdock root was my favorite. The red bean cookies that come at the end are so good! I wanted to buy a box and take them home. The plates, bowls, and cups are all so pretty and a joy to use. The coffee carafe is so cool  it's the French press of the future! We almost bought one on amazon during dessert lol. The service is mostly friendly, helpful, and informative. But there was a  weird moment. When we were served our shabu shabu, the waiter asked if we knew how to do shabu shabu. When we confirmed that we knew what to do, the waiter said, ""oh good. Then I don't have to go into the five minute speech to explain it. "" Huh, ok. Why not just say, ""oh good. Thank you. "" And stop there? The presentation of the omakase dishes were all beautiful and clean with the exception of one of my tuna nigiris. I picked it up and hanging from the end of the fish by a thin thread of muscular protein was a piece of tuna  like a hanging chad, this piece was not cleanly cut. The happy spoon was a bit too creamy and savory. I would have been able to taste and enjoy the oyster more if it wasn't masked by uni, two kinds of eggs, AND creme fraiche. Sometimes simple is super, ya know? We sat at the bar. The staff was very attentive and detailed from the get go. We ordered a the five chef choice Sashimi and a Ken's Roll. The roll was well prepared and the sashimi was fresh. It's a decent Sushi joint. But for the price and quality, it's an overpriced joint. The service is great and the place is very nice and clean. But the value is not that great. Maybe it's because they in downtown San Francisco and paying high rent! It's a new place and the place was pretty empty at lunch time. They might last! My wife and I went to Pabu last night to celebrate our th Anniversary. Overall, we walked away thinking it was a disappointing experience and would not go back. The food was just ok. The best dish of the night was the Happy Oyster Spoon. The most disappointing dish was the Miso Black Cod. Ours was severely overcooked and was trimmed properly. The other dishes in between were forgettable. Quite honestly after  dishes we left hungry. I would recommend skipping this. Generally, we are big fans of Michael Mina but this place needs lots of work. We've had ramen throughout Hokkaido. Pabu's is just as sublime. A true downtown SF gem My friends and I were excited to try this place and I really wanted to love the experience. But truly, ""Meh, I've experienced better. "" For the pice point, I expect pretty exceptional service and exceptional cuisine. The service was uncoordinated. . . possibly because the place is still new. But a server poured still water into sparkling water in our glasses. And the waitress had a hard time communicating with us. The food presentation was excellent, but the actual taste was ok. I had the Monterey Squid Okonomiyaki and Chirashi. The okonomiyaki included pork belly that was dry and overcooked. The chirashi was good, but not necesarily much better than others I've had. Overall, with so many exceptional places to eat in this area, I would not come back here again. Oddly enough for an international, Pacific oriented city, it can be hard to find Izakaya style Japanese food in San Francisco, which is why I'm glad Pabu exists. The food isn't spectacular by any means, but it's good.  I enjoyed the Okonomiyaki and the grilled squid, in particular. I'm so excited! A new cool place that I can add to my rotation :). This swank new sushi place in the financial district is a .  star experience. It's pricey sushi but it's worth it. The staff are all basically models which is a unique experience in SF, this place feels like a place you'd find in LA. We had some sushi rolls and a cooked fish, all were high quality. Definitely a great spot for a date if you're in the area and you can sit outside if you can deal with the chill. Sat at the sushi bar on Friday night and ordered the omakase tasting menu ($). The omakase begins with the happy spoon oyster, sea urchin, ikura, tobiko and creme fraiche. I thought this was really delicious and the creme fraiche made it slightly different to similar dishes I've had at other Japanese restaurants. I enjoyed the flavours of the kanpachi/kinpura burdock that followed, although it wasn't a particularly memorable dish. Next up was the extensive nigiri courses ( pieces). Generally speaking I prefer sashimi over nigiri and so was a little hesitant about ordering the omakase. Having said that, the fish selection was pretty extensive with a good variety of flavours and textures. In particular, the partially seared masaba Japanese mackerel was exceptional. I'm a big uni fan and the sea urchin from Mendocino did not disappoint. It was super fresh and really delicious. The wagyu shabu shabu was just like a mini shabu hot pot! A pretty fun dish and added the do it yourself element to a fancy dinner. For me it was a little too heavy by this point in the meal and too similar to regular shabu. I'd rather just stick to sushi with an omakase menu. The final dish, a cherry sorbet with sparkling sake, was somewhat disappointing. The sake comes separately and is poured on as they serve it. The sorbet and accompanying fresh fruit were delicious, however with the sparkling sake it strangely reminded me of that fizzy tang when orange juice goes bad(!)Overall I really enjoyed the friendly and attentive service at Pabu. Although the space is large and busy for a fine dining restaurant, our server made sure to provide a personable experience. I look forward to coming back, most likely to order off of the a la carte menu to sample dishes not offered on the tasting menu. Pabu is a nice option for Japanese dining in the financial district.  I enjoyed Pabu much more than I enjoyed Roka Akor. My family started with several Izakaya style dishes that were all quite good.  The pork gyoza and kaarage chicken were tasty and enjoyed by all.  The grilled squid was delicious and delicate, yet huge.  The squid could easily be a meal all on its own. We also tried several Robata including the chicken thighs and chicken meatballs.  Both were very tasty. As a finale, we split the seafood shabu shabu and the whole flounder.  The flounder was very delicious and a favorite at my family's table.  The shabu shabu was good with snow crab, hamachi tuna and scallops.  I probably would not order the shabu shabu again. Overall, my family decided that Pabu is a place where we will return. A bit disappointing for a Michael Mina restaurant ! At least  other upscale places in the city that are better. And it is so noisy and tables close together in, as one customer called it, the pit area. We had a booth  in the bar area. Service was ok but the waitress was not too knowledgeable and could have spoken a bit louder. Wines by the glass are high and are going up to $  a glass and it is not an always freshly opened bottle(as in this day). Best thing we had was the Kanpachi but a bit skimpy. Spider roll was ok also , only  of them though. Chawanmushi was a bit watery and bland whereas the Farm Greens were quite good and plenty. The Cod was also a bit disappointing. It totally fell apart on the plate Actually I am checking my bill over again and noticed they charged me $  for this dish and on the on line menu it says $ .  Terrible. . I had  pieces of potato and the rest was vegetable , a dish not with very good flavor. Skirt steak skewers were very good. Unfortunately the white chocolate/green tea dessert was so very bland and really nothing special. So based on everything together it should probably  / stars but not  for sure. And also I can;t believe Bauer's review with its  stars. Somebody probably recognized him. . . . . Well designed place. The ambience didn't feel uncomfortable at all. We sat for drinks at the bar before we had dinner and their bar program did not disappoint. I had an old fashioned and let the bar tender use his choice of bourbon. He led me to a Japanese  year Hakushu and it was excellent as a cocktail. For dinner we had a few starters which included the happy spoons. They will recommend that so I say just go with it. It's pretty good. The chawanmushi was also a favorite. For the main we went with nigiri. The fish was fresh and flavorful. You're definitely going to be dropping a pretty penny after dining here but I think it's worth it once you figure out what you really want from their extensive menu. Delicious. Squid appetizer was delicious. Sashimi was best ever. Spicy crunchy roll and ken's roll were the best. There were  deserts. All were amazing but the strawberry cream cake was the best. The ambience was great. The bar was a great scene. The drinks were incredible. Lovely restaurant with Asian esque, Japanese decor.   Drinks were delicious, especially the American Jack!  Since they're new, they need to work out a few kinks, and I'd be back to try the food again.  Fish is high grade, and I enjoy ordering the small plates rather than the entrees.  That way, there's more to try! Props for conveying a great NYC like ambiance, right in the heart of financial district.  I think the area definitely needed a place like this. The fact that it was packed Friday well after work was a great sign. the space is HUGE with a large bar area. We grabbed a drink in the bar area, practically stepping over people.  Everyone was squeezed along the wall so it was more reminiscent of an amtrak terminal.  We were then seated shortly  the waitress led us into ""the pit""  basically an area in the middle surrounded by booths and the sushi bar on the sides. There were about   tables packed in an area smaller than my living room. We obviously chose to sit at the bar than the pit . The tables are so close, I can't imagine having any private conversations. The whole restaurant was buzzing. It was so loud that our waitress had to invade our personal space in order to take our order and make her presence known. The prices are sky high. The quality is great. The selection is wide (with shabu shabu and great entrees).  I wouldn't mind coming back here but would not be my ""default  trendy japanese restaurant"".  That title still goes to roka akor =] My friend and I both love sushi, and were excited to try this restaurant after reading the rave reviews and seeing it on the cover of a local magazine. We have both been to Nobu (is it any coincidence the name sounds similar? I don't think so) and we love good sushi in SF, places like Sushi Zone, Warakabune, Sushi Sam's in San Mateo, and many others. I'll start with the ""positive""  the food. It tasted very mediocre, run of the mill. Like no better than a random sushi place you might go to in San Jose or San Bruno. With double the price. We ordered rolls, nigiri, and appetizers. None of it was impressive. The best were probably the meat skewers. The service was terrible. It took them  minutes to seat us, and we had reservations. They brought by  wrong orders that were for another table! We ordered simple drinks (Coke and Diet Coke) and it took  minutes to bring those out. The waitress kept rolling her eyes. Just bad all around. Bad service and very average food. Left there truly disappointed, perplexed at the high ratings, and vowing never to return, as well as to warn others to stay away. Save your money for a better place. There are so many to choose from. We had the omakase. Fresh sushi and great value for the quality of fish we are getting. But I do agree that the sushi rice is unseasoned and hard. The ""southern"" outpost of Hana Sushi is a spectacular space with amazing food, incredible depth of menu and a phenomenal sake selection (along with an impressive and charming) sake sommelier. Sat at the bar and tried the tasting menu and was blown away. We went for lunch and everything from appetizers to dessert were delicious.  Service was superb too.  I can't wait to go back for dinner. Excellent service. . . great food. . . also a very good wine list. . . . great addition to the city. I give it  stars because I had the best wagyu beef here. It is buttery and tender. The fat melts in your mouth as soon as your tongue touches it. . . A grade, $ per oz,  oz minimal. Totally worth it! It even comes with a certificate of authenticity ""certify that the following beef is % traceability genuine Miyazaki Wagyu and graded according to the highest standard required by Japan Meat Grading Association"".  Other than Wagyu beef, we tried:'Happy Spoon' OysterBluefin Medium Fatty Tuna (Chu Toro)Yuzu KanpachiSweet Miso OctopusAll good but pricy. Ryoko's offers better value for the money! We met chef and owner Ken Tominaga during our meal, a very nice and humble man. Went here to celebrate my husbands birthday.  I made early reservations for pm on a Friday night.  We got there a little early and the bar area was packed!  We just headed right to our table.  The drinks here are fantastic and the presentation of the drinks are even better.  The cocktail list is well rounded and there are a ton of choices.  I had the fuzzy and the American mammoth jack.  My favorite of the  was the American mammoth jack.  My husband had the ""I have to go"" and it was also delicious.  The drinks are served with flowers incased in ice.  Pretty cool!  We ordered quite a few dishes and had done our homework on yelp to see what was recommended.  Our server was very nice and explained the menu to us in detail making several suggestions as she went. We ordered:   happy spoons great way to start our meal off probably my favorite dish of the night, all the flavors go together so nicely!Yuzu Kanpachi this was just okay to us, Im not sure what I didn't like about it but it tasted a bit flavorless. Okonomiyaki Yum yum yum!  This is a beautiful dish and taste very good as well.  The egg with the pork belly is magical. Chawanmushi This was okay they egg was a bit watered down and it was kind of disappointing after the first bite.  The ikura was beyond delicious though!Chicken meatballs I liked this dish a lot the egg yolk dipping sauce is genius and so good!  I would definitely order that again. Beef Tounge Ehh again this didn't have much flavor to me. A Beef (off sushi menu) This was $ but the meat was very good unlike any steak I have ever tasted. Michael's negitoro roll with uni, ikura, and fatty tuna.  Sounded delicious but I thought it was just okay, I was a little surprised when they brought this dish out it was only  pieces and it cost $ that's a bit pricey even for those ingredients!Overall the service here was great, and there were some stand out dishes.  However I did find some of the dishes a little bland.  I may return, but with so many delicious restaurants like this in the city I will be more likely to try out something new! I was very excited to have dinner with my gf here. Since this is A Michael Mina resto , I was expecting it to be impeccable service, food and ambiance. So why did I give a  star?Service  excellent, very prompt, super friendly and very attentiveDrinks so delish!  They have really good mixologists. Decor  very chic, modern, stylish. Very spacious and even if it is crowded, it doesn't feel like it. Food  brings it down to one star. . Everything was just so so. Flavors of the food were just OKAY. Kokko in the peninsula served more delectable and flavorful dishes than this place. But this is not because I' m giving it a one star. The reason is for the long curly hair I found in my OKONOMIYAKI. Super disgusting, very disappointing. The manager came over  and apologized and just took off the pancake from our bill. But still this experience, leads me to just come back here again for the drinks and not the food. The hair in my food leads me to give this place sadly a one star. Tiny tiny sashimi and nigiri portions, and way more pricey than other comparable sushi place. Never been to Ken's place in Rohnert Park but been to Mina's many many establishments so really wanted to try this place but something always came up.  Luckily a friend was staying at the Hyatt and called me and said he got a table at  in the bar and I was downtown so off I went.  Well, the decor is not very exciting and predictable with the bar dominating the triangular space.  The music was loud and frankly some kind of house which was awful and disruptive to the senses.  The bathroom was overflowing with paper towels on the floor and the bin was full (presumably from a busy lunch service) but they should have cleaned up.  These are never good first signs but hey they get * on Yelp and Chronicle wants to put them in the next Top .  The servers didn't clean up the table when my friend sat so I thought he had eaten already.  The female servers were all dressed in some kind of pink fuchsia getup but not a uniform.  It looks like a Reno lounge act and this is  California address, We ordered some of their many concoctions but not a one stood out.  I had a Hibiki and Soda drink and it turns out it was strawberry soda and it overpowered any whiskey taste and I felt silly drinking a sweet strawberry colored drink.  My friend ordered a Japanese whiskey and soda to start but he got Marigolds in there. . . who puts flowers in a whiskey soda?  Some of the other named cocktails had black stuff floating around and the server said it was a lost sesame seeds but upon examination. . . nori flakes.  Did somebody not wash their hands?  Now for the food. . . . it was awful.  The pork belly buns are $.  each and this is happy hour pricing.  The one bite wonders would have been worth it if one could swallow the bun.  It was dry and powdery and the pickled shards of carrots and daikon didn't help with the tiny cube of decent belly meat.  The hand rolls were not eatable as the seaweed cone was wet and not toasted.  This is sushi  here as it must be toasted crisp as is always at the best places.  It was so chewy I could hardly bite through the nori skin.  The fried chicken tenders (Karragi) were dry and tasteless and McD's chicken tenders would have been better.  The spicy aioli is the same taste as the mix in the hand rolls.  The robata daily special was chicken oysters but this meat is near the butt and hard to pull out of the bone crevice and costs for two tiny bites at $. .  By the way. . . what's with the  pricing. . . ?  This is Japanese place and not Chinese right and all the descriptions in the bar menu was too much and felt bit like trade school approach to teach their customers.  The oysters smelled off as perhaps too long out of the water and tad too creamy (this is the bad season for that but. . . ) one should never smell the oysters before one eats them.  We tried all five bar app's as we could not order off the main menu.  We asked for the check and then they asked us if we wanted to eat off the regular menu. . . WHAT?  They told us earlier it was not available in the bar!  I thought long and hard but decided that the experience so far was so bad. . . why chance it and how much better could if be from the main menu as somebody definitely not watching the ship even as I saw Chef Ken behind the main sushi counter.   People might be impressed because of the address and Mina name but it was amateur hour in the bar area at least!  The bar should be called Pupu. . . not Pabu. Can I have a round of applause for Chef Yoji Harada! The benefit of sitting at the sushi bar is you get served by the chef working in front of you and it was an honor to have Chef Yoji Harada take care of us for the evening. He put on a smile and chit chatted with me throughout my meal, while he kept filling orders. It was a pleasant experience and much appreciated through a usual busy night. Honored to see Ken Tominaga in action there as will. For my first experience here, I had to go with the tasting menu. The menu consisted the happy spoon, sashimi and nigiris followed by wagyu shabu shabu and dessert. I really have to thank Chef Yoji Harada for serving us each piece of nigiri one by one. He hopped onto a stepping stool and reached over the counter and planted all  pieces of Nigiri onto our plate, one by one with a smile and an introduction of each piece. I really appreciated that. Sorry, I only have pictures of some items from the tasting menu because once the nigiri came out. . . taking pictures was out of the question. Get in my belly already! Overall, the tasting menu really focused on the freshness of the fish and presentation. The entire restaurant has nice decor and noise level is loud. They have a separate bar area and they get packed! If you don't work in the area where you can go snag a table, I highly recommend making a reservation. Im looking forward to coming back to try their hot plates, yakitori, sake and cocktails! As for now, they earn  stars from me for such a great experience. Thanks again CHEF YOJI HARADA!

Dinner started out with drinks with one of their signature cocktails ""Fuzzy"" and a whiskey cocktail ""The Hidden Fortess""  The ""Fuzzy"" was refreshing, fizzy and just so tasty.  The whiskey drink had just too much whiskey. . .  Not my favorite. The menu had many choices and we opted to have some small plates, sushi and dessert.  Overall the food was excellent.  Here are my favorites and highly recommend: A Beef (Japanese Waygu)  Nigiri  expensive, but worth the bite.  Negitoro Roll (Bluefin Fatty Tuna)  Skirt Steak Robatayaki  small skewers which were so tender Monterey Squid Okonomiyaki  (pork belly, sunny side egg, bonito)   flavorful Pabu Chocolate (green tea white chocolate, plum & sake jam) dessert  to die for!The service was top notch. The servers were attentive and the food was brought out at the right pace.  Plates were cleared and water was re filled promptly. Will definitely be back to try other plates and sushi. Well, this is my second Michael Mina excursion, and, as with the first one, I wasn't paying. This place is *really* pricey. For that, you get great decor, excellent service, and a nice view (if you sit in the atrium). The food was great. It wasn't the BEST Japanese food I've had, but then I've been to Japan. It wasn't the best small plate Japanese food I've had in SF, and it wasn't the best sushi I've had in SF, but it was definitely up there. Still, though I sound like an ingrate, I was glad I went, and, like I said, the food was very good, but I doubt I'd be back unless it's on someone else's Amex. It was a special occasion and a night to celebrate. Colin M. took me out to celebrate and introduced me to a new girl, Pabu. Pabu is beautiful even by the most conservative standards. Her words of welcome are warm and personal, yet her eyes possess a dark lighting that suggests a more mysterious vibe. I know Pabu comes from the distinguished Michael Mina family so her expensive taste came as no surprise. What did come as a surprise was her sense of adventure. Despite being hailed as an upscale girl, Pabu enjoyed company with a more urban and chic company. Ramen Bar, her down to earth friend, seems to be always by her side. Throughout the night, Pabu impressed me time and again with her outlook on Japanese cuisine. She believed that fish should be fresh, and flown straight from Tokyo's very own Tsujiki Fish Market. Pabu's  actions spoke louder than words, and she presented plates of sushi that awed us all. The most memorable of all was the Snow Crab Sushi, with the top seared by a flame to bait out the enticing aroma. The smell pulled me in closer and closer, and I admired Pabu more and more. And our conversation had disagreements. Pabu had a vision for fusion cuisine that I couldn't follow. I believe too many additions complicates the dish and interferes with the fish. For instance, the cherry tomatoes on the Scallop were sweet and juicy, but it completely stole the spotlight from the scallop itself. Pabu insisted on it. Pabu also had ideas that never crossed my mind. A raw egg on top of an Okonomiyaki made the popular street food into an elegant dish. A plate of Japanese Wagyu served by the ounce alongside a personal mini hotpot. By the end of our night with Pabu, I felt enlightened as a food enthusiast. My experience with Pabu was nothing short of amazing. She was understanding, friendly, classy, and most of all, exciting. But alas, she was also expensive. Our meeting with Pabu reached beyond $, and that's after her manager Jason (thank you so much!) treated us to a few dishes of sushi and shots of a limited Sake. Thankfully, Colin M. picked up the tab. He is as generous as his taste is refined (check out his reviews). It was an amazing experience with Pabu. But as just a foodkid trying to make it in f. A. A. t city, I can't afford many of these extravagant outings. But when I finally do make it, you can bet I'll give Pabu a call. Thanks again, Colin M. , Jason, and Pabu! Opted for the omakase and added in couple extra courses. I would definitely say the strong point of the meal were the nigiris as the fish tends to go from lean to fatty. The shabu wasn't too memorable but was different as you get to cook up your own lil tasting. The dessert was a surprising winner. Carbonated sake, peaches, and shiso is a happy marriage. The cocktails and sake were a pleasant touch to the meal. Place was packed all evening but waiters and staff were attentive. terrible phone person. we had  reservations for an event a month away. first, she cant' find the reservation. then she cancels the wrong reservation. guess they have ""Hard Water"" and ""Pabu"" on the same system. big difference in names and Pabu is apt name for the the staff we've been dealing with.  such a pain, we'll just go to Ozumo. We read an article in our hotel about how this was ""traditional"" and the chef would demand no soy sauce, etc.  BS!!  The sushi came out without any brush of sauce, rice was undercooked and soy sauce had to be used.  SO Overated!!  Pluses were nice server, and great sake menu.  Otherwise the sushi was way weak.  IF IF IF we ever went back it would only be for the sake. Pabu is the latest restaurant in the Michael Mina Menagerie, focusing on Japanese food in a more Izakaya (small plates) style. It has a little bit of everything in current Japanese food trends in America. The place is very large and in  main sections. The front room is a spacious bar with high glass ceilings, large triangular bar, with modern style tall chairs, surrounded on  sides with red cushioned booths. The middle section has the main dining room with natural wood decor. Their are booths on the left, tables in the center, and a long sushi bar on the right. The ceiling is not as high, but still more than most, accentuating the airy feel and noise, sacrificing any intimate coziness. There are a couple of private rooms in the rear for groups of about  to  each. The rear section is almost completely separate, with a more casual feel and features a Ramen bar. At Pabu you can sample on some small plates Izakaya style, with both hot and cold selections, on plates or yakitori type skewers. The selection isn't as diverse as a true Izakaya, but has many favorites like chicken hearts, chopped cold octopus, and full grilled squid, and a few twists on some of these Izakaya staples a la Mina. Or you can choose sushi, mostly in classic Nigiri style at the sushi bar or on a plate at your table. They do have a few rolls for those who think that yada yada rolls are sushi ( I won't tell Jiro you think so) or haven't acquired a taste for raw fish. The Nigiri can be served with rice with the standard  pieces per order, or sashimi with  pieces per order. Or you can go order ramen or even shabu shabu, although I didn't notice how the Shabu Shabu was cooked at the table or the bar, where you have the full menu. We sat at the bar with no wait on a busy Saturday night at :pm, and could have had another  people join us there. The tables were full, but not the sushi bar that night.  They do have some great creative drinks at the bar crafted by Carlo, who has crafted many a cocktail menu for Michael. They have a pretty extensive sake list and some Shochu selections, too. They have an impressive array of Japanese Whiskey and Single Malt Scotches, and specially crafted signature cocktails. I tried the Citrus, which is a refreshing Gin based drink, with grapefruit juice, specially flowered ice cubes (only enough for /night) and a fragrant lavender wasabi salt rim. We weren't super hungry, so we tried the Okonomiyaki ($, perhaps the best value), which was not traditional, but very delicious, with pork belly, sunnyside up egg, and Japanese tsukemono toppings. We also tried  kushiyaki (skewered) tastes: Tsukune (Chicken meatballs with a raw egg yolk dip, $) Butabara (fatty pork belly (there was little meat, almost all fat, $), and thin slices of Gyutan (beef tongue. , $). Actually, the tongue wasn't on a stick. we leave that to you tongue piercers. We also had an Ahi Poke appertizer ($), and for Nigiri sushi, Umimasu (Ocean Trout, $) and Aji (Spanish Mackerel, $). Drinks we had were a great Peat Single Malt, Caol Ila ($), Hendricks and Tonic ($), the Citrus ($), and a special concoction made by Carlo ($) which was sort of an aged Japanese Whiskey based Old Fashion. The food is good and drinks are good, too.  However, the prices are about double what you would pay at a sushi bar ($ $ for  Nigiri, $+ for more exotic), and maybe % more than an Izakaya in the suburbs. I didn't try the ramen nor Shabu Shabu and think I would choose specialty shops for those anyway. This place is huge, it has a celebrity chef and it is in the FiDi of DTSF, so you are paying for all that in addition to the actual food and service. They do have a very popular happy hour, perfect for being seen thru their large floor to ceiling front windows. But if you just want to walk in without a rezzie, the large bar has plenty of room on the weekends, with full menu. I would say this is a great afterwork FiDi crowd place for those on an expense account or making good bread at their start up, and a place to be seen in a chi chi sort of way. But what it has in airy atmosphere and modern sophistication and eclectic offerings, it trades away intimacy and a true Japanese crafted food feel. It strategically capitalizes on the Izakaya, Sushi and Ramen uptrends growing in popularity today, and serves them all in one place with the MM moniker, and has a great location. I would suggest it is better for a corporate meal or afterwork indulgence rather than an intimate date occasion, unless you just want to be seen from the outside looking in through the all glass facade. Pabu was very, very good.  We did the omakase tasting menu, which showcased a nice variety of dishes.  The ""happy spoon"" first course was a delicious and nice treat to start off the meal.  It was a nice mixture of textures and flavors.  The star of the evening, of course, was the nigiri sushi, of which there was plenty.  The sushi is served in what I called ""flights,"" a dish of four pieces that were in the same taste ""family. ""  It was a fun way to experience different pieces of fish and compare the differences of the ones in each flight.  I didn't love the shabu shabu.  I feel restaurant Michael Mina does a better job with that dish, and the broth wasn't that hot.  It was also weird sharing one pot amongst multiple people  you can't really keep track of what you put into the pot, or you wait your turn and it takes a while for everyone to enjoy.  Maybe give everyone their own pot?  I also didn't love the udon noodles brought at the end.  A nice idea, but they tasted almost like instant ramen noodles.  I love instant ramen, but it's not udon. Service was very good.  Our water was refilled often and we were checked on throughout the night, but not so much it was oppressive.  If you can sit in the booth that overlooks most of the restaurant near the private rooms, it's probably the best seat in the house.  The decor of the restaurant is also tasteful, modern and elegant. Food was okay. Service was spotty. Health Care surcharge for Michael Minna's empire. . . Really? Are you kidding? Michael Minna is so cheap he can't buy his hard workers health care? He has to gouge his customers. After spending a whopping $.  at Pabu, a nearly $.  Healthcare fee was tacked on. TACKY Michael!  For all of you others who don't want to give business to these cheap chefs click this link to see who else makes their customers pay for health care for their employees and themselves. sf. eater. com/archives/… The omakase was omg yummy! My friend and I came here on a Thursday night and sat by the sushi bar. The sushi chef was very nice and informative. I wanted to take pictures of my sushi and kept reminding myself after every bite but my mind and mouth were too busy savoring the delicious meal. Anywho, I only remembered to take a photo of my dessert. The dessert was also a really nice surprise. Loved it. Truly delightful experience. The shabu shabu was incredibly flavorful. The sushi was super fresh and the tempura mushrooms were out of this world. The service was impeccable. The atmosphere was contemporary and energetic and extremely comfortable. Well done! Wow! Just finished a fricken Awesome dinner!! Party of , we had our own little room and Nicole took very good care of us!! It was my brothers birthday and he likes his favorites so we knew the tasting menu wouldn't work so we just ordered lots of bites. The chicken thigh skewers were awesome. The black hawk fish melted in my mouth. The side spinach a delight. The summer saki beautiful and delish had . The decor and space is elegant , even the bathrooms have this great smelling cake batter smell inside and the hand soap was nice. Excellent customer service and excellent food! Thank you for a great night // What a scrumptious Michael Mina find this was that just opened in the Financial District. We visited with reservations when it was not even open for a full week, and we ate our hearts out! Food items we shared (that I can still remember) included their Happy Spoons, Monterey Squid Okonomiyaki, Cucumber and Octopus Salad, Braised Burdock Root, Pork Gyoza, Ahi Tuna Poke, Monk Fish Liver, Chicken Wings/Meatballs Skewers, and several of their Nigiri. Oh Lordy Lord, flavors tickled something divine that night, particularly the Octopus Salad. Loved the tuna poke and the skewers, too. Interesting variation on their okonomiyaki, but was completely worth being an adventurous foodie about. I certainly cannot forget to mention the Sake! We had two delicious recommendations on a cost conscious basis made for us by an expert working there, and they were passionately consumed as our night rolled out. The bottle I snapped a pic of was the second we tried: the Asahiyama Junmaishu. Fantastic. We even got to take a picture with Chef Ken Tominaga upon this occasion. Was very impressed. A wee bit CO$$TLY, but worth splurging on for extra special occasions  you'll simply know when the time is right! Everything was delicious! My friend has been telling me that this is her new cafeteria in the city ever since it opened, so I just had to see why. Having dined at quite a few of the Michael Mina restaurants before, I had high expectations coming here, only to find that they were met and exceeded! This is definitely my fav MM restaurant to date!To give a brief run down of what we ordered:+Happy Spoon: AMAZING! MUST GET!Had to get it modified as I'm allergic to oyster, but was still delicious none the less!+Ahi tuna poke: have eaten this pretty much everywhere but this was definitely one of the best ones! seasoned to perfection. +Monterey Squid Okonomiyaki: omg I don't know how they even invented this but I would eat this everyday if I could!!+Mushroom tempura: just as good as the one at RN!+Grilled squid+Skewers: MUST GET THE CHICKEN MEATBALLS! enough said :D+Salted Caramel Coffee jelly custard: I've never been a huge fan of custard but OM THIS IS SO GOOD YOU CAN'T COME HERE WITHOUT ORDERING IT!+Sake roll cake: yum =PDefinitely coming back to check out the happy hour and eventually the omakase menu. Love the ambiance, attentive service (may be a little slow for my liking), and delicious food! Good job Pabu! Hit and Miss. We enjoyed a bit of everything on the menu. The nigiri was ehh except for the uni which was spectacular. All in all I would return but it wouldn't be for the amazing food, more for the experience.  The experience was good, but not fantastic.  Hopefully that makes sense. . . If you are debating on going to Pabu you should go, just do not expect to be blown away. I have previously eaten at Michael Mina and RN and enjoyed them both immensely. So when I heard of Pabu's opening I was more than excited to try Michael Mina and Ken Tominaga's take on modern authentic Japanese cuisine. My reservations were made through OpenTable and we were seated almost immediately even though we were late (dat traffic doe). The first thing I notice when I walked through the door was the noise level, it was off the charts! Wouldn't recommend if you were planning to come here for a intimate romantic dinner, but luckily I was with family. We we're sat at one of the booths by the bar, it was super roomy and comfortable. I decided on the tasting menu with the Japanese A Waygu supplement for the shabu shabu, along with an order of Otoro sashimi and Okonomiyaki to share. The tasting meanu consisted of two courses appetizer like dishes (Happy Spoon & Kanpachi Kinpira Burdock) and four courses of nigiri. That's right, FOUR courses with four pieces each so I ate a total of SIXTEEN pieces of nigiri. Pretty awesome. One ""main course"" (Wagyu Shabu Shabu) and a dessert (Cherry Sorbet). My biggest complaint was the time between each course. The wait between each dish was far too long, especially for a tasting menu, and disrupted the momentum of our entire meal. It also didn't help that I was starving even before we started eating so I was understandably ""hangry"". The main course of the Shabu Shabu wasn't anything special although the presentation was cute. The Okonomiyaki was very nice, so I would recommend that. Each cut of fish for the nigiri courses was extremely fresh and absolutely exquisite (the Uni was the best I'd ever had). But overall, the prolonged wait between courses ruined the entire night for me and my stomach. It's obvious that Pabu is still working out some kinks with it's timing and service since they only opened a month ago, but so far, my experience at Pabu did not live up to my expectation. / would recommend to friend to wait a few months before trying in hopes of Pabu finding its appropriate rhythm. Happy spoon, squid okonomiyaki, sake steamed clams were the best. the sake and whiskey cocktails were very good. Ordered a bunch of stuff with  other lovely girls, everything tasted very good, with an elegant presentation. Sure it is pricey, very pricey, but you're paying for the ambience and the location. Nothing you can't get at a good local japanese place, but they all tasted very good and authentic. It reminds me of Hakkasan, if you ordered the right stuff, it could be an amazing experience, on the pricey side. If anyone can rate Pabu more than a  star, then he/she probably has never had better. In a place like San Francisco, where great food is on almost every corner, Pabu just has no place here. There are so many other better places for good sushi. The only thing Pabu has going for them is their swanky decor, location and the Michael Minna brand swindling tourists through the doors. If I could sum up the food, it would simply be ""dog shit"" and you're better off having sushi from the local supermarket sushi aisle. I spent $ for  people and so I tasted a wide enough spectrum of what they had to offer. What I remember from my experience:* Spoon of happiness tasted gritty, sauces were too salty & overwhelming and mine came with a shard of shell. * Pork belly was like chewing rubber and was too dry and again too salty* The sauces to the scallops were way too sweet, which was followed by an extremely acidic and sour aftertaste* Chawanmushi was cold and too salty* All of the nigiri we ordered arrived with rice that was too cold, hard and most of the fish, esp the otoro tasted fishy* Broth to cook the wagyu was tasteless, thankfully they didn't botch the wagyu meat itself which was acceptable quality* They took over an hour to bring our sushi out. That, however, allowed us to meet the interesting whiskey specialist from the bar who impressed with his knowledge of Japanese whiskey and his service. That was probably the only positive from my experience at PabuTo give more context around my personal sushi preferences, I rank these other sf places very highly:* Akiko's* Wako* Kusakabi* SaruSo, if you think these places were delightful, then there's no way you would bother with Pabu. .  stars. Got here an hour before our reservation and they didn't mind seating us early. Decor was upscale modern Japanese, very nice. Got the piece omakase tasting menu. The timing was on point, pcs of nigiri was a bit much, would have preferred some cooked meats. Ended with a shabu style w/ waygu. The final dessert course was peaches with carbonated sake.  Service was great, nigiri and shabu was good but nothing special. Didn't care for the dessert at all. For all the sushi options in SF, probably won't be back cause of the price. great atmosphere, decor, and service. But most importantly amazing food. Highlights:Bloomsdale SpinachYuzu KanpachiMonterey Squid OkonomiyakiIt is on the pricey side but you get what you pay for. This is a very solid addition to the SF Japanese cuisine scene. I had a great omakase experience here and their sake list is nothing short of spectacular. It is a great place for a large group or a private party as well as it has a very lively izakaya like atmosphere. My only knock on the place is that they are trying to do so many different Japanese cuisine specialties (sushi, robata, okonomiyaki, shabu shabu, etc) that it is difficult to excel at all of them. That said, I love the place and will be back. I could eat the Monterey Squid Okonomiyaki every single day for the rest of my life. Everything we tried was delicious. Can't wait to go back!! Favorite new sushi spot in SF!! Word on Yelp is that it's quite difficult to get a reservation here so I consider myself quite lucky to score a reservation in their lovely private dining room. Our lovely waiter, Nicole, made sure we were aware of all the most popular cocktails and menu items. While the cocktails looked incredible we were in the mood for a little bubbly so ordered a bottle of that instead. As for our apps and entrees we ordered a variety of sushi and regular menu items. While the sushi was so fresh and tasty I think my absolute favorite eats were the octopus and mushroom tempura. So good!  We were stuffed and said no to dessert, but Nicole didn't take no for an answer and brought one of everything to our table. Omgoodness! And of course somehow we found room for all the deliciousness. I'm back in SF next month so I better book my reservation for Pabu now. Full disclosure: My friend and I tried Kusakabe before we tried Pabu and are definitely a bit biased by how overwhelmingly great our Kusakabe experience was. However, if you're charging the same price as Kusakabe ($ for the omakase and $ for the sake pairing) and serving raw fish as well, it's a well warranted comparison. Unfortunately we were left quite unimpressed after our dabble at Pabu. Aside from the modern, upscale ambiance and the friendly, personalized service, the food was simply not up to par. We ordered the omakase with the sake pairings. First and foremost, I'm not a sake drinker (love my grapes too much!) so I'm sure that biased my view on the pairings a bit. However, I didn't really feel a direct match between any of the items and the accompanied sake. Also, all of the sushi pieces that we received, both sashimi and nigiri, were good but not great. They were decent if priced at $ for the entire omakase. But at $, there is a certain standard of excellence that these items completely lacked. There was no attention to detail when it came to freshness and flavor  quite disappointing. Same with the shabu  good but not great. Very mediocre and parallels some of the significantly more reasonably priced ones I've had at shabu spots in the valley. And last but not least, don't expect to be full from the omakase. My friend and I were still bit hungry afterwards  hungry and tipsy to be specific. If you're going to spend a sizable amount to have a one of a kind sushi dining experience, you would expect each item to be refined and perfectly curated. Pabu, however, loses major points there. So if you're looking for an upscale omakase dining experience, check out the significantly better Kusakabe (also in Fidi). Happy Eating, Yelpers! We had heard that this new place was going to be great considering the roots of the chef. We were very impressed with the space, the bar and the selections of saki and shoji and whiskey were outstanding! The staff was very attentive and well educated about all the dishes. We decided to try the tasting menu thinking that would be the best way to sample the cross selection of the creativity of the chef. Unfortunately we were badly disappointed. The menu items were uninspiring and very repetitive. It basically  was a long drawn out menu of a bunch of sushi pieces prepared similarly. Nothing to inventive with each piece of sushi and the the worst part was the quality of the sushi was very poor including the uni which was old and tasteless. Fresh uni should be bright in color and almost sweet to the taste. It would have been nice to throw in some grilled dish  or a hamachi cheek for variety in the tasting menu. Overall very average and considering the steep price, not a good value. When someone asks ""Where's good sushi in San Francisco?"", the answer is quite simple: PabuSure they're new, but this Michael Mina dining establishment sure knows how to roll out the red carpet for a group of  hungry ladies at the last minute. THANK YOU to Anthony, Nicole and the entire team for accommodating at the last minute. We came hungry and ordered several app/entrees and were treated to quite a few extras. Here's a quick rundown:+ Ahi Tuna Poke+ Bloomsdale Spinach+ Seaweed Salad+ Edamame+ Grilled Squid+ Maitake Mushroom Tempura+ Chicken Meatballs+ Miso Black CodPlus a variety of sushi rolls that I didn't even sample because I fell in love with a new dish on the menu: Udon with fresh crab. Rarely do I finish an entire plate of food when dining out (hey, it's all about portion control) but this dish was perfectly balanced and I sucked it down within minutes. If you love uni, this is *the* dinner plate for you. I would eat it again for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Just when we thought it couldn't get much better, desserts came out. . . A little gift from the kitchen since we were celebrating a special occasion. Soy Caramel Custard, Sake Roll Cake, and PABU Chocolate were all yummy, but my heart belongs to the Cherry Sorbet. The sparkling sake really makes the dish shine. Thank you again to the Michael Mina team for serving our group on a Sunday night. The private dining room was exceptional, perfect for a special night in San Francisco. Can't wait to go back! After having a fantastic experience at RN , I was very excited to try Mina's latest endeavor, and it definitely exceeded expectations.  I went to Pabu with several friends for cocktails and dessert.  Overall, everything we had was very creative and played on your taste buds, waking them up from the dull day to day. Our cocktail waitress was also very knowledgeable and attentive.  My cocktail, the ""citrus"" was not only well balanced (acidity vs sweetness) but was also presented with artistic flare. The long rectangular ice cube was infused with some sort of flower and one side of the rim was dipped in lavender wasabi salt. I loved that only half of the rim was covered, as that way, I could choose how much, if any, salt i wanted with each sip. My husband ordered the ""tree"" cocktail, which I cannot describe well enough to give it justice. . . you just have to try it. Spicy, creamy, tangy, so many flavors all at once, and it works! We got two desserts for the table to share. Both were literally a party in our mouths! Mina has elevated the physical experience of eating with these treats. The Soy Caramel Custard with coffee jelly and sesame candy was the perfect blend of textures, and the Cherry Sorbet with peaches came to life as the generous serving of sparkling sake was poured over top. I left Pabu so excited to return; I want to enjoy the full dinner experience and lunch as well! According to our waitress the restaurant will be open for lunch at the end of the month. Nice Japanese spot, with small and large plates, grilled items, and sushi.  Cocktails are really excellent, think Beretta or the like.  Weekday dinner felt populated with corp types, and the conversation at the table next to us was soul sucking.  But the food and service was great, highly recommended.  The ramen bar next door is connected and looks excellent. To be fair, this place should be .  stars. Pabu seemed great on paper, but was mediocre with its execution. Felt contrived, almost. Service was good. We came on a busy Friday night and we were seated shortly after arriving. The waitress would disappear for long periods of time, but again, busy Friday night. They explained each dish as presented, so there was that. Water cup was also refilled pretty frequently. The food was tasty but nothing great. I wasn't blown away by anything in particular and nothing really stood out. The Happy Spoon was probably the best of what we ordered with the dessert coming a close second. The grilled squid was good, but Ippuku in Berkeley makes it much, much better. The pork belly shouldn't even be on the menu. I love me some pork belly but I've had better coming out of food trucks. Ordered:Happy SpoonMonterey Squid OkonomiyakiGrilled SquidBeef Tongue skewerTender Kurobata Pork BellyMiso Black CodSoy caramel CustardAmbiance was typical Friday night Financial District. 'Nuff said. I probably wouldn't return unless for Happy Hour. The drinks were good and the bar area lively. Go here to be seen, but NOT for the food. Unfortunately it was mediocre at best. My husband and I had high hopes since we read several articles on Pabu prior to going. It didn't meet our expectations. Dishes we ordered: Oysters  had a fishy taste. should I not have ordered it since it was on a Sunday? Kinpira burdock  tasty but nothing special Summer chawanmushi  lesson learned. seafood chawanmushi is best when hot Grilled squid   stars for this dish  Beef tongue  decent Ordered every Nigiri you can imagine  Trout sushi was excellent! however, sad to say all else was super disappointing. O toro, uni, tamago especially were sad. I'm surprised that both hot food and sushi were mediocre. From my experience, restaurants like these can execute at least one aspect of their food very well. Pros: Service was good  professional, attentive and pleasant Interior decor was very niceSadly, I will not be going back. PABU is definitely a breath of fresh air in SF.  This place is what I've been waiting for and it DID NOT disappoint.  I had the pleasure of dining at PABU  times since it was opened in July.  Each time was a different  and wonderful experience, and every time, I discovered something new and amazing.  FoodIt's the freshest, most exquisite, and innovative.  It's hard to describe, but easier to say that everything I'd tried was wonderfully indescribable.    Cocktails Elegant, creative and refreshing with the best Sake list in the city.  PABU's sake sommelier was extremely knowledgable  and help us find the best sakes to pair with our foods.  ServiceJust one word. . . . Impeccable!Will I be back?  Again, again and again. . . . This is a solid  star establishment. I came here on a Wednesday night with a girlfriend from out of town and we were seated immediately (with a reservation). Our server was spectacular, offering tastings off of the sake menu before we ordered a carafe and giving us plenty of time and recommendations on the menu items.  The variety of items that we ordered were brought out in  different ""courses"", which allowed for a very relaxed and smoothly flowing meal.  I do think that the tables are a bit crowded if you plan to order drinks/multiple food items but I know that space is a premium.  Food: Seaweed salad and the edamame  to start (just to get some greens) and the seaweed salad had a pleasantly sweet note to it.  Pork belly robatayaki, which was as indulgent as you would expect.  I wish there was a bit more of a char on my piece as it was a bit gummy, but my GF had a perfectly grilled skewer. At a place like this thought I was expecting that to be executed perfectly.  Pork Gyoza were delicious and presented beautifully.   Grilled Squid was not what i was expecting at all (large squid grilled and then sliced as is) but was fantastic! Our waiter tipped us off that the spice in the containers to the side of the table went fabulously with the squid when dipped in sauce (I opted for soy because I don't care where you are, mayo is nasty).  Nigiri sampler the fish was cut way too thin for the price and the establishment.  The taste was fresh, but it was almost overwhelmed by the rice/fish ratio.  Next time I would opt for the sashimi and hope it was more generously plated. As a side note, when we were seated we were very confused because we were given two set menu options (one that looked much better than the other) and is reserved for large groups.  So if you come in a larger group definitely check that out.  I dont think the smaller party option was worth it, which is why we opted out. Overall, the experience was wonderful and the food was very solid.  This place will thrive with all the businesses located nearby and that was definitely the vibe that you got. I would love to come back for happy hour and check that out! Good location for FiDi peeps.  Nice happy hour menu (food/drinks  pm ). Reasonable pricing on the HH menu as well. Place is big with bar at the center, with tables around the perimeter. Outdoor/patio seating as well.  I had the pork bun and the tokyo fried chicken (aka Karaage). Both were delicious though the bun was less like a bun and more like a mini taco (with the doughy breading).  Would definitely come back for a dinner! Pabu is a standout among upscale Japanese restaurants in SF. Food is excellent, service is superb, design is traditional yet chic, and ambiance is lively. It feels like a top notch Vegas restaurant. Food wise, they do sushi, yakkitori, and hot foods like Shabu (pretty much the full breadth of Japanese cuisine). You'd think it means they couldn't do any one thing well but everything we had was excellent. The sushi bar head chef, Yoji, prepared the fluke, ocean trout, tuna, prawn, and tomago for us. All fresh and well prepared. No wasabi on the side here as they clearly think they know how to prepare your nigiri. The grilled squid was mind blowing. I never had squid that well done. The okonomiyaki is out of this world excellent. It's a squid pancake appetizer. The happy spoon was good though maybe a tad too creamy. The chicken thigh yakkitori was juiced and tasty, better than I've ever had in NYC or SF. The seafood Shabu Shabu for two is excellent. You'll savor every bite. The sake soaked cake dessert is also great. Cocktails are excellent here. They also have the largest Japanese whisky menu I've ever seen. I definitely will be coming back here. It's certainly pricey but I couldn't find anything I was disappointed by. Food  So we were in the SF downtown area on a Friday night looking for a place to eat. Was going to go to our default Barbacco, but decided to try something new in the area. My wife said this is a new restaurant opened by Michael Mina, so we decided to look at the menu. The prices weren't terrible for something downtown, but we wondered what the quality was like. So rating what we ate:Gyoza  Thick skin, filling was ok, nothing special.  Taste was there execution was meh. Grilled Ika  Default Standard. Was good definitely on Par. Hyakshou Greens  Very fresh very good. Top notch vegetable quality well done. Tempura Set Dinner  Terrible, / of the corn tempura was uncooked. Raw batterChicken Karaage  Very good, good taste good fry on it, excellent sauce. Spider Roll  Service forgot it. Roll Cake  Sub par. Sponge was dry and the filling not great. Comp'ed Coffee Jelly Caramel  AMAZING!Service  So as you read the above, they forgot our Spider Roll and Collected our plates. When we told them they were very apologetic and gave us a free desert for the error. Both the maitre d' and the server apologized, admitted the mistake, and took care of things quickly. They took off the Tempura set dinner as well. So service although not polished, I give A+ to accountability, which is rare in a lot of places these days. Ambiance Definitely business casual and a great looking crowd. Closer to people in their late 's or 's. It can get crowded so a bit loud at times, but definitely very nice. Bonus My wife tried the Lunch Ramen which is lined up around the block during lunch time. Don't bother, very sub par. Great food, ambience, service and pricing. ) The happy spoon appetizer, ken's roll, pork belly skewers, sake dessert,  and Japanese paired whiskey/sake cocktails (Summer) were delicious. Simple to eat, and not too heavy) Good location and open ambience inside. Not overdone either) Service is quick, great suggestions) Went in expecting over the top pricing considering its Michael Mina + sushi, but didn't feel the pinch too much. Pricing felt right for quality and service. Definitely go again, especially for the happy hour. I visited Pabu a few days ago, and found the place a little below my expectation.  Service was great, our server was attentive, great smile, and really know the dishes, and drinks.  I had one cocktail, and it was well made.  The interior was nicely done as well (the only problem was with the booth, which made it very difficult for the server to take care of the customer who sits at the end, but it's the same problem with any booth in any restuarant. )The food is where I feel a little disappointed.  Everything tasted great, just not extraordinary enough to be memorable.  We had a few appetizers.  Scallops with strawberry sauce, kampachi, tofu with matcha, clams in sake, and a couple others.  The best part was the clam in sake, which is really not something I never have before.  The grilled items were good, a bit salty for me, and good in general. The biggest let down was the sushi.  I had a few rolls, and they were just the same as what you get anywhere else.  I found the rice was pressed together a bit too hard, making the rice sticked together too much.  I'm sure the nigrini would have been much better, unfortunately, the friends ordered the rolls.  Shabu was ok.  The noodle offered afterwards was nice, but the use of sesame sauce overpowered the flavor of the brooth a bit. I like this place, but I expect it to be much much more given the predigree of the chefs. New, modern, quality grade sushi.  The wait staff were knowledgeable with every drink on the menu.  My friend loved the whisky sitting on a ball of ice.  I fully endorse. Came here for my birthday dinner with my brother and sister in lawWe decided to give the Omakase a shot and see where that takes us. ProsA good solid variety of nigiri Snowcrab leg was amazing (melt in your mouth goodness)Skewers were solid, well seasoned and tender ConsRice was inconsistent across each course (from undercooked to mushy) Cut of fish was too thinFlavors of fish were rather lackluster Too nigiri focused (would have enjoyed a more robust wide range of options such as sashimi, hot items from kitchen and grilled skewers)Shabu broth lacked depth and felt one noteDrinks were great and the bar area is quite amazing Waitress was fine, the busers were on top of their game, maybe a little too eager to clear the table but since we were doing omakase timing was key so I understand why they were that wayOverall ThoughtsIMO, skip omakase/nigiri and stick with the hot items/skewers. Definitely a great ambiance to have HH while sipping on truly well made craft cocktails Best experience ever! Food was delicious and the service was excellent! Good job guys! Can't complain about the free sake and sashimi Four of us came here for dinner on  Monday night The atmosphere was lively. We opted for the omakase menu with the waygu addition. The omakase was beautiful and delicious, but it left us feeling unsatisfied.  The Waygu addition was not worth it two small pieces of beef to be cooked in a small shabu pot. We ended up getting a couple more cooked appetizers to supplement the menu. For the price tag, I wouldn't do the Omakase again. Instead, I'd opt for trying a combination of sushi and cooked items off their regular menu. Took a foodie friend here for his th birthday. AMBIENCEJapanese pub milieu  wood beams, shoji screens, two bars (one for drinking and one for sushi) prominent, beautiful cherry blossom tree painted on the wall  but better because of the open space/high ceilings. Comparable restaurants in Japan are tighter/lower to the ground and encourage bowing. This restaurant instead draws you upwards, to stand tall and enjoy the height/views of the room and, more importantly, the aromas of the food. Sat in a comfy booth with good looking, very light green cushions. Bar area is more hip dark gray with booths that allow you to see the full actions. On a Tuesday night, restaurant was packed and energy was palpable. FOODWe had the omakase menu with Wagyu shabu shabu finale and sake pairing. Started with the Happy Spoon. Nice complement of flavors with a ponzu creme fraiche in particular adding a richer taste to the mouthful without overpowering the oyster. Next I think was a trio of Kanpachi which featured a small piece of deep fried shallot on top and some delish sauce with a bit of spicy oil in it.  Loved the texture the fried shallot added.  My British friend who is a utensil nazi was appalled that I used my finger to wipe up a bit of leftover sauce into my mouth, but chopsticks weren't going to cut it and licking it was below even my vulgar standards. Upon further reflection however, he broke down and did the same. We then had three plates with four pieces of sushi each. Every piece of fish/seafood was excellent, fresh, melt in your mouth. The chef dressed each one with a range of treatments (ponzu to negi to sesame to lemon/salt, etc). One of my new food habits is to focus on the food I am eating. I mean really focus  even closing my eyes sometimes. In my hectic life, I have recently noticed that, at times, I have finished a meal without even tasting it. So odd. This sushi is definitely something to savor. In fact, the most startling observation I shared with my friend was that I had actually checked my swallowing instinct several times because I wanted to chew the food longer in my mouth to enjoy it more fully. I'm pretty sure that's a first for me. Can't quite detail all the fish and treatment combinations, but I did flashbulb the awesome King Salmon because the Maillard reaction from super slight searing just killed me as well as the hotate (so sweet and creamy) and crab (melted). FYI, I'm not a huge fan of mirugai or amaebi, but both were as good as I have had. We then had the Wagyu shabu shabu with two sauces, ponzu and a sesame based one. Three delectable pieces. Also helped that sesame happens to be one of my favorite flavors. Nevertheless, tender and tasty. Finished off with a cherry sorbet and peaches dessert with a sparkling sake pour over. It really delivered an effervescent fruit hit that you tasted olfactorily. It came with some delicately ground almonds, but I think I actually enjoyed the bites without the almonds a bit more. SAKEWanted to put a special call out to Stuart Morris, the sake sommelier.  Sake is not usually my thing  I tend to be more ghetto, drinking beer with my sushi  but I am really glad we did the sake pairing.  For the first time, I really connected with the sake varietals  from fruity to yeasty to soft to warm  and how they complemented each dish. Heard a nice vignette from Stuart about how he became just the sixth foreigner to pass the Sake Master test. Real boon to Pabu. At the end of the meal we agreed that we will have to bring our wives sometime soon to moderate their Pabu envy. I am looking forward to exploring the other parts of the menu next time. Made a reservation for  on a Saturday night, got sat in the lounge in their beautiful new bar. We basically ordered everything shared starting with the Happy Spoon, which is pretty much a Pabu tradition now. We ordered anything that was out of the ordinary. The karagi, okonomiyaki, chawanmushi, as well as their signature ""Ken's roll"" and ""chef Michael"" dishes. Enjoyed their desserts, though a little simple compared to RN's & Bourbon Steak's. (It's the same as at The Ramen Bar next door)My friend noticed how the staff's vibe was very hospitable, and that was just on his way to the bathroom. He felt appreciated being there as a guest. Our Server, Syd, was no exception. Perfect presence. The lowlights were the under seasoned tempura maitake and a Food Runner who did not know his spiel, as well as some others rushing through their speils dropping off the plates. We were very interested to hear about the food, but I was always able to ask Syd, who always knew what was what. Empty glasses could've been noticed a little faster and less of a lull from order to table. Great energy in the place and I can't wait to take my parents to try it! Incredible food, solid cocktails, and amazing service! Had a phenomenal time here with a bunch of girlfriends but not going to bore you with the details. Undoubtedly the freshest & best selection of sushi & robata I've had in a long time, lots of sake to choose from, and our server was very sweet and genuine. At the end of the night, we were full bellied happy clams. Had dinner here on Saturday night in the lounge area. Overall, really enjoyed the meal. We had the Happy Spoon appetizer, which was pretty good. For sushi, we had Ken's roll. The spicy tuna on top was amazing!For dinner, we had the meatball skewers that had an egg yolk with seasoning to dip it in. It was really interesting and yummy. The best part of the meal was the A steak! A bit overpriced at $/ounce, but super tender and flavorful!Dessert was delicious as well. We had the soy caramel custard with coffee jello. It was so different and the custard was so rich and creamy!I definitely want to come back for happy hour! Eh So So nothing special. Last Saturday went to the restaurant for dinner. I ordered the Omakase. It was $ for  pieces. Here is the problem. . . the fish was from good cuts BUT it was so thinly cut that I could not taste and appreciate those cuts. The fish should be king in sushi. Very disappointed. I would have been happy with  instead of  but give me some thick cuts of fish where I can appreciate what I'm eating. Don't think I will be coming back. This is San Francisco, I can list a good number of great sushi places that are traditional Japanese and delicious.  Skip this one for now. If I were the Hulk I would have ran down Market street crushing cars after spending $ plus eating here. Came here / early (:) so we decided to grab their Happy Hour special, but after  minutes of waiting, there were no servers in sight, and Happy Hour ends at pm. Finally after flagging down a server at the bar, they took our order and said they would deliver it to our table. After being seated our main server only gave us one menu, and we had to ask her about the sushi menu before she finally brought it out. We ordered the following:Happy Spoon Oyster: Tasted very plain with the uni drenched in what tasted like a plain milk rather than a crème fraîche, very lacklusterOysters: Good, but very tiny for the $.  each price. Better bang for your buck at Woodhouse's $ Tuesday oyster specialMonterey Squid Okonomiyaki, Pork Belly, Sunny side Egg, Bonito: Tasted like hash browns with unagi sauce, though the egg was cooked well, I could barely taste the pork bellySpicy Tuna, Spicy Scallop, and Negi Hamachi Handrolls: All good but not greatOcean Fois Gras: Which was just plain anikimo, very little flavor and a boring sunomonoAnd a roll that had uni, toro, and fish eggs: I forgot the name of this roll but it was $ and the best dish out of everything we hadAnd for dessert the coffee caramel jello pudding and green tea white chocolate: Both lackluster at $ eachSo why would I turn into the Hulk you ask since the food was just mediocre? It was our waitress who, though we were told they would bring the Happy Hour items to us since we ordered them in advance, gave us grief over one of the rolls. She only brought out  hand rolls ( I had  hand rolls and my friend had  hand rolls) and so when we inquired about the spicy scallop handroll, she pulled up the tag that the bar waitress wrote and said we didn't place an order for it. Here's the thing:IF we're lying (which we're not), why don't you just add the roll on anyway, isn't that what good service is all about? Why argue over a $ hand roll?IF we were telling the truth (which we were), then that means someone dropped the ball, so just add the handroll on and don't make a big deal about it. She continued to argue with us about this one handroll, since Happy Hour had past, so we just told her to forget about it. Thankfully, another waitress overheard and just brought it to us. Another thing that made me want to turn into the Hulk is that I paid $ for their Sencha tea, and wanted a refill. The waitress said that would be another $. So I told her to just give me hot water instead, to which she replied that she would have to charge me $ for a pot of hot water!?! Seriously?!? So after flagging down another waitress, I got my hot water. Everything with our waitress had to be a battle, and I didn't like her condescending tone such as ""well I like the desserts here,"" when I told her that we didn't like our desserts since the soy caramel tasted like a cheap pudding, and the macha white chocolate tasted like flavorless crouton squares mixed with a weird tasting white chocolate pudding. I didn't finish my dessert, and she knew this, and didn't offer to replace it or take it off of the bill. Then, AFTER we had finished our meal she brought out the Omakase tasting menu and told us that we could have ordered the $ Omakase that basically had what we ordered, but more stuff, and would be cheaper. Really?!? Just to rub it in. Why didn't she bring out the menu in the beginning? As a waitress, she did an extremely poor job in informing us, as well as serving us. Hence, I'm thankful that I don't turn into a large green Hulk monster when I'm angry, because goodness knows, this experience would have triggered it. A friend and I decided to check out Pabu's happy hour. Since they just opened and this was the first time we had been there, we had lots of questions. The staff was friendly and informative. Carlo the bartenda, Morgan our waitress, Giana and Marco the runners who brought the food all were very helpful. We decided to try some of the signature cocktails  the American Mammoth Jack and the Summer were really good, the Fuzzy was too bitter for my taste, but the presentation was fun. The food was all good, we had some handrolls, pork buns, fried chicken, and skewers and while we did enjoy them nothing really stood out, until we ordered the Bloomsdale spinach. We were both in love with the spinach, the sesame seeds and sweet dressing on it were amazing  we ordered a second serving it was so good. Since they are so new they are still working out some kinks, but overall we enjoyed our experience. Came here a couple days ago and had such a great time, the bar atmosphere was incredible and the dining room was buzzing with energy. Ordered Amberjack and Giant Clam sashimi which was plated beautifully and tasted so fresh. The grilled squid, okonomiyaki, beef tongue, spinach goma ae and Robata that followed the sashimi were equally delicious. Stuart the Master Sake Somm found the perfect carafe for me to go along with my dinner. I will definitely be back for more! Hello happy hour!Popped in to check out HH & weren't disappointed! The food is hands down delicious, the service is top notch & the Earth cocktail is total wow. The happy hour menu can be viewed on the website & the standouts were definitely the spicy tuna & scallop hand rolls(both were very mild & could have had some extra spice) which were incredibly fresh. The fried chicken was moist & delicious too. The pork bun & chicken skewers were good but not standout amazing. The happy spoon was wow. . & that's coming from someone who doesn't like oysters!The Earth cocktail was great too. Not a cheap HH @ $ later. . . granted we had  cocktails @ $ea. . . . but it was delicious all the same. The staff were all very polite & well versed with their eye contact which I must admit made us feel very welcomed. What an AMAZING experience. I've eaten dinner at Pabu  times ( social and  business) and I was so impressed with the consistency of excellent food, presentation, and service. The bar is a really fun atmosphere and great to go early so you can try their specialty drinks. The diversity of the menu is another key advantage of this restaurant. From the tasting menu to sushi to ridiculously good small and large plates. I highly recommend the: Madai sashimi Fried Chicken (didn't expect to see it on the menu and the two nights we had it, both groups thought it may be the best they've ever had) Miso Glazed Black Cod Wagyu beef and Lobster Negitoro roll (best roll I've ever had!)I can't wait to go again! Pabu far exceeded our expectations. Service was top notch. The cocktails were out of this world  I had the ""Summer"", sake with pickled strawberry juice and fresh squeezed lemon. . . omg! The MONTEREY SQUID OKONOMIYAKI with pork belly and sunny side egg was out of this world. And I could have had two extra orders of the PORK GYOZA. The desserts topped off an incredible meal. Pabu offers a dining experience you will not forget. Treat yourself! Crowd pleaser menu, outstanding ingredients, fully priced, served in a hellhole of a Financial District social venue. Nice to have a dinner capable restaurant open up on this block. Recommend very strongly for Happy Hour. Also recommend strongly for the private rooms, particularly for large corporate groups. Recommend against for regular dinner. Here's my dinner impression:+ Excellent ingredients (although, you know, ""from Tsukiji"" for sushi is a bit like saying ""from the New York Stock Exchange"" for equities)+ Preparation is fine. Nothing that really stood out. Expect many menu items built around crowd pleaser ingredients like miso & sweet soy glaze. + Big open space+ Generally attentive staff, they're working out the opening kinks nicely. + Hitachino Ale on tap. Have I seen that anywhere else? Big loud space, music and all Uncomfortable, close table positions with poor server flow Considering the above, rather preposterous pricing Sequencing is off. For our meal, a pan fried okonomiyaki dish showed up prior to completion of the raw items.  Also: Okonomiyaki? RLY? MJD? Yelp 生息の中国系アメリカ人もビックリ！I do think it's a great Happy Hour venue though:+ Surprisingly reasonable pricing for snacks and drinks, considering ingredient quality+ Big, open, loud, fun space. And the private room out back is a nice touch. Not too many options for group dinner venues like that. Treat for your eyes, not so much your mouth. Great place if you: ) want to impress your date or ) don't know what to do with your disposable income. Restaurant is spacious and designed beautifully. Service was on par with any other Michael Mina restaurant  superb and attentive. Most memorable of the evening were the Happy Spoon starter and cocktails. The octopus salad and rest of the tasting menu were anticlimactic. I would come again for the bar experience."
Pesce Seafood Bar|3.5|Seafood in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|171|-1|3.74045801527|" Is this San Francisco's best kept secret? Such a cute space along this famous stretch of Market into the Castro!As the name indicates, a great spot for fresh seafood tapas style.  Because the plates are relatively small, I would recommend a visit here as a precursor to a longer night.  We stopped by before going to the opera so the plates were the perfect size in order to avoid induced coma during the th act of La Boheme.  Bear in mind that this is not the place to go for a filling supper since   plates between two may not suffice but for those seeking a long and drawn out process supplanted with several bottles of wine, seek no more. We started off with the Butternut Squash soup drizzled with melted gorgonzola cheese ($).  This was the largest of our plates for the evening since it came in a wide soup bowl and filling.  A very savory and tasty soup, recommend this as a starter.  Our friends also ordered the Oyster shooters, which were tossed lightly with chopped lemon and cucumber and tossed lightly in a cocktail sauce + vodka mix.  Next was the Pumpkin Ravioli ( slightly larger than regular) arranged neatly and tossed lightly in a savory brown butter/amaretti drizzle.  We could only imagine what a full oprtion would do to one's psychosomatictendencies. The pan seared scallops were absolutely amazing.  They were buttery yet firm, and the thick cut mushrooms drizzled with a truffle cream brought out the flavor in the sauce. Lastly, we opted for the milk braised pork + pancetta topping mini gnocchi.  Being the major carnivore, I took delight in this since the pork had taken on an almost creamy/carnitas texture with flavor.  I am going to attempt the milk braised approach next time as an experiment.  Our friends ordered the Branzino (a type of sea bass) but for the portion (think a large trout) and manner it was done ($) roasted plain with a smattering of fresh herbs, I would have opted for the Sole w/potatoes or the lobster topped pasta.  In all, a very pleasant experience and the trendy modern environment made it even more enjoyable.  Add in great table service and an attentive staff, what more could people want for a busy Saturday evening?Get read to sit back, relax, and order away. I went to Pesce a few weeks ago with a friend and the whole experience was wonderful.  Our server, who was from Rome, had recommended a few appetizers to start. We had the Dungeness crab and smoked salmon, both were so fresh and delicious.  I am usually very particular about wines I drink and I can only describe what I like, which is a lighter pinot noir.  Our server had recommended an amazing bottle of Gamay which will now be a new favorite for us!  We had the Lobster spaghetti as a main course which we both loved.  Overall the whole meal was very tasty, the service was friendly, the space was vibrant and upbeat.  We will definitely be returning to Pesce again soon. I've eaten at this Pesce before. It's not a place you will want to go and have an conversation as it can be a very noisy and loud, but the booths are tall and are much quieter.  So for a special occasion for two, I rang the restaurant more than a week in advance to make a reservation for two. I specifically asked for a booth. I was told that a booth was for four, but since you're making a reservation early (: pm) that it would not be a problem. I indicated that this is a special occasion and if a booth cannot be reserved then I do not want to make a reservation. I was told it would not be a problem. The date of the reservation arrives and we arrive on time if not  minutes early. We are greeted with smiles by  people ( women and a guy) and our reservation is confirmed. As the guy takes us to be seated it's not at a booth. My partner and I let him know that we reserved a booth. He tells us the booth is for four. We tell him that we confirmed a booth. He proceeds to tell us we have to understand his position. This is a first for me that I, a customer, have to understand that I was told a booth would be reserved and then it changes. If for some reason there was not a booth available I would not be happy and would want to know how this happened but there was a booth and I have to understand; as a customer I'm not sure what it is I have to understand in this situation. Well after a quick chat with my partner we decided not to stay as we wanted the quieter booth for our special occasion. Further, they did not even try to accommodate or have us stay. I'd like to also add that I work for one of the largest employers in the City and I internally post about my ordeal with Pesce. I strongly recommended not to do business with this restaurant. I received a lot of responses that the restaurant will not be used for business or personally. Further I told many friends who live in the neighborhood of my ordeal and at least two have canceled their reservations and others said they will not eat their. So it looks like the restaurant is short sighted because of this ordeal it has lost quite a bit of businessAs for the rest of you I would strongly not recommend Pesce. Love the new location. Lots of space, great modern decor, acceptable noise level. Came with a group on a Saturday night. We had reservations but I was suprised to see so many empty tables.  Waitstaff was helpful and friendly. I think the restaurant is a bit more upscale than  (the restaurant here that I really liked but closed), but not stuffy or snooty at all. Food was excellent!  Highlights are: Dungeness crab tower: super light and fresh tasting, small portion though Braised octupus: yum! great for sharing.  Lobster spaghetti: perfectly al dente pasta with great lobster flavor. bigger portion than I expected.  Baked eggplant: huge portion, tasted like it was stuffed with meat but in reviewing the menu I think it's just stuffed with veggies. anyway delicious and filling. Overall it was a scrumptious but pricy experience. I would come back for small group dinners. There were six of us and we asked for a quiet table and were given that, there is a small room in the back of the restaurant and it is much quieter there.  The cocktails were fabulous, the appetizers sensational and every one of our entrees was a huge success.  We will return a. s. a. p. For a high end restaurant it should deliver high end tasting foods.  I've never been to the Russian Hill Pesce so my rating is completely unbiased.  All I can say is BLAH. There honestly wasnt even one single dish I liked and we've ordered quite a few, and bill was high. Guess I won't be coming back.  The only reason I didnt give it two stars was the decor. Food: .  starsPrice  starsDecor: Service .  Late review but felt this place deserved  stars for all around awesomeness!! Went here with my boo on our  year anniversary. Service, food, drinks and ambiance were all great! We will beck again and again!! Thanks for a great dinner experience! Best meal I've had in quite some time. Amazing fresh seafood. Recommend the scallops, lobster spaghetti, eggplant, paparedelle and pinkies bread. Came here to meet a friend I hadn't seen since high school. Since she lives in San Fransisco (I was visiting from New York) she selected the spot. Everyone there was friendly and amicable. The bartender was super nice and very attentive. When everyone arrived (she invited a friend) and I took my husband we sat down and ordered. We ordered some calamari, a kale salad and avocado salad to share. Everything was fresh, tasty and rich tasting. We then ordered the lobster spaghetti and a fish for the table. Again very rich and full of flavor. And it was just the right amount of food for four people. Because the waiter knew it was a high school reunion of sorts he gave us a complimentary bowl of ice cream with sweet bread for the table. Would love to come back again. Four of us split  small plates,  desserts, a round of wine. It was $ with tax and tip. Part of what we ordered: dungeness crab tower, avocado, cucumber, tomato pan seared diver scallops, mushrooms, truffle cream baked eggplant, vegetables, tomato, ricotta cheese pizzetta, field mushrooms, panna, parmesan POACHED PEAR with vanilla ice creamEverything was divine! Wonderful dinner, great service. Beautiful, casual location with awesome service. I would highly recommend it.  Drinks are tasty and creative. I was pretty disappointed with a recent meal I had at Pesce. My friend and I were looking for a place to grab dinner near Market and Church, this place had an opening and we were seated quite quickly. We both ordered seafood pasta dishes, shared a bit, and were mutually disappointed with both. In my case (squid ink pasta), I was disappointed with the quantity and flavor of the calamari, found the drink to be particularly bland. Price points were in the teens for either dish. The bar selection was decent, we were both impressed with the old fashions we ordered. Overall, I wouldn't recommend going back, the food was a bit unimpressive, and there are definitely better options for the buck nearby. Had a nice time here at this restaurant.  For one you MUST have reservations NO EXCEPTIONS!  We sat in the bar section and ate there.  It's a really cute restaurant with a lot of atmosphere.  As for the food in my opinion,  everything is a la carte and in tiny portions unless you order the big fish.  This was a deal breaker for me.  The size was appetizer size of main course items.  What I got was really tasty.  That's why I gave  stars.  Also, their wines even though I didn't know them, I still tried a couple and to my surprised  they were very good quality.  Over all, I liked it but I wasn't impressed by their service and their size of food portions.  Not sure if I'll go back. I don't understand why this isn't rated higher. Love this place. Had pizetta, eggplant, and scallops, all were excellent. Service was excellent. Will be back! We loved Pesce!  Having dined often at its predecessor in the space, Restaurant , our expectations were not high.   was always reliable, but had grown stale and boring, and we expected a simple rehash of the old venue. Wrong!  The interior had been beautifully redone, down to the smallest detail, and is now reminiscent of a grand European café, the sort that encourages you to linger comfortably for hours, drinking wine, talking and savoring wonderful food. Service was spot on.  Our table for  was waiting when we arrived early for our reservation.  The server was attentive, but we never felt rushed, and he was very knowledgeable about both the food and wine, without seeming the slightest bit pretentious. The small plates format is great for ""family style"" dining and every dish we ordered was delicious and beautifully presented  The stand out was the mixed seafood grill, (they had a fancy name for it, that I can't recall), but all the dishes were great.  The entire meal reminded me of times spent in places like Santorini or Sitges.  It wasn't particularly expensive either. The menu can be a bit confusing, especially if you're not accustomed to a small plate style, and I do wish they had a few ""bar items"" that we could have noshed on while waiting for the rest of our party or, if there were some good choices for that sort of thing, that the server had suggested them.  Other than that minor suggestion, it was a perfect evening. One of my favorite meals in San Francisco! Small plates of seafood and other dishes prepared in the Italian style. This place was unexpected: the setting is lovely and inviting but not intimidating for a place that serves stunning food. The oyster shot with cucumber, horseradish and chipotle infused vodka was a bracing palate cleanser. The calamari was so tender and flavorful it could win over non squid eaters. I can still taste the pumpkin ravioli with Amaretto and fried sage  that was dessert! They let you BYOB but the corkage fee is $, so you may as well order one of their reasonably priced wines. Dining in the Castro is risky business; so many restaurants are overpriced disappointments. But after our first visit last night, this restaurant easily zoomed to my list of favorites. We live in the city (I grew up here) and we're not wealthy, so anything other than a local ethnic restaurant is a big treat. This was our first anniversary dinner (though we've been together  years) and probably our only ""fancy"" night out until the holidays. Pesce easily lived up to that high bar. We picked an early time, :, because I had heard about the noise level and because we are older. : ) We had not eaten much that day, so when the server approached us I informed her we were starving. She excused herself, and a plate of delicious bread  a sourdough with a little extra in it, something nutty and wonderful, maybe just whole wheat?  immediately appeared with a small crock of soft butter. She talked us through the menu. We are not big eaters so after being guided to two nice glasses of wine from a menu that had a good but not overwhelming selection, we picked two plates, the house salmon and the risotto di mare. The salmon, served with toasted sourdough, capers, creme fraiche, and a little pile of pickled onion, was delectable: moist, supple, perfect balance of salt, smoke, and fish. The risotto was even better. I know people have complained that the risotto wasn't cooked, but honestly, this made me rethink how I make risotto at home. The grains were just separate enough to have a tiny bit of bite, and the dish had a texture and a sauce it wouldn't have if it had been cooked into a big soft goo the way I have been doing it at home. The fish were perfect. My gold standard for a dish like this is the shrimp, because I've lived on the Gulf Coast and have earned my shrimp snob star the right way; some of the best restaurants outside the Gulf fall down when it comes to shrimp: mushy, old, not particularly clean. The shrimp were perfectly cleaned and cooked, and tasted as if they had been snagged from the sea that afternoon. The other fish and seafood in the dish were perfect as well. Perfect, I say, a word I do not use lightly: sumptuous nuggets of fish, clam, and mussel, cooked just right, absolutely fresh, not a bit of grit. Even the portion size was perfectly designed for a restaurant based on sharing, neither stingy nor over abundant (to the people grousing about portion size in a restaurant  that serves tastings, may I recommend the meatloaf at Orphan Andy's? You won't regret it, and I guarantee a hearty portion). Note on the seating: where we were sitting I could see the back room, which looked invitingly quiet. Though the noise level stayed fine since it was so early, I would definitely consider asking for a room back there. But at an early hour, where the restaurant only filled as we were wrapping up and we could easily hear one another, the ""see and be seen"" atmosphere and the street level view were fun as well.  I look forward to talking friends into joining us to share one the branzino, and I'm already contemplating returning for the cioppino. I am sorry I did not sneak the rest of the bread into my purse it was the first thing I thought of when I woke up this morning. We drank our dessert  a delicious and reasonably priced dessert wine for me, a pear brandy for my spouse (interesting, but next time we'll both do dessert wine)  and took the Muni home; the service was so attentive (but not rushed) that we were not exhausted from an evening of waiting for food and checks, and were able to watch the end of Dance Party. Could life get better? Dining in the Castro certainly could not. At Pesce for Aperitivo hour. Free bites at the bar. Staff is super friendly, they take the time to chat which makes me proud to be in SF. Thanks Luca! See u again! Pesce. . . how I miss their old location in Russian Hill. The last time I visited the new location, they didn't serve oysters anymore! :: SHOCKER ::Their bellinis that I love still taste the same but the Lobster spaghetti wasn't as good as before. Overall, disappointing experience. It's so sad to see such a little gem over expand and not do as well as before. With that said, I'll give it one more chance when I get tired of making my own bellinis at home. I highly recommend this place! Beautiful decor, delicious reasonable food and great service. If you like seafood and are looking for a good date place, this is perfect. Pesce used to be on Polk Street and was small and intimate with terrific cocktails and good. I did not look forward to its move to a large, airy, well lit space. I could not have been more wrong. The staff, some of whom moved also to the Market Street location, remain some of the best in the restaurant business. And the food is terrific, starting with the very reasonably priced chicheti (appetizers) through the good selection of main courses to excellent desserts. I have been to the new location several times now, and it is a delight. Cocktails were inspired and well executed (one was a bourbon cocktail snow cone). There was also a good teamwork vibe amongst the entire staff, and food was all good. We'll be back. Had an anniversary dinner here tonight with my husband. The cocktails are delicious and the food is wonderful. We ordered  of the salads, the cioppino, a scallop dish and the nectarine crumble for dessert. The flavors and textures of everything was just right! If you're looking for a place to go for a special occasion, Pesce is it! Good food, good cocktails, staff friendly. Not too pricy for what it is, and in a nice neighborhood. All I can say is that every restaurant that goes into that space makes me miss  even more. I came here with a friend to celebrate her bday.  I made reservations a few days before hand.  When we got in, we were seated at the table in the bar.  We asked to change to a table.  They seemed to disliked it and gave us a table by the window that is very tight (more like to hide us or something).  There was plenty of tables and I made a reservations way in advance, not like I just walked in. Food was decent, but the price was a bit expensive for the portion.  The two of us came out to be almost $.  My friend rarely says that but we will NEVER going there again. Something as simple bread, they didn't even bring to us and we have to ask towards the middle of the dinner What a pleasant surprise! We dined at Pesce on Saturday night for the first time and we had a terrific meal. Creative and tasty cocktails, fresh and delicious food including the Granchio, pulpo, duck parpadelle and spaghetti with lobster and great service from Dorothy, all made for a wonderful dining experience. We can't wait to go back! Would I go back here again for over priced tiny measly appetizers or tapas or whatever they call it? NO!There're no ""entrees"" on the menu, just tiny appetizers not even enough for one person, let alone sharing them!A friend and I went there for dinner last night, on a Saturday evening around :pm, the place was packed but there were three  seat tables still available, so we got seated immediately, and then the place got even more packed. So we were luckily not having to wait.  We ordered the lobster tail&claws special for $, plus some appetizers, hardly enough for one but we shared. The bill total was around $ for  people. I thought the staff was very nice and attentive enough but my companion thought they were not attentive enough and missed a few of their cues, such as bringing the bread to the table after the food arrived, etc! It's a very noisy place when busy and not for romantic dinners. There's an overall theme in all my reviews: I want the most bang for my buck! Who doesn't? If I'm going to spend upwards of $+ per person, I really rather top it with another $+ and treat myself to Farallon or even better places. I don't want to pay more than $ for dumpy pretentious sub par places like Pesce or any restaurants around the Castro District, leave the place still hungry, and feel ripped off too. And yes, I have a choice, I will not go back again! I have only good things to say, particularly about the duck pappardelle, cioppino, and the penne arrabbiata. Excellent service, nice environment. Somewhat noisy. I've eaten here three times in the last month, trying different dishes each time.  The service is good and the team is knowledgeable.  It is a bit pricey, but worth the occasional treat. I'm finding things a bit hit or miss the last few times I've been. Service is good depending on who is your server, but bar staff isn't on the 'good' side generally. They are either doing too much or there aren't enough of them or something. The past  visits sitting in the bar have caused me to question sitting here again. From slow acknowledgement to slow service to not being aware of what's is going on with the guests, I've been very disappointed. I've had cold good that should be hot and had to get the manager since the server wasn't to be found. I've had items not show up after ordering since the server didn't put the order in. I've waited for drink 'refills' only to have to get up and ask. With all this said, the food is nice and the place is comfortable. They just need to up their game on service. This place is super fun.  The big, communal tables encourage interaction with other diners, which sounds weird but actually ended up being interesting.  It's loud, so I wouldn't recommend this dining room for an intimate evening.  More the kind of place you'd go to celebrate, or for ""girls night"".  The food is small plates, so you order a bunch of stuff and get a lot of variety.  The crab and avocado salad was off the hook.  We had a duck pasta that was really different and interesting.  Tomato penne was spicier than I expected, which was actually a good thing.  Caesar salad was nothing special, but certainly not bad.  Calamari was super yummy.  We weren't drinking that night, but the cocktails all looked really good, and the wine selection was killer.  I'm looking forward to returning and trying more of their fabulous creations. The ambiance of Pesce is great. Amber lights and an elegant, yet inviting, interior make it a great llace for a sophisticated dinner without attitude. The food is rich and the cocktail are reasonably priced. This has everything I want in a restaurant! Pesce is a great replacement for Jakes and . It still has the nice bar and friendly wait staff with a more up to date imaginative food offering. My date and I were promptly seated at a table against the wall. Our waiter was able to give us his opinions which we mostly took and ordered. The dun genesis crab cakes were light and nicely seasoned, if a bit tall, but very beautiful. The fish and beef dishes were both perfectly cooked, juicy and seasoned with a nice balance of acid. My chocolate cake dessert was not too dense but very bittersweet dark chocolate   Our dessert wine aperitif was the perfect finish to the meal. My date said she would definitely come back for another meal, Great food. Good portions with good flavors. Great cocktails. Tasteful decor. Popular on weekends. Make reservations. Already been here  times and will go back again. One of my few yelp reviews was for the old Pesce  I am here to update  the new location is great!!Location  right on Market near Castro  Perfect for walking / public transit / biking (pretty much everything but driving)The inside is much larger than the old location, and has great natural lighting (and people watching!) Food: The menu is pretty much the same, so I was happy to be able to have all of my favorite things.  It is small plates, great for sharing  and I was there with a friend that was down to try all the things that I love  starting with the oyster shooters! (Note on the shooters, they did change these  you can ask to get them the old way though  the new ones takes much more like cucumber)Get. The. Scallops.  Get the scallops, and make sure you save some bread to get all the sauce  it is thick, an creamy, and has mushrooms  it is just delicious.  Other favorites are the crab tower, the salmon (cold  served with onions and capers), the spicy penne  and make sure you save room for bread pudding! Service: Our server was amazing! She was from New England where myself and my friend were from and brought that north east spunk and attitude that we know and love right to the table. Happy to report that the new Pesce lived up to my expectations, and more! Came here on the very last day of Dine about town week. Very good offering of their  course menu that come with  dish (not included desserts). Pesce serves a variety of tapas Italian that are good to share among a group of friends. We were a group of . Very happy with our sharing orders and the friendly service. Their profiteroles were so good you shouldn't leave without an order. Would definitely come back for the atmosphere and maybe try out their oysters menu (: One of the best DAT dinners offered.  actual courses and they don't cheat you with a dessert as the course. The pasta was AMAZING. Hot, nice and al dente. Hamachi was fresh and had a great taste. I like how they kept it simple to show off the taste of the fish. Only  slices :( But oh so yummy!Short rib melted into your mouth. Polenta was very hot and a great consistency as well. Food came out very quickly, temperature of food was on point. Interior was great and seating was very comfortable!I will definitely come back :) Great new space, good service, and I can't say there were obvious flaws in any of the dishes (crudo, octopus, tuna steak, pizzetta, etc). Not at all overpriced, given that it's mostly quality seafood. I'm giving 'em five stars, since I think they're underrated here, but in truth I probably won't be coming back. No problem with the restaurant, it's just that I can do most of these same seafood preps at home, and I wasn't impressed with the way most dishes were flavored. Some were under salted, and others, like the asparagus, needed acidity, not more fat (which is all the dressing was). It may be that I have a strong palette, and the flavors were too delicate for me. Pizzetta was the exception. Also it's not in my 'hood anymore. We recently tested out a new restaurant in the Upper Market neighborhood, that had recently changed hands, and redone both the interior and menu.   We had really liked an earlier incarnation of the restaurant in this location, so were very interested to see what the latest had to hold. It's Italian in style, with a very nice, clean interior.   The service was great.   If anything, perhaps a bit too attentive, but not in any way obnoxious.    Our waiter was always there when we wanted him to be, and never when we didn't.   The dishes tend to be on the small side and meant to be shared by the table.   However, there are also daily specials that are meant as an entrée (Lobster Spaghetti was one of them on the menu the night we were there), which we included and shared as well.   You are encouraged to order    dishes per person.   They come out rapidly, but not all at once, so you dine at a pace that is comfortable.   To a dish, they were each delicious.   And the desserts were also extremely tasty (homemade cannoli's  yummy).    We were extremely pleased with the entire experience, and I and my friends would definitely go back frequently in the future. I really really wanted to like this place. . . maybe the spot has a troubled stigma, but my meal just sucked.  First, too many menus.  I happened to be there on a Friday night during restaurant week.  So there was the restaurant week menu, the a la cart menu, the drink menu, and another menu  too many pages.  I ordered from the restaurant week menu, which was fixed price at a reasonable $. .  I ordered the steak tartar, the bacon risotto, and the tuna.  Sounds good, right? The steak tartar was gray and oddly seasoned (give us real, quality raw steak marinated in olive oil black pepper but that's it!)  The bacon risotto was undercooked and lacked a base flavor.  The bacon might have been more of a payoff if the risotto wasn't so runny and more creamy.  The tuna was awful.  I rarely send anything back, but the seasoning was so off and the tuna so rubbery and the tomato base so stringy it needed to go home.  I replaced it with the braised short rib that had the texture and taste of corned beef surrounded by a pool of polenta juice. Having said all this the waiter and manager were VERY accomodating and took my two bottles of perrier off the tab.  The two stars all belong to the kind people that service the place. It may have been an off night for them, but San Francisco sets the bar for good food and hopefully more feedback on the food will make this spot something to remember. Not quite , but a very decent restaurant.  We went there with friends and did the Dine About Town prix fix.  I had the eggplant for my main and really liked it. Loved everything about Pesce!  My friend and I shared the Dine about Town menu  (hamachi crudo, bigoli with tuna bolognese, and the herb crusted tuna) and a whole roasted branzino  everything was excellent!  The service was great, and we chatted with Luca the host from Venice who was really cordial and helpful.  We enjoyed the beautiful space and vibe of the restaurant as well.  We will definitely go back! Came here with some friends to take advantage of the DAB menu. The space is nice, but the food wasn't really on point. I started with the beef tartare, which was served with home made potato chips. The tartare was cut up very finely, almost like ground meat texture to me, which I did not prefer, and the flavor was on the blander side. My friend got the kale salad, which looked great, but really was more like a romaine salad with a few token pieces of kale. Next course was the risotto. . . the rice wasn't cooked to the creamy consistency that I'm accustomed to with risotto. Not impressed. My friend's pappardelle proved to be better. And lastly, I ended with the herb crusted tuna which was way too peppery. The short rib was the way to go, but like I've said, nothing to really rave about. There are definitely better choices in the area. Came in here with a group of friends for Dine About Town. I did the dine about menu, but we ordered a few things off the menu as well.  Oyster shooters were very good. I also put in an order for grilled octopus and it was so tender and very tasty. My prefix consisted of sashimi crudo, pasta with duck, and braised lamb. Everything was good, but I thought the pasta needed a little bit more spice to it. Otherwise, I enjoyed the meal. The bread pudding is also very good! I went to Pesce on Saturday night with my dad and sister for a low key meal. We made reservations ahead of time and arrived about  minutes early. They were unable to seat us early (it happens) so we wandered around the neighborhood and came back. The table was still unavailable, but the host offered us a seat at one of the communal tables if we didn't want to wait. I'm glad we accepted that offer, because ""our"" table was still being used  minutes later by the same guests. Pesce is Italian small plates with some larger, American style dishes as well. I had the duck pappardelle (super yummy) and this crab meat tower with avocado (good but could have used lemon juice or some other acid) for dinner. I also had the dark and dirty for dessert, which is this lovely chocolate mousse  with cream and nuts. The waiter and the host were both very friendly and the waiter was very helpful in finding a red that would suit both my cold seafood starter and my pasta. The location was lovely but it's a loud restaurant. I would def go again. Two words: handlebar mustache.  I don't know about you, but when I dine out the FIRST thing I look for is whether my server has a handlebar mustache.  As you might imagine, most dining experiences are disappointing for me.  But not Pesce.  I was greated by a server with the most enchanting handlebar mustache I have ever seen.  Sure, the salad was too leafy and it wasn't the perfect dining experience, but the handlebar mustache worn by my server was amazing.  I will be thinking about his handlebar mustache for decades, and will likely tell my grandchildren about it. . . easily could have gotten four stars for food. Broke two cardinal rules for dining;: sat us at a table where the sun was directly in our eyes for  minutes. . . with no window blinds. Worst part, we were told they get complaints all the time. . Our table was cleared while one person in our party was still eating. Maybe next time it will be better. Second time there. Consistently great experience. Both food and service are exceptional. Loved the seafood, the squid was exceptional. Fun and high energy atmosphere. Food sucked, service was great. I only went there thinking it would be cheaper than Zuni and it wasn't. This is a seafood place and all of it was over cooked. It had good flavor but if you're going to cook fish . . . cook it right. Anyhow, it was no cheaper than my regular places which do a much better job at cooking fish than this place did. I don't think I'll go back.  But like I said, service was great and the food was good but all the sea food items were so over cooked. only the decor is nice,forget about the food the chef has to go back to school,very disappointed for the price too expensive for what you get ,the quality (very blend),i had the seafood soup the chef must have open a can of tomato sauce,and the seafood i had to find it with a magnifier ,very poor! i will not go back !! This review is only for the bar area  but it was awesome.  The bartender was so nice and skilled.  We went for the happy hour and had delicious manhattans and margaritas each for $!  I've never seen those considered well drinks, but I'll take it.  The restaurant is really beautiful, and we plan to go back for dinner and will re review once we do that. Went to celebrate a friends graduation last night.  From the moment we walked in the door the service was fantastic, the cocktails from our mixologist were done perfect and dinner from the Crab & Avo Tower to the Lobster Linguine it was all super fabulous!  We are so happy to finally have a GREAT restaurant in our Castro neighborhood! The seafood was delicious! We had a few small plates each,  , and enjoyed all of them. The scallops were particularly good. We will definitely be going back. I took my husband there for his birthday recently, as this was on his list of places to go. And I think it had its place there. The concept of Venetian small plates was refreshing and enjoyable. A kind of cross between tapas and Italian cuisine, heavy on the seafood/fish side (Venetian, right?). We would recommend everything we ate there  from the scallops to the crab meat on avocado. Order in rounds, as those plates are more filling than you think! We definitely ordered one too many and could not finish all. The wine we picked was also satisfactory  definitely worth the price. Service was very good. The only negative point I have about that restaurant is that it's not as intimate and romantic that I would have hoped. The music was a tad too loud and the tables are narrow but long, and so it felt like I was too far away to hear my husband well or feel a romantic atmosphere. I came here for dinner a while ago. Loved the lobster ravioli they had at the time. Have wanted to come back for brunch for a while.  It was FANTASTIC.  Great service, excellently prepared dishes, and SO inexpensive for the quality. If you like Mission Beach Cafe, you will love brunch here too!We had the poached eggs on polenta cakes, and the pork hash. Each was superb. Delicious Good Friday dinner w friends. Mm we will be coming back!! Squid, vermintino, branzino, lobster pasta! :) great addition to the neighborhood. great cocktails and tasty dishes. not loving the wine selection but i probably should learn more about italian wines. everyone is friendly and remembers you when you come back The attitude of our waitress was a total damper on the whole dining experience. She sized us up the second we walked in and curtly asked if we had reservations. We answered ""no"", surprised as most of the tables were empty. Perhaps she did not like that we were both wearing backpacks (we are law students so backpacks are a must most days), but her attitude towards us was so blatantly disrespectful that I was stunned. Then she told us another person would help us and left. The kind host seated us at one of the window tables and left. The same waitress reappeared and took our order. We ordered small plates and she give us a ""look"", she then proceeded to ask if ""that was ALL"" and left. Honestly, I wanted to walk out and go somewhere else where my business was more appreciated and I felt welcome but my bf and I didn't want to be as rude as our server. When the food came out, the small plate (appetizer size) of lamb noodle was delicious but the faro shrimp salad was mediocre. Overall, I would give the food about .  stars and the service would get a  from me.  I will never return because there are about a million other great restaurants where my patronage is appreciated Review only for bar and appetizers. First off, let me just say that all the wait and bar staff here are SUPER nice! So that's a big A+. We tried several of the small bites and they were all good as well. I had the Il burro drink and it was solid, but I can't say it left a lasting impression on me. I can't give this place full stars because we didn't really have very much here, but I can say that with all the great options around I can't say I will ever be back here toa ctually try the menu. Great food, timely service, delicious drinks. The employees are super sweet and always helpful. Make sure to save time for parking. Moving right along. Original and now a classic: youtube. com/watch?v=MMR…Original and now closed: yelp. com/biz/pesce san f…Returning to check out their new space has been high on my list. Initially disappointed when our friendly waiter broke the news they were out of homemade chicken sausage. Time to move on again. Smoked salmon tartine with cheese, onion, capers and arugula and indulgent buttery biscuit with homemade berry jam was a delicious destination. Both were more food than expected and made the $ price seem worthwhile. Light paint, dark wood accents and minimalist lighting represented a nice revamp from the previous incarnation. Plan to visit again for the sausage and dinner. Should be a good move. I came to Pesce when they were relatively new. I had a heavenly meal. I had Short Ribs and my friend had the lamb and we loved it. And I mean that we really thought this was a great restaurant. I went back today. Their menu seemed to be dumbed down a little but i could still find good things. Both my starter and entree choice were not available. OK. I get it. So i ordered the steak. The steak was chewy and tasteless, and the fries were disgusting. I would have enjoyed McDonalds more. I understand how difficult it is to run a successful restaurant, but when you compromise the quality of your food so badly then you become just another Castro shit hole with a pretty face. That sounds harsh but I was really disappointed. It was a place I really welcomed and hoped would be my go to place. Now I feel ripped off! $ for a glass of wine and a meal that MacDonalds could have done better!I never post here, because i get how pleas need to survive and thrive. But this is such a drop in quality and I paid $ for it so I feel compelled to warn people. If you want poor for in a mediocre atmosphere go here. A month ago my review would have been that the for and service were amazing.  Wht happened? this place looked really impressive at first glance.  we walked past the restaurant on our way to Anchor on Castro.  After looking inside and looking at the menu, we decided we would come back and try this place sometime.  When we got to Anchor, the wait was insane, so we figured, hey, let's go try that new place we walked past.  I have to say, the space was really, really nice, and the service was great.  unfortunately, the food was not up to snuff.  ordered three things: grilled octopus, seafood and shellfish risotto, and cioppino.  all of them seemed a bit one dimensional in terms of flavor.  the pulpo was overwhelmingly lemony.  also i think the octopus was cut a bit too thin so you didn't really get the full flavor of the octopus.  the risotto tasted mainly of cream, instead of being infused with seafood flavor, so i'm guessing they cooked the rice in some sort of cream base rather than a seafood stock.  dont' get me wrong, i like creamy risotto but not with seafood.  also, the cioppino really fell flat.  the broth was lackluster and didn't seem to have any fennel, which I think really makes cioppino cioppio rather than shellfish thrown in tomato soup.  like other reviewers have said, not sure how long this place will last in this prime spot on market.  oh well. I love this restaurant. I've been here with one other person and with a party of eight. Everything I've tasted has been delicious. All the fish is wonderful, but so is the pasta, risotto, steak and braised lamb shank. There is something here for everyone. The biggest problem with this place is the noise. I'm surprised so many people complained about the service, because it was actually one of the highlights for our last visit. I went with a group of four, and it was so busy that we had to be seated in the back not a problem since it was very loud in the main area and the back room seating offered some solace. My husband and I split the arugula salad and our friends split a Caesar with kale. The salads were way too salty. Definitely going to pass on them next time. The quality of the vegetables were exceptional, so it is a shame they had to kill off that flavor with a mountain of salt. I had the angus steak and my husband had calamari and swordfish. He seemed very happy with his dishes and the steak was cooked with precision to medium rare. It was absolutely delicious. The tiramisu was fabulous. ""Remember that restaurant in the Castro called Pesce?""  That is what we're going to be saying in about a year and a half.  At first glance, the new restaurant remodel has brightened up the place.  The cheap, brown, bent wood stools at the bar seem out of place for the white interior.  Perhaps they are temporary; but, they are the first thing you see.  I ordered a drink for my partner and we were ""coaxed"" to our table. As soon as I opened the menu, I remarked, ""We're not getting out of here without spending $. ""  The food, for what it is, is expensive and not all that creative.  Small dishes, and nothing outstanding.  Servings, pictured in the other reviews are not representative of the presentation which looks cluttered and piled, or slopped, onto the plate. Unless we get a ""really"" cheap Groupon, we're probably not going there again. A group of us decided to check out Pesce during Dine About Town week(rated top  out of the DAT participants). I ultimately decided to order off the regular menu as I didn't find the DAT menu appealing. I also immediately noticed they had a large selection of smaller dishes allowing me to construct a diverse meal. The Pappardelle(wide noodles, braised duck in a porcini tomato sauce) was lip smacking good and the Bistecca(grilled black angus steak, garlic fries) was solid but our other dishes were just pedestrian. My cocktail(Winter Smash) had a generous rye pour and was tasty as were the desserts we had shared(Budino Warm bread pudding with vanilla gelato, Tiramisu, Milk & Cookies, and the Biscotti e Vin Santo. The ambiance was sophisticated and the service was on par with this level of establishment. I noticed their happy hour menu which runs  days a week(with shorter weekday hours) looked very solid. True rating: .  stars Been here for dinner before but this was first time at brunch today. Between us we had the poached eggs on polenta cakes and the fried eggs on braised pork hash.  Both were wonderfully prepared. I was surprised that the restaurant wasn't more crowded as it really was delicious. .  stars After 's departure, the Castro has never been the same. Pesce tries to fill in that void. It has classy decor, but still approachable. A restaurant with superb cocktails and great service. I say, forget the dining room altogether, you'll find me at the gorgeous white marble bar next time, because if there's one thing the Beretta team is known for, it's their cocktails! Being the only cocktail on the happy hour menu, the $ Georgia Porch Swing (vodka, peach, bubbly) is a nice way to ease into the night. Starving? Can't go wrong with French fries spiced with Calabrese chilies and the fried calamari. Moving onto dinner, the only memorable thing is the hamachi crudo. Between the overcooked herb crusted tonno and the bland Agnello, I was ready to call it a night. But the bf insisted on tiramisu and thank God, it's good. I opted for more cocktails because  I still had space in my tummy ; )Try the lemony Ducati with gin and flamed absinthe or their version of a Manhattan in the Focolare (mixed with Mezcal for that smokiness!) And just to prove my hunch, a great bar can make the perfect Negroni and Pesce nails it. There's much room for improvement but keep this on your radar when you're in the Castro. Hey, this neighborhood isn't just for partying anymore. Wow, I'm surprised this place hasn't gotten better reviews. I guess I forgot to post mine. I'm reviewing it now just so yelp will do a better job of showing it as an option when I search for things near the Castro (!). I've been here at least twice, maybe three times so far. The food is always fantastic. Highly recommend the hamachi crudo, I have gotten it every time and I was never disappointed. I also seem to remember liking the kale salad and the Gamberoni. So far I've only had vegetables and seafood on my visits, since those seem to be the strengths of this place. The service is always good, too, and I've been very happy with the wine choices. Drink was a bit slow to get to me. ( Minutes) The food was pretty amazing though!  Loved the tiny pizza. Food and cocktails are excellent.  The service is terrible.  Inept, unprofessional and management has no idea how to mitigate the situation with guests.  I have hopes they will fix the service so this can become a goto. A great date place. Quite noisy and the service was a little slow but the waitperson was quite pleasant (which is not always the case with restaurants in San Francisco). The cicchetti's are a great way to experience different flavors. Just the right size  all of us (party of four) sampled everything. arancini was great (delicate saffron flavor). Octopus was lovely, though some thought  it was a little over boiled. Salmon crostine was all right  not bad but but not terribly differentiated. Scalloped potatoes was delish. Bay scallops was nice  and the sauce was even better. The tuna was not bad  but I probably wouldn't order it again. I so wanted to like this place. . . Overpriced, way to loud, and have you ever been served by someone who never smiles? Came early to avoid the crush, even on a (thankfully) rainy evening, and since they say they're Venetian in influence we decided to eat at the bar. The woman on duty was quick to acknowledge us and water appeared without asking. Blackboard at bar noted oysters, beau soleil. Bien!Asked server about wine to match with oysters, gave me a taste of something she thought would go well, great wine, and poured me a glass. Then our server was replaced by a guy who couldn't have cared less. What a dullard. Took him a bit to look and see me and say 'Yes?' oh, am I bothering you, I wanted to say, but instead gave him our order. He then chatted up the barback water guy in Spanish, dishing the crowd and a co worker. Then he placed our order. At no point in our meal did he check in with us, no chatting with us, no chatting with anyone but his co workers. Overheard that he was leaving, I think, or someone was. Should be him. You represent the business, you ass, and if your face never has even a hint of smile there is no welcome in your heart. What are you doing serving people, go get a job coding. The bar filled up, our food came. Calamari good, as was Chicory salad. Note that the website menu does not match the one currently offered to you. About $.  per bite, at least for the small plates. Quasi Venetian, a bit of Cali twirl and seasoning. The hamachi has the nastiest pink peppercorns, so big the flavor overwhelms and makes your palate numb. Nice peas in the suppli, probably the best thing I ate besides the oysters, which were $.  each, a bit pricey. Deafening room, one of the worst in the city. Cheap, Crate and Barrel ish but tackier furniture. Not that many changes since  and then Jakes to the room, same layout. The staff seemed overwhelmed, judging by the crowd that crowded the doorway. Our nice woman server was there when we left our unsmiling dude server and made our way out into some lovely rain. One and done. $ bucks each,  drinks, ringing ears and crap service. Done, indeed. This place looks beautiful if you like the trend with wood and metal. To me it feels cold. The food is not memorable. Lack of personality on the floor staff. Overall a good cafeteria. Solid Dine About Town experience that gives you an appetizer and  entrees for a robust, hearty meal. I went with the raw Hamachi starter, duck papardelle, and seared tuna a spicy tomato sauce. All were well done and delicious. Nice fresh pieces of Hamachi served with a few greens made for a simple yet tasty dish. The duck pasta was cooked nicely with just the right amount of sauce. The tuna steak was seared medium rare like a good piece of steak and the sauce had a great kick. Ended the night with tiramisu and canoli to conclude a great meal. Ragazzi, questo posto e' BUONISSIMO! Pesce is my favorite restaurant in SF right now. I really liked their food when they were on Polk street and I was worried they might have changed negatively when they moved to Market Street in the Castro. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised: the location and the interior are better and the food is as great if not even more delicious. I love their food. I love that they have a generous happy hour for apps and drinks. I love the wine options. I love the mini apps (Chiccheti) options as an amuse bouche almost. Th quality is fantastic and the recipes are very real of the region of Venice (region of Veneto). I am from that area and am proud to see that Pesce was able to bring the original regional flavor to SF adding a modern twist to each plate. Noteworthy:Polpo app: awesome flavor, original taste from Veneto. Especially the flavor of the potatoes in the recipe, brought me back to Venice for a moment. Their vanilla and chocolate GELATO: the best in town. Heaven!And I am so glad there's not TV in here! Great bar and bartender, food is ok, dining room is a little boisterous, bistro like. Tuna medium plate was very good, and liked the aracino, pulpo was ok. Hard to find other plates that were standouts. Love this place.   We were introduced to Pesce by a friend who owns a restaurant down south who came to SF with his chef to ""do some market research"" (translation eat), and can't thank him enough!   Five visits over the course of six months and it is consistently great.  The oyster shooters are like a fresh hit of oyster followed by a shot of chunky gazpacho.  Yum.   The octopus is terrific, properly dressed and seasoned.   The tuna bolognese was delicious.   Nice wine list at a reasonable price.   The only flaw is the parking, but if you go early it's not a huge deal. Had a fantastic meal on Sunday night. Server was so nice and accommodating. The Pappardelle was perfect. The Puttanesca Pizzette was almost perfect. Surprised not to see olives, but then again, we shouldnt have been surprised as olives are not mentioned as a topping. But, the pizzette was so yummy, how could I possibly complain :) Plus, when we asked about the olives, the server offered numerous times to add the olives. But, truthfully, it was perfect without them. And the gnocchi dish was rich and luscious! Definitely making Pesce one of out standard Italian places to frequent in the Castro! I came to Pesce for restaurant week last Thursday and dined with a friend.  We had reservations and were seated without any problems.  My friend and I were seated in the side room, which was nice because it wasn't as loud (we were looking to catch up).  Interesting enough, the side room was predominantly Asian but the main dining area was more mixed  coincidence?  Anyway, my friend and I both opted for the Dine About Town menu.  I chose the hamachi crudo, braise duck pappardelle, and the lamb shank.  My friend ordered the same but switched crudo for kale salad. Love crudo in all of its forms, and hamachi was no exception.  The peppercorns and the oils were an excellent compliment, too, and it came out with three pretty decent sized pieces.  Pappardelle definitely tasted like it was made in house, the noodles were soft and wide.  The braised duck was present, but not extremely loud, so it was more subtle than anything else.  My favorite dish, though, had to have been the lamb shank.  The portion size was huge (it probably also felt this way because we'd already polished off two courses prior).  And it was deliciously tender.  The veggies seemed like they'd been braised along with the lamb shank, and the meat basically fell off the bone with such ease that I really didn't need silverware.  If these are regulars on the menu, I'm mighty impressed!  We got some bread pudding for dessert too (not on the Dine About Town menu).  Warm bread pudding (with raisins, which added a kick) and cold vanilla ice cream.  What an amazing way to end the meal. Service:  There was a bit of a wait in between the pappardelle and the lamb shank, so the waitress ended up comping our bread pudding!  We didn't even say anything.  They just felt bad for the wait so dessert was on the house.  It was lovely.  Also, the staff did a great job filling up our water. Bottom line:  Fantastic meal! (+. ) this place is such a great find! didn't except to be this awesome but all the seafood dishes are amazing. Definitely should get the bronzino! My friend and I tried this place for dine about town. We had Hamachi + mint lime shrimp for the First course, they were both pretty good especially the Hamachi was great for first course, fresh and tangy, great to start your meal. shrimp was little too big for course (nice dish with tasty grains tho but felt too much as first thing to eat, makes you full. ) . Second course, we had Tuna bolognese, and Braised duck noodle. I would not recommend Tuna bolognese  any tuna used  for this dish was wasted got too mixed up with other things in the source. but the duck pasta was super tasty I think it was nice soft home made pasta (?). The third course, we had Herb crusted tuna and lamb shank. they were both super tasty. no mistakes ordering them to make your night. I will come back this place for dinner and try more dishes. Think seafood tapas. Potions size is on the small side. You will need about   dishes to feel full. Unless you order the larger/grandi dishes which is about twice the size of the rest. I had the best scallop ($) dish to date here. The cream sauce that came with it was amazing. Make sure you mop it up with some bread. The herb crusted tuna ($) was mediocre. It was way too spicy for us. The hamachi crudo ($) was nice. Lobster spaghetti ($) was really good. Duck papardelle ($) was less impressive. Milk and cookies ($) at the end made a good finish to the meal. It comes with a small vanilla milkshake and five cookies (each in different flavor). Service was friendly and on point. Parking sucks. If that wasn't the case, I would be back soon. This was officially the worst dinner we have experienced since moving to San Francisco  years ago.  I'm not a person who usually eats a lot of salt but everything was completely under seasoned.  This is a huge mistake in my opinion. Everything tasted super bland and was drenched in tomato sauce.  The octopus was good, but I have had better. The crudo was ok. My husband said the pappardelle with duck was super bland. The tuna bolognese was ok but it tasted sweet. Normally when you add sugar to tomato sauce it's because it aren't able to cook it long enough. The lamb was tender but again no taste no flavor. The tuna was in edible. It was doused in tomato sauce and weird sauce on top. Absolutely horrible. We spent over $ with tip. What a waste! Precious, sparcely portioned food at outrageous prices. $ for  thin slices of hamachi with a ruffle of organic mâché picked by hippie orphans.  Small plates equal big check at the end.  Location is fantastic, service is fabulous and if you love precious food, this is your spot.   Precious, but unlike the film's star, tiny portioned.  If you are going to be precious, give me a serving that will fill me up.  Indicative of San Francisco's changing landscape. Had dinner here last night with some friends at the bar. We tasted a bunch of different dishes. . . The pappardelle (fantastic), the jalapeño vodka oyster shooter (the vodka was so spicy it was unbearable), the crudo plate (pink peppercorns were a neat contrast in texture), the crab Louis salad (delicious!) and several of the specialty cocktails (the Mama Mia is like drinking fire water)The layout is sparse and I would venture to say boring, but the staff was nice. Great addition to the hood. Contemporary dishes, quality ingredients, solid service, creative ingredients, always buzzing, updated decor (though a bit stark for my taste). very good Italian seafood & very good service.  Star food,  star service,  star atmosphere,  star drinks.  Before being deterred by some of the low ratings  PLEASE read the reviews (Being asked to quiet down apparently is hostile).  My favs:  Scallops are impeccable, brussels are insane (excellent), and the gnocchi is well, YUM!I miss the Enzo drink though; wish that Pear juice/vodka drink was available all the time. . . Good food but shockingly bad customer service. I went there with some friends, the atmosphere was nice and the food was good, but two things happened that really peeved me. And the restaurant's response was even worse. . For my main dish I ordered mahi mahi which was about $. They told me they were out of that fish and could substitute it with another prepared the same way, which I was fine with. Then after about  minutes someone, presumably the manager, came out and told me they were out of the replacement fish. Now all they could prepare for me was the sea bass they had on special on the menu. I really didn't want this, because it was on the bone and is generally less fish, but I accepted. However when we got the check, I was pretty shocked that they had charged us the $ for the sea bass, given that I intentionally did not want to order it because of the high price and lower amount with meat. Not cool. . The friends I was with ordered x the amount of food as me and my partner. They also ordered  rounds more drinks. We both put our credit cards on the table and I was expecting the waitress to come and ask ""should I split this down the middle?"" at which point I would see if I could gracefully put just our dishes on my card and leave the remainder for the other couple. However, the waitress came by and just swept up both cards and split it / without asking. So, after being charged a lot more for a dish I was forced to have because the one I ordered was out, and then having to front the cost of three more rounds of drinks and two courses I didn't partake in, I left feeling pretty annoyed and upset. Between the above I ended up paying about $ for the $ of food me and my partner actually consumed. It's a relatively new restaurant and since I live only a couple blocks down I felt compelled to at least try to help them out, so I thought it was important that they get this feedback to reduce frustration from future customers. However, here's the worst part. The next day I called them and spoke to the manager (Myron) to give him this feedback directly. He remembered me and remembered the incident. He asked for my name and I gladly responded thinking he would offer some kind of resolution or compensation, but he never did. He just thanked me for the feedback and hung up the phone. Seriously? Any restaurant, especially at this level, should have better customer service than that. The menu is weird. It consists of various alcoholic drinks, small servings, medium servings, large servings and pizzas, rather than the usual first course soup salad and main course. And I'm very suspicious of  the freshness of food in restaurants that offer a very long menu along the contours of Italian food. The waiter was a bit pushy with his agenda of what he wanted to steer us to order. Realizing we got the subtext he changed his demeanor for the better. For first course we ordered grilled sardines. To our shock these were not fresh but  slices of canned sardines that were fried. Canned sardines are cheap. The item was quite expensive  $ for a very small serving. And canned. . . For main course we shared a grilled fish. It was divine! Very fresh and done exactly right  not undercooked or overcooked. Its meat of high quality. . It came with potatoes and artichokes. A large serving for two cost $. The chocolate pie dessert (bearing some fancy haute cuisine name) was mundane. Not good for groupsThe atmosphere of the restaurant is better suited for groups of  or less.  Went with a large group and we were reprimanded for being too loud.  The waiter was super nice, but the service was very slowAs for the food, the brunch was not that good.  The food was in desperate need of seasonings.  It was very bland and uninspiring.  Will not go back nor recommend it. Manager did not immediately remove a clearly drunk and aggressive guest who was shouting and repeatedly threatening other guests. No respect for managers who do not care enough about the safety of their staff and guests. Will never return. Good happy hour. Wine is $ a glass of house red or white. My friend and I had the fried calamari and a oyster shooter.  The oyster shooter w/o the vodka was good. The acid from the lemon worked well with the oyster. The calamari was fried perfectly.  I will have to come back here for a meal to experience the full potential of the restaurant.   And a quick return it will be. So glad Jake's is gone!This place is a better one to inherit the  space. The brunch was very well prepared, excellent, fresh and compelling menus, good, simple, Italian (Northern) style, good service and attractive ambiance. Cocktails were really excellent, I had their ""Vespa"" (read: Vesper) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . nice. We will be back! I have been a longtime fan and love the new locations but I have to say our last trip the food was great and the service was so poor.   On our way out the three folks standing at the reception table asked we enjoyed it, and I told them the service was not up to par.  They respond really?  I said yes it was, please look over to your left and see the poor guy waving both his arms to get some service. . . . and three of you just standing there. . . .  They need to pick it up a few notches or it will ruin a great place. Update:Lenny the manager emailed me asking for details on the poor service so that he could use it to help train the staff.   I will need to go back and see if things have improved on the service side now! I'm still having dreams about the squid ink risotto. I mean wow! WOW! I couldn't quite make any decisions on what to eat. I knew that I was HUNGRY! The bartender recommended a pork pasta with some sort of flat noodle. It was good, but man, that squid ink pasta. . . I just drooled on myself. We had also purchased dessert from Hot Cookie which is around the corner. The cookie is a bit of a conversation piece. The bartender decided to bring out a candle so now my cookie was ""flaming"". Oh Castro. . . how much I love thee! You should definitely make a reservation. I walked in with my friend and the wait was about  minutes but we sat at the bar. That is my preferred seating by the way because bartenders seem to have a tad bit more fun than the wait staff. I'm excited to come back and have more wine, cocktails, flaming cookies, and most importantly, the squid ink risotto!! Great addition to the neighborhood!  Loved Pesce when it was in Russian Hill and it's even better now.  Great food, service and the new digs are vast improvement on the old space which was a bit cramped.  Current big hits for us are the bigoli tuna pasta dish and the kale Caesar, yummy! My Bf and I recently moved to SF and have been all over the place trying new restaurants and we are pretty convinced this is our favorite spot so far! Why you ask? Well it's in the Castro and it's a fun place to walk around! (We happened to stumble into this place and had no idea what we were in for)They serve small tasty tapas, Italian/Seafood style. My fave was the eggplant dish. We sat at the bar and had amazing service. We had some delicious drinks  mine was a vanilla bean cocktail and I can't remember what the BF had but he loved his too. We also enjoyed our second round but can't remember exactly what it was!We ordered the mini pizzas and we were very pleased. By far the best part was the dessert. I don't remember what is was called but it was a flaky phyllodough type of dessert with great chocolate and whipped cream. I was in San Francisco for work and this place was recommended to me by a friend.  Went in there and loved every minute of it. Its tapas style.  Which is cool but i like to eat a lot. . . . so i really had to get a lot of food which ended up being kinda pricey considering how much my buddy and i eat. The food was excellent and the server, whose name i do not know was the most attentive and likable person ever!The scallops were amazing. . . although they were a bit small and i think the plate only had  of them on there. . . . so we had to order  plates!Place is great and the food is excellent i just wish they would put more of it on your plate! If you go with the understanding that the dishes are meant to be shared, you might  have a better experience and not be surprised at how small the servings are. . . My partner and I had a :pm reservation and we were able to be seated right away even though the restaurant was packed. The host needs to work on his greeting.  He stared at me blankly while waiting for me to give him my name.  I waited for him to say ""good evening"" first and then waited again for him to ask me my name.  I don't play the ""attitude game"" too well. After we finished dealing with the drama, we were seated and met by a fun and down to earth server.  She eventually lost a star in this review because along with her playful demeanor, she proved to be incredibly absent.  Hence, the % tip. However. . . . . the food was very good. We shared everything and yes, the plates are small.  We had the following:. oyster shooters (Miyagi oysters very nice  We had one shooter each. ). arancini ( There were  small rice balls I asked for a bit of red sauce and they told me ""no, they don't need them"".  I  still think that they needed some sauce for dipping. ). scallops ( There were  of them and they were probably the best seared scallops that I've ever had!). pizza ( We shared an arugula, heirloom tomato, and  mozzarella cheese pizza.  It was VERY small.  Picture a personal pizza and you'll get the idea.  There were  tiny slices.  It was good but a tad bland, so we asked for grated cheese and that perked it up a bit. ). gnocchi with milk fed pork  ( Again, this was a very small portion but perfect for the two of us considering all of the other dishes that we just shared.  This was good.  The chunks of pork served with the gnocchi were very tender and tasty. . tiramisu and chocolate gelato  ( The tiramisu was good and not too saturated with liquids.  It held up nicely.  The gelato was ok. There is a full bar and many specialty cocktails to choose from.  We stayed with Jameson on the rocks and a Hangar One vodka martini. Dinner before taxes and the Health Tax addition came to $. . Side note the reviews are correct when they write that the restaurant is very loud. Wow this was one of the loudest places that I can think of in a long time. Granted, Pesce was completely full but the noise level is out of control.  They need sound proofing panels on the walls.  Right now, they are completely bare.  Maybe some hanging artwork would help reduce the noise too. The drunk girls next to us were literally screaming.  Thank god they left halfway through our dinner.  It looked like they were only drinking wine too  cheap dates! We only had two complaints: it's rather loud and hard to carry a conversation when busy and the benches need foot rests (we were told they were still working on this and it will be fixed).  Aside from that, a top notch date spot with pretty amazing food.  Go! I have been in many restaurants over the years.  Never have I felt so unwelcome in a restaurant.  The host and bar server were so cold and unfriendly, I left before finishing my drink and ordering my meal.  No matter how good the reputation of the chef, the front of the house staff has ruined my experience.  I will never return, and will tell everyone I know how bad the experience was. BTW, I am not a competitor trying to dish this restaurant. What a great place for brunch!Excellent service, food and ambiance. Pesce = fishA simple name for a simply delicious meal.  It was a windy Sunday eve that we arrived to a bustling restaurant, left side, bar and right side, dining. The food =  stars.  The prices, high. We shared a couple of dishes, family style:  capesante, pan seared scallops in a thick buttery and creamy saucebroccoletti, grilled broccollini with warm garlic and anchony saucerisotto de seppia, squid ink risotto, andcioppino. Cioppino was the best dish of the evening and for the price (), a health big bowl two can easily share.  Seafood was fresh ( tasted of the sea) and tender. Capesante was fantastic but for the price,  small scallops didn't warrant the cost. (). My mate swilled some Vida Rosa (which had a smoky mezcal) and Gargenga Soave, a red from Italy. Both were tasty. And for dessert:  budino, a warm apricot bread pudding with vanilla gelato, one of the best I've had. Minus one star for the uneven service. Sometimes overly attentive (getting to close to the customer is awkward) and sometimes the timing is off  getting your drink order after your food arrives. Dishes like these are best shared with loved ones.  Bundle up this winter with a visit to this fine eatery in its new home. You Have Got To Be Kidding Me.  I have paid a high price for many different dining experiences in SF, but this was the worst value. Poor service blended with small portions masked by uber rich cream sauces made for a underwhelming experience. The menu is full of dishes priced as entrees that are mere snacks with boring and expected over rich flavors. Boo. $ paid for two people to leave bored and hungry is not worth it. Find somewhere else to spend your money on better planned menus. Sterile. Flat. Expensive. Restaurant opened with little fanfare. . . . . coming into the Castro swimmingly. Once in the door. . . the ambiance and restaurant lacked character. Drinks were not as refreshing as thought. Now the kicker. . . . food. . . It didn't. Appetizers was a huge miss. . try it and you won't be able to picked up with one hand. . . bread did not hold ingredients. Should I give them time to perfect? No. . . they had no business opening if they were not ready for people paying their hard earned money into their business and the immediate neighborhood. Think twice before sauntering into Pesce. We got caught in their net. . . not a good catch. Had a Saturday brunch here with my hubby. Food was a delight. Server Gary was friendly and professional and kept our coffee full. A pleasant find. We will return here the next time in SF. PS have the Kale Ceaser. Had brunch and got the same vibe as dinner a few weeks ago. Pleasant staff and service. Food is creative and pretty good. Nice variety. Was a fan of  many years ago, and this is a nice replacement. Prices are bit high for small portions, but still acceptable I went to Pesce a little while ago when it was on Polk Street when my parents were visiting the city.  The food was delicious. . risotto . . yum, and the fresh seafood was amazing.  Our waiter was so nice, friendly and timely.  My parents and I were celebrating, but it also felt special while we were dining there.  I don't know if they could tell we were celebrating or not (we were there for a couple hours lingering with drinks) but they brought us a complimentary dessert, which was awesome! I haven't tried Pesce in their new Market Street location, but I hope they are as good as they were on Polk Street! Delicious quality brunch, just the reasonable sized amount that doesn't leave me feeling bloated.  Nice environment and good service!  That's equality as important!  Quality food and good service. So far I've only been here for brunch.  I am a brunch lover. Overrated.  Our party of four went to town at Pesce having heard good things about it and I was underwhelmed. We ate the granchio, polpo, fritto misto, cavoletti, bigoli, torta cioccolato, and budino.  Of all those, I only truly recommend the polpo because it had to be the best octopus I've ever had. . . and I am not a big fan of octopus.  Everything else was honestly mediocre.  Not sure if we'll be back. I had previous checked out Pesce in its former location in Russian Hill many years ago.  I had remembered it was quite good back then . . . I think that still holds true today. As is recommended, we ordered a bunch of small share plates and for the most part, they were stellar.  Some of the highlights: Granchio (dungeness crab tower with avocado)  beautiful arrangement and even better tasting.  One of the best dishes Risotto di seppia (squid ink risotto)  creamy and rich; another hit.  Pumpkin ravioli with brown butter sage and saba  just a touch of sweetness that added a nice balance to this savory pasta dish Capocollo Pizzette (spicy tomato, capocollo, calabrese chile)  this pizza, on the other hand, was amazing.  Simple but with surprising heat.  So good we ordered an extra one. Others dishes were just ok: Pere e gorgonzola Pizzette (d'anjou pear, onion preserve, pomegranate seeds)  interesting toppings but unlike the capocollo, this one was just ok.  Tonno (herb crusted tuna, tomato puttanesca, soffritto)  the fish was just ok but the sauce made up for it. For cocktails, the Focolare (bourbon, Benedictine, walnut liqueur, mezcal rinse) was a great drink although the Estasi (chamomile infused grappa, elderflower, cocchi, lemon, grapefruit) was surprisingly even better. Desserts were somewhat disappointing. The Budino (warm cinnamon apricot bread pudding with vanilla gelato) was better than the Limoncello cake with marscapone but neither really shined. Nice spacious location with a semi private room in back for small parties.  Friendly, prompt service and reasonable prices. Gosh, I really liked this space when it was  probably because years ago, some close friends threw a birthday party for me in their private back room. That kind of thing happens to me like once every twenty years, so I don't expect the next one until I'm eating the Early Bird Special at some suburban shopping mall chain restaurant. Anyway, I still dream about that herb roasted Fulton Valley chicken sitting on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes and piled high with Blue Lake green beans and a stack of fried onion rings (photo: bit. ly/epZiO). Delicious. I read some good things about Pesce, so Jamie W. and I sauntered over to the Castro for a birthday eve dinner here. The first thing that struck me was how loud it was. REALLY LOUD! I know it's the Castro, and they kept the bar scene hopping. But still. . . Even though we made a reservation, we were squeezed into the crowded banquette seating area where the couple next to us felt a need to hog the seating for themselves. In fact, the one who was sitting halfway into my space wouldn't even acknowledge that I was trying to get in. EXCUSE ME. MAYBE YOU CAN DO THAT AT HOME WHERE YOU ACTUALLY OWN THE SOFA. I tried to push him to his space with my jacket but to little avail. The server was no help even as other tables started to open up. Oh well, I suppose I can eat with just my left arm. Service was on the slow side as the bread finally arrived. Room temperature and rather chewy (photo: bit. ly/dEcw). The menu had a pretty standard cross section of Italian food with of course, a focus on seafood. Thus the name, Einstein (photo: bit. ly/awmUq). By this time, another nearby couple was doing the two on the couch thing. WTF. YOU WANNA TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF AND PICK YOUR TOES NOW, TOO? We decided to start with the mini pizzas or Pizzettes as they are apt to call them in Castroland. The first was the $ Puttanesca with spicy tomatoes, capers, olives and white anchovy on a puffy, browned crust (photo: bit. ly/akBCdM). It was decent enough though a bit saltier than it had to be. Better was the $ Scarola e Salsiccia which had clumps of caggiano sausage along with escarole, lemon zest and panna (photo: bit. ly/p). This had actually substance, and the lemon gave it a more refreshing taste than you would expect. Entrees were next, and Jamie got all predictable and ordered the $ Pappardelle with Braised Duck in a Porcini Tomato Sauce (photo: bit. ly/cBuSO). It was pretty good but strictly by the numbers in execution. Once again, overseasoning hindered the intended rustic flavor. It was my birthday. . . OK, birthday eve (did I mention that already?). . . so I decided I deserved the $ Aragosta, which was just a plain bowl of spaghetti mixed in saffron, brandy and tomato and topped with a roasted half lobster (photo: bit. ly/iEQWF). I didn't have any complaints about the succulent lobster, but it overshadowed the pasta which was in a pool of watery sauce with only a hint of the brandy mentioned in the description. By now, the couple next to us had left unable to disengage their mutual embrace. DON'T LET THE DOOR HIT YOU ON THE WAY OUT, BOYS! And the other couple was canoodling causing a look of sheepish indigestion on the neighboring diner. HEY, YOU CAN GET AN HOURLY RATE AT BECK'S REAL CHEAP, SWEETHEART. Why am I yelling? The place has emptied out. Please bring back . FOOD  .  stars. . . some of it is good, much of it is meh and often on the same plateAMBIANCE   stars. . . WHAT?!!SERVICE   stars. . . fairly indifferent given the canoodling that was going onTOTAL   stars. . . that chicken with the onion ring tower sounds pretty good now Pretty solid for the Castro. I do prefer the quieter vibe of the old location but really, this place is vibrant and what really impressed me is that every person you come in contact with was super polite and friendly. The waiter, each busser, food runner, etc. Crab tower: /Octopus: . /Sardines: /Whole Branzino: /Service: /What I remember about the old Pesce is that there were tons of hits but a few missed here and there. Last night was along the same lines. Only one miss that was the sardines. The accompaniments on the plate was wilted and underwhelming. But, everything else was really nice and the whole Branzino was cooked perfectly!Energetic  and a bit noisy but we can hang with that  people were having fun and enjoying their dinner and we really enjoyed it as well. Good job, please keep it up! Disclaimer: I don't have the most sophisticated palette, so maybe the quality of food at this place was beyond my appreciation. Went here for a mini celebration and figured the prices weren't ridiculous ($  ish a plate for a nice place with a beautiful, fancy atmosphere) so we tried it out. SERVICE was nice. It was crowded for a Sunday night, and we walked in without a reservation. The host was also the waiter and bartender so we were waiting up front for a few minutes, but then seated immediately at the bar because the dining room was full. The waiter seemed rushed but was still polite. I wouldn't exactly call it attentive service, though. DRINKS: We started with $ cocktails. A Farewell to Arms, I can't remember what was in it but it was fairly sweet and delicious. He had the Americano, which sounded sweet on the menu but ended up being crazy bitter. We didn't finish the drink, it was just made badly. Thought about sending it back but he didn't want to. After ordering, the waiter brought some bread on a plate with a pat of butter. The food came relatively quickly after that. SCALLOPS: I had the $ scallops, which came with three seared scallops, some mushrooms and a delicious sauce. It was a yummy dish, and it didn't seem expensive, but the fact that the dish was so SMALL threw me off. It looked like an appetizer. I was hungry when I finished and continued eating bread. PAPPARDELLE: He had the duck pappardelle, which was also a tiny dish. Delicious as well, but perhaps my palette couldn't distinguish how that tiny bowl was worth  bucks. The food was not bad, and the prices (for the quality) was not bad, but I really couldn't get over the QUANTITY (or lack thereof). We spent nearly $ on dinner and left hungry. It wasn't a good experience; maybe we will come again when we are feeling more frivolous or loose with our wallets, but the value didn't hit it home that night. Atmosphere was nice. I'm lucky I sat in the back room! I could still hear a lot ofNoise coming from the front!Service was good but a little too good at times. I felt rushed!Also, food that comes out to the table under  minutes ofOrdering, makes me believe it was sitting in the fridge. Ordered the kale salad that had some kale in it mixed withIceberg. If it says kale salad on the menu, shouldn't it be kale?Steak was good, but each bite had a lot of olive oil in it. Tiramisu was not good. Cocktails were very good!I would return for cocktails & maybe an appetizer (happy hour)I don't mind paying higher prices for dinner but I don'tBelieve the food at Pesce justifies the price. Too many other restaurants that are great without the highPrice. Overall excellent. Food, service and decor was such a huge improvement over anything that has been in this space. Only criticism is the chubby host. There were two of us, it was early and not yet busy and he sat us at a table just outside the kitchen. We requested a booth and he said that the booths were reserved for  even though the table we were being seated at was a four top. The booths went empty until just as we were leaving when he sat two separate parties of TWO. Pesce needs a new host or they'll be doomed as others in this space have been. First impressions! very rare I give a  star to places but my two experiences were so wonderful there. . I love the remodel and the upscaling they have done to the place. The staff it actually amazing in every way. they had dimmed the lights and to my friends it was too low and they turned them back up . I have not been to too many places that will do that for u . This place is maily SEAFood so do not go if u do not like, they have some dishes not that way like lamb and beef but majority is seafood and amazing seafood at that . Jessica was our server noth nights and she rememeber everything about me and one of my other freidns that came both nights, to me that is impressive. The food is mainly smaller portions ment to be shared but they also have about  dishes that r just a big plate style . which one night i did that way and had the lamb ( excellant) in every way shape and form. . . and then last night the small plates and shared with friend from Turkey. The only thing i would say is that with the high ceilings and wood floors it gets very loud in there to where u may not be able to hear people at the other end of table if u have a big group . sorta like HOME used to be before the carpeting and still how Chow is. I do hope that if u r in the area you give it a try for its great to have another new addition to the hood that is upscale and great food. . . . . . Fantastic!  Lovely, warm interior with a friendly and attentive staff.  I came early and was waiting for my friend, but they sat me anyway.  Other places would have made me wait or told me they were booked (even if half full).  They won me over with their friendliness.  Now the food. . . awesome!  They had fresh clams that were incredible.  Fresh, with just a lovely hint of the ocean.  Their slightly baked squash salad with fresh mozzarella and a sprinkling of cinnamon was incredible.  Wide noodles with braised duck in a tomato and mushroom sauce, amazing.  The noodles were like butter!  The menu changes depending on what is fresh and in season.  Nice wine and cocktail list.  Very relaxed and friendly atmosphere, with a great staff.  A bit pricey, but worth it.  We will make this a regular place. The introduction of Pesce to the neighborhood was quite refreshing as that area of Market Street leaves much to be desired in terms of dining options. Pesce (owned by the same group as Starbelly) has opened a great Seafood oriented restaurant that offers a wide variety of dishes from the Northern Italian regions.  The menu offers mostly smaller plates, but unlike most other Tapas style places, you actually feel like you're getting a good value.  The options range from exclusively Italian items (seafood pastas, mozzarella etc) to more local items like flat breads and scalloped potatoes.  They do also have a shorter list of larger entrees. The restaurant itself is freshly designed, think Restoration Hardware meets Italian Seafood!  The bar is quite nicely designed and the space feel like something you might expect in NYC. Overall having already eaten several dinners at Pesce, I highly recommend it for its consistently good food, friendly service and pleasant atmosphere.  Hopefully the neighborhood can take a few notes from these guys! Awesome brunch. Not crowded which will change very soon. Food was inventive and well priced. Good music Good bar. Coffee was so so but that didn't ruin it. Definitely check this brunch out. Good food in the hood is welcomed. Yay Superb food, drinks and service.  Well crafted menu.  Everything was just so tasty.  We sat in the cozy back dinning room.  Our waiter was professional, friendly and very knowledgeable he helped guide us thru an awesome meal. As we were leaving I did notice the noise level in the main dinning room was very, VERY loud.  I'll be sure to book the back room again. What a pleasure to have in the neighborhood.  Great food and service.  Portions are small so it can add up to order many plates, but it was quite delicious and our server Jessica was sensational. I love this place. We have been long time fans going to the location on Polk about once a week for years. We were sad to see them move from our neighborhood but happy to see the amazing new space and extended pizza menu! My faves will always be the scallops and the tuna pasta. The best best ever! Also the staff is so nice. I don't usually drive across town for a mellow week day dinner  but for the food and staff this place is worth it! Wish I had gotten in a review for the former Russian Hill Pesce ( Polk St), but I was quite relieved to know this place only moved, and did not shut down because their seafood is so delicious!At this newer location about two month ago, my date and I ate such items as sardines, baby octopus salad, diver scallop crudo, pan seared scallops and lobster pasta. Everything was tasty. I particularly liked the sardines, and the octopus  it was soft and seared, not chewy at all. Our waiter was quite knowledgeable about the menu, as well as the wine selection  his help guided us to select the Moscotto. Did have to get reservations, but it was well worth it. Delicious gourmet meal each time. Friendly service, tasty cocktails, comfortable atmosphere. Has it been perfect each time? Of course not  that would be boring, and what's more seriously unrealistic. Sometimes its great, sometimes its not. But each time, its been a fully present experience that doesn't pretend to be anything its not. And for that (and the gravity challenging deliciousness of their crab tower), I truly appreciate them. Old school Italian seafood without traditional Italian American east coast exuberance,""mezza mezza"" atmosphere and service. Great improvement from Jakes, however miss warmth of , especially @ the bar."
TBD Restaurant|3.5|American (New) in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|153|-1|3.66666666667|" What a cute little restaurant right by the Orpheum.  We came here for a quick bite, was able to get reservations pretty last minute and the food was unique and tasteful.  We had the baker's bread because it sounded interesting. . . it was sort of like mushrooms on top of bread with some kind of sauce.  Their honey glazed brussel sprounts was good and the presentation of the tuna tar tar was perfect.  I'd definitely recommend anyone catching a show by the orpheum to come here. They also have a good yet simple selection of wine! Really nice comfortable decor. Silverware in drawers in the table a very neat concept. Brussels sprouts appetizer was delicious as was the sturgeon entree and the tuna tartare appetizer. Friendly service. Constantly updating menu: if what you see on the menu for the day strikes your fancy, highly recommend giving them a shot. Try mixing and matching from the prix fixe menu by asking the great servers politely. The menu at this place makes no sense and was super disjointed.  The tasting plates we ordered actually had good flavors but do they have to make them all with baby vegetables?  We had the Josey bread which was okay but you couldn't taste the chanterelles, the leeks which looked like  baby pieces of scallion, and brussel sprouts which were about the diameter of dimes. The kitchen then gave us a complimentary appetizer of tuna tartare with head cheese. It;s a nice gesture, but we didn't order it specifically because the combination sounds bad. Who wants a slice of fatty pork head with warm tuna that doesn't taste like tuna?Then here is where it really goes downhill. The entrees all came out and were gigantic. It's like two people designed the menu where the appetizers have to use minuscule vegetables and the second person felt bad and overcompensated  with gigantic entrees. Sure, normally one wouldn't complain about gigantic entrees but the roast chicken was an entire half chicken. My opinion is that the waiter should have let us know how big it is instead of letting us over order like that. What kind of person would actually want a half chicken at dinner? Also it was too salty.  It came with a side of bread salad that I had trouble cutting with a knife. My friend got the pork ribs and wouldn't finish them because he said they were also very salty. They were braised ribs that had a grayish sauce on them.  You know they are not good when someone can't finish ribs! Another dish was the fish over sunchokes which my friend didn't like and to me it looked unappetizing.  It was a dry looking fish sitting on top of an unidentified brown mush. The steak looked nice but my other friends said it had no real flavor. This review might sound harsh but these things are easy to change. As is, this place is a waste of time. I'll conceived menu with poor execution. Love this place! Awesome kitchen, and we prefer to sit at the bar to watch how they cook on this massive interesting grill. Come open minded to try new things. Not a full bar though. Great place.  Good food, love the style of the restaurant.  Friendly staff.  Get lots of small plates, and eat like a king! Great meal. Bright inside love that now I'm older. Nice arrangements of flavors. As long as the food stays consistent I would continue to go. Great service as well. Check menu on line it's consistently changing. good food at a fair price. upstairs seating might be a little awk but since there were only  of us, it was fine. ordered the prix fix which came with:daikon radish salad  GREATveal in mushroom cream sauce  goodpumpkin profiteroles  good Wow, great food and service!  My daughter and fiance invited us to a SF dinner. . . we went to TBD.  Since this type of fine dining was new to us our future son in law ordered family style.  Oh hooray, we get to taste the multiples!!  The appetizers and main courses were outstanding, deserts amazing!  We can't even pick one item out that was the best. . . it was all good!  Our waiters/servers were so nice.  They were there for every need.  Swooped in to grab the used plates and moments later were bringing new plated foods. The manager was exceptional, went out of her way to our request, I had asked for a certain type of beverage that they didn't have available. . . she went out and found it!  How cool is that?   It was so much fun watching the chefs prepare the food on the open fire and exciting to watch the very handsome head chef take a little taste of everything before it was plated.  So much care and detail to every dish for every patron. The ambiance was warm and inviting. . . rustic with class!  Loved, Loved, Loved it and can't wait to go back! Loved this place!  Stopped into AQ (it's sister restaurant) and the prefix menu was just  bit too pricey (it's listed on Yelp as '$' but I think it should be '$' especially if that prefix didn't include wine which I don't believe it did, but I digress) so we went over to TBD.  We were seated at a group table upstairs which was very nice and intimate, another group was there but it was not a problem.  We started with some great wine and proceeded to order a bunch of dishes for the  of us.  I believe in total we order  or  things,  entree and the rest were small/medium plates.  To me, this place would've been  stars but the portions were a bit too small.  The entree we got was lamb very good but too small for an entree.  For other plates, the highlights were the mussels, octopus ceviche, and rockfish.  The pepper with squid ink was underwhelming for sure. Overall, I loved the ambiance and we had great service, the food was fun and interesting and delicious, but I wasn't stuffed.  I would absolutely go back! Each dish was amazing. We started with warm Josey Baker bread with corn, cotijo and espelette, followed by a beet salad with grapes and walnuts just touched by a subtle fresh horseradish.  Then the heartier plates arrived: arepa (duck) with tomatillo, apples and manchego, roasted sunchokes in a red brick mole and grilled leg of lamb with carrot and mint (both part of the three dish prix fixe menu), honey glazed brussel sprouts, octopus ceviche with lime and avocado served over a very light bed of hashed brown potatoes, and finally a shared desert included in the prix fixe selection the lightest, fluffiest doughnuts resembling beignets and more than enough for the three of us.   All the dishes were amazing and made with loving attention to detail, encapsulating all the flavor a recipe could possibly have!  Read the entire review with photos at:  unhealedwound. com (October , ) Nice place, though the server kept interrupting us as we tried to talk business. Anyway, the appetizers were very inventive, though not all hit the mark.  The rice cakes were really just that nothing special, but the potato salad was excellent. The leaks were good as well. My trout dinner was okay, though a bit mushy and watery for my taste. This place was just a fun timeI walked In with  of my good friends, and we were determined to have a good time. I was a little difficult with ordering the wine and appetizers, but both the server and manager matched our energy. They even sent us a small gift from the kitchen which was extremely nice of them, so thanks. We crushed  bottles of wine, the server nailed my needy requests, and we had a big meal. All in all this place has some great food, great service, and a fun environment. I'm down to go again. The silverware is in your tables drawer! Did not know this restaurant existed! It's been open for almost a year and we finally checked it out last night for dinner. Everything started out great. They don't have a full bar but they have a couple of wine based cocktails which are pretty good. To start, we ordered the eggplant, brussel sprouts, and the octopus ceviche. These were all really good. Special shout of to the sprouts and the octopus which was perfectly cooked. We then had the venison tartare which none of us cared for. They mix raw and cooked venison and the textures were too different and we were done after a couple of bites. Then we got the porcetta, which was mostly fat, and the burger, which also tasted way too fatty. Basically, we should've stopped at the appetizers because the rest of the meal left much to be desired. If I come here again, I'll have  orders of the octopus and call it a day. PS: Great service! I really enjoyed this restaurant. I read about it online and I was very excited to try it with my friend. When we arrived we got our seats very quickly. First the lights in the restaurant was pretty bright but after  min later they dimmed which made our experience more enjoyable. They have their services (fork,knife. . etc) available on your table. Each side has their own drawers with one set of service. Such a good idea and I think it saved time too. Food was great! It was a good amount. Price was good for the service we received. I will go back there for sure. Loved this place when it opened.  Went there as much as any place in the City as a no fuzz honest interesting food at fair prices.  Cocktails made from Sherries and like were fun and service was friendly.  Chef Mark even sent us a extra dish when we shared some good wine with him.  But last time. . . they ran out of the lamb chop main course when we had a PM Reso.  They gave us some sausages instead which was a joke.  We didn't complain but that was way unprofessional.  Bauer might be right on his update this past TH.  Bummer because we really had great fun there before. I was very impressed with the ambience and the food. We had the prix fixe. The soup was great, with the right touch of the pumpkin seeds. The short ribs were plentiful and so tender atop a great grit and tomato based sauce. The peaches with farrow and cream were a great ending to this meal; light and delicious. The service was just ok. I tipped % and generally tip closer to  %. % is equal to a  on   scale. A little more attentiveness would have gone a long way. Overall, it was a great pre show experience. Great plates to order and share family style. Super easy parking on the street right in front. Had a reservation  seated right when we walked in. Great service. Will be back. I know yelp probably won't post my review because it's the first one but I had to register so I could comment on this restaurant. For a Friday night and hardly anyone there, that should have been our first clue to go somewhere else but my husband wanted to try it. First  Menu is very limited.  Unless you're going with the prix fixe menu (which hubby got and wasn't wowed with).  There was only three entrees to choose from (already made steak and roasted chicken for dinner at home this week).  So the only I got was the beet salad.   They bought my beet salad out thinking it was a side dish my husband and I were sharing.  I said that's my entree and our waitress said ""oh, sorry"" and just walked away.  I don't know what they did to the beets salad (mashed/mushed), but it really wasn't a salad.  Just mashed beets with spicy walnuts which the walnuts didn't even go with beets (I love walnuts and didn't even eat them).   It took another  minutes for my husband to get his prix fixe entree and that wasn't even impressive.   Long story short. . . I'm glad we only spent what we did at this restaurant.  There are to many restaurants out there so we will not be going back to this place and we sure won't recommend it. Let's start with the good: Everything except the food!  We were seated at the bar and the bartender that served us was very friendly, helpful, and charming. . She served me two excellent beers.  The ambiance in the place is neat, its got a classed up 'roughin it outdoors' kind of feel to it.   For example, in the bathroom, the toilet paper holders are made out of branchesWe weren't too hungry, so my girlfriend and I split the prix fix meal and it was plenty of food.  The amuse bouche was beet with arugula and ricotta cheese, pretty uninteresting.  The first course, yellowtail crudo, tasted meh. Next, the grilled halibut served on a bed of greens, was remarkably underseasoned, and the veggies tasted like how I used to steam them in college.  The main course, the dry aged NY steak, was undercooked (I enjoy rare, but this was bordering on purple, and chewy and dangerously close to cold in the middle).  It did come with a badass steak knife.  The meal ended on a decent note; although the dessert on the prix fixe ran out, the soft serve and smore dessert they substituted was perfectly fine. Underwhelming. . . Went to TBD because I planned at the last second on a Saturday and there were still seats available. Staff: Awesome. Decor: Awesome camp y vibeAtmosphere: About half empty on a Saturday dinnerDrinks menu: Nice selection of beers and wines by the glass (like legit selections for a beer lover, not just a couple of CA IPAs)Food: It's mandatory Prix fixe for $, which I liked. They also have a separate ""bar menu"" which you can order alongside your dinner. Food was excellent all around, but they serve family style, and gave us way less food than could fill us up, even with extras, drinks and dessert. st course: Shrimp ceviche  Super yummy, though  small shrimp total for our group of . nd: Mole carrots. Excellent mole, soft sweet carrots. Very tasty. Add ons: Avocado seaweed bread (so good) and padrones peppers (like small shishito, OK). rd: Pork Posole  amazingly delicious juicy pork with some incredible jus. They need to bring bread or a starch with this, so much jus and not enough stuff!th: Dessert was bowls of panna cotta with fruit / mint sauce.  stars. Extra dessert: Deconstructed s'mores. Mm. So overall, fun place for a group, delicious food, but they need to make enough food, and I'd like it a bit more lively! .  stars if I could. Overall I'm a fan of this place. The food was good, the waitstaff was friendly and quick and I liked the atmosphere. I will say though that it is important to recognize that TBD has a single prix fixe tasting menu. They can modify it for people with allergies and other dietary restrictions but it is worth looking into the menu on their website in advance in case you're dealing with just plain picky eaters or have a large group. We had gulf prawn ceviche, carrots with mole, pork pozole, and flan. The ceviche was the weakest dish but was still ok I just would have liked it to have a little bit more bold and bright flavor. Loved the carrots and mole and the pozole though I wish they had served the pozole with a bowl instead of a flat plate because I didn't get much of a chance to enjoy the broth with the pork, hominy, etc in the pozole. We also added the josey baker bread with avocado, great but the portion size was huge. Too much for two people and I wish they would offer a half size portion of it because that would have been perfect. The staff at the restaurant were great too. Very professional, friendly, and everything happened at a reasonable pace. We overhead that the table next to us was late for a reservation and had an event and asked the staff to rush the meal and it seemed like they were very accommodating to this, which is the hallmark of a well run operation because clearly those customers were being kind of needy but the restaurant staff were able to deal with it with a smile on their faces. TBD, like AQ, has changed to fixed menu for $; the price on single items have gone up ($ for Josey Baker bread!). Disappointing. Great food! Special experience! It's unfortunate that it is buried away and challenging to find because it is worthy of multiple visits. TBD is an oasis for me in the neighborhood  a place that's casual enough to walk in and perch at the bar after work, yet maintains an ambitious menu that holds up against some of my favorite restaurants in the city. They recently changed formats to a set menu ( courses for $), which lets the kitchen focus on a few standout dishes each night (rather than the broader old menu, which frankly could be hit and miss). The flavor pairings are often unique (last week: sea bass with hot/sweet eggplant, fava purée and herbs) but invariably satisfying  the portions are also more than generous. Though the bar program only incorporates wine and beer, you won't be left wanting. The wine selection is a great cross section of local and old world, along with an incredible sherry selection. Definitely worth checking out their 'loophole' cocktails as well, especially the Nogroni. Excellent food, experience, and service! I would recommend this for any occasion. The camp fire concept is also very unique. Food was better than AQ. I have been to this unique and wonderfully fresh eating establishment a number of times now, and it is my new favorite restaurant.  I love the smell of the grill as you walk in the front door.  The decor is modern and inviting all at the same time.  The manager was very gracious inviting us to sit at the bar while our table was being prepared.  In very short order we were seated toward the back, where we could watch the chef and crew prepping and grilling.  A fun surprise were the drawers in front of each diner with clean flatware for each course. . . very innovative.  Every server that came to our table was friendly, helpful and efficient, so we never had to wait very long between courses.  I felt we were consistently attended to, without anyone hovering.  The beer cocktail was delicious and unique.  I loved it.  The food was outstanding, each course more interesting and special than the previous one.  And the s'Mores dessert was the perfect ending to a incredible evening with dear friends.  I would highly recommend this casual and rare SOMA gathering place, with a most inspired menu that changes often, so there is always something seasonal and innovative being offered. Mark, the chef consistently comes up with amazing combinations that enrich the tasting experience. . . . this is a wonderful restaurant in which  to spend an evening. I've had the pleasure of eating at TBD (and their big Sis next door, AQ) enough times now to appreciate the craftmanship and care that goes into every dish prepared. Cooking indoors over a wood burning hearth is no small feat, and doing it so well, with such an epicurean aesthetic, yet still rustic and hearty is quite an accomplishment. One I have yet to see mimicked, much less equaled. At TBD, the bar has a menu apart from the rather new, fixed menu for the seated area, and both of them change quite regularly. Highlights at the bar for me have been, Asparagus with a soft Egg, Cojito Corn, and the grilled Peppers. During my most recent visit to the dining area the menu (yelp. com/user_local_phot…) featured a delicious and perfectly seasonal Watermelon and green Tomato salad, a perfectly large piece of Seabass with a fava Bean blend and Eggplant (yelp. com/user_local_phot…), and a huge portion of Tri tip crusted in burnt onion and coffee. I'm a huge Tri tip fan; coming from down the Central Coast and the rub on this one was so flavorful and unique. The service stands out in my mind at TBD almost as much as the food. It's the little things that make a difference. Such as the server being congenial and very helpful; offering to bring tastes of the available wine to make sure we enjoyed the pairing beforehand, or like when I left for the restroom and returned to find my napkin refolded in its proper place; the smaller things go a long way with me. Overall, I consider TBD one of my favorite restaurants anywhere and I can't wait to return to see what's new from the grill. Cheers!   @LeeShep I love the new format at TBD!The food is inventive, quality sourced, seasonal and delicious.  Going there is like going to a friend's house for dinner (a friend who is an incredible cook) because the food is served family style in a casual, unpretentious setting. You don't have to think about what to order and there is always an interesting mix of dishes. I am a vegetable lover and the menu offers a great vegetable to protein ratio. If you go during the summer, get the side of corn  it may not seem particularly interesting but it is! I save TBD for special occasions and it wows me each and every time.  Shoutout to JD and the staff on providing such a tremendous experience.  The wine and beer list is one of the best I've seen in the city.  Where else can you go for such an in depth variety of Sherry?  Super cool to try new things like fish baked in a special way with parchment.    Perfect place to take a date, family or people visiting town! I love this restaurant.  I went with  BFFs and we sat upstairs at the long table.  Great place to sit for group of  .  Delish and provocative weekly fixed price menu (we had seaweed tagliatelle and lamb roasted over coals, both fabulous).  One of us ordered off the bar menu and had the fabulous gems and cauliflower and Josey Baker's grilled bread  so good.  Good beer and wine selection, and, surprise, an amazing sherry selection. Ambience hip and casual.  All table were taken on a Wednesday night when we went.  Can't wait to go again with my hubby.  Convenient and EZ walking distance from Powell St BART and cable car.  We found street parking across the street. Super meal and great service.   I am not always a fan of fixed price menu's;  however, I was pleasantly surprised by a more than excellent  course meal last Wednesday.   Every bite was delicious  beginning with the beef tongue ""tonnato, the seaweed tagliatelle,  the entree of roasted lamb and finally the ricotta cheesecake for dessert.   Compliments to the chef for the excellent choices of good ingredients resulting in such delightful tastes.   I will recommend this restaurant to my friends and hope to try future fixed menus. Barb P While the revised format of having a Price Fixed Menu alongside some additional selections may not be for everyone who enjoyed the ""original"" TBD, I think people will be very pleased. Last night we both enjoyed the set menu very much. Every piece from the Chef's amuse bouche through dessert was balanced, flavorful and beautifuly presented. In each case the chef came to our table to describe and explain the dish (classy) and the waitstaff as well as the sommelier were personable and not pushy. The atmosphere was great and not stuffy. Because the menu rotates weekly you can be assured of creative options. I haven't been impressed with restaurants for awhile. Finally, I came across TBD. The concept was fun, food was creative and flavors were bright. Service was fine. My only gripe was that we had the pork rillettes that came with very little bread. When we asked for more bread, they never told us it was extra charge. When our bill came, we were charged $ for the  pieces of bread we got. You do smell like smoke when you leave so make sure you wear something you don't mind washing. Awesome spot, so ""San Francisco"" and I love it. The menu is amazing and really affordable. About $ for  courses! I loved the gem salad and I can't remember what else I had because I dined there last week, but I know it was awesome. On top of the tasting menu, my friend and I shared like  appetizers  all delicious. Good spot, but definitely super loud  you can't really have a quiet, conversational dinner here. i came here w/ friends to try out their new prix fixe concept.  the food is pretty good, but it sucks, b/c they don't let you substitute anything unless you're a vegetarian.  the entree was salmon, which i liked, but one of my friends is not a salmon fan (and we had made reservations long before we found out the menu of the week), so she basically had to have the veg special, which was roasted cauliflower.  we supplemented the meal w/ the josey baker toast w/ avocado, which was superb.  they had a great soundtrack of s music playing while we dined, and we found ourselves singing along frequently. Lovely appearing restaurant, with humble food. Nicely presented and above average. Not worth the price of the fixed menu. Great experience tonight at TBD. After reading some of the previous reviews, we were unsure (perhaps 'tbd') upon making reservations, but net net, it was really a quite enjoyable evening. The food was unique and well prepared from the balsamic fig salad to the fisherman's stew ending with the tres leches. We sat at the bar and received incredible service. There seemed to be a high degree of attention and genuineness on the part of the staff. With the prix fixe menu and limited choice, TBD is probably not for everyone and likely will vary from week to week, but if you're open minded, it's a great value and well worth it. In San Francisco, we have so many choices. It's nice to sit back from time to time and be guided through a well prepared meal. I also added the wine pairing and experienced some unique vintages and varietals I otherwise would not have tried  well beyond your standard Napa Cab or Sonoma Pinot. Love the decor. The food was delicious. TBD has only been open for   months now but I believe it's set up for success. Every dish we had embodied such intriguing flavors (descriptions on the menu don't explain it a tad bit) My favorites were definitely the short rib (fell right off the bone, so tender) and the catfish with garlic. Menus change every week so who knows if they'll ever serve those again. $ for pre fixe   course dinner (no subs allowed, unless you notified them before due to dietary restrictions). Overall, super attentive service (sometimes felt a bit rushed to finish dishes though). Overheard they use sherries instead of hard liquor for their cocktails. Id be interested in trying one next time! Great Experience. You can watch the Chef cook from upstairs view. This restaurant was wonderful when it first opened. The food was good, the service was professional. We came back after few months and it was still good. However, we went there last night for the third time and the menu was completely different. Food was average, choices were very limited, and wine was forgettable and overpriced. Either the chef was on a vacation or something going on with the team. It's not what it used to be. Last night will be the last time we ever come here. I went to TBD with my family last Friday night, great atmosphere and we had a wonderful experience.  The seasonal food as fantastic and the service was warm a friendly.  So far parking hasn't been a problem, I was able to find a spot almost across the street from the restaurant. TBD changed their menu format this week from a la carte to prix fixe for $ without any choices, plus some optional supplements.  They call it a four course menu, but the second course of roasted new potatoes seems more like a side than a course, making the meal seem too expensive for what you get.  While the food was good, it was not great.  Other restaurants, such as Camino, do the open flame cooking thing better.  Also, the space seems unfinished.  We were seated upstairs in a loft with a very, very low ceiling.  The service was just ok and not very organized.  We had to ask for spoons for our soup and serving utensils for the potatoes (everything but the soup is served family style).  Our food definitely needed salt and when we asked for some, our server brought a tiny ramekin with a quarter teaspoon of salt, which seemed precious for a table of six eating the same food.  We had to ask for more, which was irritating after having to ask repeatedly for utensils.  With so many restaurants in the Bay Area, this one just does not stand out. It was girls night out and we were looking for an exceptional meal with exceptionalatmosphere.  We received both and more.  What a treat after a long work day tobe greeted at the door, seated and then from :  : waited on and servedthe most delicious courses: Cool Melon Soup with King Salmon Cerviche and almonds,Pork Butt with smoky eggplant and Bing Cherry Clafoutis.  If I only had themelon soup and the Josey Baker Bread with seaweed the meal would have beena success  but it just got better.  And the wait staff seem to really enjoy workingthere.  Very relaxing atmosphere.  They were attentive but not overly so. Make reservations you won't be disappointed.  We're bringing out husbands backnext time! I really wanted to like this place, but overall, it was a huge disappointment.  Highlights: Ambiance is great. . . mix between cool and comfort Drinks are really good and creative The food as it's described on the menu sounds incredibly interesting, but nothing wows your taste buds and perhaps I missed the memo, but there is no flow to your meal. . . plates come out at random times And if you're on a low carb diet, pray they've run out of the Josey Baker bread because they won't substitute any other bread or carb. We were served mussels, French style, in a broth. With. No. Bread. The worse part?  The service!  Be prepared to have multiple servers and to wait a very long time for anyone to check on you.  Also, if you need a toothpick, don't ask, because your server will recommend that you go two doors down to the restaurant AQ for one (I kid you not!). In their defense, the Manager didn't charge us for our meal after my friend had a heart to heart with him about the terrible service and mediocre food.  It was very generous and unnecessary, as we would have preferred to pay money for a really outstanding meal! I'm really disappointed by my experience with TBD this week. I'd made reservations a few weeks in advance for a group of  girls for an evening with a friend coming in from out of town. I tried to increase my reservation this week by one person and was swiftly kicked to the events group. Long story short, they wouldn't let us dine there unless we committed to a $/person prix fixe menu of items we didn't really want, two courses + dessert (unwanted) only,  excluding tax or booze. Zero flexibility offered. If we were a party of more than , perhaps I'd understand.  But for one last minute addition?  Not cool. There are too many great places in the city to waste time on ones that aren't accommodating. This should maybe be . . Cute, functional concept (the menu's organized according to triangle, which correlates to size/price of dish), and the campfire thing mostly worked. Food was above average, if not amazing. Only one dish (sea bass) was truly awful (fishy, overcooked, poorly conceived and executed). Lamb, steak, cauliflower, sausage, salad, etc, etc all good. Dessert ok. Not worth detailing which dishes were good because the menu constantly changes. The issue was that our waitress sort of sucked. She couldn't answer basic questions, and then COMPLETELY oversold us. You only get one chance to order here, which is odd  you cannot order and then if it's not enough food, order some more (despite the smallish plates concept). So we ordered our dishes and she told us we needed at least  more. Worst advice ever. We'd have been fine with our initial order and should've trusted our own instincts. It was a gluttonous mass of food and we couldn't finish it. And we ended up paying about $ for , and that only includes  drinks. Then, toward the end of the meal, we (for some reason) were given a different waitress. This one was much better, more professional and less shaky, but when we got our bill, she asked us to contribute to a charity she supports, and gave us the URL etc to do so. Dude! We should've just donated those unnecessary  upsold dishes to the charity. While it was cute and some dishes were quite good, I don't think I'd go back. Great food and atmosphere. I enjoyed the cauliflower, asparagus lamb And steak. And the dessert was delicious. I would order the s'more and ice cream to share!Some people called the atmosphere smoky but I disagree. It was clear and my clothes didn't smell the next day. Overall, an awesome experience in an unassuming location (tucked between th and th, next to a Subway). The food itself was great, very diverse and creative menu. It's great for carnivores and fellow paleo eaters: lots of meats, vegetables and gluten free options. One thing I will say is I wish they had more seafood options when I went! Their wine and beer selection was pretty extensive. Don't forget about the dessert they were amazing! The service was great too, not too intrusive or negligent. Atmosphere was informal and friendly we conversed with people sitting nearby. It definitely has a rustic and cozy feel, with lot of wood, open fire/kitchen and hunting memorabilia. But at the same time, it has good lighting and an ""airy"" and light feel to the whole place. My only minor complaint is the price per actual weight of the food, especially if you are starving (like I was before my dinner!) and want a satisfying meal. You will easily spend + for a nice meal paired with wine. But, again it's San Francisco and food is king in this town. What a treat!This was the first dining experience I had in San Francisco, and it really set a fantastic tone and standard for dining.  I found that the staff were all very friendly and knowledgeable; they answered any questions we had, and were easy to suggest drinks or make special accommodations for dietary restrictions. We had the chef's tasting menu ($ ea. ) and were provided such a splendid variety of dishes on the menu, and in such quantity that we left stuffed and elated.  Although we didn't opt for a pairing menu, the bartender was very helpful with picking out matching beers for me, and wines for the other person.  I thought that the chef, Alex, coming to say hello to us and detailing the dishes was a fantastic and intimate touch to the meal; he was very attentive and had even asked if there was anything we didn't receive but wanted to try. The restaurant had a rustic vibe, plenty of seating, and even a little spot right in front of the wood fire grill (man, was it toasty!), which provided a view of the chefs at work.  I would make a reservation if you're dining around the rush of dinnertime, and suggest that anyone willing to make the trip will not be disappointed. This was a great meal, and a great evening! You can get a similar experience by attempting to cook food over a real campfire and throwing $ pp into the flames. Yep, it's that bad. ATMOSPHERE: It was scorching hot because of the furnace, which I imagine is really cozy in the winter time. However, it was not so pleasant during one of the few heat wave weeks of the year in San Francisco. Maybe TBD could turn down the heat during those weeks? The decor is really cute, though  open kitchen, rustic tables with pull out drawers for silverware. A great place for a wintery date. FOOD: I had the charred octopus, smoked cauliflower with raisins, roasted lamb, seaweed bread, and s'mores. Almost everything was executed poorly and burnt. The octopus was. . . chewy. There's pleasant chewy, which is al dente with a little extra chew, and then there's  second chewy. This was the latter. The smoked cauliflower tasted sour and burnt. The roasted lamb was a good texture and not burnt, which was a welcome relief. The seaweed bread was hard as a fire briquette, burnt, slathered in butter, and sprinkled with nori. I like the novel combination of nori with butter but the bread itself hurt my gums. The s'mores were tasty but nothing revolutionary, just the flavors of the classic campfire snack broadly reimagined as a fancy chocolate cake.  The fancy TBD s'mores are all one texture: finely ground graham crackers, finely sifted chocolate, finely emulsified marshmallow. I would've preferred the real textures of s'mores, or at least s'mores fondue. BILL: For a drink and a few dishes shared with my dining camp anion, it was about $ per person not including tip. The waitress said we ordered on the ""light"" side, too. Wow, that was a lot to eat some charred food in a sauna. For the record, I love sister restaurant AQ, so I really wanted this to work. Sorry, AQ, for the blistering review. If this cost less than $ for me and my partner, I would've given  stars for ambience and service. The food here, as others have commented, is too creative for its own good. Some too bland, some too salty, and some just dry as arizona in summer. If Im going to spend this kind of money, I'll go to AQ next door which is a bit pricier but X better in the cuisine department. Other than my hair smelling like campfire at the end of the meal, everything was excellent at TBD.  I enjoyed every dish we ordered, especially the clams with charred fava beans, charred octopus, and pork chop with charred strawberries.  Yes they have an open fire stove/grill and they love to char the hell out of everything. In the right way. I'd absolutely go back just for the  dishes mentioned above.  Also one of the chefs apparently likes mazzy star, great taste in music chef! Just wow. This place is another reason that SOMA has turned it around in the past number of years. If you're looking for a place that feels hip and will make sure friends have a great time and a great meal, I'd definitely recommend it. A few highlights:Sherry: They are one of the restaurants in SF that is on board with the sherry trend that popped up in London at Jose a while back. Instead of wine, try pairing some glasses of palo cortado or other semi dry sherries. The bartender was incredibly knowledgeable and got pretty excited when we expressed interest. Veggies: The almost Scandinavian preparations really came out with deceptively simple dishes like the charred leeks. Sitting at the bar: You can enjoy watching the chefs in their denim aprons manage the huge fireplace while talking to the bartender about the sherry selection. Hours of entertainment. Soft serve: Yeah, seriously. They have a flavor of the day. It was honey when I was there. Amazingly good. Guten free notes: Most things on the menu are gluten free. You'll be happy. One of my new fave spots in SF! While the decor is much more beautiful at AQ, I much more prefer the slightly better prices, better quality food, & more rustic vibe at TBD. RESERVATIONS: For Friday, pm. The staff was nice about our many last min changes. It was busy, not crowded, likely no wait. We sat at a communal table upstairs, around the corner: no view of downstairs, but at least the music was quieter. THE SERVICE: Great, patient, friendly, good recs & descriptions. THE COST: $ total (incl. tax/tip) for a filling dinner: x$ , x$, x$ , x$ dessert, split  ways.

If I had a favorite ski chalet, this is what it would look like. Perfect for a date night, especially when the fog rolls in. We came in last night and were greeted by the friendly staff the smoke smell from the huge, roaring grill. We were then seated upstairs, where we had a prime view of said grill and the busy kitchen staff. Advised to order   dishes to share, although  + dessert would have been plenty. Some standouts: the tequila cocktail; Josey Baker bread with butter and seaweed; chicken sausage (house made is so much better than whatever else I've been eating); grilled asparagus and egg; and those damned s'mores in a big bowl. I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews of TBD, we had a wonderful time there last night. As many have noted, the ambiance is sublime, I'd classify it as Alpine Modern. Service was attentive and knowledgable, and the food was simply delightful we started with a couple of well balanced and impeccably served cocktails, and then moved onto dinner where I was especially impressed with the Josey Baker bread & seaweed, the beef with house ""A "" sauce, and the s'mores for dessert. In short, I give it high marks all around. The only negative was the carrot dish, which I found a bit bland, and not terribly remarkable. A cozy and delicious spot, perfect for a chilly San Francisco evening. //Made a reservation here after seeing the menu and pics of the insane grill thing. SEEMED great! Alot of new places are getting back to using live fire and wood and I love the whole thing. So we went here after a few cocktails at AQ next door, which were great. At first I thought that TBD didn't have cocktails, but they actually do just not a full bar. Their 'Loophole' drinks are really good and worth it. Their beer list is impressive, as well. We got some complimentary Sherry. . . Tasty, thank you. The food, however. . . . well, unfortunately, we ordered ALOT. And not one thing was good. Not one thing was cooked properly. Not one thing was seasoned properly. The sum of the ingredients equaled ZERO.  Impossible to eat toasted bread for a bruschetta type dish. Couldn't cut it with a knife! We needed a band saw! Overcooked Hangar Steak. . A temperature wasn't asked for, and it came out well done. No juiciness, no love, no flavor, no salt.  Lame Pork Chop. Fatty, chewy, DRY, flavorless, overcooked. What a shame to kill a pig for this. We ate tons more, but I erased most of the meal from my memory, because it was just an insult. I felt personally insulted that someone tasted this food and sent this food out in its' condition and thought to their self: ""Yo Bro, this shit is BANGIN! We rock! Michelin Star, here we come!!"" The person in charge of the food this day should go away. Go back to Golden Gate park and forage some skill and technique beyond assembling some ingredients on a cool plate. A waste of an amazing grill, a waste of the $ or so spent there, a waste of time, a waste of what COULD be a great spot. . . . The NIGHT, however, was NOT wasted because we went to KIn Khao afterwards and ate a PROPER meal with some flavor. Thanks, Pim! Bravo!AVOID. DEATHWATCH. ALL that stuff. . . . get a new chef, please. Love the ambiance, but was really disappointed with the food. I think they need to focus their creative energies a little. The ingredients were all fresh, but I found the seasoning too salty and certain flavor profiles a little overwhelming. Would eat the cauliflower and octopus again, if I had to. Would go again but only if somebody else was dying to try it! Also, it's tapas style  so be sure to dine with a date that's not picky! :) And don't go for a first date since you'll both smell like smoke when you leave (which is not my choice of aphrodisiac. . . ). Cute concept. All the utensils are in a drawer. After loving AQ, I thought this place was just as good. I was disappointed. I eat pretty salty food and alot of it was overly salty and everything I ate looked like a jungle. cauliflower smoked gribiche & golden raisins not bad, minus the raisins. I just don't like raisins, but the cauliflower wasn't bad and not too salty. josey baker bread & seaweed pretty good and very filling. The bread was just a tad bid too hard for my liking. Some corn cake thing was too dryThe ham on a stone with pink daikon was my favorite. It went really well togetherSalad with all these random things in it. I did like the dehydrated onion that went with it. Not too heavy on the dressing. This was another good dishEgg with very burnt and tiny asparagus not sure what to make of this dish. Grilled artichokes a huge jungle. Not sure what I was eating. Steak was cooked perfectly, but nothing specialOn the menu it said sea bass, but we got groper it was horrible! over cooked and very smelly fish. None of us could finish this. Smores this was pretty good and not overly sweet. First visit. Say at the lounge area by the door. Love the deco and the feel if the place. Creative and simplicity of it is wonderful. The open wood burning cooking style, one of the unique concepts I've seen and differently gives the food a depth of flavor. Menu changes so not sure if what we had would be available but the fried bread was a no. Too hard and basically no flavor. Muscles with burnt bread. . . Absolutely one of the best cooked and flavored muscle dish I ever had. I had to order a second one. Looking forward to the next visit. Painfully loud. Few things screamed delicious: Josey Baker bread topped with seaweed and house cured butter. Two massive pieces were a $ steal considering*: venturebeat. com///….  Beef kielbasa smoked on the captivating focal point of the space  the open flame grill. Served on a bed of sauerkraut, it was searing in looks and in taste.  Grilled fished atop a double play of beets and Rancho Gordo beans. Texture didn't overwhelm but the flavor certainly did.  S'mores finale uniquely prepared as a block of fudge surrounded by graham cracker sprinkles and a chicory pudding. Pioneering perfection. But a few things were just too loud: Pain of the fish price ($) offset some of the pleasure.  Carrots both as a side and the ones served with the artichokes acted as more of a sponge absorbing all the sauces and seasoning. It was overdone.  Aforementioned artichokes suffered the same excessively flavored fate along with an excessive $ cost.  Two triangle ($ per the symbolic pricing) salad was a mix of greens, bacon and egg distorted by a dressing mess. We finished just half. Then there were a few noise violations: Male foursome nearby were loud and obnoxious. Oblivious to the world except for their incessant smartphones, they did a masterful job reinforcing the tech stereotype.  Shriek from my wallet glancing at the upwards of $/glass of wine.  Tables so close together it was like an airplane only we weren't moving. Make sure you come with someone you don't mind leaning in for conversation. Four star beginning was firmly in three star territory until I thought more about some of the quietest moments of the night: No offer to change our plates between extremely distinct courses.  No inquiry as to why some food was left unfinished (aka the salad).  No thank you as we left by either the server or the lingering staff. There were some wins. But there were a few more losses. Two stars speaks loudest. *Absolutely worth it: yelp. com/biz/the mill sa… Pros: Great ambienceSome of the chairs have fur. . Great for all the ladies out thereMenu is seasonal and hence changes frequently Thats's about itCons:We had a reservation for . . But had to wait  minutes to be seated at a table. Depressingly low quantities of food/drinks and ridiculous prices considering the quantities. Come on, even fine dining restaurants can do better. Drinks were tasty but each drink was probably around a quarter of a glass. We ended up ordering loads of drinks by the end. We looked up yelp before deciding to visit this restaurant. It seemed as if there were ample options for people with dietary restrictions (vegetarian, seafood only, chicken only etc).  At the time of our dinner, there was hardly any veg/chicken/seafood options. Menu was stuffed with beef and pork and some of us ended up hardly eating anything. We tried cauliflower (starter), baked beans (starter), smoked beef kielbasa sausage, smoked mussels, charred octopus, the whole hog ($), some beef item, s'mores (desert), semolina cake (desert), strawberry lime (soft serve ice cream of the day). Out of all these dishes, Mussels and s'mores were tasty, though ridiculously less quantities. Rest of the dishes were ok or intolerable. SF is a city of food lovers. We love trying new restaurants, pay a slightly premium price and will be happy to visit again and again (with more people) if a restaurant is good. But I will definitely not visit them again! a great tasting menu. totally reasonable, a huge amount of food spanning all of the highlights of the menu, with great service and beverage pairings throughout. it may seem like the nosebleeds, but the counter upstairs has a great view of the open kitchen and are the best seats in the house. you might smell like a campfire for a day or two from the open wood grill, but it's worth it. highlights: the cauliflower with smoked gribiche, cocoa lamb loin, the s'mores dessert, the the oloroso sherry i had after. one note: i loved the soundtrack of s alt rock hits (pixies, weezer, i think smashing pumpkins?) but it could deemed too loud for some. This has huge potential, but missed on execution. I wasn't blown away. Some dishes good. Maybe one was great. Concept is brilliant. Hopefully, they dial it in a bit and I'll go back. Very impressed!  We sat at the bar watching the big grill. The ""old man and the sea"" was a delicious cocktail.  The steak with the ""A"" was great.  The trout was cooked to perfection.  I will definitely be back. I don't go out to dinner much. When I do, I go with my adult children and tend to pick restaurants that they would like as much as I would. I picked TBD because it sounded like we could share a bunch of dishes, still get full and enjoy each other's company. To me, going out to dinner is much more about conversation and companionship. Food is important. . . but the atmosphere of the place has to be right. I made a reservation for pm and we were seated way upstairs at the far end of the communal table. At first, I was little annoyed because I like to people watch in restaurants. And there is no people watching up here. But I'm glad we were up there. The downstairs is super hot and noisy. No conversation possible at all. The music playing overhead was an interesting Pandora station and I must say that trying to guess which 's band was playing was hilarious. Good drinking game! Food: okay here's where my  stars comes from because the service was excellent despite other reviewers. They seem to have gotten this down well. The food was pretty good. I read other yelp reviews pretty carefully and got the idea of which were the must haves. . and I agree. The bread/seaweed dish is fantastic. Sure, it's salty. . . but I like salty! The arepa was very good. We ordered a second round of both of these. The kale salad had too much anchovy. . but it was still okay. We had pork chops, steaks and kielbasa and baked beans to kind of finish things off. All very good. Cooked perfectly.  The heritage carrots were a waste of time. The turnips that came with the steak were  star. . . where the hell do you get baby turnips? My only gripe for everything is nothing was hot. I dunno. . . I like stuff hot. People complain when I cook that everything comes to the table scalding! But that's just me. We had some great wine. Three bottles. . . that's how we do it in the !! It was the syrah. . . definitely a good choice and not too expensive. But if you're watching pennies, don't go here. It was $. For desert we got a small piece of the semolina cake [it was my birthday] and the soft serve ice cream. Awesome. I avoided the s'mores because they are served cold. . . WTF? Who has cold s'mores? The decor is interesting and I felt very comfortable here. The chairs are large and comfortable upstairs with sheep skin throws over them! Tables are large with plenty of room to spread out and see your food. I don't understand why people think this is an iffy neighborhood. It's perfectly fine. Born and raised in SF and I can tell you, this area has improved %. Parking was a breeze. One of the worst experiences in SF dining scene. Last night, group of almost  people having drinks at the bar while waiting to be seated. I ask for a specific glass of wine, the bartender poured me half glass saying ""we don't have more of this wine but it's ok I  will charge you half the price"". I replied jokingly that ""since you cannot give me a full glass it would be nice from your part not to charge at all"". The bartender said: "" You're right, I'll take care of that"". After minutes and while we were still at the bar, the host of the restaurant comes to me and in a very loud way tells me: "" Sir, I hear that you don't want to pay for you wine"". I explained to him what happened and he is trying to pull the glass from my hand saying : "" I'll get you another wine but full glass"". I replied that ""there is no need, I'm fine with the half glass of the wine that I have"". Next thing the host did was to go to some of the people in my group and ""informed"" them that I didn't want to pay for my wine!!   Such a disappointment. . . Never again. I had a wonderful meal  today. A wide variety. The portions could've been bigger but very inventive menu and great service Nice decor, nice staff, but the food was hit or miss. . . Came for a friends birthday dinner so the menu was set and served family style. The good:  Cauliflower: nicely roasted with a tasty sauce Pickled beets: I love beets and thought these were perfectly tart Sausage: good flavor and nicely cooked  S'more: fun take on s'more flavorsThe ok:  Bread and seaweed: bread was a little burnt and thought the seaweed was an interesting choice of accompaniment, not good, but not bad Beef: good flavor but a bit chewy Carrots: I don't like carrots but heard they were ok Grits: good flavor but very mild  Soft serve: pineapple flavored, was just ok, skipped it for the other dessert (s'more) The bad:  Octopus: Way too toughWhile the portions were good, we hoped that more dishes would fall into the ""good"" category. With so many great choices in SF, I probably wont make my way back here. . . Two stars for the ambiance, decor and creative menu. . . Was let down by all six courses my man and I shared. . . The trout wasn't bad, but all the other dishes were either bland, too salty or just mediocre. Will be trying AQ next. . . Loved the ambiance of TBD!  Some of the items were really good and some of the veggies or accompanying parts of the dish were really salty.  Your silverware is placed in a drawer in front of you (loved the concept). Food: Seaweed Bread (large pieces of bread slathered in butter and seaweed).  This was really salty and really heavy. Cauliflower: really delicious and perfectly charredBeef:  loved the beef and turnips, the greens were overly salted. Might come back here again but would hope to try less saltier dishes.  star cuisine,  star service. It shall be a classic business school case study: how shitty customer service can ruin great product. Sad. . . We made a reservation for a big party, for  p. m. Two of our party were late. We asked to be seated. The manager refused  according to their rules the whole party must be present. The restaurant was virtually empty, but he kept us waiting, hungry, for  min  they have the strict rules. They do important work; we, customers, create inconvenience for them. Felt like the Soviet Union : (Well, they lost our business We were sorely disappointed with our experience at TBD. The service was great, and the wine recommendation was outstanding, but that's pretty much where the positive notes end. We shared several starters and appetizers, and they were unremarkable at best. The most memorable part of the meal was (unfortunately) the Florentine steak, which took an hour to prepare. We were warned about the preparation time on the steak, and that was fine with us. However, when it came out WELL DONE (they didn't even ask us how we wanted it  we assumed it would be between rare and medium rare as a good steak should be), we were appalled. The rarest parts were medium, and parts of the steak were brown through and through. For an excellent Florentine steak, go to Cotogna instead. This was very disappointing, particularly in light of how excellent AQ is. Very well decorated interior that gives a warm vibe to the environment (perhaps it's best of the big fire burning at the back of the kitchen). The food is very thoughtful, flavorful, and different. Each dish we had were all full of surprises. I'd recommend ordering the beef or trout just to settle down the stomach though, as each dish are small in volume (but when you are packing very intense flavor into your dishes you do not want them to be big, so I understand why). I really liked the carrot while my girlfriend enjoyed the arepa. This is definitely a restaurant where everyone can find at least a dish that he or she can relate to. Food was surprisingly good. Been skeptical of places that try to be too inventive.  Loved the pork in tea leaves and this hen dish.  The ambience is a bit much for me. . . trying too hard to be hip and quirky, kinda like the entire Valencia street. No full bar which is a big negative My boyfriend heard about TBD in one of his GQ magazines and wanted to try it out since we live not too far. It's located in SoMa and if you don't know you're looking for it, it can be easily missed. The ambiance is very laid back with minimal decor, but it works for them. What I love is their open kitchen and how they cook with an open fire. If you enjoy a subtle, smokey taste this place is a must. If you don't, definitely give this place a go. Their menu changes seasonally and also depending on what is available, the items we grubbed on may not be on their menu all year longWhat we had: Beer (i think the name was ""golden"" something. . . yummy and fruity) Andouille sausage (a must get if on menu) duck blood sausage (never had it but happy my first time was here  amazing) Squid (very tasty with grapefruit)    Beans (I'm not a huge fan of beans, but the thick pieces of baconhad be enjoying every bite)Service was great everyone was knowledgable and attentice! I happened into this place because it was dinner night with Annie. We chose it on a lark, based on ratings of the parent restaurant, AQ. Super impressed! The food was fundamentally delicious, and super cute too. It's all small plates, and  of them for  people was a good dinner. Definitely full, not stuffed. The winner of the evening was the black trumpet mushrooms with farmer's cheese (in broth  eat the broth), but the seaweed bread is even more important to get for dipping. Service was attentive. Our server recommended a super good wine to go with our last course (we chose our own for prior courses), and that leaves. . . nothing to complain about. Decor was cute, too. The ""drawer"" silverware was adorbs and the southwest motif worked. (This IS a newer San Francisco restaurant so obviously it's not going to be quiet, you need a reservation even on a Monday night, and it costs money. ) Disappointing.  Liked the sound of most of the dishes, and since the  of us shared I got to taste most of the menu. Nothing was great. Nothing was horrible  although the octopus portion was so small it was hard to say. Good waitress and interesting decor.  I'd go back if it was nearby but wouldn't go out of my way. While there are a few meat based dishes here, most of the dishes are still vegetable heavy, and the experimentation here doesn't quite appeal to my tastes.  Also, while the open campfire feel of the kitchen was a nice touch, the smell of smoked wood drenched my clothes for the rest of the night. Too much like Bar Tartine  if you're a fan of that place, you will probably like this as well.  Not my cup of tea though. Excellent new restaurant in San Francisco. The way they prepare the food, over the open flame,  gives it such a great flavor.  It's not just the meat and sausage that come out great, also the vegetarian food was great. Best carrots I ever had. Also great andouille sausage. Great atmosphere and very nicely decorated as well. Highly recommended."
ICHI Sushi + NI Bar|3.5|Japanese in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|109|-1|3.78409090909|" I came here to get omakase with my roommate and my friend. We're talking about a swanky restaurant that has the feel of a bar and a sushi diner all rolled up into one, but one thing I will say is that you can't have both. As much as I liked the ambience at this restaurant, it lost some of the old school Japanese feel to it. You know what I mean? The one that makes you feel like you can wield a samurai sword and slice all the freaking fish in the restaurant on your own! ALL ABOUT THAT ACTION BOSS. But lets get down to the nitty gritty stuff. Let's talk food. This place was pretty damn good when it came to the omakase. We ate until we were stuffed and you know what?! No ""REGRATS"". Not even one letter. The place was awesome and the fish was fresh. Most definitely had my fill and I loved every single bit of it. I would definitely recommend getting there early though and putting your name down. You can easily put your name down and sit at the bar in the back to wait. That was pretty awesome. You can also just walk around outside if that is your cup of tea. Good thing there are a lot of random restaurants and stuff to look at outside! But anyways if you ever get a chance, definitely check this place out. The sushi at ICHI was definitely some of the freshest I've had in SF and I loved how they had a good variety of some more uncommon fish, like the delicious Baby Yellowtail and flavorful Katsuo Skipjack Tuna.   The Arctic Char, Amberjack, and Uni were phenomenal. The spicy scallop roll was excellent. My favorites of the night were the Hamachi Belly nigiri and the Amberjack sashimi. The Wagyu Beef sushi was just okay  they shouldn't have cooked it so much and kept it rare, since Wagyu really shines in the raw form.   We also got a Amberjack Collar which was just okay. The pork belly was good, but it was missing a texture contrast  perhaps the (delicious) chicharrones should have been more crispy to offset the fattiness of the succulent pork fat.   Also, I've got to give it some points for using real wasabi. I love going into sushi joints that use real wasabi and not the green dyed horseradish paste that % of sushi places use to save money. Good job, ICHI.   The sushi chef we had (not sure what his name was, but it definitely wasn't Tim) was kind of a douche. I mean, he wasn't very friendly  just very matter of fact and a bit pretentious. When I asked for some wasabi, he gave me this snobby response of: ""All the wasabi you need is already in the sushi. It's made the way it should taste. "" WTF, who do you think you are? Jiro?! Nobody's making documentaries about you. If I'm asking for more wasabi, it's because I like more wasabi in my sushi. And of course, after eating my piece of sushi, it turns out that there really wasn't enough wasabi in there. Asshole.   Anyway, as lame as the sushi chef was, I really was pleased with the quality of the sushi fish here. If you come for the omakase and really enjoy the nigiri/sashimi, ICHI is definitely up there with the best in SF. Omakase # on the  x  Things to Eat Before You Die list. I've had the omakase at ICHI on my ""to eat"" list for a while, so decided to come here for dinner with a friend. I made reservations a few weeks in advance for a :pm dinner on a Friday night however, there were still a couple of tables available along with seats at the sushi bar for walk in customers when we arrived. We were seated away, and I convinced her to do the omakase with me. Our server was really helpful, and thoroughly explained the different options we had with the omakase we could opt for sushi/nigiri only, or a combination of dishes + sushi/nigiri. We could also let them know if we had any allergies, or foods that we didn't like, and also if we wanted to eat something in particular. I loved the flexibility of their omakase, and we opted to go with a combination of dishes + sushi/nigiri, and let the chef choose for us. Our omakase consisted of: Cucumber Salad ($, yelp. com/biz_photos/ichi…): Delicious I loved the miso dressing they used for this salad, and the cucumbers were super fresh, crisp, and crunchy. I could eat a few bowls of this. Maguro Avocado Salad ($. , yelp. com/biz_photos/ichi…): Just ok. . the tuna was fresh, and I enjoyed this dish, but it wasn't so amazing that I'd want to order it again, especially for the price. Skip. Hirame ($) / Suzuki ($) / Tai ($. ) / Katsuo ($) [yelp. com/biz_photos/ichi…: I normally wouldn't order any of these as nigiri, and I didn't really love any of them, but they were all good since they were so fresh. Inada ($) / Shima Aji ($) / Wild Sake ($. ) / Shiro Toro ($) / Sanma ($) [yelp. com/biz_photos/ichi…: The toro and wild sake were definitely my favorites, but all the nigiri were really good since all of the fish were fresh.  Ocean Trout Dashi ($. , yelp. com/biz_photos/ichi…): Yum! I wasn't excited to hear that this was part of the omakase, but I was happily surprised. The ocean trout was cooked well, and the dashi had a good umami flavor recommended! Pork Belly ($. , yelp. com/biz_photos/ichi…): Good, but not amazing. Some pieces of pork belly had the perfect crisp to tenderness ratio, but one piece was overcooked and dry. Skip. Uni ($. / piece, yelp. com/biz_photos/ichi…): Good, but not amazing. I would only order this again if I had a craving for uni. Overall, we had a great dinner at ICHI, and if I came back, I would love to build my own omakase now that I know I can order just  piece of nigiri. One of the only negatives was the really small table my friend and I are short Asian girls, and we felt a bit cramped. Also, the seats weren't the comfortable, and my legs started feeling numb towards the end of the meal. The other negative is the lack of parking in this area there is very limited street parking, and very little parking that is really close to the restaurant, so you're almost guaranteed a short walk. The neighborhood isn't the best depending on which direction you walk, so be careful. Had an awesome omakase experience for our anniversary dinner!  delicious dishes, paired with a sake and sparkling wine (never mind the hangover next day), expertly delivered by Darren and his colleagues. Favorite item? The uni was sublime, but the seared snapper belly may just have taken the top spot in this lineup. Table of , Friday night reservation. There was room at the bar but we opted for a table. Didn't really have a great first impression because the layout of the restaurant is actually a maze. if you're sitting towards the front of the restaurant, you can only get out one way, and the tables are too close together to walk through. Figuring out how to get the bathroom also required a double take. There are a ton of options of the menu. Many people recommend the omakase on Yelp, but we were told it would be in the $+ range. Instead, we opted to try a few of their more izakaya style dishes. Miso Asari Clams: A salty mixed miso soup with clams. It was very oily but delicious. Then, some nigiri. We got the Maguro Zuke, Saba, and Shiro Toro. I didn't like the large amount of wasabi they put on these, since they used fake wasabi. The maguro zuke had very little flavor, and literally tasted like nothing. The other two were a bit more flavourful, but definitely not worth the $.   per piece price. We were pretty disappointed by the quality of the fish. We then got momo yakitori, which is chicken thigh. The meat was very tender and juicy, making us want to order another skewer. We chose the buta katu niku kushiyaki, which was pork shoulder. Also amazingly juicy and delicious. A single skewer was only $.  each, making it the best value to price ratio on the whole menu. I'm surprised no one is talking about these skewer dishes at all. We also tried the kampachi kama, which is amberjack fish collar, the best part of a fish. Very delicious and more filling than most items on the menu. This was $ and great for sharing. We were not full by the end of this meal, but had already spent ~$ each so decided to call it. The service was friendly overall, the interior is very modern and clean, although the layout really bothered me. The non sushi options on the menu are AMAZING, definitely recommend trying them over the overpriced sushi. I really wanted to like this place, based on what I've long heard about it. On the good side, the staff are very friendly. The sushi is also generally the star here, with the emphasis on the core ingredients and less on dressing it up (or disguising inferior fish). And there is a good emphasis on the daily specials  since when it comes to fish, it's always about what's freshly caught. They have many Japanese varieties you don't always see in SF sushi joints. And what you don't see are many of the unsustainably fished staples at most sushi restaurants, such as unagi, etc. You can also go full on omakase here, and the sushi chefs will take care of you with a variety of things to try out. This can get pricey, however, as I would call this place a little more expensive than the norm for SF sushi (especially given their smaller nigiri sizes). They have some nice sake options (cold, of course) on the menu as well. What wasn't so great about ICHI is that the sushi didn't shine here  for being the star attraction. The service is a bit discoordinated, as it's easy to order dishes that come completely out of the order you requested. There are also often long or short gaps between plates, as it is not well metered out. Then comes the weirder stuff. I didn't mind the gentle lecture on the proper way to prepare and eat nigiri, even if being told what you already know is a little like being a scolded child. So I get that any wasabi or soy added to the nigiri is at the sushi chef's discretion of taste (unlike the rolls). But if you're going to give me that lecture, you had better deliver wonderfully flavorful sushi where I wouldn't be tempted to change a thing. That did not happen, and the sushi fell a little short. Between that and a conversation with one of the wait staff about their cold sake (""we could make one hot for you""), I got the strange sense that ICHI is lost somewhere between sushi newbies and sushi patrons who know what to expect. And that's OK  there's nothing wrong with teaching or learning a few things. But there is a fine line between honoring a cultural tradition and parodying a cultural stereotype. Here ICHI seems to follow a number of paint by number superficial details of what makes a Japanese sushi bar while missing out on creating its soul. You get the ""irasshaimase"" greeting, but all the sushi chefs look like skateboarders from Orange County. As if they got together at a Vans sponsored skate park and decided, ""Wouldn't it be cool if we acted Japanese and started a sushi place?""The rest of the wait staff is whiter than a Walnut Creek Cheescake Factory, thus it begs a question: how would you feel about a soul food restaurant run entirely by ethnic Chinese where they spoke in ebonics and lectured you on how to properly prepare and eat collard greens with grits?Asking for something a little more authentic of your sushi, whether it's steeped in Japanese tradition or something decidedly Western, shouldn't be a stretch. But hedging by trying to accomplish both is a recipe for failure. It might fly in Norman, OK, but not when you're just a couple miles from SF's Japantown. With so many better Western or traditional Japanese options in SF for sushi, I won't be back. Fan f*ckin tastic.  I'm unbelievably lazy, so you better believe it takes quite a bit to get me out to Bernal Heights.  The fish was to die, and prices were surprisingly reasonable.  Service was top notch.  Zero complaints.  Actually, one  they had no dessert.  But it wasn't a big deal bc Mitchell's is literally around the corner. Yes. Ichi sushi! This is my favorite sushi place in San Francisco. it just dazzles. It's fresh and flavorful and simple  no gimmicks or heavy sauces needed. Other dishes, such as the cucumber salad, deserve the same descriptors  fresh, flavorful and simple. Worth the drive (assuming you don't live in the neighborhood). Also, you can walk to Mitchell's afterwards for ice cream (and who doesn't want ice cream after a sushi dinner?) REVIEW IS FOR HAPPY HOUR ONLYM F : :Oh muh lord, the happy hour here is really good, and it definitely makes me want to come for dinner one day. Yeah, it's in Bernal Heights which is not hustling and bustling but at least it's easy to find parking, and hey, you can get Mitchell's for ice cream afterwards :)$ oysters YAS. And it doesn't get crowded here like most places in the city because it IS far from everything and it's not close to BART. . The oysters were really good. It came already dressed with ponzu  so you don't use the typical cocktail sauce. SO GOOD  simply: fresh & sweet. I believe the beers were $  or so? Phat pint! I forgot what brand of type of beer were offered but it was decent stuff (I think I got a Stella?! @_@!). We also had the Yuzu chicken wings which is usually $.  but I believe it was $ or  for HH. SO GOOD. Dry fried chicken wings with SO much flavor and light/crispy batter. PERFECTION. Perfect with the ber. The interior is modern, clean, and simple. It looks like their mission is going back to the tradition and basics of basically showcasing the fish / ingredients and not doing anything super crazy or adding a bunch of sauce. MY PHILOSOPHY WHEN IT COMES TO SUSHI AS WELL. Seeing all the good reviews for the omakase and having the nice service means I'm definitely coming back soon! This place! So much going for it! I would highly recommend doing the chefs choice, it was pricey but one of the best meals I have had in recent memory. I would definitely recommend it if you want to have a really nice dinner. Last night, I experienced omakase at Ichi for the first time, and I was completely swept off my feet. The freshness and flavor that is packed into every piece is a marvel simple flavors come together with incredibly fresh fish to form a complex. Even the pieces that aren't for the faint of heart, such as anago and uni, are so enjoyable that anyone can love them. My two favorite pieces were the inagi and shiro toro. The inagi was so fresh and wonderfully seasoned. Shiro toro completely melts in your mouth, and is exploding with flavor. Omakase at Ichi is truly an otherworldly, ethereal experience with food. Go, spend, eat, fall in love. Experiencing food like this is what life is made for. This place was so underwhelming it's insane. The second you step through the front door it smells like old fish, not a good sign. The waitresses are snobby and terrible, food was beyond forgettable, not sure what people see in this place. So good! The service can be a bit slow though. And getting into the restaurant is a nightmare. But the food is good. All the fish is fresh and delicious. Can't get enough of it. Forget the haters. This is easily some of the best sushi and service you will have in the Bay Area. The food was exquisite, the sake was unforgettable, and the service blew me away. Come here, and come here often. Oh my goodness! Where to start!?Come here if you are interested in nigiri sushi. It is not your place to go if you're jones in' for a spider roll. This is also not your place to go if you want to douse your sushi in soy sauce & wasabi it actually spells that out literally as writing on the wall. Fresh fish & fantastic season fish daily & a lovely large sake menu to boot! My husband & I sat at the bar & ordered ordered omakase & had about a dozen pieces each. Everything was good but over half were excellent! Darren was our sushi chef & he was fun & fantastic!! He is incredibly knowledgable & has been doing sushi for just under  decades! He got me to like octopus for the st time in my life!! :)With a great combination of friendly & knowledgable staff, cute trendy atmosphere, & incredibly great ingredients, how can you go wrong?Can't wait to go back again & hopefully we'll get Darren! Delicious! So good! Been hearing about this place for two years and it totally lives up to its rep. So fresh and savory  definitely get the omakase. But please beware of the bartender on weekends. I waited  minutes to order a glass of wine and then he was churlish, cranky and cruel. I can't believe such a lovely establishment wouldn't train that man in basic hospitality. Perhaps I am missing something? In my opinion this is overrated, overpriced, hipster sushi.  Top ten sushi in the city? Sorry but I beg to differ. my friend and i got omakase sushi here last week, and it was tasty.  we sat at the bar, and we had the chef make us whatever he wanted.  the sushi here does not require dipping, as all pieces are already flavored.  we ended up eating most of the specials and then requested a couple other more typical items.  all were good, and the price wasn't too bad. Probably the best sushi I have had in the Bay so far, though I haven't been to that many, in full disclosure (I'm from NY). Ordered omakase at the sushi bar and loved every piece. Very bold flavors. Not super traditional but delicious! Had a great time with the sushi chef also, who was very friendly and entertaining. Reasonable prices. Omakase for two ended up costing us around $! Will definitely come back again. What a fantastic place for omakase, and reasonably priced, too! Tadashi san was our sushi chef, and he was an absolute delight. This place is very good. I would say that this is my nd favorite sushi place in the US, right behind my beloved Yasuda in NYC. The fish here is amazing and the variety is great. Also the waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the fish and the tastes, I had asked her for a few recommendations and picked amazing fish. I didn't try the rolls I am more of a nigiri type of guy so I ate that. I was also really surprised with the price extremely reasonable, I had a party of  and we ordered a ton and we repeated many fish and had an $ bottle of sake. The bill came in just north of $ with tip. This to me was not bad at all. When I go to yasuda in NYC I spend that much for a party of  and with no sake. I will definitely update this when I go back,  hopefully in   months. I live on the east coast so I don't get out there too much but would recommend this place and for a first date is good too as long as the person you take really values good fish. I've had Omakase three times now and each has been an incredible experience. The nigiri is perfect and the small plates are great. Get a reservation a few weeks in advance, sit at the sushi bar, and let them amaze you! I LOVE Ichi. The folks who run the place are some of the sweetest I know, and the chefs are incredibly talented. My boyfriend and I made a reservation, and were super excited to see the new space. When we showed up, the group ahead of us was just wrapping up so the hostess suggested we have a drink at the bar while we wait. No biggie. The server at the bar was helpful in recommending a sake and we had the Ichi beer, which was full of flavor but refreshing, as well. Then, we went a little crazy ordering from the bar menu: clams, eggplant, chicken wings, cold somen. Everything sounded delicious. I had to remind my bf that we still had omakase to make room for. He was undeterred. He said we could do it. Our table at the sushi bar opened up more quickly than we anticipated and before our dishes arrived at the bar in the back. But, the hostess said that they'd get delivered to us at the sushi bar and helped us with our drinks. The seating at the sushi bar is a little squishy but not uncomfortably so. Perhaps the people next to us were just taking over more than their allotted space. Either way, it was cozy, in a good way, for the two of us. Our sushi chef, Daniel, introduced himself. We told him we wanted omakase, that we eat any and everything, and that we had ordered a bunch of dishes from the bar already. He said no problem; he'll take good care of us. Then, the influx of food came  one dish at a time so not overwhelming. The clams with pork was amazing. I wanted a bigger bowl of that. I would eat that all day. The grilled eggplant was super flavorful. The chicken wings were tender and juicy. For the sushi, I can't remember all of what we had because we had so much but the standouts were the scallop (incredibly sweet and buttery), the shrimp two ways (raw body on rice and fried head on the side  the fried head was delicious; I wish more places served fried shrimp head), and the uni (amazing how something can taste so much like the sea). I was stuffed. I couldn't even eat the last complimentary piece that Daniel put in front of us. Everything we had was delicious, exquisitely prepared, and all the nigiri had the right balance of warm rice and cool, perfectly seasoned seafood. I would put a bite in my mouth and just let it sit there for a second before chewing and savoring the flavors and textures. My boyfriend, who I was a little concerned about since he likes dunking his sushi in soy sauce with lots of wasabi, was beyond okay in trusting Daniel. He didn't ask for soy sauce or wasabi, and enjoyed each bite. That's a huge win. And, as for the price, it was totally reasonable for how much we ate and drank. So, for the quality and creativity of the food and the attentive but not overbearing service, Ichi is on the top of my list of sushi places in SF. It all started in the wrong way. We sat at the bar ( awful position for a bar ). The bartender was not looking comfortable at all. After we asked her a suggestion for a sake, she gave it to us but never came back to ask if we liked it (unacceptable from a professional)The hostess ""almost"" pretended to be friendly and caring. Once we sat at the table, we had to wait  minutes to receive the menu ( mind that it was not in the rush of service ). The food from the kitchen was good. Didn't blow my mind but properly prepared. The sushi was absolutely disappointing. Definitely overpriced ( even the not so exotic items )The rice seemed cooked in rush. Or at least I hope for them, otherwise . . . . It does happened that if you get super busy, you need to cook rice in the middle of service. Good luck !Bottom line, seating at the table was disappointing. Wait staff not prepared. Busers very polite. From far, it seems that the sushi men are proper: people seemed entertained. I will not go back. This place is definitely good for their Nigiri sushi. They are confident that it's prepared and seasoned just right so there is no soy sauce on the table for you to kill the flavor with.  Cold and Hot plates were good too but don't  bother with the rolls. + Toro Nigiri (Fatty Tuna) *+ Butterfish *+ Hotate Nigiri (Scallop) *+ Squid Salad  *+ Miso Clam Soup *+ Nice Modern Clean Decor with Fun Wall Mural+ Service was great but we also went early on in the night Rolls ** Seating Space (Reservations Recommended) maybe too much green tea salt on the omakase set. but still very tasty and fresh! Their sushi is incredibly fresh. The nigiri is mind blowing although the seaweed wraps can be a little chewy. Their rolls are really good too, though same problem with the seaweed. The sake list is amazing, though, and so tasty! The waitstaff if attentive and courteous, however the food is overpriced and mediocre.  In an area with many quality dining options you can do better than Ichi Sushi.  Take your hard earned elsewhere. Ichi has never failed us  the fish is always fresh, service impeccable, flavors perfectly balanced, and I would trust the omakase selections any day.  I've had sushi all over the Bay Area, and this place is always one of our very tops.  It's just hard to get in sometimes because they are so darn good!  And let's not forget the proprietors, Tim and Erin Archuleta.  They are amazing.  Love, love, love. The fish wasn't fresh. On a Thursday night, our maguro and ocean trout sashimi had that old, fishy taste to them. In fact, we maybe should have guessed from the fishy smell when we walked into the place. It wasn't all bad  the beef tataki was excellent, and the hotate and wakame salad were fine  but bad fish at a sushi restaurant is the cardinal sin. Sorry to say I won't be back. Showed up right as they opened and were granted seats at the bar. +Sake shiso maki: small rolls with salmon and shiso. Simple. Shiso, typically known as the wasabi receptacle (you know, that leaf), is insanely delicious in a sake roll; the leaf makes it almost refreshing. +Inari nigiri: deep fried (kinda sweet) tofu stuffed with rice. Tasty as a dessert. +Umi masu sashimi: three slices of ocean trout goodness. Incredibly delicious and sustainable. Gluttony sans the guilt, can't get any better than that. +Spicy yellowtail specialty roll: simple, but with a spicy green sauce drizzled on top. Pretty good. +Miso soup: basic. Did I detect a hint of booze in there? Weird. Cute joint ensconced in a not so cute neighborhood. Great service and fair prices (for the quality of sushi). Definitely give it a try if you're into basic, but delicious, sushi. Born and raised native with a foodie palate. . . I gotta be honest. This place is a pure rep of gentrification right here. Food is clean, no doubt. But way over priced and nothing crazy mind blowing original. I spent almost$ for two of us. Full of white folks, with no neighborhood rep whatsoever. And that says something. I had to check to white girls from getting in line at opening bc they thought they could  cut  bc ""they had reservations"". . . that kinda place.  We ordered the house ichibier  ($), maguro and hamchi  nigiri, chicken wings ($. ) beef tataki (. ) pork belly (. ). . . cali roll (. ). . . mostsu nikomi (tripe and short rib) ( . ). . . tataki we order one Skewer of pork shoulder (. ) and one Skewer of flank stea (. ). . . seriously everything was good. But really NOT GREAT. To. much cash for the what it is. I would come to just try nigiri and short ribs dish. The service was dope but food took forever to come out. Im bummed. Thats a lot of cash to spend on a dinner. Good lord, I think I found heaven. I'm a sushi snob, so when my friend suggested this place, I was a bit wary. At the end of it I was % wrong and I'm glad I did. When we first got there, it was a wait so we put down our number for a text. An hour later, we got the text and headed over there. We sat by the sushi bar and our server was really helpful in assisting us in what we wanted. We were able to select a set menu and ate to our hearts content. I'm  a big albacore sushi fan and I can still taste it in my mouth. When I say it's like an orgasm in your mouth, I am not lying. It was better than sex. It was better than Nutella. Heck, it was better than sex AND Nutella. SO. DAMN. GOOD. The baby barracuda was banging as well. I think by the end of it I may or may have not proposed to my waiter, that's how good it was. It's a bit pricey, but it is worth it if you love good sushi! Showed up and put our names on the wait list, because they don't take reservations. Waited  hours, and at the end of the  hours they told us the restaurant was closing and they wouldn't be able to serve us. Wow.  I mean. . . . Wow. Yay! Was able to walk in without reservations on Fri at pm. Although we were told to get out by :pm sheesh. . . The food is super fresh tasting. We were so hungry, we wolfed everything down. We had the crab roll, the spicy halibut roll, got some Japanese eggplant which is to die for! There weren't anything extra creative that makes them different from other sushi places. I mentioned to my friends that that sushi in Hawaii, they get so creative and different with the rolls. You know, like a signature roll that they created/invented. Order bit by bit cuz there were the  of us and couldn't fit all the food. Small table, ya know?No desserts, bo. . . not even mochiService is excellent! Food arrived promptly. Finally got reservations here!  We haven't visited since they moved and expanded to Ichi Ni.  We had super fond memories at their original location, in fact I went around telling friends + others it's the best sushi in SF.  Well. . . Ichi Ni isn't quite how we remembered our experience but I would like to say the sushi is fresh and different from what you'd get at your average Japanese / sushi restaurant.  We were fortunate to sit at the sushi bar and had to order the omakase.  We had  pieces  baby yellowtail, amaebi + mackerel from Japan  probably the best fresh mackerel I've ever had, Hokkaido uni, and it goes on were the most unique.  Something about the rice didn't seem on par  I couldn't put my finger on it.  I wish there was more seasoning on some of our pieces like how I remembered at Ichi.  We tried  hot dishes  sea bass collar which was pretty basic but the sushi chef recommended it.  I probably wouldn't order this again.  The nd was the chicken meatballs that you dip in a egg yolk with green onions and this was on point.  Super moist and really tasty  I recommend trying.  If we ever do make it back I hope to see in Tim's corner.  I think this would make the experience more enjoyable. m best amaebi I've ever had.  They fry the head and then put it on top of a corn soup that blew my mind.  Sushi was pretty good  If i can remember correctly, I had the squid, tuna, albacore, scallop, salmon, uni, and they were all o so very good i had to order the second piece for every single one.  Dollar oysters and the yellow tail kama was also great for happy hour.  hmm debated giving them  stars for allowing the half order of nigri ( peice) but if i come back and still love this place then ill bump it up to a . I ate at ICHI last night, and it was wonderful.  We sat at the bar, and enjoyed omakase from Eric.  Everything he served was delicious, truly as good as could be.  The waitstaff was very friendly and nice, and kept me plenty full of ICHIbier (which you must try  it is lovely).  I will be going back to ICHI soon, and will likely become a regular there. For full disclosure, I'm a sushi snob.  I'm used to eating some of the best fish available, and as such, have insanely high expectations.  It is rare that I find a place that hits my five star sushi rating.  ICHI is just such a place.  Do read some of my one star sushi reviews if you're looking for some color on what a bad sushi experience feels like to me. We had omakase here and, it exceeded all my expectations. My friend said he was there with the owner as their omakase chef, and noted it was better. I can't possibly imagine how much better it could've been. There were some pieces of nigiri with fish that I had never heard of. . . They were so delicious! I can't wait to go back. I hear their happy hour is pretty rad. . . Service by staff was okie  .  stars service by sushi chef  was fabulous  stars atmosphere  very nice and modern food quality  very fresh and well prepped food presentation  good Overall  had a good time! will come back and recommend! Just got home from a meal of mediocre sushi and crazy over priced sake ($ for house hot sake  yeah, that's house hot sake we're talking about). Atmosphere was lacking. The service was friendly but a bit slow. There are many other options around the city that give a way better performance for the amount of money spent. All in all, a disappointing experience. Their happy hour is pretty boss. The collar is one of my favorite parts of a fish and you can get a variety of them for $ before pm. Like  different ones. Really no reason not to get them all (we had four). The $ oysters are also quite good and other izakaya stuff like great nasu dengaku, decent wings, and shishito peppers. They also have this pesto somen that's in credible and worth each person getting their own. It's super clean tasting and fits all that rich fish well. We came here for drinks and snacks on a Friday and ended up appropriately sitting at the bar in the Ni bar side of things. The atmosphere of the place was less than stellar  a little cold, IMO. The food was good but value ratio a little off. Drinks were okay  selection is on the smaller side. Service was friendly but slow. Would like to come back for dinner to get a better sense of the place, but am not really in any hurry. First, I found the set up of this place absurd. It was divided up into the sushi section and the hot dish section. I had to pick where I wanted to sit and couldn't order food from the other section. Because it's Friday evening and the sushi side was full, we settled in the 'hot dish' section. What was strange about the hot dish section was there was sashimi (raw seafood without the rice underneath) on its menu. So it wasn't hot dish only. The whole point of divvying up the restaurant into raw and hot sections was moot? (Not to mention I have never been to a 'Japanese' restaurant that has this kind of set up) To add to confusion, I tried to order the one and only (sake) cocktail on the menu and the waitress had trouble knowing if it's available and took her more than  minutes to check both sides to find out. If you had only  cocktail on the menu, you better frigging know if you are serving it or not. As for the food, the quality to be fair wasn't bad but just of tiny portion. Real Japanese portion. So the sticker price may not seem much, it adds up when you have to get full. In the end I paid $ for food and a couple of drinks and was still kind of hungry. I always lament the fact that there aren't many good Japanese (or Asian) restaurants in the city (given its reputation as a foodie haven) and this is another shining example of this inadequacy. Stay away unless you have no better options. WOW! I don't know why people write such bad reviews here, but I had a lovely first time experience. Party of  and we got the the restaurant around pm on a Tuesday night! We didn't have any reservations but decided to try if we can get a table. Lucky for us we got seated right away in a little corner booth! Since we were going to do the omakase. . I guess sitting at the bar is better! We asked the waitress if we can sit at the bar instead and just our luck,  bar seats opened up! Our chef was amazing! super friendly and very informative of what he was serving us! We never had to wait long for our sushi it just kept coming to us in a timely manner! our waitress was very attentive and always walked by to see if we needed anything extra!Everything we had was wonderful! every bite was a burst of different flavors that all went amazingly well with each other! I've never experienced eating sushi like this and I love it!Bonus, chef's are fun to look at and Mitchell's is right around the corner for dessert! :) My two friends and I had a great meal at ICHI Sushi. Even on a Wednesday night, we couldn't get a reservation until :, but we had a drink at the bar and ended up being able to get seated earlier. We were at sushi bar the whole night, so pretty much all of our interaction was with the sushi chefs. They were great  personable, funny, and they were good at choosing and explaining the sushi. We ended up deciding to let the chef choose  pieces of nigiri for each of us to try. The fish was really fresh and delicious, and we all got to try things that we may not have ordered ourselves. One of my friends is a little pickier and he catered to what she said that her dislikes and likes are. We ordered a couple of rolls and the pork shoulder as well, which were all good, but the nigiri was definitely a stand out for me. When the bill came, we were all pleasantly surprised that the price matched up with the quality of food and experience. Especially since we let the chef choose and he did give us things that are usually more expensive like toro and uni. It's so nice to find a sushi place that is actually good and not outrageous!The reason why this place is getting five stars is because once I left, I knew I wanted to come back. I wouldn't say this was the best meal I've had in my life, but it was great, and the sushi chefs, atmosphere and price make ICHI sushi a keeper. I realized how rare it is to leave a restaurant knowing you want to return (even when the food is fabulous). ICHI must be doing something right (: This place is kind of the hip place right now and I have no idea why. The staff is stuck up, it's WAY overpriced, and it wasn't an overall pleasant experience. Sure the atmosphere is hip and cool, the food is good, not great, and there are way better sushi places in the city that treat you way nicer and you get a better value for equally if not more so unique and adventurous sushi. Decided to try this spot for dinner. We arrived about  minutes before opening and were first in line. By the time it opened there were about  other people in line behind us.  Pork Belly Appetizer: tasted more fatty than other pork belly I've tried.  The albacore and salmon were the best and most fresh tasting fish out of everything we ordered. Definitely recommend the albacore. We also tried a few rolls and other nigiri  they were good, but nothing memorable. Food was nicely presented and the service was fine. The decor is modern with seating for about  (including the bar). We sat at the table closest to the window  the seats have no backrest and there is no place for your coat or purse. There is no signage on the building so you'll have to look for the black/dark grey unit. My wife and I had been to the old Ichi before, but in our first time at Ichi's new space, we had a similarly great experience, only with less wait, since it's much bigger now. We went in on a Friday night around , and they quoted us  minutes to wait, and almost exactly  minutes later, I got a text from the hostess saying that a seat at the bar was ready. Even though we didn't wait there for the  minutes, I appreciated that we could've hung out at the bar in the back while waiting for the table. I agree with all of the other positive reviews saying that you should go with the omakase, although what I appreciated most if that the sushi chef asked us to order some things we liked, and then he could add some sushi that would complement what we ordered. It wasn't that we just had to pay a ton of money without any control  instead we were able to tell them what we liked and didn't like and ordering a bunch of other interesting things at the same time. Everything the chef prepared for us were delicious and fresh, and the only things we didn't like were the things we ordered. Unfortunately, two of those things that were not great were the two beef dishes we ordered. The beef tataki was a bit on the tough side, perhaps just a bit overcooked. Also, the wagyu nigiri had a great taste to it, but was also a bit on the tough side. It didn't melt in your mouth like other similar dishes I've had at other high end sushi places. All the fish was great, but the beef necessitates a one star ""penalty. "" However, that won't stop be from getting great sushi at Ichi in the future. Man, I really don't write bad reviews of places anymore and this review is late but I recently read something about Ichi and was reminded by the great bursts of red clouding my vision about why I will never eat there or recommend it to anyone I know ever. Basically, Ichi was responsible for my  super bummer of a birthday a couple of years ago (). I'd heard so many great things about the place that I definitely wanted to celebrate with delicious sushi on my birthday.  When we got there, the hostess quoted a wait time of  minutes which was cool, so we went next door to drink margaritas. An hour and twenty minutes later, she still hadn't called so I went back over to check and she told us that they wouldn't be able to seat us before the they closed so we were, pretty much, shit out of luck. In sum, the hostess couldn't even be bothered to call and tell us we wouldn't get a seat and had us sitting around for almost an hour and a half waiting to not get seated. Even if it hadn't been my birthday, it was a pretty dick move, so I celebrated at Emmy's where the hostess was far more competent and accommodating even if it wasn't exactly the celebratory meal I had been hoping for. I mean, I guess they've probably replaced their hostess by now but that experience is something that really ruins restaurants for people forever. Reading reviews here it is hard to know what about many restaurants that attract the diverse and contentious crowd of people who might later post their thoughts on Yelp. Nonetheless, wading through the absolutist partisans and enemies of a place like this one is left with a certain amount of anxiety, even fear; can ANY place live up to the expectations  positive or negative  expressed on a forum like this? I doubt it. In any case, we dived in, sitting at the bar and going for a joy ride. Our chef (in the station next to the boss man), was amiable, solicitous, and seemingly competent. He asked us if we had any things we wouldn't want to miss or anything we particularly didn't want, and then proceeded to produce a fairly steady stream of nigiri from the fish under the glass in front of us. Without referencing any other sushi venue in the city, or indeed without mentioning any sushi place I have ever been anywhere, and even without worrying about anything that the restaurant's owners might or might not have said about the food, their concept, or anything else, but just letting the seafood and rice speak for itself, we can pronounce ourselves fairly satisfied with the experience, and left  with a good taste in our mouths, happy to have taken the time to visit the place. On the plus side, the fish, scallops, and shrimp we had were served in pretty interesting ways, tasted fresh, and while not truly plentiful in portion, were not stingy, either; the drinks service was conscientious and, as mentioned, the sushi chef was attentive and eager to please. There was lots of good tasting sushi. On the down side, much of the sushi, despite being fish of different species, for instance, all tasted the same. It is really hard to understand this given that I have never experienced this anywhere else. I have to wonder if it is not somehow a function of the drive to make of the experience eating here some kind of ritual of sushi ""purity"", whatever that might be. Our chef offered in passing when setting down our first nigiri that it was ""seasoned the way it was supposed to be"" or something similar; of course, since we had heard that Ichi does not brook the use of extra wasabi and soy sauce, this aside was absorbed without comment, and even with some pleasurable anticipation. But the fact is that all the effort then to make the sushi ""special"" really just boiled down to applying a fairly narrow range of seasonings (including various ponzu concoctions, a number of spicy or salty condiments, etc.  and none of them bad, mind you) to whatever fish was on hand, without, it seemed, any particular thoughtfulness about why that particular combination might be especially apt. Our conclusion was that in a perhaps misguided attempt to pursue something like ""perfection"" the concept of honest ingredients of the highest possible quality was somehow distorted by a penchant for novelty for its own sake. Our chef was, as far as we could tell, following a playbook as rigid as that which controls every action of a burger flipper at Mickey D's; instead of a spontaneous interaction between the chef, the materials, and us, we got a fussy, preset packaging of the fish of the day which ultimately produced something akin to mass production, even though, I will happily add, it was all pretty darn good. We thought that perhaps by combining this level of passion and skill with something less self conscious and more open hearted, this place really might have a chance of becoming the ""best"" sushi place in the City, whatever that means instead of a + star novelty with potential. . . This seems to be my first review on yelp. It was so bad that forced me to post something here. We found this place on a  restaurant list(obviously). I suppose they spent some money on the marketing. the food was so so.  the waitress were okay. But the waiting part was horrible. And it's so expensive. . How dare they charge so much with such bad service? We were waiting there for about more than two hours just to got a few pieces of sushi. . . . If you are hungry you would be starved there. This is the worst part of my pride weekend! I highly recommend you not to go. . . Why does everyone hate on here?  Is it because it's in Bernal Heights? Is it because it's hipster and not exactly what you'd find in Tokyo?  Please people, relax!I went through a sushi craving to the point where I started perusing high end sushi experiences, and saw that ICHI has been getting a lot of press (for starters, x features them on the  things to eat list).  We made a reservation for a Friday night at :pm and when we showed up, this place was PACKED! Sitting at the sushi bar was an absolute must for me, but unfortunately that meant we had to wait  minutes to be seated.  I'm not sure why or how that makes sense, and if it weren't for the fact that the sushi was amazeballs, I'd probably have more complaints about the fact that I didn't receive a single piece of food until pm, or  minutes after my reservation. Ok, moving on. So, if you're going to remember anything from this, it's that you MUST order the omakase.  Not to be a snob, but for the people who sat next to me who ordered the two orders of the California Roll, why did you waste your time coming here? We went about  pieces deep, and threw in the chicken wings and fried fish collar from the hot food item list.  It was definitely an aggressive night, but hey, my LA Kings won the Stanley Cup that night and I was going to celebrate. Highlights from the omakase included the hirame with chili and green onion, the saba with the egg yolk vinagrette and fried leeks, the barracuda, and the super sweet hotategai (giant scallop).  The tamago ended the evening, and while it wasn't warm, it was definitely quality.  The excellent quality of the fish here is what really blew both of us away.  The rice wasn't overly salty, and our sushi chef graciously put the shoyu or additional sauce on for us, so we never needed anything else. Dinner came out reasonably priced, including the hot food and some beers.  Something ""strange"" that we noticed was that we were charged per piece, not as a general ""omakase"" pricing.  Either way, ICHI sushi was definitely a great experience and while their sushi isn't what you'd find in the traditional sense, their quality of fish is absolutely on point. Good quality fish spoiled with copious amounts of yuzu sauce. Just serve the fish with some soy and wasabi. Our server was nice and suggested what to get. The girl working the ""ni bar"" was in a terrible mood and wasn't pleased to help. Music is too loud and you need to yell over it. Price is ok, but there are other higher end places that cost about the same but give a much better experience. Had a very good meal here, ordered Omakase, which is apparently the way to go.  I would concur since many of the sushi we received, I would have never known to order. Off the hot menu, the chicken wings, were dry and none of us got what the big deal was. They need some sort of sauce to compliment and the beef, was just ok.  Next time I think I'll try the pork belly and the clams, my friends weren't into either.  We went on a Tuesday at :pm because that was the only time we could get a reservation.  I was baffled during our whole dinner why Open Table said they were so booked and when we called the restaurant directly to see if we could get a pm reservation they couldn't accommodate us, but during the entire length of our dinner, at least  hours, there were open tables all around us.  I think the hype of it being the best sushi restaurant in the city maybe just that, hype. However, the food was good and the service excellent with a nice looking space and vibe.  I will go back.  Especially since it's down the street from where I live. I'd give this joint  stars if I could. Here's why:) The music is BOMB. Go eat tea sandwiches with your mom somewhere else if it's too loud. ) Erik. Effin. Marinovich. He did the mural. Yeah, that mural. ) Freshest fish in town!) Best sushi chefs you can find (yeah, that means you Erik!)) The staff is accommodating and there to help you. Hats off to Shasta for holding it together!) In every piece of sushi/sashimi you can taste the freshness of the fish  regardless of what they add to the fish, be it yuzu, soy, scallions, ginger, etc. You taste the FISH in all of it's amazing glory. ) Best fish collars. For days. ) The chef/owner Tim comes out and greets us. He's awesome. Maybe even super awesome. ) They got Almanac to brew them a signature beer. A bay area beer brewing darling makes ICHI a special beer! Aw yeah. ) They make all the other sushi joints seem overpriced for what those other joints offer. There you have it.  points for the ten stars they deserve. If you think they're too expensive or too fancy or too loud or too pretentious or too anything other than awesome then go somewhere else. Amazing nigiri and a great experience if you sit at the bar. Our sushi chef Darren was so interesting and talented. Some of the best nigiri we've ever had! If you like typic Japanese place with an American twist, this the perfect spot. With a good sake collection. My nd favorite sushi place in SF. I was scared to come here because I heard the hype, but the reviews weren't too good and that confused me. the bad reviews are a lie!Some things: always expect a wait. for two people at dinner it was like  min which wasn't bad. they text you when the table is ready.  such fresh fish it's unbelievable. . . order the shrimp nigiri and you get a fried shrimp head!Some bad things but not enough to let me remove a star: why is miso soup $. ? the decor is good, but then also slightly reminiscent of a chipotle? The food was good  good enough for my friends and I to enjoy while we catch up. Yuzu fried chicken wings were my favorite (in addition to pickled cucumber)! The sake was very smooth  I definitely wanted to try some more. The only thing that annoyed the entire dinner was that you cannot order food from Ichi Sushi if you are seating at the Ni Bar (even though they are not really separated). It could have been very nice if the host told me that there are separate menus before I cancelled the reserved table. This was one of the most disappointing meals I've had in San Francisco and I eat out a lot.   ""chef' ONE STAR    Service    Price      Music   Conflicted about ICHI: Some really great fish Many of them are masked by all the toppings and citrus Favorites: Kuushi oysters, kohada, saba, tataki, umimasu, uni Friendly and knowledgeable servers Casual and fun vibeReasonable for omakase: veggie app,  oysters and  pcs of sushi EACH, plus a ml bottle of daiginjo.  $ without tip.  Would give it another go purely for the variety of fish and the quality. The quality of most Fish here was very good. (I didn't try tuna as usual because most places in the US have awful tuna. Toro is OK mostly but ""Akami"" in the US just sucks. I stopped eating Tuna after moving here from Japan. ) Why  stars if the quality of fish is very good? I didn't agree with ""chef's choice of garnish/sauce"" on a lot of nigiri pieces. It is sometimes simply better with a touch of wasabi and soy sauce on nigiri than Yuzu, etc. I appreciate this restaurant is showing that sushi or sashimi is not supposed to be over dipped in excessive wasabi and soy sauce but I also want to enjoy my nigiri as the best way possible. They seem to use a lot of Yuzu on nigiri but some fish really just call for a touch of wasabi and soy sauce instead of Yuzu. Would I be back? Maybe. If I figure out how to ask for a little wasabi and soy sauce without offending the chef. I'm Japanese and I never use too much wasabi or soy sauce but just a touch of it on some nigiri so that it taste even better. . . Other cooked items were just OK too. I have yet to find a better sushi place in San Francisco. I have been here a few times now  mainly for the omakase and the excellent sake selections  and have never been disappointed. In fact, whenever I am entertaining an out of town client I suggest ICHI and they always rave about the experience as well. Went here last night and our group must have tried   pieces of nigri each, as well as shared a couple of the hot dishes. Everything was delicious and flavorful. I see some reviews complaining about the prices at ICHI, which I will readily admit are on the higher end. But you have to realize you are not going to get a  star meal for a  star price in a place like San Francisco. I suggest ICHI for special occasions and going with true sushi lovers. Dropped in Ichi on Saturday night for omakase at the Ichi sushi bar. We had a resy for : and arrived on time, but had to wait about  minutes for  spaces to open up at the sushi bar. With open seats at the Ni bar in the back this didn't bother us one bit as we sat drinking a pint of Hitachino until a spot opened up at the Ichi bar. The atmosphere is more trendy than traditional, but the sushi although modernized with their spin isn't just hype. This is not your traditional Japanese sushi place, so traditionalists would probably not like it, but if you want a modernized spin on sushi then Ichi fits the bill. I also respect that they don't give you soy sauce and a bunch of wasabi at the sushi bar so you can make some horrendous concoction of wasabi soy sauce to overpower your sushi. People who are complaining about how the sushi chefs want you to eat the sushi the way they have prepared it make me laugh. You want to dress up your crunchy roll go to another spot. We started with a cucumber salad and ordered a bottle of Hakkaisan Junmai Ginjo Sake. Every piece of nigiri hit the spot and the combination of flavors and creativity are on point. Our sushi chef Eric walked us through about  different pieces of nigiri and one piece of cod collar. I would say the only piece that missed the mark was the tako (octopus), it was a little tough which can be common in octopus if you don't work it before you prepare it. Since dinner resys are hard to come by, I never understand the people that come to a sushi place and order california rolls and chicken teriyaki. The people wearing their scarves inside sitting next to us kept glaring at all the assorted cuts of fish the sushi chef was handing to us feeling jelly that they went with the california roll. I think the sushi is just ok but very expensive. You can have very fresh fish like Tekka on balboa for that price. Its really over price here. The quality of the fish here is top notch. It's up there with the best sushi spots in SF. Sadly, the new space is a total departure from what made the old ICHI great and I will spent my money at Saru or Maruya with my friends and visitors instead. The new place feels more like a Chipotle than high end sushi joint. It has a modern feel with tall ceilings and slate gray walls. One of the walls even has some cheesy sushi related words painted on it. There is also loud music playing. Combine the decor with the music and the loudness from everyone talking over the music and it feels like Chipotle opened a night club that served excellent sushi. It was nice hanging out at the NI bar before dinner, but with the amount of space that they have, it seems like just adding more tables would have been a better idea. They don't seem to be going for an intimate feeling with the way the floor plan is already, so I'm not sure why they decided to add the bar. ICHI, I will try to remember you like you used to be and block out my trip to your new space from my memory forever. Some reviewers mentioned pretentiousness, I see it as entertainment. It is a little difficult to take young(er) people following ""traditional rules"" seriously. If there was a  year old chef at the counter threatening to boot me out for asking for soy sauce, I can go with the flow and shut up. When someone much younger does it, hell yes, I'm going to ask for soy sauce just to see what will ensue. This is not a giant piece of fish on a giant slab of rice place; the flavors are delicate and layered, the rice is compact and well shaped, the flavors can be unexpected, just enough to wake my senses in the middle of auto feeding to say, ""hey, slow down, something special's going on here. "" Back to the soy sauce, there aren't any on the tables, there also wasn't a lump of wasabi with every plate things I've gotten used to seeing in sushi restaurants. When asked, we were told each piece was appropriately sauced/wasabi'd as the chef intended fair enough and I agree. But, upon further pressing to different table attendants, we were given the tiniest pencil eraser size ball of wasabi and a bottle of soy sauce that was soon taken away from us by another server while we were distracted. Asides from the excellent pork belly, flavorful barracuda nigiri, and scrumptious skewers, acquiring and losing that soy sauce bottle was pretty good entertainment for the eve. In retrospect, maybe the beer influenced our amusement. We arrived at : on Monday once the shop opened, it was fairly full by , but had plenty of walk in seats in the rear for small groups. The crowd and the styling of the place leans to the young, but the food quality will satiate all fine sushi fans. It can get a little loud when full, very attentive staff. No desserts on the menu, but Mitchell's Ice Cream is around the corner. A solid place, a good place to eat on your own so you can focus on the flavor. The restroom has hand lotion, nice touch. I've finally had a chance to sit at the new sushi bar a few times and the food and service is just as good as ever. The best way to experience Ichi is to sit at the bar and order omakase (the chef will choose your meal for you). Also, the yuzu chicken wings are a must try. I must say, when I found out that my former favorite sushi spot in the city had closed, I was pretty bummed. Then, I ate here. Honestly, if you like sushi, just sit down and ask for omakase. You will not be disappointed. Everything is super fresh and expertly prepared, and each dish is a journey. Make reservations!! Food was great but we waited over an hour at the side tables to order sushi since we couldn't actually order it at the place we were sitting ( I can't rationalize it ) . . So dear owner . . When people want to order more food and spend money. . why say no?!? Frustrating and disappointing. . Really had a lovely meal here.  Extremely well made nigiri.  Uni sashimi screams fresh.   Love the vibe of the restaurant.  Modern contemporary setting yet authentic sushi.  Please order the steamed clams the broth was amazing with some sort of spicy chorizo diced up to give the kick to it.  Did the chef choice menu Omakazse which you can tell the chef to stop feeding you food when you start to feel full   makes the experience fun.  Cost for food before drinks and tax/tips was around $ $.  Great value for the quality you get. Overall, .  stars. Ichi is the best!  The sushi is fresh and delicious and the oysters are near perfect.  They've ruined me for all other sushi.  Damn their deliciousness!  The new space is much bigger than the old one and the place is always buzzing.  They also brew their own beer called Ichibier which is also quite good.  It's perfect with their fried chicken wings. If there's a place to do omakase, it is here. It was so hard to get a reservation during a normal dinner hour! Book early. We came and sat at the sushi bar and had the omakase. Try out one of their barley Sochus, they're like a smoother, lighter whiskey. I'm no sushi expert, but I'll tell you what we had, much of it came with green tea salt which was heavenly.  Kakushigura: Barley sochu Nanban Zuke: Fried fish in vinegar with onion Cucumber Salad: Raw cucumber with sesame & peanut dressing Kampachi Kama: Yellowtail Maguro: Bluefin tuna Kisu Tai Inada Aji Shima Aji Hotategai Umi Masu Shiro ToroThe sushi chefs were very nice & talkative and wanted to explain and share with us what we were eating. For the above + a beer and two glasses of wine we paid $ total. Not bad. First and foremost: I am a vegetarian who will occasionally (i. e. twice a year) eat fish. So, I am not a sushi connoisseur. That's what my boyfriend is for. So, after being featured on best of lists, I thought it would be a great treat for him and I to experience a new sushi spot. The reviews would lead you to believe that this is the Holy Grail of sushi in San Francisco, and while this is better than Barracuda (sorry, neighborhood sushi spot!) it also wasn't as mind blowing as expected. We arrived a bit early (how did MUNI get us to our destination early, I'll never know), so we sat in the back of the restaurant, the NI Bar, as it were. I was half expecting this place to be overrun with people, given how highly publicized this place has been, but it was actually comfortable for a Friday night. The decor was very simple and, in actuality, left a bit to desire. I felt like it was very ""Ikea"". Perhaps I am used to my sushi joints being a bit more 'divey', but this felt like it was trying to be elevated, but didn't quite hit the mark. Our reservation time came and went  we weren't seated until  minutes after our : reservation. The host seemed a bit frazzled  she couldn't remember names (not really a problem) but we didn't get much of an apology for the extra wait. Again, not much of a big deal, but reservations usually mean avoiding some wait. We were seated at the bar itself, which was not a problem for , but could be for larger groups. The dining area feels a bit tight  I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups (which can be great, as there weren't any birthday parties doing sake bombs. . )We placed our orders directly with the chef, who was friendly and knowledgeable. The man next to us seemed to be going through an extensive run on the menu, receiving piece after piece, causing a reaction that led my boyfriend to describing it as an ""O face. "" Needless to say, I didn't have the same experience, but this is where my aforementioned lack of sushi eating experience may make me biased. However, everything I did have was delicious, and despite pondering aloud what we would eat later in the evening, we left pretty full. Highlights included the Spicy Albacore and Vegetable Futomaki. I did not partake in it, but my boyfriend loved the Tuna Tataki. We also opted to start with the Shishito Peppers as an appetizer, which were roasted with great flavor. So, in the end, it was a pleasant experience, despite an underwhelming decor and delayed service. I don't think it will be high on the list of places to return to, but perhaps this is the place for you if you are true sushi connoisseurs. Sometimes  stars is not enough. While the sushi is undoubtedly next level the humble chicken wings  is the eye opening (as in  this can be done with chicken?) dish at this place  these wings literally smell like waffles  which results in a total senesthetic mindblow. . I've spent over  hrs at Ichi, and every dish was an unexpected surprise. Its literally difficult to imagine a restaurant continually improving on the previous dish for over  items but this is the place that pulls it off. There's possibly only one other place that can do this in SF that i've experienced (its american dim sum. . . ). Srsly next level sushi yo (also helps if you go with Aaron V). Im very frustrated. I had heard about Ichi from some of my friends who really enjoy sushi. I took their advice and went with my family. I did not make reservations, which I should have done. I'm planning to go there next month. The reason I am writing my review now is because the woman who helped me was very rude. She made me not want to visit the restaurant again. I hope not all the staff at Ichi is like this! I do hope the food is better than the costumer service! I'm looking forward to eating there soon. Oh man, guys. This place is an experience!  I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that this is  hands down  the best sushi place in the city.  Freshest fish, dishes that allow the diner to really experience the taste of the fish, not dress it up with gross mayo sauces or hose it down with soy sauce.  Be prepared to let the food melt in your mouth. The cocktails and sake are great.  The customer service is friendly, accommodating, and everything I want and need a San Francisco mom and pop to be.  And the prices are absolutely reasonable and a great value for the flavors and fun ambience.  I highly suggest gettin' crazy with the Omakase style and let the chef choose your dishes for you.  During my second visit, we gave the server a per person budget and threw out some favorite fish and flavors of ours. The dinner that followed was extraordinary and, of course, exactly what we were willing to spend.  Plus we learned a lot about dishes that we didn't know before and were served new items that we wouldn't have ordered on our own but are now new favorites.  See what I mean?  A total experience. ICHI Sushi + NI Bar is amazing. My family and I had a wonderful dinner here, sampling a bunch of dishes from their new izakaya menu. From the seared pork belly to the somen with shiso, everything was delicious. Equally as impressive is the atmosphere. From the second you walk in, ICHI is incredibly warm and welcoming, and the staff is super friendly and helpful. You should definitely try ICHI if you're in SF. Hell, you should go to SF just to try it! I was really excited to try ichi after hearing it as a recommendation from some other people as a good sushi place in the city. I understand that this is a new location and the menu has expanded and changed.  We came in on a Wednesday night for my sisters birthday.  The location is a bit meh, a bit far from us and parking was not difficult but not super easy.  There is this weird dead end street that did not have signs and our only option was to back up.  The space is nice!  Love the paint color and cartoonish wall and decor and furniture.  The service was also top notch.  The staff is super friendly and helpful. We had the cocktail which was a surprise.  it was called a cats meow. salted plum, shiso and other stuff. salty, not sweet at all. Onto the food.  I was not impressed to say the least and dont feel like I would want to come back here.  Good sushi for me is really hard to find.  I want quality  fresh fish.  I also want a semi authentic experience. I say semi because who i am i kidding here? Its california, not japan.  I also want value   i dont want small ass pieces of fish on small ass pieces of rice.  I want simplicity  fish on rice.  nothing fancy.  no bells and whistles. I think maybe part of it is expectation not meeting reality.  When this place was recommended, i thought it was an authentic japanese spot for sushi. That is not what i got.   japanese people dont come here.  we started with oysters.  they were fresh.  there was a sauce on them. dont get me wrong, the sauce was good. but sometimes i just want to taste the oyster.  there was no option as the sauce was already on there.  We selected a few things from the regular sushi menu and these were good as well  ikura, tobiko.  Then we went to the specials menu and thats when i started noticed that almost everything we chose came pre sauced.  we also tried the somen with shiso pasta and also seared pork belly.  it was not seared.  it was deep fried.  why would you call it seared if it is deep fried?  confusing . . . . damage was $ per personI appreciate what they are trying to do here.  Put a new spin on sushi.  Its just not for me. Hipster vibe. Manageable sake list. A sushi bar that does omakase. Sushi chefs that look more like a lineup for startup guys. But I rather the waitress not mention that one can get omakase at the table. It turned out that the service is slow and waiting  minutes between each  seconds of devouring  pieces of delicious sushi is not that enjoyable. And P:E ratio is kind of high. We have to go binge on Mitchell's ice cream afterward to fill up. Couldn't have been more pleased!  Everything was outstanding.  The food was amazing!  Chef Tim has brought the art of food preparation to a whole new level  and that's saying a lot when it comes to San Francisco Sushi restaurants.  The staff were friendly and attended to every need.   This place is simply awesome! Party of  on a busy Saturday night  service was exceptional. Tried about  different dishes. Favorites were the Yakotori Chicken, Fried Chicken, Noodles, Kobe Beef and Nigiri. If you wanted to go out to dinner and find a fun spot with a great crowd and good drinks then let me tell you. . . look somewhere else. This was one of the most disappointing meals I've had in San Francisco and I eat out a lot. Completely uncreative sushi that all tastes the same, mediocre nigiri and they're too pretentious to offer dessert. There are so many outstanding sushi places in the city, don't even think about coming here. Feels like a poor man's Roka Akor Nothing special.  Questionable hygiene (food placed in direct contact with bamboo mat in fish case instead of on dish). Enjoyed cold somen. I'm fairly new to sushi and sake and usually order the basic California Roll at sushi places  to play it safe. But. . . . I went to ICHI ready to try new things.  We sat at the sushi bar  best place to sit in my opinion! The waitress came over to take our drink orders and offered sake from their list.  I told her that I wasn't a big fan of sake and she brought me a taste of something that non sake drinkers like.  The sake I've had from sushi places usually ends up tasting like nail polish remover but the sake she brought me was tasty! The chef started us with a cucumber salad which was very crisp, fresh, and tasty!The chef was very nice and knowledgeable and made us the sushi piece by piece and didn't rush us.  The mural they have fits perfectly in the mission district and it serves as an educational piece about sushi and sushi etiquette.  The colors, decor, style and design were so chic and contemporary.  I went to ICHI to get an education about sushi and Japanese food and I got one! Thank you for that ICHI! The barracuda was my favorite!! Ok, seriously I don't know what I just ate. Ocean trout, pork belly, noodles. I'll never understand what nigiri, sashimi and all that is. But, shit, this is good!Amazing food!!The wifey ordered everything, she's the sushi pro. . . . even baby niko got his own avocado. Highly recommend you try this place! Wow. That is all I have to say. Wow. Words cannot explain how good ICHI was but I will do my best to describe the deliciousness y, goodness y heaven I infested tonight. Let me start off by saying I love sushi. And not the spider roll, fried sushi kinda sushi. I'm talking salmon roe with quail egg and monkfish liver kind of sushi. I had read about ICHI in x and how it was voted best sushi in the  Eat + Drink Awards and I knew I had to try it. I can say with certainty it was the best sushi I've had in San Francisco. I even overheard (ok, let's be real, I was totally eavesdropping) a chef saying that the fish was flown in that today fresh from Japan and will have another delivery on Friday. Talk about fresh! Right when you walk in the door, you're greeted and hit in the face with fresh fish smell. We had  different things that we ordered, but I'll talk about the highlights. The first thing we tried was on the daily special sheet, the Samekawa Karei (aka Japanese Sharkskin Flounder). Wow. I think this was the best tasting piece of sushi I've ever had. They quickly cooked the skin with a blow torch and placed it on top of the fish. Wow. You could taste every little flavor that was on that piece and it was amazing. The Kampachi Kama (salted Albacore collar) was mouth watering ly good. I'm sitting here drooling just thinking about how good it was. Came out hot (which is huge in my book) and so absolutely tasty. It's so hard to describe, but just trust me when I say to try it. The Ikura (Salmon Roe) was also the best I've ever had. I make it a point to try it at every sushi place I go to and ICHI had by far the best. We had Daniel as our sushi chef and he was wonderful. I will be for sure requesting to sit in his area every time I go here. Not only did he know what he was talking about but was able to make great sushi (which was a given I'm sure but he seemed better than everyone else!). Two times I asked him to surprise us and he did not disappoint. First we had a roll with eel and cucumber which was still warm from the freshly cooked eels. NOMS! Then he made us uni with cucumber and salmon roe and a fish crisp to start. Everything worked together so perfectly I wanted another one but resisted. Overall, I recommend this place to true sushi lovers. I can't wait to go back and try all new things because I know that it will not disappoint. Thank you Daniel for the wonderful experience and looking forward to your new treats!"
Leatherneck Steakhouse|4.0|Steakhouses in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|133|-1|3.734375|" This is a very classy steakhouse in the nob hill area. I was looking for a steakhouse in the area and was pleasantly surprised to find this one which also came with a great view of the city!It's on the th floor of the Marine's Club building and the customer base seems to be older, white folks so don't expect a very hip vibe but do expect an old school, classic steakhouse vibe. This means chairs come with clever, unnoticeable wheels so you can easily slide in and out of the table. This made my life a lot easier when I was stuffed at the end of the meal and I could leave my table with ease!The food:Rib eye ( oz)  Perfectly charred on the outside and cooked medium rare, just the way i like it. I'd say not as good as other steakhouses i've been to but its definitely up there. Tater Tots  Get these! Not like other tater tots in that its not ground potatoes but I think they are mashed potato tots. So they are super light and crispy on the outside. Ask for extra steak sauce so you can dip these in it. Prime rib  Very good, obviously not as good as a place like house of prime rib but It was pretty damn good, very flavorful. It didn't come with any au jus but you can ask for the horseradish sauce which complements it well. TIPS  ) Ask for sauces. I recommend the steak sauce and the horseradish sauce. They will gladly give you more than one if you ask. ) When making the reservation, ask for a table next to the window. We made our reservation the night of so we had to take what we can get. Overall, i'd come back for sure! This is a great place to go on a romantic date. I think the food is reasonably priced and you can't beat the views. Amazing restaurant. I don't really understand some of the negative reviews. I took my wife here for her birthday. I made reservations  week before and they were ae to accommodate. I was  min early and was seated at the window after I politely asked for that seat. Let's start with the view. . wow! Amazing views of my city. My waitress was quick to ask us for our drink selections and provided phenomenal service through our dinner. The food was delicious (calamari, salad with blue cheese, tater tots, cream spinach and prime rib and rib eye). It was all cooked to perfection. They even sang happy bday to my wife and brought her dessert. I really enjoyed the piano playing as well. Where do I begin. Went to the bar to order our drinks while we waited, bartender was extremely friendly. Older couple next to us seemed to be regulars as they conversed w/ staff on first name basis'. Great to hear. When our table was ready, our host did something I've never seen. He took my girlfriend's drink off of the bar top and walked it to our table. Then, as I was about to grab her chair for her (no really, I had planned on doing this!) he quickly grabbed it and opened it as she sat. Then immediately opened and placed her napkin on her lap. Now, keep in mind, we don't visit top notch restaurants often, but having experienced this before we even looked at the menu. EXCELLENT. Then we looked up. . . . . . . WOW. What a view. Great view of the San Francisco High Rises, as night lit up. Exactly what we were looking for. With such an awesome view and impeccable service thus far, we couldn't wait to order. She ordered the filet mignon medium, came out very juicy and perfect! I ordered the ribeye. Awesome! same as the filet just a bigger cut obviously, juicy and perfect. We had a great time here and will definitely be back. Be aware there is a dress code listed on their website. Visited November  Party of   everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food, our service was great, and the view (as many reviewers share) is breathtaking. Dinner rolls were accompanied by roasted garlic  so good. Filet mignon was wonderful, cooked perfectly, everyone cleaned their plates. Ice cream sundae is huge & basic & delicious  we shared two of those and a berry crisp for dessert. Ambiance is hard to beat  loved the live piano music, the view (as mentioned), the lighting, and the Christmas decorations. Our  hour dinner flew by. We will be back! I decided to make a reservation here for my boyfriend and I's anniversary mainly because of the view. We thought the view was absolutely gorgeous but it didn't make up what was lacking in the food and service that we received. For appetizer, we ordered the calamari and there wasn't anything special about it that made us go, ""Wow!"". It was very basic. I mean, it was good, don't get me wrong, there just wasn't anything special about it to make it memorable. For our entrees, I ordered the prime rib and my boyfriend ordered a steak but I forgot which. The prime rib was on the fatty side. I love prime rib and its fattiness but this prime rib was just too fatty. I'd say % fat. So I couldn't eat a good chunk of my entree. On the other hand, my boyfriend enjoyed his steak and have no complaints. We also had the truffle tator tots and my boyfriend enjoyed those little tots! Lastly, we had bread pudding for dessert and I honestly don't remember if I liked it or not. That's how unmemorable some of their food items are. As for service, I felt as though our server didn't even want to serve us. He gave off a certain vibe that kind of made me feel uncomfortable. Also, I was kind of expecting Leatherneck to greet my boyfriend and I when we checked in with 'Happy Anniversary' or something because I made the reservations months in advance and I stressed that it was our  year anniversary so I wanted it to be extremely special. The whole time it was as if we were there like any other night and they didn't really make us feel like we were celebrating. I mean, my boyfriend and I knew but I guess I shouldn't automatically assume the restaurant would put cute little details here and there to indicate that we were celebrating. I feel as if the least they could do was to write 'Happy Anniversary' on our dessert plate. Maybe I was just expecting too much from a restaurant who appears to be romantic because of the view that comes along with it. All in all, I wouldn't come back to Leatherneck to celebrate anything. My spouse and I are members of the Marines' Memorial Association and we visited Leatherneck Steakhouse every morning and evening while we were staying at the hotel. We enjoyed breakfast in the dining room and happy hour in the lounge. The breakfast buffet had a nice selection of hot and cold items and the selection changed daily. They also offered made to order omelets, but we never ordered one. The servers were attentive and they began to recognize us after the first morning. The lounge was fairly small, but there were some tables set aside for happy hour in the dining room. The bartenders were aloof and they rarely smiled. Bartending is a social job, but they seemed to be more interested in watching television than interacting with guests. However, we returned to the lounge every evening because of the talented piano player, Jerome Clay. He was warm and friendly with a great attitude and he had a smile from ear to ear. He offered us his playlist and he played several songs for us. We will return to Leatherneck Steakhouse because of our experiences at breakfast and with the piano player. My Husband and I had a great dinner here, we loved everything about our experience and will definitely be back if we ever return to San Francisco. The food is delicious and will not bankrupt you for the rest of your trip! We had drinks, filets, two sides and dessert for around $ including tip. They serve rolls with butter and an entire roasted garlic that you can spread on the bread. . . so good! We had the macaroni and cheese and garlic mash, I preferred the mac. We got the berry crisp for dessert which was good but after seeing the bread pudding being delivered to another table I wished I had gotten that. The views are fabulous! Well worth it! Super bomb steak (rib eye, NY strip and prime rib were all delicious)! Their house salad seems home made with light cream and mild, creamy blue cheese (not overpowering). The prices weren't overpowering for steak either. And YES! Truffle tater tots! They're more like tiny vessels of truffled mashed potatoes, lightly fried to perfection. Creamed spinach also perfect (not runny, perfectly seasoned and gooey). Seriously, their food is spot on and simple. Super bomb view. And a pianist and musician taking me back to the s. Overall a really nice hidden gem. It's so quiet, though. Only half the restaurant was in use (probably   tables total, only  large party) and I prefer a more lively restaurant, so  stars from me. Not because this place wasn't wonderful, just because I prefer a different kind of ambiance even though the view is really special. Wonderful experience and delicious food. From the view of SF to the entree the meal was excellent. The bread and roasted garlic was the perfect starter. The rib eye was cooked to a perfect medium rare and seasoned well. I would definitely recommend this wonderful gem to anyone. The romantic setting was wasted as I was dining with a co worker on a short over night stop. Do yourself a favor and have a meal here. We were here on a business dinner, there were  of us, we had reservations and arrived minutes early. The check in receptionist/greeter was probably the unfriendliest woman we have ever met. She told us the table was not ready, and then disappeared. No smiles, no ""would u like to grab a drink at the bar"" just very unfriendly. I recommend she work on her customer service. The view here is spectacular and I think you come for the view, the food was OK.  people in the party had steak, both complained it was cooked to death despite asking for medium and explaining to our waitress. At pm this place closes, the lights get turned on, despite there being about  other tables still finishing off, they started setting the spare tables for breakfast, talk about killing a mood. I'm not sure why they did this? I understand shifts ending and the need to prep for the next day, but this did feel very very odd. A warning, the female bathroom was dirty. Which makes you wonder about the kitchen. No one had checked the bathroom that day, and there was paper towels on the floor. Pretty poor standards I think, and surprisingly so. Would not come back. For the money you can find somewhere so much better Service:  (/) The server John forgot our sauces, our mixed up our entrees, and then decides to call us back (a party of ) out of our way because he forgot to slide the card. Food: (/) The fillet minion is the one to get.  I give that a /.  The prime rib was not very good (/) the cut was extremely fatty (% of it just fat) and it wasn't very tasty as a usual prime rib.  The crab cakes were alright, mac n cheese / tater tots also okay.  Ambiance : (/) The restaurant is the th floor of the hotel, and was fairly nice. Best price for a steak dinner in the area. Food was good. Atmosphere is a little odd, mixed croud of old and young, hostess a little spacey.  Members just walk in and take tables.  They stick to their funky dress code. Along with reservations, they told us they only had availability for two at : so we took it, yet as we ate, there were at least a dozen table that were never used. Would recommend for a good steak at a good price.  Just be aware of the odd atmosphere. Located on the th floor of the Marine Memorial building, you get to see an awesome view while you dine. Prices are fairly reasonable for a steakhouse, although quality of meat could've been better. I got the Prime Rib and my GF got the filet mignon. Dress code enforced on my friend for having a tshirt on.   people at the bar had t shirts on.  We were turned away. Menu prices didn't seem bad, however I don't appreciate the discrimination. I'm assuming this is the lounge on the th floor.  We've come in for cocktails, especially during happy hour & for breakfasts in the mornings.  The staff is top notch and the view is gorgeous.  If you're in the area, make sure you stop in & check it out! Absolutely perfect.  Went for the steak Oscar and was not disappointed! Loved the piano bar ambiance. Service was great. Because my wife and I had such a great experience here last year for our anniversary, I decided to make it a tradition this year. I called and made reservations when we arrived in the city. Later, we both got dressed up and arrived  min early. We were seated promptly next to a window with a breathtaking view along with the soothing melody of the piano. Service and food was excellent much like our last year's visit. My wife enjoyed her filet mignon and my new york strip was delicious. We were amazed by the huge baked potato which came with its own silver topping tray. You can't beat this experience for the price. On a side note, it seems a lot of bad reviews are from people that can't be bothered to or don't make reservations. Classy places require reservations so they can assign enough staff (serving and cooking). When you procrastinate in life and play the ""we'll see how it goes game"" I don't particularly feel sorry for your bad experience. Furthermore, if you have to ask a hostess if a place is romantic enough, you need to do more research yourself. Also, if your woman wasn't impressed by this place, I would struggle to fathom what would eventually impress her. If following a dress code while acting polite, respectful and showing some class is beyond you, I'm sure Outback, Applebees, or Chile's would love your money and patronage. The Leatherneck is on the th/top floor of the Marine Memorial building/hotel, whcih also houses a theatre, library and guest rooms in addition to the restaurant.  We came with Father in law who is a member of the club, having served in the armed forces for over  years.  This restaurant is small in size, and it has a bar as well as dining tables with wheeled chairs  The views of downtown SF are spectacular and the food is delicious.  i had the petrale sole with green beans and wild rice pilaf and everything was perfecrt and tasty.  Hubby had the chicken club sandwich which was equally delicious.  Generally, it's pretty quiet here and there aren't that many people (at least when we came) and most of the patrons that day were older (hence the wheeled chairs). Entrees/sandwiches on the menu ranged from $ to $.  We didn't try the steaks today  but I would imagine they are good since this is a steakhouse and they executed the other dishes quite well.  This is a great special occasion place and I would visit again. So I took my dad for his birthday. It was quite lovely. The pianist sang happy birthday and came to the table to personally tell my dad happy birthday and gave his latest CD a little cheesy but cute. My only complaint were some fruit flies or gnats. I look forward to going at night to see the evening view. The steak was so tender no steak knife needed nor did we need any steak sauce. An iceberg wedge came with the entrees which the waitress pointed out as we ordered but since I don't like blue cheese salad dressing she allowed me to substitute to a dressing I liked thus saving me the cost of ordering a different salad. How cool is that! All in all a great experience would give it  stars if not for the gnats or fruit flies. I hope they see this review and handle that. Also dress code is mentioned when u make reservations which I loved This place is a class act though dress code loosely followed. Saw some folks in attire that did not class up the place. The waiter was not very nice, he tried to ""evaluate"" you, didn't suggest any reservation options. We were happy to went to Morton's statehouse nearby and had a great evening! I am currently here for lunch. Only  customers here. Server is very slow. I got up to use the restroom when I returned the other guest were gone and my server yelled from across the restaurant ""do you want to order anything else""?  Not the professionalism I would ever expect :(  I ordered the Crab Cake salad. . . the crab cakes were ridiculously salty :( I had high hopes, but this place just didn't do it for me. I wonder if the dinner food and wait staff would be better? Very nice view but doesn't have a very captivating atmosphere. . . The furniture and decor is very old and worn down. Food is just okay. Not the best steak place I have been to. However, the price meets the food quality expectation. I think the cost is more $$ than $. View was beautiful on a Sept eve, but food not so good. Chef does not know what med rare is, sent steak back and still not right. We like bulldogs, but come here for drinks, not dinner. My husband took me here for my birthday. We had to park across the street and pay  bucks for parking, but it was worth it, imo. When we went in, they told us it would take two hours to get a seat, but to my surprise, we had reservations. Unfortunately, a big group was having a party there and it was really, really loud. That ruined the mood for me a bit. The server was really nice and even gave me some wine to sample since I didn't know which one I preferred. The view was exquisite, and the food was delicious. The tater tots were out of this world. I have never had tater tots like that before. The prime rib was delicious as well. We had the passion fruit cheesecake for dessert. It was a bit sour for us. The sauce kind of overpowered the cheesecake so I didn't like it as much. My husband and I were in San Francisco to see Beauty and the Beast. We were looking for a good place to eat while in town and used Yelp to help guide us. A lot of places closer to the theatre was booked but we were able to get a reservation same day here. I'm so glad we did because it was great! Very traditional fine dining place but didn't have a stuffy atmosphere. All the veteran decor gave us such a good feeling dining there. We started in the bar for a few drinks while we waited for our reservation time. The bartender was very friendly and made great drinks.  We transferred to our table and we had an amazing view of the city. We got the crab cake for an appetizer. Very good with great flavor. We each had the filet for dinner. It was cooked perfectly and we really enjoyed the sauce. The waiter was friendly and visited our table enough times where we felt taken care of but not swarmed. The prices were what you would expect from a nice place but not overpriced. Very reasonable for the type of food you receive. They had a piano in the corner playing modern music which was fun and different. Great background music. I can't wait to come back to SF to try it again! I would actually give it .  stars. The .  star if you dig a retro old school look which I sort of dug after a few drinks. One star deduction for making us gentlemen wait after a reservation made weeks in advance and another star deduction for less than average ambiance.  Service was average  could have been better and food I would give it slightly above average.  It's sad considering the phenomenal location and the spectacular view of the city it offers.  Give it a try though and let me know your thoughts of the restaurant. My boyfriend found this place by looking through yelp reviews and we were pleasantly surprised! We actually came here twice for two years of my birthday, yes it's that good! Located atop the Marines Memorial Club and Hotel with spectacular views of downtown SF. The staff is super friendly and ambiance is very old fashioned/sophisticated. They have a piano bar with a set list of songs, creates a romantic atmosphere. What we ordered: Filet Mignon (cooked perfectly) New York Steak (perfectly cut and seasoned) Truffle tater tots (must order, omg it's mouthwatering!!)*all dinner comes with iceberg lettuceTip: If you check in, you'll get a free glass of wine! WARNING ! ! !My review is below, but here is a warning for certain folks. This is a living memorial, in honor of Marines, and all the branches of the Armed Forces, it is not a hip hop club, or trendy spot.  There is history in all the walls, and a lot of it is walking around, a lot of elderly folks with great history, and of a different generation when respect meant something. So conduct yourself accordingly and be prepared for the ambiance. Yes the view is incredible, make reservations and be polite, the lady at the counter is older and has been working there forever, which is nice to see people not get tossed to the curve because of age, so be polite, most restaurants worth your while show that kind of loyalty, try the Basque cultural center for example. Ok the steak is not the greatest to you, but for the price and view, good luck finding better. However to me it becomes the greatest steak simply on those merits alone. But it is delicious. LASTLY, have a little class when visiting, this place honors servicemen and women, there are Generals, Dignitaries, I sat across from a former Secretary of State, there are police officers in uniform, federal agents, E  through Admirals, and spouses of fallen Hero's etc.  Please Show some culture, education, and class unlike that clown that posted a one star bellow. What a troll. David C. MY REVIEW. . . Wait staff is incredible, The food is delicious, although I have sent back my steak a few times because I like it medium rare, they get on it, and deliver perfection each time. ( I eat here frequently for business, and pleasure ) The price is very affordable. Selection phenomenal, the wine ( leatherneck wine ) delicious, ask for the port wine, not on the menu. The piano player is excellent. OK the VIEW IS INCREDIBLE !  Stars. you would pay  down the street at Morton's for half the food, and not as good a steak, without a view. over here for two with wine, you are looking at half that. I love old fashioned spots. And the view is gorgeous. And the piano. It even plays itself after the pianist goes home. So awesome. My NY Strip was perfectly seared and salted. I loved the buttermilky salad dressing. Even our bottle of pinot noir was great. All in all, we had a stellar experience. Good place to celebrate. Bring your folks. Go! WARNING! Grab your reading glasses because I'm about to go off! Yelp, if you were real I would kick you in the teeth! I took my girlfriend to San Francisco for valentines day, I thought this would be a nice place for dinner since it had a view, WRONG! The day of valentines, I called just to check on our reservation; I wanted everything to be perfect. While on the phone with the ""hostess"" (an older Asian lady)  I ask, ""Is this a romantic place"" WHAT? she says,  I repeat ""I'm bringing my girlfriend and we never been there so I was just seeing if this place was nice for a romantic dinner"" she replies rudely, ""well it depends on what you consider romantic"". I'm speechless, I was just looking for a little validation that I made a good choice in picking Leatherneck Steakhouse. ""Well do you think this is a good place to bring a date for valentines? Do you have candles on the table or anything?"" In a very rude annoyed voice, ""Well it all depends, I'm not sure what you would"" ""DAMN IT, JUST FORGET IT!"" I interrupt her"" JUST FORGET IT!""  and I just hang up on her. Right there, I should have just said forget this place, but, its valentines and everywhere else is booked! So I stick to the plan. We arrive at Leatherneck which is inside a hotel and proceed up the elevator, I notice that there are quite a few elderly people milling about. My girlfriend who is in her mid 's is dressed sexy, like a girl who is in her mid 's. I'm dressed in sports jacket and nice shoes etc. So we take the elevator up to the th floor which seems like a cool ride,  a ride that would build the anticipation for a romantic evening. Well when the doors flung open we unknowingly step out of a time machine into the year ! Now I was not there, but I imagine  was just an ok year, it wasn't ""the year of romance"".   As we walk in we I see the old ass, rude lady and rather than me wag my finger in her face and tell her about good service, I simply give her my name and we proceed to our table. I am in shock, As we walked to our table (like in the movies)  the music stopped, and the entire room looked our way with mouths open.  A woman, head down, about to put soup in her mouth, dropped her spoon in her soup and it splashed in her face but she didn't blink an eye, her mouth was open and  she stared at us in disbelief. OK, OK, now that really didn't happen, but it sure felt like it. . . This place looks as outdated and tacky as saying ""bling"" do describe shiny jewelry. It looked like an old raggedy lounge in the back of an Arizona bowling alley where  they threw in  tables and chairs and called a ""steakhouse"". I mean, I'm not rich, but I have been to some nice restaurants in my time, this place wouldn't rank as decent. If you added up the age of every person,  the average would be ish I kid you not, the men had long eyebrows and looked like Andy Rooney from /. I love older folk, but this was not the scene I was looking for on a date. First of all, the chairs had arm rest and rolling wheels, I assume that is to help the older people to get in and out from the table. Anyways, we sit down and the music starts and people go back to eating and talking,  I notice we are in the middle isle of the restaurant, that spectacular view of the city, we get no part of. My girlfriend is giving me ""the smile"", the this place sucks sweaty balls but I'm going to smile and act like I'm happy, smile. Immediately  we see a couple leaving the coveted table by the window area and I beg our waiter to move us, he was very nice and says he will see if we can move. He walks over to the manager and I can see them talking. I'm thinking in my head, please please lets us move there. I notice the manager peak over at the two of us, then proceed to shake his head. I was optimistic and thought, ""maybe hes saying: NO problem, move those nice people at once!""Not a chance, the waiter comes back apologetic, saying he cant move us. Five mins later, another couple comes and sits in the prized window seats. I'm really unhappy and so is my girlfriend. We are sitting in this center isle with people buzzing by us on both sides; like a table in the middle of the sidewalk downtown NYC. So as the manager walks by, I asked him why we couldn't move, he replies, ""we cant just move people"" , in the most rude tone ever and walks away!  This was suppose to be first come first serve and we had not even ordered, It would have been no consequence to move us. We decide to just leave. I give the manager a good lashing on the way out!! To conclude my essay on leatherneck steakhouse, if you are under the age of , read my entire rant, and you still dine at Leatherneck, you may want to seek Therapy from a board trained, highly qualified Psychologist or MFT! I have done my part, I have warned the masses, I have returned with the tablets from high among the clouds,  the commandments read. . Thou, shall not steal. . . and don't eat at Leatherneck ""steakhouse I was mostly satisfied with Leathernecks, but there are some things I would do differently if I were to try this place again. My boyfriend made the reservations a few weeks in advance for our short stay in SF (we live in Reno, NV). We did not think about it when making reservations, but wish we would have thought to ask for a ""window seat. "" We were in the middle, and the view was just not the same! We were pretty disappointed, but we realize this was our fault, not theirs. It took them longer than expected to bring us water and a menu, but we soon received our waters and ordered our meal (filet mignon for me, prime rib for boyfriend and mac and cheese to share). The service dwindled from there. I'm not sure if it was our age ( and , much younger than the rest of the crowd) or what, but our waiter was not too pleasant. Very short (no, I'm not talking height!) and only checked on us once. We definitely expected better service. The salad comes with bleu cheese, and I'm not a fan. So, I requested ranch dressing only to find out I had two other options: thousand island or vinaigrette. I opted for the vinaigrette. ""Salad"" is served. A corner chunk of iceberg lettuce with some dressing drizzled on top. Pathetic. I had about two bites and didn't finish the rest. Vinaigrette does not go well with iceberg lettuce. I was expecting a GREEN salad with lots of goodies on top. Very disappointing. Steaks and mac and cheese were delicious. My boyfriend decided to order the truffle tater tots as well after we had received our meal, and you could tell our waiter was not pleased. Not sure what the big deal was. The tots were also very good! Overall, the experience was okay. I'd go back for a special occasion, but there are some things I've learned! Service makes a BIG difference, but there's little I can do about that! For a pitiful salad and below par service, just three stars. Great steaks good service and awesome sundae. But not the fucking greatest. The best part of the restaurant is undoubtedly the view. The prices for lunch are very reasonable, especially considering the location. But the food is nothing incredible. Dinner is definitely more on par with other restaurants for dinner, but I'm not sold that the quality is. I got the sea bass and it was so salty I was chugging my water. I made the mistake of coming during the lunch hour. I asked our server is the chef could make us a rib eye steak. After he confirmed with the chef that it was possible we waited quite a while for out food preparation. To my surprise, the food arrived and boy was I surprised. My medium rare steak was nothing other than the rib eye cut from the lunch menu (English cut). The waiter explained that the meat was pre cooked and he was sorry that the temperature wasn't what I expected. What a waste of an hour of my time. Great steakhouse with a better view. The restaurant is located on the th and top floor of the hotel and we got a table in the corner of the house with a million dollar view. The ambiance is nice and dim as you'd expect from a steak house and the bar right up front is a very welcomed sight. The appetizers (calamari, oysters rockefeller, and truffle tater tots) were all delicious. Our table got two filet mignons and two ribeyes (all medium rare of course) and it was phenomenal. Probably the best steak I've had in a long time. We were in a rush because we arrived at : (and the kitchen closes at : for new orders) but luckily my friends already knew what they wanted. Our waitress was very helpful and always made sure we were doing just fine. A bottle of red wine to accompany our dinner gives this restaurant a guaranteed  stars. Spectacular views and service, you CANNOT go wrong with Leatherneck Steakhouse.  We were fortunate to get reservations for eight people on short notice during Oracle Open World week, and not ony that, reservations with an amazing view of downtown San Francisco. The Leatherneck Steakhouse is located on top of the Marine hotel on Sutter street.  When our party arrived, we were greeted by very friendly hostesses and seated directly in front of the window front view overlooking downtown.  Our waiter was spectacular and provided incredible service throughout the meal.  Our table ordered a number of appetizers including the tuna tartar, calamari, and cheese plate.  While most of our table ordered a variety of different steaks, I couldn't refuse the salmon. I must say, while our table highly applauded their dishes, I have truly never had a juicier or more flavorful filet of salmon.  It was absolutely amazing. Overall we were all really pleased with this restaurant, and by the way, if you're waiting at the bar, they have glasses of goldfish as their bar food.  Can't beat the snack that smiles back :). Went to the leatherneck steakhouse because it was close to our hotel.  First off the staff was very friendly, courteous, and prompt.  Secondly the view was nice I would say it would have been better after dark or at sundown.  The steak was good, my wife's lamb was good though cooked in a Moroccan style which really seemed strange for the type of restaurant it was. Mike is a wonderful bartender, with a great personality!  Hm, wonder why all of my reviews seems to revolve around bars and drinks.  Wonder if I should be worried.  NOT!?! great service, great view, and the food is even betterso glad we randomly found this placestarted with drinks to enjoy the great viewpuree of veggie soup to start was simple and delicious  the way a puree should be made  sans creamour steaks were cooked perfectly  petit filet for the wife w/ mac n cheese and  oz ribeye w/ shrooms for me  we both loved our mains w/ the sides  these are high quality steaks (my ribeye was tender, marbled but not super fatty and packed full of flavor) at a fraction of the cost you pay at other spots we cannot wait to come back Dim lighting. Amazing view of the city. Piano on the background. This is one of the most intimate and romantic places to enjoy your steak. Appetizer: Prosciutto wrap tomato basil Entrees: Prime rib and petite filet oscar (crab, asparagus, bearnaise)Sides: Mashed potatoes and truffle tater tots (MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE! I will come back just for 'em tots) I saw the good rating of this restaurant and decided to take my parents there for their last dinner in SF. I know steakhouses like this usually run out of space quickly so in the morning, I deliberately came to the restaurant and asked if a reservation was needed. They told me no, that there would always be empty tables on weekdays. Perfect. When we showed up for dinner at :pm, the waitress told us that they actually would have a party in the restaurant and they wouldn't take any walk ins. I was told that I wouldn't need a reservation, but I understand that things change. However, their way of talking just makes my head burn. Both the waitress and the manager were rude and disrespectful, not showing any signs of regret or apology for the mistakes their people made. We walked out and talked to the reception downstairs for the hotel, with whom we had a much better experience. Their staff was a lot understanding and helpful, and got us a reservation at a different steakhouse. I will come back to SF many times but never walk into this restaurant again. My fiancée and I had a : reservation on a Saturday night. We showed up at : but, even though we were early, they got us right in and sat us at a table by the window. The food was delicious (and very affordable) and the view was amazing. The live pianist was extremely talented and personable. He played unlimited requests (I think he played  of our requests) and made a point of talking with everyone who came in and left and greeted the regulars by name. For dinner I ordered the petite filet Oscar and it was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing. We also had the truffle tots  definitely a must try! Admittedly, the service was a bit slow. However, we weren't really in a hurry, particularly because we were enjoying the live music and the view, but it could be an issue if you had somewhere to be after dinner. Definitely stop in the bathroom  it has a surprising amount of character! Overall, this place has a level of elegance and style that is hard to find anymore. Nice looking restaurant with great views. I came here wearing a Hugo Boss sweater, Seven jeans and D&G white shoes. The waiter turned me away from the main dining area because I wasn't dressed for appropriately for the floor. She sat me in an dead area with no other diners. I walked away after sitting for a few moments feeling disrespected. Was a guest of friends for a very special going away celebration. Have heard wonderful recommendations about this restaurant but had no idea what a true dining experience this would be. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted by the very gracious manager, Edda. Our service was prompt but leisurely. Out wonderful server, Tracy, could not have been more professional or personable. Her knowledge of the menu and assistance in ordering just the right entrees and wines was outstanding.  This was a wonderful dining experience with great food, wonderful ambience and outstanding views. I highly recommend the Leatherneck. I loved this place, the food, the service, the views!  All stellar!  I am actually afraid to tell everyone how awesome this place is because I may have a long wait next time I try and go LOL. . .  I had an end cut prime rib and it was off the hook!  Green beans were amazing and I had some amazing glasses of wine  red wine  Chalone I think. . . Hubby had the filet and he mowed it down.  We also had the truffle tater tots which were yummy.  We went here on Valentines Day and got to sit at a window seat.  We also came here for lunch the day before and had a great salad and pulled pork sandwich.  This place is not well known but it is definitely and A++ place to eat. . . Valet parking was nearby and not very expensive either. . . Highly recommended. . . I think it is all about. I can't deserve more than anything from any food shop. It should be the best one in this area. Everything was so cute here. I never forget to order TRUFFLE TATER TOTS. I never thought it could be o delicious! Food decoration is also cool and good looking to raise your appetite!! I'm gonna keep this review real short and sweet:Best steakhouse in San Francisco. No questions asked. If your looking for the best steak in town at a nice restaurant, Leatherneck is where you need to go. Wow, this place is incredible! Amazing food, gorgeous views, even a live piano player (who just happened to be playing some of my all time favorite songs from The Phantom of the Opera). We started with the crab cakes. Now, I love crab cakes, and pretty much always order them if they are on a menu when I go anywhere, and I've had some really good crab cakes in my life, but these were the best I've ever had. Perfectly seasoned, not overly cooked, and they had a great sauce drizzled on top (not quite sure what it was but it was delicious!) Next was a simple wedge salad, with a blue cheese dressing that was to die for! Then I had the sea bass, and my boyfriend had the glazed salmon. We shared because both were incredible. Every bite I took just melted in my mouth. I loved the food so much, for the first time in my life I asked if I could speak with the Chef to give him my compliments. He came out right away, and was very nice and thanked us for being there. He recommended the passion fruit cheesecake for desert. Now we were quite full, but the way he talked about the cheesecake seamed like we just had to try it. We shared a piece and OH MY GOD it was unbelievable! Anyone going there just has to try it! We also had a bottle of their house red wine with dinner which was a cabernet sauvignon, and was quite nice. The service was superb, the views were breathtaking. I would recommend going anytime, but especially for a special occasion (we were celebrating an early Valentines Day). Great, high quality food. Definitely feels like a  star restaurant without  star prices. I cannot wait to go back! This spot is a gem. Phenomenal view and a classy ambiance to compliment it. The bruschetta was on hit, and the truffle tater tots were also quite nice. I may be a little biased since anything with truffle on it makes it better in my eyes, but even still, they were delightful. And the ribeye that i ordered was a fair size, and cooked just how i asked. Looking for a last night in SF treat during my last visit, I wanted to check out a relatively inexpensive steakhouse and the Yelp monocle led me here. Awesome view, super nice service but I didn't like how I couldn't take my meal at the bar. Instead I had to be THAT guy who sits at a table for  by himself but aside from that, I had a delicious rib eye and those truffle tots, holy crap that was good. Be sure to eat the tots while they're still hot to get that delicious truffle oil taste and hot crunch. Once they start cooling down, they start losing their properties of awesomeness. The view is actually so cool that I could see the floodlights at the stadium in Oakland that night for the Raiders game. i am giving this restaurant one star because i was very disappointed and displeased with the service here. a few days before coming to this restaurant, i called to make reservations for my brother's birthday. a male hostess answered the phone. he asked if i was a guest at the hotel, my name, and phone number and time and date that i wanted to come in for dinner. he said he will write it down and that i was set for that time and date. so a few days after making this reservation, i come to the restaurant. i told the hostess that i had reservations at pm, but then he said that my name was not there. he even let me check the book. and i checked for myself and my name WAS NOT THERE. the person i was talking to on the phone said he would WRITE MY name but OBVIOUSLY didn't because my name was not under the time and date. I was very annoyed and pissed off because the male hostess i talked to the phone lied or forgot or something and did not write the name. it was my brother's birthday and i was pissed that he didn't even write my name like he said he would. the hostess said he didn't even have a table for us and that we had to wait until happy hour was over. he didnt even TRY to accomodate us after not even putting our name on the list in the first place. (im not sure if he was the hostess or not that i talked to on the phone). he just said wait for happy hour to be over. i said okay we'll do that but he didnt even ask for my name or phone number.  For that i am never going back because of the TERRIBLE service. i didnt even try the food. . . but dont come back here due to poor service and when the employees don't try to accomodate you after forgetting to put your name on the reservation list. By the time we arrived at the restaurant for our  pm reservation, the restaurants as out of Prime Rib.  I ordered  first courses, the French Onion soup and the Ahi Tartare. The server came back and said they were out of the French Onion soup.  I ordered a salad instead.  She proceeded to forget my second first course (which was to be my entree).   Then I was informed that the restaurant was also out of the Ahi Tartare.  Our server, Marissa, was rude and totally inattentive to our needs (we couldn't order a second drink until we flagged down a busboy.  But she was quick to deliver the check which included a built in tip in excess of what we would have been willing to give her in light of her poor attitude. I took a group of . We had a wonderful time. The service was very attentive and the food was excellent. Don't leave without trying the berry crisp for dessert. Wow!  This steakhouse is so affordable compared to many in the City.  They give you so many lil appies when you sit down, nice breads, dips, crudite and butter of course, with some mighty tasty baked garlic.  We totally enjoyed!We each ordered steak and again were amazed at the prices:  $ for small  ozs Filet Mignon and NY Steak.  Both came with wedge salads which define the rich and gooey pleasure of blue cheese ""ole school"" dressing.  We even popped for an amazing rich and creamy Panna Cotta with pear topping dessert, coffee and a nice bottle of Cabernet wine.  We really feel that the prices are subsidized overall by Marine's Memorial being a membership club.  Anyone can eat there though, and I do suggest reservations as we were there promptly at :pm and they were already full for the evening.  The piano bar is a nice touch and the views are incredible!  ~Ms. Ali We found the restaurant to be very quiet with excellent views of San Francisco. We ate at the Seasons a couple of days before and I can honestly say that the steak is far better at this restaurant. Cooked exactly the way you ordered it (RibEye & Filet). The Iceberg Wedge with blue cheese was surprisingly excellent and the Bearnaise sauce is fantastic. The Oysters Rockefeller is exquisite. Service was among the best I have had in SF. The ambiance is similar to a what an officers mess in the military and the attention to detail shows. Best steak restaurant we visited on our  day trip to SF. Onion soup: too little cheese, and I barely tasted onion in the soup!Prime ribs: completely flavorless! Even the raw horseradish sauce isn't as strong as that in House of Prime RibsAmbiance: good view of SF if you sit right by the windows. This place was like a retirement/senior home, as the avg age of diners there was probably . Definetly a  star experience. This is a private club, but allows the general public to eat.  The dining room is on the  floor with a beautiful view of the bay from the wall of windows.  We decided to reserve for the sunset, but unfortunately it was a very foggy evening.  But what the hell?  This is after all San Francisco. We ordered the  oz. prime rib and split it.  Spliting charge was $, but this included  salad wedges with very good blue cheese dressing and crumbles.  After reading about the truffle tater tots we ordered them along with asparagas with hollandaise sauce. The warm rolls were fantastic. Everything that was said about the potatoes was right on. Absolutely delicious crispiness.  The asparagas was totally tender and yummy.  The prime rib was done perfectly with a slightly salty crispy rub.  The service was friendly, attentive, and professional.  Water glasses were constantly refilled and several times the waiter and maitre de stopped by the table to ask if everything was okay. I would suggest this hidden gem to anyone who wants a unique and memorable dining experience in the City. For old people. Good view. Meat is good. But everything else seemed pre made hours ago. The crudités at the beginning of meal was so dried out. As soon I saw that they served us dry ass jicama, I realized I didn't have to be proper.  The ahi tuna tower was bland. The filet mignon was cooked to order and pretty good. So was the mushroom side. Dessert was panna cotta. It tasted like it was made yesterday. Otherwise, good service. Dinner came out to . Wish the food was better. Came here on a whim after reading the reviews on yelp and we were pleasantly surprised. It's not a super fancy place, and the service was a bit on the slow side although very very friendly. Nice ambiance as they had a pianist playing beautiful music at the bar. We ordered a filet mignon and a ribeye  both were cooked as we ordered, and tasted great. Had the bernaise sauce and horseradish sauce on the side. Based on other reviews, we had the truffle tater tots  definitely a MUST HAVE  and the macaroni and cheese. The wine list is unique in that it featured wineries owned by military families. We enjoyed a tasty pinot noir. For dessert, we had the chocolate pot de creme. All in all, a very nice evening and the food was really good. I'd defnitely come back here the next time I'm in San Fran. Interesting throw back in time. . . . . dress code for the guys. . . . . great view, my date and I  arrived for sunset on a clear day.  We split the  oz. prime rib and ordered three sides: truffle tater tots, swiss chard and string beans.  Iceberg wedge with delicious ranch dressing.  Plenty of food for two and the service was good.  Piano bar.  Friendly staff.  and again: great view, ask for a window seat.  BTW way she loved it. Awesome food and even better views. We arrived while it was still light and had a full panoramic view of the city as night fell and the lights came on, spectacular! The fillet steak was brilliant and the service was good. This place is very underrated.  Amazing views, food and service.  Mac and cheese is a must! First time here! The truffle fries are PERFECTION. Crispy, delicious, not too oily, I was in heaven!! Delicious!They were out of prime rib and two people in my party wanted it, so they were disappointed, but the truffle fries, m lol The Pros: great view reservations not difficult affordable drinks good house wine prices were pretty good truffle tater tots were awesomeThe Cons: spotty service  filet was dry & cold prime rib was off tastingso overall, the service and food taste will be sacrificed for a great view and a more economical and lower quality meat.  Without the view, the steak isn't worth the price."
Florio Bar & Cafe|3.5|French in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|241|-1|3.67692307692|" Hangar Steak was very, very good! Cocktails and ambience were exceptional. . . . service. . . not so much. I will return. . . maybe they were just having a bad night. I feel as though I've stepped back in time when dining at Florio. I like the ambiance, however it can be crowded and the noise level is loud. I had the seafood stew, it was delicious. My friends and I found this place on yelp, and my friend was concerned about the less than  star yelp review. I told her, ""come on it's San Francisco, people are entitled here"". I was wrong. SFers know their shit. This place was SO unremarkable. Service was pretentious with a side of attitude. The food portions were so tiny. I ordered soup and salad, and immediately hit up Trader Joes after leaving as I was still hungry. One out of five of us enjoyed their food, while the others were not impressed.  So many better places in the city, would avoid this place. Decent neighborhood joint! Good cocktails, full of classy old people who look like long time locals (=they keep coming back) and a really good seafood stew. Good service. I am seriously confused about these mediocre reviews. I went to Florio last Thursday night and it was a wonderfully pleasant experience. Feeling like I was instantly swept away to an old bar in Europe upon arrival was the biggest treat. We sat outside and were greeted by a sweet waitress and some bread and butter (exceptional bread and butter to be specific). We ordered a lovely sauv blanc, the mussels and little gem salad to start. The wine was refreshing for a hot SF night (and a recommendation from the waitress) and the mussels were incredible the celery based broth was so flavorful we literally drank it with a spoon towards the end. The little gem salad was pretty standard but a great starter nonetheless. The real winner of this meal? The steak and frites. Holy crap. Dare I say it's the best I ever had? I'll say it it was amazing. The steak cut like butter (and came with a side of butter sauce bernaise as the French call it) and was cooked perfectly. The frites were amazingly salty and crispy but tender at the same time (and paired nicely with the aforementioned butter sauce). From the setting to the meal, it was really an ideal experience. I can't wait to go back! This place is a neighborhood gem with outstanding high end food that has balanced flavors  and plenty of options. The staff is friendly and attentive. We had a variety of cocktails and wines with our party of  and enjoyed it all. I would most strongly recommend the Seafood Stew A La Provencal. Its surprisingly light broth is combined with hearty portions of seafood I have a very healthy appetite and it filled me up. Try the burger, it is delicious! Great for a small group dinner. Such a great place for dinner. . . date night! We started with the crispy anchovies and prosciutto and burratta, just delicious and wonderful. For dinner, the burger was amazing and the duck confit was superb. The mustard that the grass fed beef burger is served with makes it that much better. Love the pure and great ingredients they use for their dishes. Love the carafe of wine in addition to the glass and bottles. Merry Edwards Sauvignon Blanc went perfectly with our first course. The server made great recommendations for us to make our dining experience amazing! Food was great! Tuna confit and seafood stew. Delicious! Service is bad. Well. . . the table of the owners friends behind us are getting good service. Us, not so much. Would have been  stars with better service. Guess it's all about who you know Unlike the service at this restaurant I'll make this quick. The food was average, the service was slow, and we had to find the host so he could seat us. Won't be eating eat here again. Wow.  Where to begin. . .  The one star is for the food.  It was actually good but served VERY cold even after a ""reheat"".  On the suggestion of a friend, we ate dinner at Florio.  The vibe is way cool.  It felt like a small restaurant in Paris (not that I've been there  yet!).  I loved the decor and the bar.  I was excited to try this place out. . . Our waitress did not match the vibe.  She was curt and had a strange attitude. . .  I had a hard time decideing what to order.  EVERYTHING sounded amazing!!  After ordering drinks we waited and waited and waited and waited to order dinner.  Minutes  MANY of them passed and at this point we were at .  No waitress.  The owner was near by but he was busy chatting with the regulars. . .  We were unable to get his attention.  I was about to get up and walk to the kitchen and place the orders myself when a busboy wandered by. We asked him if he could possibly find our waitress.  He did.  She arrived with an excuse that we told her we would be here all night so she figured she would let us take our time.  Huh?  We never said that.  I'm pretty sure what we said was, ""We are so hungry and everything looks amazing"". . .  How that translate into don't worry about us, take your time wherever you are. . .  check in in an hour or two. . .  I will never know. SO!  Food ordered and at this point we went from hungry to starving.  It took FOREVER for our food to arrive (this is a small joint) and when it did  it was COLD.  The frites were soggy and cold and the steak was cold to the touch.  Our plates obviously sat for  minutes before our stellar waitress decided she would allow us to eat.  My friend and I were not pleased.  A $ steak should at least have some warmth.  This time we flagged down the owner and the waitress put the food down and fled.  I told him our food was ice cold.  He took it all away apologizing profusely.  He offered cocktails on the house which was nice but truthfully we just wanted a warm dinner with an equally warm waitress.  About   minutes later our food reappears just a tad bit warmer.  I'm not sure what they did (microwave) but at this point we just shrugged and said, ""Oh well"".  Our waitress reappeared and never ONCE offered an apology nor a question about how the food was.  She could not have been MORE disinterested.  It was shocking.  The owner did come by to ask how the food was and I told him it was ""ok"".  I also told him we had been sitting there FOREVER and his waitress could not have been more inattentive and disinterested.  All he could say was, ""I know, I know"". . . I usually like to try a restaurant twice before writing a review or just personally deciding never to return.  In this case I already made up my mind.  With so many restaurants on Fillmore, skip this one and eat where your time, money and opinion is valued. Epic steak frites. One of the better steaks I've had in the city. Good French wines by the glass too. Have been here a couple times now. Both times had an amazing experience. The restaurant has a great atmosphere and friendly service. The food is a little pricier with smaller portions, but great flavor. Would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a little more expensive spot on Fillmore. Expect to be ""In For A Treat"" enough said. Always good, but Friday they were incredibly good!!Dave had the salmon and a  salad   I had a taste of his salmon and ordered the same salad  total perfection!  Okay, I am a salad snob.  That being said, I admit it is hard to please me when it comes to salad  Florio salad was perfection.  Karen had the halibut and raved about it.  I ordered the Provencal fish stew and was delighted to receive classically prepared bourride  oh so good!Noise level allowed for conversation and the atmosphere (and wait staff) made a comfortable evening. This review has been due for a LONG LONG time. This is one of the best restaurants in the city, great food and wine etc. I am always looking forward to an excellent dining experience at FLORIO. We came in here for drinks while waiting for a table at a different restaurant. Wines are pretty expensive, and there's little bar space to hang out. We had our one drink and left. Flawless. . . . Intimate yet lively. Great service. Wonderful bread and butter to start. Fresh French seafood and meat dishes all around. The pate is my favorite citywide. Amazing! Nice place. Menu a little small and difficult.  The drinks are so so.   The food is very good.   The atmosphere is great.  The people are very friendly. Consistent and classy. You can't go wrong sitting at their amber lit bar with a cocktail, hamburger (grilled to gooey perfection with cowgirl creamery cheese and onion on rye), and pommes frites (crisp, thin, and salty). Service is unobtrusive and seasoned. Great spot to dine alone or with a partner, as the dining area is a bit small for groups. Pros: Lavazza coffee was good! quick to be seated classy interior designCons: slow to receive food (even when we were the only patrons) French toast was burned (and flipped upside down to hide char)Bottom line: come here if you're really hungry and every other restaurant on Fillmore has a long wait Came here on a date. Great, cozy and vibrant atmosphere on Saturday nights. Cocktails, wine list and food was wonderful and the staff was particularly courteous and friendly. Definitely would recommend and go back. .  of  star. Overall my experience there is not bad although they don't serve Ice tea. The compliment bread with butter is very good. Perfect to eat with butter or dip it in sauce. We ordered the prawn as appetizer and it was amazing. I love the spice they put in the dish and great to deep the bread in it. The bolognese sauce with bacon was delicious. Very tasty even though the pastas were little soft past al dente and little salty. We were too full to get to the dessert round so save that for next time. We love this place. . . but think about the provenance. . . the owner is owner of a few other GREAT places in SF   Market Bar (Ferry Building Farmers market) and Bix to  name a few. . . this place is definitely a neighborhood place in the feeling but the service and food is worth the trip even in you don't live nearby. Essential to a place like this is a great bar, you can go in alone or with a friend and have a drink and get a great dinner. My favorite bar person is Tara. Just love her. She never steers us wrong on wine and food pairing and she is fun to talk to.  I also really like the host, he is so stylish and used to work at Hermes. He is so fun to talk to. The wait staff is very professional and knows their stuff. We have dined here easily  times at a table and the service has always been great. The roasted chicken is a staple like Zuni café and never disappoints. You can order it for one or two people and its a always tweaked in terms of sides with it for the season . The weekly fish and vegetable is also awesome. They tend to be seasonal and more farm to table which I love. They also have some great wine producers  that can be had by the bottle or glass or even by the tap.  They also have great rose wines from France is which can be spotty to find in SF. They have a full bar and do a some great weekly cocktails too. On a final note I am picky about a place being clean. No issues on the dining room and equally important, the bathroom is always clean and nice. If you don't know where to go for dinner tonight  a friend, a date or a business meeting, this place is just right and there are a ton of bars and other places to go after you have dinner. This is a place you can take you elderly aunt, your younger cousin or your fun friend from out of town and have an equally good time. I wish they were open for lunch! Very nice, sophisticated menu, venue and service. Good bar and wine list, good apps and high quality, limited menu. Have eaten here twice and both meals were very good. Friend and I tried to get into SPQR for Saturday night dinner, but unsurprisingly, the wait was over an hour, so we strolled over to Florio and found a spot at the bar. I should have checked Yelp before ordering, but I was craving pasta, so I decided on the gnocchi. Sadly, when the dish came out, all I found were   tiny pieces of dough scattered on my plate with a bland white sauce poured over. This dish was definitely not filling and I felt like I was eating an appetizer. I asked for extra bread just to satiate my appetite. My friend ordered the burger which at least looked substantial in portion and came with side of fries. Service was attentive but not the warmest. I felt bad though  we were sitting at the bar, so our server had to manage making drinks for everyone else at the restaurant. Will I be back? Potentially for drinks before having dinner somewhere else on Fillmore St. Great atmosphere, good service, and the best roasted chicken for two I've ever had.  Comes with roasted veggies and a side of pommel frites. Lost a star because the noise level was god awful.  We were there on Saturday.  Waiter told us to try Sun/Mon/Tues. Will certainly give it another go. . . . 'cause of the chicken! Walked by this place and picked it based on atmosphere. The meal ended up being really good.  We got the carafe of white wine which was good. Nice and fruity tones.  We shared a roasted pear salad which had a really nice overall taste if you got all of the ingredients into one bite (was a bit peppery though).  Our entrees were the chicken and hanger steak.  Both were prepared perfectly,  I got frites on the side,  They were great, but afterward I felt they were a bit over salted (could just be me, I mean, fries are supposed to be salty).  Dessert: caramelized apple tart (yes, highly recommended); vanilla and persimmon gelato (persimmon gelato was awesome). Pasta and crab was wonderful and loved the atmosphere oops. i got the wrong restaurant. I've deleted my review but left the stars out of embarrassment. I can only comment on the bar, and one bartender (Gerald was the name on my receipt). I have never been treated so rudely in my life. I was at the bar, with a couple of friends for a couple of hours while we were waiting for our table at State Bird, so we were ordering drinks and appetizers. Service  of drinks at the bar was unbelievably slow for a restaurant that was not crowded. But, that was not offensive, only annoying. This bartender never once asked if we want another round. We literally had to beg him to take another order. Then one more joined our party and it took a long time to get Gerald's attention. When we finally did he responded, I am helping these other people first because they were here first. Um, Gerald, no they were not. Our friend was waiting for you to grace us with your attention long before they walked in. And the entire time we were there you actedas if we were some sort of nuisance. I am not sure why he did not want a small, quiet group of young professionals spending money at his bar. But don't worry, Gerald, we never will again. I was visiting from out of town and found Florio in Yelp. The place perfect for what we were looking for. Great food. We ordered the pork belly, which could have had a little more flavor, and burrata which was great. The main course consisted of the meatball, amazing and filling, and the seafood squid pasta dish, which was the best in the menu I thought. I highly recommend this place for ambiance and good food. Spaghetti with meatballs made from veal, pork and ricotta was delicious. The little gem house salad was also wonderful, but maybe a little pricey for the portion. Ambience is very cozy. All in all, a delightful experience. Fantastic dinner. I had the sweet corn soup with dungeness crab and they were right about the juicy & flavorful roasted chicken. It came with some great greens and delicious mushrooms cooked just right. Great energy and very close to our church at St Doms. I hadn't been to Florio in  years since I had lunch with a friend and before that, a send off dinner for my then boyfriend before he moved to DC. It was one of our favorite restaurants among many; given that fact, it was time for a return visit. (And on my birthday no less expectations were running high). I started with the Barbary Coast cocktail (spiced rum, angostura bitters & lime) and it was refreshing and delicious. But then came the potato leek soup. Topped with creme fraiche with a taste of lemon, the consistency of the soup was far too thick. I think it was a combination of sitting too long and having far too much starch in the soup. It was gluey;  I was starting to worry. Luckily, the fresh corn and mascarpone ravioli were outstanding and restored my faith:  Five or six little saucers of savory goodness with a dramatic plated presentation of two post modern smears of fresh beet juice. The aftertaste of the pasta wrapper, though, was a bit chalky; it just missed pure perfection. I still would've licked my plate if it were socially acceptable. The service, though the service was perfect. Every staff member worked with each other in perfect harmony. I never had to wait nor feel hovered over. They are true professionals. I wasn't charged for the disappointing soup and I appreciate not having to ask. My experience was good, especially the service. I'd want to return soon to see if I hit it on a slightly off night. Sweet spot in an outstanding dining corridor of the Fillmore Strip. WOW, my new favorite restaurant. Service was superior, food was innovative and bursting with flavor. I had white corn and mascarpone ravioli with blackberry coulis creme fraiche and fresh sage. So great. Then the desserts were out of this world. Butterscotch pot de creme and blackberry cheesecake. I can't wait to go back! Florio feels like French brasserie that's comfortable and inviting when you walk in.  It's got a great mahogany bar, classic dark wood accents and an open kitchen. We started off by sharing a bowl of the potato leek soup which was warm and delicious. Ever tried fiddlehead fern? They remind me of a cross between a green bean and an asparagus; and when they're sautéed in lemon, red chili and olive oil, they're delicious! Next up:  Mussels.  They were cooked with shallots, capers, spring onion, garlic and preserved Meyer lemon.  The sauce wasn't to be wasted; that's when the crusty French bread came in handy!Overall the food was very good, but the service (non engaging/grumpy waiter) and the general attention to detail were a bit lacking.  Would we go back?  ~ If they improved the service, probably.  I came here on a weeknight for date night. We got a half carafe of the rose du jour, which hit the sweet spot for our budget and taste for the night. I had the beef and veal meatballs & spaghetti and he had the seafood stew. The meatballs were great! Good blend of the two types of meat and tasty, not breaking the bank. Seafood stew was a bit watery for a ""stew"", but tasted fine. I'd probably try something else next time. The service is great and it's a cute cozy Italian place on Fillmore surrounded by cute shops and bars to do things before or after. Only problem is that it's tough to choose between all the restaurants! Head here on a Sunday evening and sit at the bar.  Order whatever is on the wine tap and get the special  spaghetti and meatballs (Sundays only).  Butter lettuce salad has a dressing I can't figure out, but want to. $ for a tiny, dry and salty piece of halibut.  Service was mediocre.  A total disappointment. My very first time dining at Florio a couple of weeks ago. . . I should have written the review the day after, because now I can't remember the names of the dishes or the name of our friendly server. But I was so happy when he suggested this place. I've walked by this place countless times and it has been on my long list of restaurants I want to try in the city.  So naturally I was excited to check this place out. I immediately fell in love with this place the second we walked in. I just love the dark wood through out, white linen tables with candles. . . the overall vintage romantic decor. I didn't even have to taste anything, especially when he told me that he's seen Robin Williams dine here. . . I had no doubts that the food would have to match the intimate ambiance. . . and it did. We started off with a glass of champagne. And as I vented and poured out the tension in my head and then received excellent advice, I soon became extremely hungry. He ordered the olives, which is one of the few things I never eat. And I had warm seasoned almonds which were surprisingly yummy & addicting. He ordered a bottle of   Cabernet Sauvignon (ugh, I can't remember the name. . . But I think it was local. . . Napa or Sonoma). . . which paired well with the steak I had. He ordered the chicken. Both were delicious. Customer service was excellent. I look forward to coming back. Almost like stepping into a cafe in Europe. Loved the dark romantic atmosphere. Had the air chilled chicken entree dish, um Fabulous! So much flavor! Tried the pecan tart for dessert: made me want to melt into my chair it was do good. Was surprised by my boyfriend for dinner here for Valentines Day :) I was a happy camper I came here for dinner with my sister and dad before a show at the Fillmore on a Friday night.  We were the first to be sat since we got there right when they opened at : p. m.  Our waiter was very helpful and let us know all of the best options on the menu.  Our cocktails were delicious and my dad and I both had their specialty one that involved bourbon, ginger and an orange liqueur. For an appetizer we got the speck, herb almonds and chicken pate.  The speck and almonds were very tasty but the chicken pate was left practically uneaten.  For main course, I did a half and half of rib ragu and fennel & lamb sausage which was great that the waiter told me I could do since I was having a hard time deciding.  I enjoyed both but probably favored the fennel & lamb. My sister had the potato gnocchi which was tasty.  For dessert we ordered the pistachio gelato and pecan tart but they messed up and gave us an apple crisp instead of the pecan tart which was a bit disappointing.  The pistachio gelato was overwhelming and way too much pistachio. Overall, we enjoyed everything except the chicken pate and the gelato but had a great dinner over good food, cocktails and wine with just a short walk to the Fillmore! Went here for dinner last night on a date first timer! We got the burrata which was amazing and then the beet salad which was also good. . . big chunks of mozzerella cheese . . . . for entree we got the steak frites but I must say the meat was chewy =( and we also got the pasta with lamb I beleive it was. . . I left full and I'd go again but would be leary of the meat. . . . probably should have said somethiing but we didnt. Service was awesome! Very attentive and just the right amount. The french fries were the only good thing that was served.  I was thoroughly disappointed.  The trout special was really fishy, salty and dry.  The kale caesar was saturated in dressing with big chunks of fish (not in a good way). To Whom Is Reading,This was for  Wayne Cheng, pm, table for , Feb th, This is my very first Yelp review I have ever done because I felt there has been no need for me to do any; but in this specific case I feel the need to. I was a huge fan of Florio, but the recent visit has completely shattered the view I had on the restaurant. I reserved a table in case there was going to be a wait & all was well upon the our arrival. We sat looked over the menu/ wine listing & this is where the slight problems started, the waitress (older women around her mid 's long brown hair in a braided ponytail, average build if you waitress is this woman please request to be served by someone else) she was very vague with her descriptions on some of the wine & asked if we needed some more time which I was fine with. A few minutes come by & she actually more irritated looking when starting to talk to us & I didn't like the fact she was leaning on the chairs talking to us which I thought was rude. She gave us a few more minutes after asking about the main course she was more rushing us in the process which didn't make sense when the place is open till am. The waitress's look on her face was unpleasant the entire time when she came back    & was rushing us more with her body posture & look in her eyes. If your stressed at work for some reason then you be professional still & refrain from unpleasantly expressions. Food was ordered & wasn't offered any extras the come with the eating there, so I had to ask the man who is charge of the front of the house for it & he seemed displeased as well when it's such a minor thing on his behalf. I told my guest I was sorry  times for the behavior we're experiencing from the place because I talked nothing, but the utmost of the restaurant. My guest said ""Well it's the fact we're here & hopefully the food is better than the service. ""The main course came. I ordered the Scallops & my guest ordered a seafood soup. Of course the presentation was flawless, but when I started to eat my scallops I noticed a grittiness to the texture & I pulled out bits of sand from my mouth; this was the same problem with the rest of my dish. My course was washed thoroughly, but I never said anything to the waitress or the head of the front house. I was telling my guest how completely shattered my view now was & was telling him making sure the waitress heard me because she next to u with a partition separating; hoped that she would change her tone, but nothing improved whatsoever. She asked us only once ""How is everything?"" She never came back to refill water, we've both said ""Thank you,"" but was ignored. Never offered dessert menu, but we weren't going to stay after the annoyances going on. The thing that really pissed me off the most is that WE had a SERVICE CHARGE for ONLY  PEOPLE. I'm originally from Sonoma County's Wine Country, but the service where I'm from is absolute. I moved to SF  months ago, but since I have been here I have never experienced such crass service in my life. I told my guest we should have gone to Original Joe's because they are prim & proper there & the owner is very personable. Do not waste your time coming to Florio, unless you actually want to I hope your experience will be better than our's. I love coming here as a cozy date spot with a friend or a partner. The service is GREAT, I love the host, and the atmo is quiet yet makes you feel like you are really out on the town simultaneously. It's charming and the food is yummy and rich. Also, great cocktails! Tonight we had the pate (with enough leftover to take home!), the endive salad, and the orchichiette. I wouldn't get the salad again. . . it was a bit bland, but everything else was perfect. The wait was too long at all the other restaurants in the vicinity. That should have been a clue! I was punished for ordering a $ hamburger by the cook burning the bun until it was black!  She did tell me the meat would be black (I was ok with that)but not the bun. The waitress was very rarely around ,I think we saw her twice, once to take the order and once to give us the check( BAD SERVICE). The food was very mediocre, skinny little fries, watery soup and horrid cheesecake. If you have a choice keep walking up the street to ROAM. A great new burger place with great organic sides. And half the price! Oh, and do not bring your own wine to ""Floporio"" their corkage fee is $! Big waste of time and money! Too bad, we were celebrating an important occasion. Woodhouse across the street had an hour wait so I went here with a group of . First of all seating is limited so if you have a larger party be warned. We were celebrating and had brought a bottle of champagne and had to pay the corkage free of $ which seemed a little steep especially since all she did was open the bottle. We had to ask to have it put on ice and had to pour it for ourselves. The service was definitely below average and for the price its not worth it.  Out of the  of us only  of us liked our meal. The fries were WAY over salted and I love salt. The steak was undercooked and the seafood stew was just bland and the portion was small. The scallops were really good and the only thing I would recommend. With so many options in the neighbor I'm surprised this place does so well. Go to Fresca or Woodhouse instead. This was not my first choice for dinner since it only have .  stars on yelp, but I decided to give it a chance anyway.  Unfortunately, I will have to say .  stars is generous.  The service was mediocre at best.  Our server was very pleasant but also very slow.  We waited  min after we said we needed ""just another minute"" to decide on entrees.  The other server in our area bumped into my chair and proceeded to push the table out of her way and told us OUR table was in HER way.  She then proceeded to spill ketchup all over the table next to us including the guy's shoes.  She did not even apologize or seem sorry. In regards to the food, my steak was rubbery and the fries were cold.  They were also out of three items on the menu  one of which was my appetizer (balsamic broccoli and artichokes).  They served it without the artichokes.  Less than amazing is an understatement. Had a great Bellini here cant wait to come back and try the food outstanding meal every time. . . service staff friendly. . .  a neighborhood gem. . . great tasting menu that changes with the season. . . Totally agree with the other posters here about the uneven service, unfortunately we seem to have experienced the lowest part of the scale on our recent visit. I know it was late, but really,  the place was hardly empty.  Not like we were impinging on your ability to get out of there on time.   Yes, we know the kitchen was closed.   But was rolling your eyes when we asked for some nuts (that had just been served to the person next to us, btw) really necessary?     And then no attention paid to empty glass?  For the whole time we sat there?   Disappointing, because we live nearby and it's so convenient and looks great  a perfect cozy, intimate bistro, as some lucky posters have noted,  but unfortunately  our actual experience was the exact opposite. Hust not interested in dealing with passive aggressive angry service at the end of  a long day   ugh, we'll go elsewhere. Popped into Florio on a whim, after lucking out at the movies and not being in the mood for Harry's Bar. It was pouring cats and dogs out, and the mood at Florio was inviting. The man and I nestled up at the bar and were promptly handed some drink menus by the bartender.  We had coats, scarfs, umbrellas, sweaters and the bartender was kind enough to point out the hangers and umbrella buckets by the door; nice touch. My litmus test for any bartender is their ability to craft a Manhattan, and this one did not disappoint. We tried the swordfish and the asparagus soup, both of which were perfect. In all honestly, who can put a price tag on ambiance. Good wine, fun cocktails, perfect sized dishes and lovely company what more could a girl ask for? I've eaten here twice now. The maitre d' is one of the nicest guys I've ever encountered and will make the entire experience enjoyable. The rest of the staff is also just the best and will go out of their way to make sure you have a great meal. Now. . . The Food. . . . Chicken, for the love of god. Order the chicken it's incredible. The vegetables are seasonal so be cognizant of that when you go. I've been in the spring and the fall and gotta say I'm a sucker for root vegetables so I enjoyed it more in the fall. Butter lettuce salad, bread, chicken for , and a half carafe of wine. It's a perfect meal and a great time. They are always full but never a line out the door, enough back ground noise to break the silence, great low light, very cozy feeling. I'd suggest making a reservation but sitting at the bar and having a glass of wine isn't a bad way to wait. All in all just go, you'll enjoy yourself. Fantastic spaghetti and meatballs and an awesome bowl of pistacio ice cream. Solid : food is consistently fresh and well executed across categories, they honor their reservations, the service is prompt and professional, and we haven't had any unpleasant surprises. Solid winners: salade lyonnaise, roast chicken, steak frites, pasta.  The produce can change significantly from month to month, but these anchors are safe bets, and whatever the changing cast of fruit/veggies might be, it is always high quality. I believe they also use Acme bread, which is a plus in my book. They say a good impression begins with your server. He was not too sure of the entrees or the wines. Needless to say the wine he offered was horrible and my entree was blah. Was not Attentive nor de he anticipate the needs of our table. Sat with only  glass of wine. He never came and asked of we wanted another or something different. What  could have been a good experience made worse by the lack of service. If there is a next time I'll request a server that know his stuff   Have had better service at Denny's Nice, dark, romantic with a little retro glamorous feel. Sat at the bar and had a nice meal and lovely cocktails with St. Germain! Friendly staff. . . Solid food. . . Good wine. . . Date Spot? Hell yea!Expensive? Sure. Taking someone out is not the time to be cheap, so man up and hit Florio Still a great place. I get to come here only once a year or so, but the top notch staff remembers me and treats me like a regular.  Their special cocktail of prosecco, gin, and fresh lemon juice is a refreshing summertime treat.  The chicken (I've had it twice) is always better than jus' plain ol' roasted chicken should be.  Juicy and flavorful and this time served with fancy French carrots and schmantzy peas.  The best news is that the special dessert that I had last summer seems to have worked its way onto the regular menu.  Pot de creme flavored with vanilla, orange, and bergamot, the stuff that makes Earl Grey tea so delicious.  Yes, it's a small portion but I'm pretty sick of heavy supersized desserts when all I want is a little something sweet.  And anyway, this little Tiny Tim of a dessert is so flavorful, cool, and subtle that it wins out over any goliath molten lava cake.  Florio is a friendly, bustling little place, a little expensive, but a great experience for those who love great bistro food and charming, interesting waitstaff. Food was okay, not necessarily outstanding but very good and reasonably priced for the ambiance/service/quality. My girlfriend really likes this place.  I took her to dinner there, and ordered the Seafood stew (a combination of mussels, clams, shrimp, & cod).  My girlfriend had the pan roasted chicken with frilly red mustard greens, brussel sprouts, and a side salad.  For starters, I had the foie gras au torchon, local brooks cherry preserves, house made brioche.  It was quite good, though the brioche was a little too soft and would fall apart when trying to spread the foie gras. I was very disappointed in the seafood stew which was pretty much bland, served in a shallow dish with an over abundance of celery, onions, garlic slices, to make up for the limited seafood.  They really need to work on this dish, as the broth is watery, lacks substance, & flavor.   The pan roasted chicken however was very flavorful and cooked to perfection.  The bread was very good as well and I ended up eating to much to make up for the meager seafood stew.  The service was very good, and I enjoyed the classy old school ambiance. For the money, you can do much better. If it will make my girlfriend happy, I will gladly take her there again, but otherwise I'll pass on this one. Oh my. Florio is a glutton's heaven. After an appetizer that I can't for the life of me remember and more amazing bread than we ever should have had, my group of four each ordered individual salads  two little gem and two lyonnaise. My little gem had a worm in it, so the waitress was kind enough to bring me a new one, but both of the salads were mouthwateringly good. Seriously. The portions were also huge, so I would recommend splitting a salad if you've got dinner coming. We then split the whole chicken and the  ounce ribeye. Between four people. It was enough food for eight, and you better believe that we ate until our pants were bursting. I have perhaps never had such good chicken and steak. The chicken was perfectly seasoned, with just the right amount of crisp on the outside and juiciness on the inside. The ribeye was incredibly high quality, tender meat, just cooked enough to not be blue on the inside and oh, oh so delicious. On the side? Brussel sprouts that had been just a little browned on the outside and unbelievable duck fat fries. Top it off with two bottles of wine per the waitress's excellent suggestion, and I was in Seventh Heaven. I think someone ordered dessert, but I was way too stuffed to be paying attention at that point. Florio is definitely at the top of my list for the next time I'm back in the Bay, and would make for a great date (or double date) night. We all were in the mood for burgers and since they were highly recommended, that's what we all had.  Surprisingly good for an Italian restaurant!  Very nice atmosphere, service a little slow but it was very busy.  Seemed a little pricey but not too bad. . . ."
Cityhouse|3.5|Steakhouses in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|88|-1|3.08888888889|" Little Filipino man is rude. I'd comment on the food but we left after  mins and no one came and took our order. Go elsewhere. Horrible. You seat yourself and then hope someone notices you to provide a menu. And then you pray that they will come back and ask what you'd like to order. Not even the obligatory glass of water was provided. I'm pretty sure I was overlooked because I wasn't dressed in business attire. I was staying at the hotel, so I thought it would be convenient. WRONG! And to top it off, I was overcharged. There was hardly any one in the restaurant! REALLY?! The burger was awesome. The service however was agonizingly . . . slower . . . . . than. . . . . a. . . . . snail. Sat for  minutes without being acknowledged. So moved to a busier part where the waiter was walking by. got some attention and finally ordered. Then he disappeared after bringing the drinks for  minutes without checking on us. Never got our food. After asking him about our food it came quickly after. But both orders were wrong entrees. He realized at least one was wrong and brought out the correct entree. But it was made with the wrong cheese and basically no meat. May have helped if he didn't try to memorize our order and just wrote it down like he did for some other tables. Btw we got our food when a couple was finishing their meal  they arrived much after us and ordered much after us. Don't think it's the waiters fault though. Management has him working most the entire floor by himself. Overworked yes. And his attitude wasn't lacking. A very kind man. Unfortunately terrible experience but he was kind about all his issues. Wish the lower tip couldve come from management. . . not him. Terrible!  We arrived and saw a sign that said seat yourself which I thought was weird that a steakhouse didn't provide better customer service. It took a few minutes before anyone took our drink order and that was only because I asked another server as he passed. We looked at the menu only to find bar food and asked about the steaks and we learned they changed the menu a week ago.   The menu ranged from Asian, Italian, Greek, etc and everything was frozen bar bites. We ordered pizza, chicken bites and potstickers all horrible. Our nd round of martinis came in a wine glass bc they ran out even though we were  of few patrons.  Would not recommend this place! Went here for Happy Hour food for Monday Night football.  Had a lot of seating and a lot of TVs to watch the action.  Ordered the beer and some calamari and there was a Happy Hour discount in place that was good too.  I definitely recommend coming here for Monday Night Football.  It's good for groups and close to the Bart station for the quick getaway. Ups: Seafood Cioppino a bowl filled with tender scallops, mussels, salmon, and shrimp swimming in a delicious tomatoey stew. Crab cake appetizer  decently sized crispy crab cakes that were quite addicting. Downs: Almost everything else. Salads are small and overpriced, and the apple cake and creme brûlée were just okay. . . Definitely not worth the price and calories. The service was on the slow side, but they were friendly, when they did come to our table. Cityhouse is the hotel bar and lounge of the ritzy Parc  hotel, located just above the lobby. It's classy, clean, and there is ample seating. It's quiet, the other patrons are generally high class people, and it's well isolated from the rest of the hotel. The assortment of beers, wines, and liquors is fantastic, and the atmosphere is well suited for bringing a date. Unfortunately, it is a very upscale lounge and thus you will experience upscale pricing. $.  for a soda (which comes in a small glass half filled with ice), $.  for a small cup of coffee, $ for a can of beer, % automatic gratuity. . . To add to this, the waiter service is fairly inattentive. Overall, I see Cityhouse as a fantastic place to bring a girl you've just met, or to meet a classy gal, but the exclusivity comes at a steep price. Great service. I had a very nice short rib with creamed parsnip. Wine selection was meh. This is an update to my ""check in""  I was mistaken, we did not make reservations here. . . which is an entirely different issue. I forgot where we made reservations  really?  Staff was polite but not warm. Service was very quick. Seems like a typical nice hotel restaurant. The ribeye was well seasoned and cooked as requested. Presentation was simple with a large, single, onion ring adornment. Grilled broccoli was terrible. The iceberg wedge had ample blue cheese but was /th of a small head. Prices were as expected for a city hotel. Bottom line I would not go out of my way to come back. I have had breakfast here twice as I was a guest at the hotel. Both times have been nice with pretty good service. I am a sucker for eggs benedict so ordered it twice, the hollandaise sauce is very tasty but the first breakfast there wasn't much on the plate. Second time I learnt and asked for extra, I was in hollandaise heaven. Eggs were runny, potato was nice and coffee was refilled. The muffin was a bit sad though, very flat and tasteless. Overall a nice hotel breakfast, a bit pricey but tasty. This is one of my favorite restaurants to dine at in san francisco. The salmon is consistently great and their steaks are a dependable choice as well. I've also had scallops and swordfish here but not sure if those are always on the menu. Their wine list is good and by the glass, try one of their Petite Syrah's. They used to carry Rosenblum's Petite syrah but recently changed it to another which was also good. If youre dining in a group this is a great spot since its in Union Square and close to transit. Hotel parking is usually $ so fairly high but if you are ok with walking a few blocks you can generally find parking for $ although ladies its not recommended to do this alone at night as some close neighbourhoods can be fairly sketch hence the low cost to park. If you're guests are coming in from mountainview or anywhere south, the BART stop is right outside the hotel so very convenient. You can dress up or down at this restaurant and you'll find a variety of guests dress formally and informally since its inside the parc  hotel. Overpriced and awful food in ridiculously small portions. Even Diet Coke is watered down. Avoid at all costs. I've been here  times and somehow we always manage to get there during the pm pm time that the restaurant is closed. But each time we've ordered off the bar menu and been very happy with the food. The bar bites range from $ $ each or you can do the cityhouse platter and get  for $ which is what we do. So we've had every dish but the hummus so far and the standouts are the trio of sliders which is excellent you get a pulled pork slider, a mini burger and a crab cake slider. We cut each one in half for the perfect variety and bite. The lamb lollipops are so good I could eat  orders of them good! Mac and cheese is rich and creamy. Garlic fries are very good. Downsides are the calamari which was greasy and a bit dry at the same time! The potstickers and fried chicken were also not that great. Overall though this place has come through and someday I'll get to eat a real meal there! Drinks and service for the bar area were always top notch. It's a great chill spot to get some pre game food to line your tummy before a night on the town! Good enough for me because I was staying at Parc  and wanted some late night food so we went downstairs. BF & I odered the trio sliders, calamari, hummus & pita chips and lamb ""lollipops"". The sliders were alright and calamari was EXTREMELY salty. I didn't try the lamb but the BF liked it enough. I thoroughly enjoyed the hummus though. I would suggest this place if you are staying at Parc  for something convenient. But if you're in the union square area, I'm sure you have better options. It is a solid food kind of eatery. Nothing fancy and service was so so.  Would eat here again. Fish and chips was good and filling. Very nice staff, food was great Great food and service. Love the lobster bisque and great views of sf downtown. Only wish drinks were a bit stronger. Got the salty chihuahua and i couldn't taste any alcohol. But overall great. I stayed at the parc  for a week in January and had breakfast here twice, and both times ordered the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. This may be the single greatest breakfast I've ever had. It came with potatoes and asparagus, but the smoked salmon with eggs Benedict was the star of the plate. Perfectly smoked salmon, that was not too salty, along with well executed eggs Benedict. The Benedict was served with lemon scones, which was a tad different from any I've ever had. The sweetness of the scone with the salty smoked salmon was a excellent combination. I really liked the hotel. . Until I met with my sister and her boyfriend, and ordered  raspberry lemon drops and she had  Shirley temples, he had  jack and cokes, great conversation and a lackluster cheese plate for a total of  dollars. Eek. Why so much? Because their well vodka. . At a hotel bar was absolut vodka, so each drink starts at $ before any soda is added. So each drink, was  and higher that was ordered. If id known this. . I suppose I'd of purchased one of their five signature cocktails that were cheaper than the aforementioned plain jane drinks we ordered. It was ok for a grown bar. . But I usually go to the Hyatt regency and resort bars, have a lot grander drinks for a lot better price. Sadly disappointed. I can only really speak about the late night menu. It's not that great. Had the trio sliders that tasted like paper, the Buffalo chicken tasted stale, the fish and chips were kinda eh, the garlic fries were flaccid, and the lamb chops tasted like bad Indian food. Plus sides were the service and the drink menu. Asside from that, you definitely come here just for the ambiance. After doing some last minute Xmas shopping with a friend. . . I needed something quick and fast (read: no long line) which is challenging to find in Union Square normally. . . let alone a couple of days before Xmas. As we were walking back to the parking structure I looked up and saw a sign for ""Cityhouse"". We ordered calamari, hummus & pita, lamb, and sliders. Everything was okay except the greasy, bland, & slightly fishy smelling calamari (possibly old oil). Great customer service, good place to watch sports games, spacious, and quiet. Would I go out of my way to eat here again? NoIf I was about to pass out from not having any nutrients in body and I was close by. . Would I come here again? Yes Came here for lunch on a Saturday after checking out of Parc . The place was pretty dead; I was seated right away and ordered a New York strip. It came out probably  minutes later, and was way overcooked (I asked for medium rare, but it was nearly well done). Around this time, the entire staff seemed to disappear, and it was another  minutes before somebody walked by and asked if everything was ok. It took another  minutes to get a new steak.  stars for garlic fries, and the second steak they brought me was pretty good. My husband and I went into the city to see a show at the Warfield and wanted a nice dinner close to the theater.  This place was perfect  great location, fantastic food and  a very attentive waiter.  If you enjoy people watching then a table near the large windows is perfect. . . lots of activity on the street. We had a couple of drinks in here while staying in San Francisco. The service was great and their drink menu, draft selection, and wine list were pretty good. We wouldn't go out of the way to return unless we stayed at the hotel, but it's good to know that their selection is there. My typical game day go to spots include crowds, nachos, and lots of yelling.  Cityhouse was a refreshing change up to the usual, and a great spot to enjoy a meal and/or game. We sat close to the bar, the nice wait staff tended to our every wish when it came to changing channels given the all important football and baseball games going on simultaneously. We tried the heirlooms & burrata salad ( stars), the salmon ( stars) and the halibut ( stars).  Everything was delicious, if I had to gripe about something it was that the food wasn't very hot when it was delivered to us.  We were hungry, so didn't bother having it sent back. All the dishes were beautifully prepared and presented. We didn't have cocktails but given what groups around us were ordering, they looked enticing. Cityhouse is a great choice for a classy, tame, and vibrant dinner out whether or not you're looking to catch the game. Good food. Good service. Nice place. Sketchy neighborhood. The crab cakes were amazing! We stayed at the Nikko next door and ate here due to them having a gluten free menu.  Overall the food was very good, my bone in rib eye was to die for.  We began with the salumi platter which was very good.  My only complaint was that even after questioning and informing the waiter about my husband's GF needs, his lamb chops were still served with the fried onion ring on top!  We simply removed it and didn't complain, but that leaves questions in our minds as to what actually went on in the kitchen. We ate here the other night because we were staying at the hotel.  Our server, Anthony had zero personality, and he was obviously annoyed that we didn't want drinks. Clearly he was basing his tip on the price of dinner, and not good service since he was horrible.  I ordered the vegetarian pasta and I stated that it doesn't say it has cheese, but that either way I do not want cheese.  He repeated ""no cheese. "" When my food came there was a small amount of cheese melted in and mixed up in the pasta.  Anthony was no where to be found.  The guy pouring water came over to ask if we needed something and I explained the situation and i told him maybe it was already in the sauce and he said it wasn't.  He took it to our server who sent him back to me telling him there wasn't cheese on top.  So I showed him the cheese.  He took it back to the kitchen and took care of it brought it back.  This is the guy who pours the water. . . taking really good care of the problem while Anthony stared from a distance.  He waited until the problem had been cleared to come over and vaguely ask if it was good.  No apology or acknowledgement that anything had gone wrong.  He came back once to force desert on us, and then give us the bill after he gave up.  All our food was ok but the place was empty at dinner time on a Saturday night, for a reason. Food is decent but too pricy for what it is. Don't have much to review about this place because I stayed at the Parc  and my package offered a breakfast buffet. I'm not a breakfast person so to me everything was okay, but the waiter who served me (Lorenzo) was GREAT EVERY MORNING! We were staying in the hotel, stopped in for dessert and a drink on the way back to the room. Dessert was fine, but it took about  minutes to get it. Probably not the server's fault. He was quick with drinks. My husband and I stayed at Parc  Hotel this past weekend for  nights.  We decided to check out the restaurant and let me tell you, it was AMAZING!! We both had steak for dinner and it was cooked to perfection just what we wanted. The dessertwas delicious.  Our waiter Jefferson was excellent and very attentive in serving us. The view from our table was also nice looking over Market street. I've stayed at this hotel before but never tried going to the restaurant.  Our overall experience with the hotel stay and restaurant was definitely a great experience.  We can't wait to go back!! Food was great, especially the lobster bisque.  Service and ambiance was also great.  Drinks were a little weak and it's a bit pricey, but I'd definitely go here again. This review is just for the bar, and it's a nice one!  Obviously overpriced, being a hotel bar ($ for cocktails, sometimes as much for the beer) and the service can be spotty  or great! They took back my friend's cocktail that she didn't like and quickly made a fresh, much better, different one. Highly recommend the elderflower collins, especially if you like St. Germaine. . . which, let's face it, you should.  This one was just about worth the $.  The salty chihuahua was nice but not quite as good. Certainly no artisan, trendbreaking mixology happening here, and it's not a sustainable every weekend kind of activity, but it was a good place to come with my friend to congratulate her and catch up after her performance at EXIT Theatre down the street! Pretty good food, non chalant service and prices that are too high for the quality of the meal. This place I will only eat in again if I stay at the Parc . This is not a breakfast destination and there are many better restaurants to eat at nearby. I LOVE the location of this lounge.  It is on the second story of the Parc .  Although I was only semi impressed with the service at the Parc itself, the staff went above and beyond here at Cityhouse.  They were fast and friendly.  The appetizers were pretty good.  The wine selection was ok, nothing impressive at all but it was nice to hang out here and then be able to walk back to the room which was just a few feet away.  The location is perfect as well. I thought this was a nice bar/lounge located inside the hotel. During our stay here, we came here a number of times. They have great happy hour options. The prices are a little high  I mean come on it is located in the heart of Union Square in a hotel, what do you expect. They have a pretty good appetizer combo  choose  things for $. Not bad. A few of us shared this, over drinks. Pretty good. It's convenient if you are staying in the hotel. Definitely not my first choice, but we started out here before we headed out into the other part of the city for bars. Service is good and attentive. Cityhouse is located in Park  Hotel which is nice, but restaurant don't even bother. Service was slow and unorganized. Food is bad and overpriced, presentation is sloppy. Hostess really nice older Asian lady was great   stars! I loved this place when their happy hour was  drink full price, second drink  cents. Now their happy hour isn't as good anymore and it feels like their drinks are not as strong anymore either. Tasty bar bites, but still rather pricy. Wish they'd go back to the older version. Friendly servers/bartenders though! My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out since I enjoyed my stay at the hotel so much, I thought hey the food must be good, turns out I was wrong. . . yuck. We had the crab cakes, New York strip and braised short ribs. Everything was just ok. . . nothing special. . it was way too expensive for the quality and quantity of food. We ended up going to eat at the Westfield mall food court after :) So the lamb lollipops are a life changing experience. But you really cant lose with the Cityhouse Trio.  bucks with enough food to keep two hungry folks satisfied is a damn good deal in an expensive city. Got the sliders and calamari as well and they were also tasty. Our waiter (forgot his name but he was attentive and very nice) and overall service was top notch. We stayed at Parc  so we had to try out this spot, almost felt obligated to, and I'm definitely glad we did. I'd chow here again regardless of if I was staying at the hotel or not! We went here for our BFF's birthday dinner and man aren't we glad we did! The steak  is perfect! I requested to surprise her with a birthday cake and the receptionist suggested their complimentary cake :) The tears from my friend and the look on her face is priceless We will definitely be back for the extra mile service and great food!Thank you Cityhouse! Wow. Granted, we had a large ish party (), but it took over an hour to get our food  grilled cheese sandwiches, cups of soup, and pre made salads. Ordered right off the lunch menu. Unbelievable. Food was just OK, made better by the fact that everyone was ravenous by the time we ate. Won't be going back. Best Shrimp Louie Salad I've ever had!"
Grandeho’s Kamekyo|3.5|Sushi Bars in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|184|-1|3.21621621622|" Food is average to below average for San Francisco. Life is too short to eat mediocre Japanese cuisine and sushi. The cucumber salad tastes like it's from Shanghai, the eggplant gengaku is as sweet as the brown sauce you get in most Chinese restaurants. The hamachi kama was the best thing we had, but that's baseline fare. In other words, this is not the place for authentic Japanese food. And it isn't inexpensive either, at over $ for thinly sliced nigiri. Cole Valley, you deserve so much better! San Francisco is not my favorite Sushi city. While there are good places here, there's not an abundance of great places here like in LA or NYC. I've been coming here for almost a decade. I proposed to my wife here, and make regular visits   or  times per month. I've been to hundreds of sushi restaurants around the world, and I am more comfortable here than anywhere else. Families love it here. I'm disappointed to see all the whining and negative reviews. . . not merited. For dietary reasons, I only eat sashimi, so my review is based entirely on the quality of the fish  which I always enjoy. As far as the prices, where are people getting cheap sushi? It can't possibly be any good, so get over the prices. If you want cheap food, then go to the McDonalds down at the corner of Haight and Stanyon. I gladly support this local business run by a family man who has no airs about serving top quality sushi year round, year after year. My neighborhood sushi spot. . . Always friendly with good service, and a laid back vibe. Reliably fresh fish too (not the best of the best you'll find in the city, but perfect for satiating a weeknight sushi craving. ) Try the GariSaba roll! The place is a bit pricey for what they offer. We got two rolls, miso soup, and edamame, and a udon soup. The best thing was probably the udon soup and it was qutie a large bowl actually. The sushi was all ok. Miso soup was good. OK place. A bit overpriced for what you're getting though, but it's just ok. I'd only come back for the udon soup. Wonderful neighborhood sushi bar where you can interact with the sushi chief so you can get what you want instead of what's on the menu. This place is really expensive for the quality of food.  piece sashimi appetizer was $Uni nigiri was $ (not even fresh)Amberjack nigiri $Kirin and a bowl of riceI went over the menu  x.  Everything is way overpriced. Final bill was $ including tip. I won't be coming back Pretty good food.  Miso soup was good.  Got salmon roe sashimi (two) and tuna sushi ( small rolls). My son made a similar order.  Total $.  Seems too pricey.  Good service, nice atmosphere. I used to think this was a great place but they have raised their prices significantly and reduced the size of portions. I think a nice restaurant that charges $.  for a fountain soft drink and then another $.  for a refill as this one does is lacking class.  $ for a fountain soft drink is more than the VERY small sake. I'm not going back.  They've lost a customer. Grandeho's Kamekyo is a great neighborhood place.  I have been coming here for some time and thought a review was due.  The food is always fresh, reasonably priced, and there is plenty of Sake and Beer.   The Sushi Chefs are great to talk to and talented at their art. Great food. Kid friendly. Clean. Friendly staff. Tonight, I am inspired to write my very first Yelp review after an expensive and truly terrible meal. I should have known when they set down a menu whose pages were plastic coated. But in my hunger, i missed the sign. ""Would you like miso and edamame to start?"" ""Sure. "" I wouldn't have guessed a dish of mediocre edamame was going to cost me $. . Things progressed as you might expect. . . bland fish, the driest salmon skin roll I have ever had, etc. $ later, I urge you to avoid this spot at all costs! Been going here for years and have never been disappointed. Taking my parents tomorrow for a quick lunch. Guaranteed to have a hamachi delight : ) This place has fresh sushi and is reasonable priced. The service is quick and friendly ever time I have been there. My favorites are the maguro, hamachi, and rock and roll. This Japanese restaurant is run by Chinese. Very friendly staff but the quality of the food is not good. The tempura batter is heavy instead of fluffy, the soft shell crab is caked in batter, the teriyaki swims in sauce. . . If you like authentic Japanese cuisine, this sadly is NOT it Hate to give a place two stars, but the sushi was just no good, and the service took too long. Went for lunch, and even though it wasn't packed, it still took quite a while to bring over our sushi. I had a veggie roll, and my friend ordered a tuna roll and some sashimi, and at some point during our lunch, we both had to spit out our food for some reason or another. For me, the seaweed was so chewy that I couldn't even swallow it, and for my friend, the sushi smelled a bit strange and just didn't taste right, so of course we both completely lost our appetite. Safe to say I won't be making any trips back there. Freshest Sashimi I have ever had in SF! Great customer service! You can always see the same people coming over again and again. My suggestion is: only go for Sashimi if you decided to dine there; order the sake box (shot) if you love drinking (I think it's pretty cool); ask Byron for suggestions if you do not want to do any of the above!! Very nice restaurant for drinking and Japanese food! I will definitely come back soon! I agree with a reviewer below that it's definitely a ""no fuss sort of place. "" That said, service was great, and as others mentioned, no wait. I had some dry sake, salmon nigiri, fried tofu app, and a couple rolls. All were above average and prices were decent. When I'm craving sushi but too tired to venture elsewhere, I'll come here. It's quick, friendly service. Salmon sashimi is fresh and delicious. Rolls are just okay. There's never a wait. It's a no fuss sort of place. Kemekyo is fabulous!  The seafood is outstanding The place has an excellent selection of very fresh seafood, also some exotic fish that you don't see on a menu very often. We love it when Chef Yo is there.  He is an excellent chef & really knows his stuff.  The miso soup with clams is delicious. Go early as the place fills quickly for dinner.  Lunch is good, too.  Even though we live in Bernal Heights, we love this restaurant, & look forward to our next visit. This is hands down my favorite neighborhood restaurant.  I come in and order Chef's Choice from Byron and he totally makes my night every time.  I love that not only is this place delicious, but you can always get a seat, the staff is amazing, and I leave smiling every time. Expensive for Lunch @ .  for the Bento Box but the fish was fresh and the presentation was stealer. I would recommend this place to anyone that likes Quality food. Pretty good sushi.  My boyfriend and I come here to get our fix  a. because it is close to where we liveb.  rarely ever a long waitc.  decent serviceif you are looking for an over the top sushi experience, then this probably isn't the place for you  but if you are needing some decent sushi rolls, then give it a go. This place is like a disappointment factory. When I moved into the neighborhood I was warned that the sushi here wasn't that great, and the general lack of patronage in comparison to nearby places testified that folks in the area had arrived at a similar conclusion.  Months passed, and after untold times of passing the place on the way to and from the N line, I finally grew curious.  My father came over to visit for dinner, and I suggested that we give the place a try. ""I think they're Chinese"" he whispered to me as we entered the restaurant, referring to the couple who appeared to be running the place.  Later he confirmed to me that he heard them speaking in Chinese (my father is Chinese but my mother isn't, and so as is common in mixed race/language families the father's language was not passed on). The food, well, it tasted like sushi made by non Japanese.  The flavors weren't quite right, the sashimi lacked the freshness that makes sashimi so wonderful, and the rolls were eminently forgettable.  A month ago I could have told you to grab real sushi at the authentic joint around the corner on Carl run by an elderly Japanese couple.  Sadly, that place has closed and so if you live in Cole Valley to get your fix of any sort of Asian food you'll have to trek out to the Sunset or settle for a dinner of mediocrity at Kamekyo, which will almost certainly leave you full, but disappointed. I love this Sushi Bar!  Friendly service.  Quality ingredients.  Prices are not bad for what you get.  If you are visiting the city this is a great place to visit. Fruit flies and bugs flying around the restaurant during my entire meal. Flies lurking on the walls. That's really all I have to say. I've lived and dined in the wilderness and have tolerated flies in that setting. Just doesn't seem to fit a pricey sushi place in San Francisco. Sushi quality also very low. When I told the  waitresses about the bugs these were my two responses:. Umm, sorry, I will let the manager know. . Yeah, I am sorry, we have had this problem for a while and are trying to fix it. Sorry to you both, but your responses were incompetent and so was the experience at your restaurant. Sucks for me because I wasted a meal in San Fran at this establishment. I grow up in SF and I have been looking around to try Asian food. This place is fantastic with their service and I love their Sashimi especially the Salmon and yellow tail. I can tell their fish is not the one you can buy at Costco or Safeway, it's really the Japanese Sashimi grade! Love it and I'm planning to stop by there again with my family! I doesn't have the world's best ambiance, but the quality of the sushi is fantastic and the staff is great. There's an early wave of families with kids (and it's a great place to take a kid for a pm dinner), then a second wave of locals. We usually ask the chefs behind the bar to create something for us, and they never disappoint. *This rating is based on   in restaurant and take out meals*We live walking distance and desperately wish that this place was good because there isn't much variety in Cole Valley. However, after trying (and failing) to enjoy either take out or in store food on multiple occasions over the past  months, we are calling it quits. Furthermore, we sadly note that this place has been on a steep decline from mediocre to downright bad since . Rationale for rating:The sashimi is poorly cut. It is thick and cut in such a way that you notice the ""grain"" of the fish. It is tough. The spicy rolls are covered with sriracha so that is the only flavor you taste. (Yes, I know spicy rolls are inauthentic, but they can be done in such a way that you can still taste the type of fish. )This place is expensive about $ /person (food only) at dinner time. This pricing is at or above higher quality sushi places in the city for that price. Also and this is the dealbreaker: *the fish is not fresh*. It all has a distinctly ""fishy"" flavor and is not enjoyable and perhaps not advisable to ingest. To the owners () please consider abbreviating your menu and focusing only on the most demanded seafood, so that you can turn over the inventory quickly and only serve your customers the freshest product. (eg, skip having multiple kinds of salmon and just have one high quality cut)(b) on point # above, take this seriously. My husband and I were concerned about eating the last stuff you served us for health reasons. () please teach your sushi chef how to slice sashimi and nigiri. That is the heart of sushi where you cannot hide the quality or freshness of the product and cutting the fish properly highlights its goodness. () please go order a few spicy rolls at  or  sushi restaurants that have  stars on yelp, do a taste test with yours, and consider changing the recipe. () please ask whomever pours miso soup in to go containers to fill them up. My last order was only / full in a small styrofoam cup. () check other sushi places in the inner sunset or inner Richmond for price/quality comparison and get Kamekyo in line with the market. () sorry to be pedantic and bitchy, but you're going to go out of business if you don't fix this stuff. For your sake, your employees, your customers and your neighbors, take Tupac's wise words to heart and make some changes. What an F'n rip off.  I hate, hate, hate bad mouthing neighborhood mom and pop places, especially in my hood but come on Kamekyo.  $.  for four pieces of spicy salmon rolls?  Let me repeat $.  for !, four, cuatro, quattro however you want to say .  I thought they gave me an empty bag for my takeout, but nope there was my  measly pieces of sushi.  The sushi itself isn't bad, but its not OH MY GOD amazing either.  If they had normal prices( or served  pieces of sushi in a roll like most places!) it would probably get  stars from me.  I don't think I will ever go back and if you want to try it, God speed.  I warned you. Best chicken teriyaki I've ever had. The miso is also the best I've ever had. Not a big sushi fan, although I know the sushi is great and the tempura is pretty good as well. Overall one of my favorite Japanese spots of all time. Well, this place was a pretty average sushi joint.  My husband and I were on our honeymoon in San Francisco and we wanted to try some sushi since it's one of our favorite foods.  This place was recommended by our hotel and it was near the Haight Ashbury neighborhood, which we wanted to walk through and check out. The restaurant wasn't packed, but we decided to sit at the bar anyway to watch the master chefs at work.  Service was pretty slow for a Wednesday night, so we were in there quite awhile just because it took a long time for the server to come back to us when we wanted to order more rounds. We paid a $ corking fee for our wine (yikes!) that we bought at a nearby liquor store.  I'm not even sure if they serve liquor here, but that was a pretty expensive bottle of wine overall considering we paid almost $ for it at the store.  Yeesh. The sushi was alright.  Not anything totally memorable in terms of quality or taste and the menu was pretty standard.  The menu had all of the things you'd expect at a sushi restaurant and some 'signature' items that were not noteworthy or sounded too weird to want to try.  All in all, I probably wouldn't go back, especially I lived in the city.  I'd definitely check out more options and chat with more locals to find a better sushi joint in San Fran.  This is more a nice spot for the people in the neighborhood who want a place close to home that they can walk to during the week. Grandeho's Kamekyo can do better. Service was alright. . . the server seemed way too busy for the amount of diners and brought the wrong order to us and had to be beckoned over by guests at the only other table. While the seaweed salad had a generous portion, it's price was a bit hefty as was the general menu. Ordered one roll which was mediocre and nigiri which was very nice. I wish it was a better experience so I could frequent more since it's in my neighborhood but likely not with so many awesome sushi spots out there. If I do head back, I'll stick with the nigiri/sashimi and a beer. Old dry fish. My instincts told me it was gonna be average, but I was really hoping for it to be better because it's the only japanese place in my hood.  Agreed with prior reviews that the menu is uninventive and prices are high for what you get.  I have a relatively bland palette (prefer not too spicy, not too salty) but my chicken udon was utterly flavorless.  It's such a shame because it's a nice cozy space in a convenient location.  Next time I'll venture to nearby inner sunset or inner richmond when I have my noodle soup and sushi cravings! Loyal neighborhood customer here!  I think I average sushi from Grandeho's twice a week.  The chefs and wait staff are always very friendly to me, and the sushi is good.  It seems a little pricey compared to other sushi joints nearby, but I'm willing to pay a bit more for the convenience, and to support my local businesses. Specialty rolls are always tasty, and their sweet, sweet wasabi sauce makes my mouth water, but I usually end up getting a few standard rolls and some sashimi.  Gyoza is also yummy! Kamekyo's comfort food hits the spot if you're craving Japanese cuisine and happen to be around the neighborhood, but I don't consider Kamekyo a ""destination restaurant"" because the food is not bad, but far from outstanding. On the other hand, the atmosphere is warm and quite family and kid friendly and it is not difficult to get a table here. The friendliness of Kamekyo's servers and chefs toward our baby was refreshing particularly after we had been told to leave neighboring Hama Ko after our baby ""yelped"" (as babies are prone to) once. Kamekyo takes its cuisine seriously, but apparently not as seriously as Hama Ko (which is most definitely not family friendly  make a peep above the median noise level and you will risk being reprimanded by Hama Ko's chef and his wife)."
Aato Korean Fusion|3.5|Korean in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|29|-1|3.33333333333|" I ordered BBQ chicken with salad and potato. The whole plate was so good. It was a very pleasant surprise. Owner was very pleasant also. The place is clean and conveniently located from the hotel that I'm staying in. This really is a hidden gem. The kalbi has that perfect flavor I remember from my childhood, but for some reason cannot always find.  What is even more wonderful is the fact that the cut of meat is always tender.  Everything is cleanly focused, not overdone as with some fusion restaurants. The actual restaurant is elegant but casual at the same time.  Loved the kimchee.  Loved the very refined and friendly owner.  So glad this upscale restaurant is on the westside because I can be there in a flash. Over all experiance was ok, food was good, place was clean, but you get owner/server combo that don't work so good, she start being moody after few questions we had etc. AATO Restaurant is a hidden gem in San Francisco. The food is top notch, the service is charming and kind, and the combined experience is a delight.  This Korean fusion restaurant really ranks with some of top end San Francisco eateries, but it's not as well known or located.  We found this place by accident because we couldn't get in  Boboquivari's Steak House (more commonly known as Bobo's) right across the street. What a fortune thing! While Bobo's is great, AATO is even better. The Korean steak dish (Galbi, the short ribs) is outstanding; the soup was great as was the salad. We didn't have room for dessert. If you are searching for a restaurant along the Lombard Street corridor and don't know where to eat, stop here.  You'll enjoy it. Really expensive. Small portions. Nice atmosphere. But smelled like dirty mop when we walked in. Food tasted wonderful BUT food was lukewarm. Dumplings were kind of cold in the middle. Owner was very nice but kind of odd. I live in Orange County where there's an abundance of great Korean restaurants, so this place was not what i expected. I'm used to more casual Korean restaurants that are super loud, but this one was more elegant different atmosphere. Food: my boyfriend and i shared the dumplings and he made the joke that they were Pot Stickers you could buy in bulk at the market, but they were still good. I had the salmon which was tasty, but wasn't really Korean in flavor. My boyfriend had the bibimbop and he said it tasted fine. Service: our server was very nice and patient considering we came in an hour before closing. Price: The food was good, but pretty overpriced considering the dumplings were $ but only came with five. Other: for some reason the menu we got differs from what is shown on Yelp. The starters were the same but there were less entrees, not sure if they changed the menu or have different menus depending on the time of the day. The menu we got had less Korean food as entrees. Overall it has a nice ambiance and good service, but most likely wouldn't visit again. The dishes are extremely overpriced. The portions are so so so small in comparison to every other Korean restaurant I've been to. Skimpy on the meat. Still hungry after a bill over $ for  person. :/ My husband just had a delightful dinner at Aato, a new restaurant on Lombard, near Van Ness.  This place is an undiscovered gem.  The food was so tasty!  It is a mix of Local Californian and Korean cuisine.  The ambiance is elegant and quiet and the service was attentive and friendly.   I had the spicy, sweet chicken wings which were so good I ordered another serving to take home for lunch tomorrow.  The chicken soup was total umami, with mushrooms, shredded chicken and sweet peppers in a clear broth and my Caesar salad was among the best I have had with a sprinkling of walnuts, grapes, pear bits and a light, savory dressing.  My husband had the salmon which he loved.  For dessert, we had a kind of Korean street food  pumpkin pancakes with rice syrup and nuts.  Yummy!  This place deserves to be very popular. I always love to go European restaurants due to the exotic flavor and its atmosphere.  Today I really enjoyed the full course at Aato.  I'd like to evaluate this place as a Europeanized Korean restaurant This upscale Korean restaurant is Korean version of Tommy Toy's restaurant.  If you miss the Tommy Toy's you may enjoy this place as a Resurrection of Tommy Toy's yet still keep the modest price.  The all organic natural flavor of the fermented seasoning truly taste the soul of Korean's authentic flavor.   Many Americans don't understand the benefit of fermented food.  The fermentation clean and detoxicated the human's internal system hence it may allow the prolong the longevity.  I was able to taste the soul of the slow food of fermentation and so does the owner woman Jennie's effort that  spills over everywhere of the restaurant.  As a talented former musician woman Jennie is really put lots of creative effort into the menu.  I really love the desert she is offering that all organic from the scratch and nothing is processed.  When I was having the lime pie that all hand made I almost cry of the fantastic taste that totally new to me. Certainly it's a wonderful place for the weekend lunch or dinner. I used to live above this place on Lombard and I feel obligated to warn everyone away. There is no one inside for a reason. . . I really don't understand at all the horrible reviews. Now this place is my favorite place and is actually one of the best restaurants in Bay Area. The pacific Korean menu was fantastic, and she changes her menu every now and then. Talking to the owner Jennie who is totally wonderful, she has told me Aato means the ""Gift. "" Even though I am Korean, I didn't know what it really meant. Shame on me. . . . . The reason why she named her restaurant ""Aato"" is because she wouldn't serve anything to her customers that she wouldn't feed her children. Important things are the enzymes she makes to pasteurize her food like kimchi and uses for the tastes which are totally slow cooking process takes up to   years minimum. She only uses natural and organically way to make these enzyme which are totally good for our body. Furthermore, she also informed me that she mostly uses organic and also she even grows some of her food. This is the original way the Korean ancestor have made their food for thousands of years ago, and this is only restaurant in CA or even in the US uses this way to cook the Korean food.  Furthermore, she doesn't use any Dashida(msg based) & MSG. No Korean restaurants in Bay Area, CA or even the USA do that. Name me one if you know any? I was so amazed how tasty their salad and Korean bbq i really really suggest to try their lemon kimchi and home made desert. Try their lamb. . . . Presentation was perfect and the taste was even better. The process of the food is totally authentic, and she spends a lot of time preparing her food. Unlike other ethnic cuisine, it really takes very very long time to make some foods. I am talking about years of preparation. . . . . Also try their organic/ none gmo tofu. Totally fantastic. I will go there again. . . and i really don't understand about the bad reviews here. . . . . Stop being ignorant. If you don't know what healthy and real foods are, then don't even bother. . . Food was great.  My wife had the BBQ short ribs, and I had the Scallops.  Presentation was wonderful, and the taste was unique.  Service was top notch. I know the owner Jennie and she's awesome.  The food from what I know seems to be more about quality than quantity, and the process or making the foods seem very interesting.  From growing her own organic vegetables and producing food enzymes, the food made here seem very healthy.  Food enzymes assist the body helping digestion and the boosts immune system.  Fermenting these food enzymes take a whole lot of time.  That sounds to me like a lot or work is put into the food.  If you're looking for taste,  I really love the BBQ chicken there.  I hear the menu is changing soon so lookout for new stuff! I'm a Korean American who has spent a considerable amount of time (+ years) living and working in Korea, who travelled the length and breadth of the country to eat authentic food at the source. I grew up in Koreatown LA, home of the largest Korean population outside of Korea. I'm also a (retired) certified Korean language instructor. They claim ""Aato"" means ""gift"" in Korean. The word for ""gift"" is sun mool, I'm not sure how Aato is supposed to be pronounced, but it is definitely not the word ""gift. "" I'm not sure that word means anything at all. Perhaps it is this misguided attempt to con people into a non existant word that also guides the food and prices. Portions were stingy, flavors were mediocre, and the food was unimpressive at best. It tasted as if an amateur Korean American cook with very narrow exposure and view to Korean cuisine decided to open a restaurant. Horrible representation of what Korean food can be. Please don't judge our food by this restaurant. Had a really bad experience here.  people, piss poor breakfast, and the total cost was $. . The place is attempting to be a high end restaurant, but the actual food and ambiance suggests it should be a low cost, quick place. I suggest spending your money elsewhere. Extremely over priced. Small Portions. Almost always empty. Do NOT eat here. Aato Fusion was next to our hotel.  The restaurant was empty, but we took a risk.  It was actually a huge risk because my Dad and I were traveling together, and he had never eaten Korean food before.  We decided to give it a shot, and I'm so glad that we did  the food was delicious and we both enjoyed our meal.  We shared an order of dumplings and Bi Bim Bob.  The food was very flavorful with bold flavors.  I would have preferred a bit more heat, but they had toned it down a bit for my Dad, at his request (kudos to them for that. )  Our waitress was very accomodating and personable.  I noticed that the restaurant also serves a brunch, I would like to try that on my next trip. For a place named after ""gift"", I did not receive any.  I can't figure out if this place tries too hard and fails at any attempt at fusion or doesn't understand how to do so.  The menu is mostly classic Korean dishes, such as bibimbap, japchae, galbi, seafood pancake, etc.  Although the haemool pajun looked good, it was soggy and lacked flavor even with the sauce and what seemed to be fresh ingredients with bad oysters.  However, the chef offers some twists with sweet potato latte, calamari olive oil pasta and sweet corn cakes in honey.  None of these variations had flavor or tempted me in looks.  The latte was bland.  I had a dead clam in my pasta using Asian noodles, drowned in oil oil with chewy, over cooked squid.  I didn't think anyone could s crew up dessert, but the sweet corn cakes were like mochi on a bed of honey and oats.  Perhaps I should try their brunch, which seems to get good reviews some of the time.  However, $ for  dishes and a dessert seemed twice what they were worth.  This place might try to confuse you with fine dining using a selection of three prefixe menus in a Western setting, but the food just isn't special enough to fit in. Service was slow, friendly and not so helpful.  The waitress doesn't seem to know the menu and what is good.  The ambiance and decor is pretentious with chandeliers and fine dining chairs, but it doesn't invite anyone in especially since they are hidden on Lombard even with neon lights.  Parking can be tough on the street, but you might as well go across the street for Bobo's great steaks to get valet parking."
1601 Bar & Kitchen|4.0|Wine Bars in San Francisco, CA|Pricey|117|-1|4.0| The egg hopper was the highlight of the evening, but all dishes we tried were pretty good. There were  of us and we ordered  plates each, which was a good amount.
Rue Lepic|4.0|French in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|183|-1|3.8125|" I don't know if this was just an off night (it was sunday night and there were definitely no french chefs or servers to be seen) but I thought this was close to terrible but how expensive it was and how AWFUL the cream sauces were. First of all, all the people in my party ordered different dishes, one of which was supposed to have a truffle sauce, another peppercorn, another rosemary. . . well, they were all IDENTICAL. Identical. And gross. Sickly sweet, all of us were scrapping the sauce off our meat so we could eat the meat itself. The cuts of meat were good, but again, poorly prepared  overcooked, undersalted, kinda dry. . . Oh and $ per plate!Bummer. I was going here with my boyfriend one night. When I walked in the door, no one greeted me and it was very awkward. Finally someone greeted me, maybe a host or waiter, and he asked ""what do you want""? I asked for a table and he said they had no tables, when I could clearly see several open tables and it was a weekday. I didn't even get to sit down because the person was so rude. TOO MUCH BUTTERFood:  nice salads, nice soup, but the entrees were drowning in butter  I guess that's the secret of French cookingService: very good, very friendlyThe place: nice location and setting; they need to work on their ventilation system kitchen smoke permeates the dining room I don't eat a lot of French food, but I assume this is as good as it gets! I ordered of the Chef's Menu.  An incredible starter, Seafood Pasta. Wow! Then the daily soup special. . INcredible, next a caesar salad. . . . it was okay, then the roasted veal in a truffle and mushroom sauce. . . . Out of this world!!  the Creme Brulee didn't do it for me, but I'm not a dessert eater. . . I had a few glasses of the Rue Sud Pinot Noir and it was very tasty. All in all an amazing place.  And a pleasant walk from Union Square.  The walk justify's what you are about to eat! A lovely experience overall. Great service. An excellent meal. I'd love to go back sometime soon and would recommend Rue Lepic to good friends. Our early post Saturday matinee dinner at Rue Lepic  was close to perfect. The scene is relaxed, the service is friendly, professional, and efficient. Just for example, though we ordered drinks and dinner at the same time, our server was careful to wait until we had finished the drinks and the chef's amuse touche before bringing the first course. The food was superb. Two cold soups corn and pea followed by mussels and fries, both exceptional, and the best mackerel I've ever tasted. A seasonal peach and berry tart topped it all off beautifully. Rue Lepic is a Nob Hill institution, and one of my favorite places in San Francisco.  The owner of this place has a lot of history.  Google her.  She is an amazing woman. I come here for the special occasions.  I typically order the chicken which has a delicious creamy/mushroom base.  Very French, and yet so accessible and humble. A small table by the glass window, and a view to an old fashioned street in Nob Hill.  It's all about the simple pleasures of life. Take the woman who truly deserves your heart here.  The ""other"" women can be taken elsewhere. Five of us went to dinner yesterday and we had a great time. The service was superb and the food was simple exquisite and delicious. It is a small and cozy restaurant but you are able to have an amazing dinning experience. We ordered the chef menu option  which provided us with an opportunity to enjoy several delicious menu items. The portions were perfect and each plate was full of flavor and each plate was uniquely different from each other but all together was symphony of flavors that was made your palate dance. The owner made sure that each table was properly served and she brought clean plates and took away dirty ones. She was sweet and concerned with your comfort and she treated you as if you were an important guest I her own home. The wine list provides a nice selection of French and California wines.  This lovely gem in Nob Hill is great for a dinner date or for a large party to celebrate birthday but make sure that you make reservations since there is limited space. The place is small and cozy, it's perfect for romantic dates. The service is really good. The foods are great, i really like them. You should try the escargot dish, it's  so tasty. I got the duck one, and my boyfriend got the chicken one. Both are good and in love with the portion size. They  also gave us free vegie cream soups. So far so good, We had good time here, and will come back. Came to SF for a mini vacation from east bay.  We had been to Rue Lepic  before and loved it, so decided to go again.  We were not disappointed!  The atmosphere is intimate and cozy.  The service impeccable.  The chef and waiter very personable without being intrusive.  And, the food was wonderful. . . each course prepared perfectly!  We had the Chef's Special which we thought was a very good value. The nice touch of a complimentary glass of port at the finish of our meal was welcome.  We will come back again and again! I live next door and like to come here for dinners with friends when I'm keen to make a meal the focus of the evening  but when I'm not in the mood for a hassle getting somewhere, waiting, or getting a reservation. I always get the chef's menu, and I've never been disappointed with the food or service. Basic interior. Space is a bit tight, as well, and noise from the kitchen and ventilation are frequently in the background. Normally, I'd drop a place to three stars for that, but the food and service always more than compensate. I recently had dinner at Rue, skeptical at first, I was not familiar and ready for so called ""French cuisine"". Having the menu a teensy bit on the limited side, I ordered the ""Rosemary Chicken"". It was delicious beyond my non knowingness. The chicken came with potatoes and delicious green beans. The chicken itself was smothered in a delicious sauce, almost gravy like and was very rich. The only downside was that it was lacking a bold flavor of Rosemary which the name of the dish clearly stated. Overall, the restaurant was  / stars, great service, great food, great atmosphere, and GREAT dessert(; I've been here twice and both times my dinner left something to be desired. The first time I chose the salmon.  It was a good thing we both ordered it because it was on the fishy side and no matter how much listerine and toothpaste I used I still had the flavor with me the next morning.  The soup that accompanied it was a watery, non exciting non recalling soup of the day.  The Caesar salad had no flavor, although the romaine was crisp.  The second time was a bit of an odd experience.  We were there for nearly  hours.  It took an hour from when we ordered before we were served.  My partner ordered chicken with no sauce.  The waiter came back once to ask for our orders a second time around.  We joked about them killing the chicken in the back before they cooked it.  Then the meal comes out and he was served fish of the day smothered in sauce. ? I guess they had to go fishing instead.   By then we didn't want to wait another hour for them to correct the order.   Not sure about this place.  Its one of those little romantic and quaint places in SF that's been around forever.  The food is okay. It's more of a romantic, date night place that's good for presentation or last minute reservations. My husband and I found this little jewel about  months ago when we were walking down from the Mark Hopkins to go back to our hotel. The meal we had was so amazing that we knew we would be back.  Last week my son and I were in the city and we were lucky enough to get reservations. Once again, we had such a great meal. We both had the chef's menu, so we were able to taste many different items. I love the escargot pasta and the waiter was able to exchange that for the seafood appetizer ( which my son had and raved about). Everything was delightful, from the intimate décor to the wonderful people waiving to the chef as they walked by. When we left, the chef came to the door and gave us big hugs and thanked us for coming. What a wonderful way to end a splendid evening. This will be our go to restaurant for French food in the city. You have to be kidding five stars!I didn't tumble down the 'steep hill' from a hotel I have been in SF  years So, not totally painting the devil on the wall: Pro: My date and I  liked the staff it was intimate and it was somewhat romantic Con: For the money, this was the worst quality food and the worst prepared food I've tasted in my life I am not talking about the dumps I've been in or what I ate ""i can't say it' in Burma, water buffalo  India, questionable lobster  East Hampton or tendon wildebeest in Africa we are talking a all in $ dinner that was just very poorly prepared money or no money  my date concurred but wouldn't be so vocal to write about it as 'she felt sorry for the place' We started with asparagus soup and escargot as a start the soup tasted like something I'd prepare in a blender then small little snails cut in half on a bed of garlic butter angel hair pasta this is not French cooking, let alone 'classical'  Her lamb chops had a gunk of gravy on them no hint of rosemary, salt, etceteras no taste at all My filet mignon had a even bigger gunk of gravy on it we aren't talking a redux here we are talking about thick brown gravy you could build The Alamo the worst part was it was cold inside I did order it rare but, this was as cold inside  as a piece of meat in your refrigerator I rarely send anything back brother, I sent this back the waiter politely took it back and it came back hot and he apologized I tried scraping the gravy off, but it was still stroganoff looking The desert was, as others have said 'amazing' that and the verts were the only redeeming qualitiesI swear to Buda, I don't know where the all these five stars emanate, especially, if you are writing a critique of a restaurant's ability to serve delicious food but,I guess that is why there are Heinz  By far one of the best meals I've had. Vincent's service speed and friendliness are incomparable. We enjoyed a delightfully paced exquisite  course French meal. The escargots were amazing and the best I've had. I will definitely come back next time I'm in the city. Rue Lepic has been our go to place for birthdays, anniversaries, Valentine's Day and many other occasions for several years. The food never seems to change, and that's fine, because it's always wonderful. The restaurant is cozy and quiet so my wife and I can talk without shouting. The service is friendly and accommodating, and in fact, Vanson has become a close friend. We also enjoy those times when Michiko, the owner, is in the restaurant. Adela is the head chef and we love her cooking. And we can park Mitzi's Smart Car right in front without getting a ticket. Five stars, and more if we could. Extremely small, cozy, and romantically dimmed just right at the corner of PIne and Mason. Call in advance to request for the table at the corner. You can not help but notice people walking their dogs in this neighborhood. The food is consistently delectable and at a reasonable price. Don't miss the seafood pasta and the filet mignon. The only complaint is the parking. Major and most important problem here This place lacks adequate ventilation. Your clothes and hair pick up all the cooking smells and you will need to send clothes to cleaners or wash afterwards. Also everything they are cooking overwhelms the taste and smell of food you are trying to eat. While food is very good, the service last night for valentines special was very hurried. There were not enough waitstaff(nor room in the tiny restaurant) but the two people serving still managed to snatch our plates and slap next one down in record time. Not relaxing! We felt like we were gulping food down. Will try on weekday night but I have concerns that they are not venting properly The place is very small and cozy, lovely romantic ambience :) It is also quiet so you do not have to raise your voice in order for your dinner party to hear you. The food is divine and the service is very friendly. Highly recommended for a special occasion or a nice romantic dinner! went here last night with a group for my friends birthday . . . the restaurant is super quiet, and we are not, so I'm pretty sure everyone heard all of our conversations (sorry I'm not sorry). I def wouldn't recommend this for a first date spot, because you may feel kinda awkward. the service was not good at all, we were quite disappointed. it took forever to get our drink order, and then they brought us butter but no bread . . . we had to ask for it twice. everyone that ordered an entree got a tomato y soup before hand and she took mine before i was done with it. her attitude about everything was just kinda meh. the appetizers were fab . . . we got the escargot (it comes over a little pasta with this insane sauce. I highly recommend this) & the smoked salmon (comes over a bed of lettuce with capers and a sauce. I'd also recommend this). when we finally got our bread it was great as well!we got a few different entrees but they all seemed to come with the same sauce which we all loved. A few of us got the chicken, it was moist and came with yummy potatoes and some green beans and carrots. My boyfriend got the filet and said it was cooked perfectly, medium rare. Another friend got the roasted veal and she loved it. no complaints on those we had cupcakes waiting at home, so we chose to skip dessert . . . but, it was my friends birthday so they brought out a little chocolate ganache with a candle and we all sang happy birthday. The prices match the quality and taste of the food, so we all left happy. . . just wish they gave better service. FYI :: if you have to use the bathroom & are remotely claustrophobic, good luck. It's smaller than an airport bathroom. Very disappointing!  My husband and I had eaten there about  years ago and we decided to take our daughter and her husband for what we remembered as a pleasant dining experience.  Sadly the service was abominable, the food was fair, and although it had a small restaurant atmosphere, that did not make up for the poor service and average quality food. To begin with, after being seated we waited / hour before our drink orders were taken.  The waits between courses were long and no one ever looked to make eye contact with us.        Specifically, the salads were pitiful and appeared to have been prepared yesterday, the main courses were passable, and the creme brûlée was tiny and unremarkable. I would not recommend this to anyone! Cute neighborhood restaurant.  Small dining room but we went on a week night so it wasn't that busy.  It was hot inside. . . no air conditioning and it was on one of those rare warm nights in SF. The food is very good and prices reasonable for San Francisco.  The poulet was very flavorful and perfectly cooked. . . not dry at all.  The venison was also good as well as the soup.  The owner was nice enough to give us a free cheesecake for dessert.  He recognized me as living in the neighborhood.  I always walked by this restaurant and never thought about stopping by until I had out of town guests that night and didn't feel like driving.  I wished I had dinned their sooner and will definitely stop by again. Delicious. I have ALWAYS wanted to go here as it's right down the street from us. The food was stellar, the wine flowed, and I loved the atmosphere. There's something really cozy about how the windows are setup. We will be back again! I loved their food!Their food is def. flavorful with lots of sauces. I LOVE that tho. I got scallop, which as a special menu the best scallop ever. The creamy sauce that came with scallops was flavorful with garlic! Not too garlicky, but just enough for me. My BF ordered filet mignon and it was saucy too. It came with somewhat meatloaf like sauce but he enjoyed it. He even cleaned the rest of the sauce on a plate with mashed potatoes!!At the end, our plates were squeaky clean!!All the Entrees come with soup which was good too. I wouldn't go for the course menu about $/person, ~ courses because you get full with one entree anyways. I took one star off because of the interior and ambiance. . . the restaurant is super small and not well decorated. Self portrait of the owner also freaked me out a bit. . . But, food is the most important, so I would def. go again to try something else on the menu. i am sure the food is great here I never got to try it. Had a  reservation showed up at  no one greeted us or acknowledged us for  min then told us to wait  min. At : we left. There was another couple ahead of us. So I would have guessed a min plus more wait. They were way under staffed. I hope to try in the future but not a very professional level of service for a restaurant with this level of reputation. Never wrote even one review in my life Can not even describe how bad it was. It is not cozy, it is crowdyIt is not French food , it is just a very average dinner, extremely overpriced, precookedSalad ans soup , which was served immediately, means was standing somewhere waiting for the victimsVery unprofessional stuffJust meat was okNever ever againIf you know what good French ristorante means, do not stop just pass by and find better place to waste your time and money If you like garlic, this is your spot.  If you like it moderately, stay away.  The garlic odor hits you like a ton of bricks as soon as you enter this small place. My wife and I enjoy garlic in our dishes but this was too much. Loved it in  and loved it in .  Still fine sauces and wonderful service. Small and peasant.  Highly recommend GUESS WHO JUST TURNED ?!I'm a big girl now! and my big butt needs feeding, and for my birthday, the boy decided to be a little reminiscent so we showed up here!The temperature, uncomfortably hot. Interesting enough, I was so flustered that I wanted to play footsie with the boytoy but contained myself. The vibe, cozy and intimate. The restroom's the most intimate part though, I was practically hugging myself in there. The food, satisfying. Just to be a little serious here: Seafood Pasta: very aromatic and flavorful sauce; a bit runny however; would have preferred a thicker sauce IF it was an entree but since it was an appetizer, the lighter sauce was very fitting; the shrimp and scallop (though small bite sizes) were very crispy and fresh none of that soggy wet mushy alien meatCream of Watercress: good. I say good and nothing else because cream of anything tastes the vaguely the same to me. . . i. e: cream of asparagus, cream of broccoli, cream of watercress. . . i've always believed that it's the rich buttery cream taste people liked. Caesar Salad: slightly too much dressing; I liked how the parmesan wasn't overpoweringly strongRack of Lamb: the boy liked, me thinks mehh. . I like my rack of lamb crusty on the outside and a very pink, almost red center; this was a little too saucy for me. Lobster Tail: DROOL. that butter. . . that garlic. . . that bed of sliced potatoes. . . makes you just want to savor the flavor in your mouth and not eat anything else after!Cheesecake: the boy likes more than mousse. Chocolate Mousse: i like more than cheesecake. its quite bitter but very very rich and very very dark. *wink wink* Come hungry, my friends. . . and leave the diet behind. This is my favorite spot to eat when I come to San Francisco. We always stop by here and my favorite to start with is the soups! All of them to this date have been delicious! The portions are generous. I think my favorite thing is the fact that is nested in a little corner of Nob hill and is a very small little restaurant. I love the intimacy and the cuteness of the restaurant. Not to mention that the service is always top notch. My husband had a business dinner here, and he asked me to tag along. A small corner restaurant surrounded by steep streets. Trust me, don't expect to find parking easily, but don't discourage yourselves to try this place as well. Anyways, inside the restaurant, there were only around  tables, and the kitchen was very visible from where we sat. The whole ambiance made me think it was a house turned restaurant type. It was cute. Everything that the chef cooked permeated every corner of the small room. It smelled so good. The downside was, the aroma clung on my hair and clothes. LOL. That's not really bad, was it? I ordered the Chef's Menu and it included a bowl of Mushroom Soup, Seafood Pasta, Caesar Salad, Filet Mignon, Bordeaux (wine), Le Ganache Au Chocolat for dessert and Capuccino. C'est si bon! Et c'etait gratuit. Merci pour le patron de mon mari. : ) See, eating in a French restaurant brings out my French. LOL No, seriously, it was that good. You should try it. We had a large family celebration last night at Rue Lepic and the food and service were simply outstanding. Every part of the five course meal was delicious and beautifully presented.  The place is definitely small but it nicely accommodated our large group of .  I highly recommend this restaurant and look forward to coming back soon! Thirteen of us had dinner there tonight, special occasion, and everything was terrific. Great food, great service, fun atmosphere, just a wonderful experience. What a gem. John F Wonderfully unpretentious and intimate restaurant.  Service was well paced for ordering and serving.  You didn't feel like you were waiting and you felt you could have conversation and catch up with friends. The food was delicious and presentation was beautiful.  Very flexible chef's selection menu that allows you to try any entree or dessert.  I enjoyed the sweetbreads even after the generous portions of pasta, soup and salad. Best cheesecake I have ever had  amazingly light and creamy  almost like a panna cotta.  Passionfruit mousse was my favorite but all the desserts were perfect. I have wanted to come here for awhile and was delighted it lived up to my expectations. Simply amazing the food that comes out of this wonderful small restaurant and the service is so warm and attentive.  My parents have been going here for at least  decades and has always beena favorite of theirs and is now a favorite of mine. French done just right!  Beautiful food in a quaint intimate setting near the top of Nob Hill. There are many wonderful neighborhood bistros. . . . . this one is just so special. The escargot are unique and special. . . . . the sauces are sublime. . . . . . the waitstaff warm and friendly . . . . . and the wine list priced oh so right. I can't wait to get back to SF and go to Rue Lepic I love SAUCED up french food and this place gave me just that. Went for the obvious choice of the prix fixed menu and loved each dish. Was pleasantly surprised at how much food it came with as many French places can be pretty stingy with their serving size. So big plus for that!The restaurant itself is pretty casual but it's small and cozy enough to make a great date night if needed. The wait staff and owner were also super nice which makes you like this place even more. Overall, a super cute restaurant that provides great food for a really good price. My husband and I wanted to go to a fancy smancy restaurant and found RL on Yelp and it looked fancy enough for us so we checked it out. We were the first to arrive at the restaurant a few minutes before it opened up and we were greeted with do you have a reservation? We stated that we did not, which didn't seem to be a problem and we were seated in the ""nicest"" part of restaurant according to the owner. My hubby had the rack of lamb that came with yellow rice and veggies + a glass of cabernet and I had the rosemary chicken that came with veggies and a touch of saucy mash potatoes. I'm seriously impressed by the amazing food and this just might be the best dinner I've ever had. The two things I would say that need improvements would be the restaurant itself. It's very outdated and the other would be the servers were stiff to the point where the service was impersonal and a tad pompous. I also noticed that my waiter's attire was outdated as well and unclean, which isn't a big deal but something that should be looked into. Overall my husband and I did enjoy our meal and will certainly be making our way back to RL sometime in the near future. Our total bill with tax + tip included was $ for  entrees and  glass of wine and we both thought it was well worth it. Great job Rue Lepic! Simply amazing. It's been  years since I last was there until this Sunday. The food hasn't changed a bit and it still superb in every way & worth every penny. I love support a chef who is truly passionate about her restaurant (and beautifully dressed too). She is so personable to visit every table asking about your meal and kindly held the door for us as we exited. This is the perfect, romantic date spot. It definitely reminds me of a European restaurant. Needless to say, you won't be disappointed with the meal, service, or ambiance. Food was good, but pacing felt like I was in Europe, where the waiters show up so infrequently and the food comes out so slowly so you just enjoy yourselves at the table. For me, it was definitely too slow, but the food was simple and tasty. Not much parking around. Small room, but quaint. We had dinner here on a Wednesday night.  Walked in around :pm, and the restaurant was somewhat empty.  We were able to get seated right away even though we didn't have reservations. The place is pretty small.  They only had one waiter working.  I'm not sure if it's like that  every night or just weeknights.  The service is decent. I ordered their caesar salad which was $. .  It was a tad small for what they charge. Our entrees each came with a small bowl of soup (cream of mushroom that day).  We got the boneless breast of duck with an orange sauce ($) and the grilled tenderloin of beef with a cognac peppercorn sauce ($).  I thought the steak was very good.  Just the right size.  The peppercorn sauce was very tasty, and there was lots of it (which I like).  It also came with some scalloped potatoes (or was it potatoes au gratin?).  The potatoes were good as well. We were pretty full, so we didn't have room for dessert. I don't know why, but I think this is one of the most romantic restaurants in the City.  It's small to the point of being cramped.  The food is above average, but not great (I had the duck and she had the veal. . . both good but not great).  Menu hasn't changed in years.  Open kitchen, so it's slightly smoky.  But there's something about sitting by the window with someone special and it feels so good and right.  There are definitely fancier places with nicer decor, but this place just feels right to me.  This is the one place where I want to take my time eating my meal. Definitely order the chef's menu, a very good deal for the quantity and quality.  The service is spot on. . . . friendly and attentive but not annoying and fake.  Street parking in the neighborhood is impossible to find, so take a cab.  Aftwards, walk up the hill to the Fairmount or Huntington and have a night cap in the bar. Just happened to pass this place by  and was surprise that it was located just a block form the grand hotels (Fairmont, Mark Hopkins, Huntington, etc). It was Wednesday night and the place was quite jammed (good sign?) We were lucky to score a table right away because the place was quite small. Only one waiter (owner?) that night. Two kinds of menu offered, prix fixe and a la carte. we decided to go with the prix fixe. we were not disappointed! The filet mignon was cooked to perfection, and my friend had a salmon dish which he said one of the best he ever tasted! The wine list is small but did not disappoint. The baguette was one of the best outside of Paris. Love the pasta ! (who care if it's not French? I ate one of the best spaghetti in Paris by the Opera!) Very entertaining to see the chef (Adela) at work  (The kitchen was open) and you can tell that she really love this job! Food was lovingly prepared. This place reminded of Parisian bistro without all the fake decorations. The mango custard dessert was the perfect finale of the evening. Good place to get authentic French cooking without the ridiculous price tag. Best kept secret in SF! I like to think of Rue Lepic as accessible sophisticated French food. The restaurant is small and intimate, not intimidating like some French restaurants I've been too. The staff are very hospitable and eager to help recommend dishes, wines and pairings. The food is simply: Parfait. It's the right combination of flavor and texture without being too rich as some French food can be. The portions are just right. You'll walk out satisfied not needing a nap. This place is near my Aunt and Uncle's place so I go as often as I can. They're big fans too. I came here after a fantastic show of Book of Mormon with my family, and we were as hungry as ever. We had already made reservations & it was a Wednesday night, so it wasn't too busy but the ambiance was good. For a  person staff, the service and food were both excellent. I have only been to a couple other French restaurants, none super expensive, but I think it is the best one I have been to so far!The soup, creamed cauliflower, was DELISH! Great with the hot bread served to us. I order the Filet Mignon, liked the sauce although it was a little reminiscent of a bbq sauce flavor, but nonetheless fantastic. My mom ordered the Rosemary Chicken, boasting its flavor and tenderness. My sister ordered the veal, which seemed a little subpar compared to our meals, but had a great sauce. The duck ordered by my dad was tasty, but not as good as expected.  Carrot and beans were amazing sides, as well as the scalloped potatoes. We ordered a creme brulee and mango mousse for dessert. Both were good as usual, nothing horrible or extraordinary. Overall, the staff was extremely nice and did exceptionally well for only have one chef. Food was served at a perfect time, hot, and delicious. I would come back again to try the lamb or seafood pasta! Dined here for our  year wedding anniversary. When I walked in I wasn't sure. . It seemed like there was absolutely nothing French about it. I was WRONG. The chef has been trained well. The food was exquisite. It was also a really good deal for the prie fix meal. The only thing I wished for was a decent wine list or a full bar. Otherwise, I will for sure be back! Had dinner here, other than the starter, shrimp in a Pernod sauce, the rest if the food was barely edible. The duck was tough, no crispiness to it, drowned in a very strong overpowering orange sauce, and the accompanying 'rice' had a very weird aroma, reminiscent of dirt, yes people, dirt. It tasted very odd as well, and when I complained about it, the waiter tried to tell me it was the spices, he mentioned cumin and turmeric, two spices I am actually very fond of. He then said he would taste it, which he did, and agreed that yes, it was very bad, and would I like some potato dauphinoise instead. My friends Filet Mignon was also not good. We did have some pureed vegetable soup, which was very tasty. Even the coffee was weak as hell. All in all a bad, bad experience, and certainly not one I could recommend. No reductions either in the bill, and considering I had to send the rice back, that was disappointing. I rarely if ever eat at French bistros in CA. Our French in SB is Bouchon (not related to the Vegas one to my knowledge but it may be) is extremely expensive but worth it on a special occasion (Valentine's Day, anniversary, birthday). In New York, I go to Bistro Chat Noir, Mon Petit Cafe, Quatorze Bis (once). The Upper East Side boasts many excellent French restaurants, not the least of which is Sel y Poivre, an old neighborhood family owned bistro. It's extremely reasonable the bargain prix fixe of the Upper East side for dinner .  for entree, appetizer and dessert! But my CT friend who traveled to SF for business a lot at one time always ate here. Just at the bottom of Nob Hill, down from the Mark Hopkins on  Pine Street, it's teeny tiny with unusually beautiful and comfortable chairs and tables close together. I was absolutely astounded by the food and the prices, far lower than I expected for a place of this caliber. It's  years old and you don't survive in the cutthroat restaurant business if you aren't exceptional. It's owned by a charming older Asian couple and frequented by a combination of locals and well to do tourists. One man came in by himself and ordered a Caesar salad (the best I've ever had, utterly perfect dressing, plenty of shaved cheese and tons of anchovies for just  or  dollars), a glass of wine and a dessert. I was shocked by the size and we were lucky on a Friday night during our mini vacation to San Francisco for the Afghan Whigs show at the Fillmore (review of this legendary venue forthcoming) to get the last table for two at PM. My boyfriend had the filet with cognac peppercorn, a generous cut of meat with some potatoes underneath. It was exquisite and entrees come with a cup of soup. The soup of the day was cream of vegetable, just a hint of cream, with a wonderful flavor. I never send things back due to temperature but the soup was barely warm so they happily took it back and it returned quite hot. The coffee was terrific and strong (I'm wondering if they serve my favorite coffee Peerless since that's a SF based company) but if you demand scalding hot coffee say so when you order. J had the best cheesecake I've ever tasted, far lighter than a New York cheesecake like he had at Cafe Majestic the night before. The creme anglaise was so good I could have had a cup of all by itself. Best of all for a place of this caliber, there are plenty of  and  dollar wines by the glass. In New York, it's gotten insane.  used to be the most expensive wine by the glass and now it's barely above average at a nice restaurant. Hotel bars are notoriously pricey but at the Gramercy Hotel bar (admittedly great), wines start at  or  and to up to the low s. Same with the Peninsula. It was an extraordinary meal and with an entree, two soups, a salad, coffee , dessert and one glass of wine just  before tip? I can't wait to eat there again when I'm hungrierP. S. : The bathroom is TINY. When I say tiny, I don't mean  or  feet by  or  feet. I mean it's like an airplane bathroom, just a bit longer. It's no big thing but it is a bit of a shock. Went here when my aunt and uncle were in town.   Very small place but they were able to seat us within  minutes without a reservation.   The food was outstanding and the priceas reasonable.   Our waitperson wasn't very knowledgeable about which wines to pair with what dishes but it didn't ruin the experience.   Overall a great experience. This place is close to me  I should come here more often!  We came here on a night when the Giants were playing so it was probably a little quieter than usual.  We had a lovely meal of vegetable puree soup (soup or salad is included with your entree)  m!  Good taste and comforting.  I wanted the lobster tails, but they were out of this so for some reason we were all in the mood for salmon.  I tend to like my salmon more on the plain side because I enjoy the taste of salmon itself.  Rue Lepic's sauce was a little heavy for my taste, but it had good flavoring.  I sopped up the sauce with bread  m!  The waiter recommended a nice, buttery chardonnay to go with our salmon. Service was real nice and attentive, and the chef came by and checked on us, which is always a caring touch.  And yes, the restroom is super tiny, haha.  But it goes with the charm of Rue Lepic.  Definitely a neighborhood plus. The absolute worst ""French"" food I've ever had the displeasure of eating. This place is bad. Really *really* bad. Barely edible. If you've lost your sense of taste perhaps this would be a good restaurant choice. For everybody else, avoid! Hey, you  guy or girl or couple from out of town looking for a French place to eat.  Yes, I'm talking to you.  I'm here with you right now.  (I'm not talking to the locals because they already know what I'm about to tell you).  Got two words for you: ""don't bother. ""  I won't get too much into the details.  Just find somewhere else.  This place is not as good as the French place where you're from.  Not even close.  On any level.  Ah ah ah ah ah. . . Shh. . . (I'm putting my finger on your lips now to shut you up).  Just. . . (whispering) just don't go. I've only been here once but I can truly say it is one of my favorite restaurants in SF. The food is phenomenal. The ambiance is like an old school Parisian brasserie. Real nice. The service is also very good. I had the veal roast as part of my prix fix menu. A great experience! I have been going to this restaurant for years. And it drives me crazy to see some of these idiot people who put these reviews on here like they have never stepped foot in this place. I think they must be thinking of another place or they are just morons stirring things up just to be mean. The folks here at Rue Lepic are the best. And the food is wonderful. Love this place. For those who gave those bogus reviews, get a life! This was my birthday dinner and someone recommended Rue Lepic so I did research on this French restaurant.  The pictures, in retrospect, are deceiving, because they make the place look romantic which it is not.  Nothing romantic about being on top of the next table and the open kitchen smoke blowing all over the place.  I ordered the Chefs Menu. But being an escargot lover, I asked to replace the seafood pasta with escargot which our waiter was more than happy to do.  In fact, he recommended it.  But, I'm a purist with escargot and this one was plated with noodles, some crazy butter/tomato sauce and basically tasteless.  The salad was ordinary.  The lobster, while good, was not presented well.   Rather sloppy looking.  the dessert was forgetful.  I saw no French in the kitchen.  Basically your run of the mill hispanics but the lady had it down to a science.  I'm given it two starts because the host/waiter was very professional and has been there for decades.  However, one time was enough for me. A well meaning but mediocre restaurant. Maybe the tourists will keep it going. Since it's often hard to figure out which reviewers know their food and which don't, I'll say which SF French restaurants I do like: Chez Papa and Zazie. (No, I haven't tried any of the really expensive ones. ) Readers can decide whether my opinion is worth taking seriously. General point: Food was overspiced, in some cases wantonly so. Lentil soup: blended smooth, but had too much salt and pepper mixture left a harsh aftertaste in the back of the throat. Le Poulet avec Rosemary: again, overspiced. (The beans and carrots were cooked perfectly; small compensation. ) However, the poulet was a miracle of restraint compared to the Filet Mignon, which had been drowned in Worcestershire sauce. I think I outgrew this style of cooking in fourth grade. Maybe fifth. Had we not been in a rush to see our show, we would have sent it back.  The cut of meat was not particularly flavorful, either. At $, this was a huge disappointment. Bottom line: if you want mediocre food before taking in a show in the theater district, save your money and go to Lori's Diner. (Of course the service was pleasant, but I've never seen the point of giving and withholding stars based on service. ) With French food offered by Asian proprietors in a small, simple space one block down (south) from California St. and its swanky  hotels, Rue Lepic is easy to miss. But the food is consistently excellent and offered at a lower price point than comparable cuisine at places like La Folie. Check it out. If Spartan seating arrangements aren't a problem, you won't regret it. I was catching up with a friend who was staying at the Four Seasons on Market and we decided to head out for dinner instead of getting hotel food. Rue Lepic popped up on Yelp and had good reviews and we decided that it would be a enjoyable walk in beautiful SF evening weather. No seriously. . . I like it when it is a little nippy. This really was a nice walk and a bit of a workaround up those steep hills which is good because I really worked up an appetite. This is a tiny quaint little restaurant. Service was not that great though. Our waitress was surly and never cracked a smile the whole time we were there. The food was good. Let me just cut to the chase. The ganache was OMG GOOD. Heaven on earth! Let me back track now. The pasta was delish and the caesar salad was good. The pea soup was all right. Slightly disappointed with the filet mignon. The sauce was not that great. So overall it was a satisfying meal though at $ (including an avg. bottle of wine) including tip was a little pricey given the overall experience. BTW, I think this place has the smallest restroom I have ever seen. You literally have to walk sideways to use it. They might have actually converted a closet. No biggie and I thought it was cool. You know, something different. Based on the recommendations of the yelpers we checked out this restaurant. Great place and food!  Highly recommend it! I dined here recently as it was nearby to the meetings I had in the city and decided not to schlep elsewhere for dinner with a friend. I was happy with my choice for that reason alone as it was raining on the evening in question and neither of us felt much like venturing out. I was actually quite impressed with this place. The atmosphere itself isn't very inviting, I have to admit, and the tables are extra cozy. But the menu is straight up French bistro and the service is actually quite nice. The wine menu, as mentioned elsewhere, isn't massive but the bottles they do have are very reasonably priced. My dining companion and I both ordered the chef's menu. The seafood pasta starter was delicious and a nice little portion. The soup  a generically described ""vegetable cream"" the night I dined  was also a delicious little course, delicately flavored and a nice velvety texture. The salad course was the weakest; the Caesar salad featured flaccid and overdressed greens and haphazard chunks of parmesan. They need to rethink the salad course a bit; a bitter greens salad would be a more welcome component to the meal. Maybe some arugula or mache. The main course  in my case, a red snapper special  was delicious and well prepared. It was slightly over sauced which masked the flavor of the fish and the sauce itself was very similar to the seafood pasta (think lemon butter herb). But I will say it was very tasty and while wasn't much of a looker, the flavors were pretty much balanced and what you'd expect from French cuisine. The highlight of my meal was the dessert. I chose the passionfruit mousse and was utterly impressed. It was tangy and tart with a great sauce and a lingering, almost faintly perfume y aftertaste that is iconic of a nice passionfruit. A light and fantastic end to the meal. All in all if they'd address the salad course and maybe freshen up the decor slightly it'd be a big improvement. Barring that I'd still happily dine here again; it seems from the reviews here that the meals are consistent from visit to visit and so is the service. The husband/wife team are very charming folks. On a cold rainy SF night, this little gem hit the spot and for that it gets four stars! A very small and cozy restaurant that is worth a visit. First of all the wine list is not extensive but very good and prices are reasonable. The Monthuy's Pere et Fils champagne was very good. The salmon according to my better half was ""incredible. "" My chicken was not very tasty and we thought was bland. Perhaps something was left out in the preparation. The soup, Cream of Watercress, was fabulous. I would return for a second visit in the future. Is it wrong to have dreams about seafood pasta? If so, I don't give a damn. That stuff is good. I licked the plate with their perfect baguette. We were in the city celebrating my friend's th birthday. So we partook of the chef's menu. I began with the seafood pasta. I am going back with my hubby just for that alone. Then the soup special was butternut squash. Dude. One of my favorite squashes. I ordered the scallop dish. It came with perfectly cooked asparagus, carrots and I kid you not, butter masquerading as potatoes. I love them. Scallops, veggies, butter. . . love. To cap of the evening I picked the passion fruit mousse. Yes. YES. YES!That is all. Okay, a little more. At the end they provided a bit of nougat and dark chocolate to put you over the top. The restaurant is in gorgeous Nob Hill. Just a short walk from the fabulous Huntington Hotel. It is a tiny restaurant, so make sure you make a reservation. If you go, even if you don't need to use the secret restroom. Go. It's so tiny. Bon appetit!Cheers!ps. Don't wear skinny jeans. You will have to unbutton them before the evening is through. I brought my mum here on her visit to SF and it was Mother's Day. Perfect setting in this small cosy restaurant tucked away in the heart of Nob Hill. It was her day and I wanted to give her the most personal one to one time, both with mother and daughter. We started of with the house mushroom soup which was fabulicious and I decided to have the duck. Fantastic  one word! Soft, tender and tasty. We paired it with a nice glass of sparkling wine. We had the one of the best time together in this quiet setting. I should bring my hubby here too!.  stars! .  stars.  It's a lovely, cute place, not surrounded by a lot of other establishments in the immediate vicinity.  For this, I liked it more at the get go.  The ambiance inside is very charming; quiet, but not too quiet because since there are maybe  tables in the restaurant, the background noise is the consistent hum of conversation from other patrons. I ordered the escargots (which was strangely served over spaghetti, but I really enjoyed it), the filet mignon (which was very flavorful, which it was just a little more tender like most filet mignons), and the creme brulee for dessert, which was excellent.  The temperature of the cream itself was very chilled and refreshing, and the glaze on top was perfect.  One of the better creme brulees I've had!I've lately been on a French food kick, and Rue Lepic did not disappoint!"
Hotel Whitcomb Restaurant|2.5|Restaurants in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|22|-1|2.5|" Perfectly acceptable food at a highish price delivered quite promptly by unnecessarily surly staff. I am a foreign resident in the USA; from England, this is the first time in  months and many dozens of restaurant visits where I have not felt obliged to leave a tip which is usually given for anything greater than or equal to basic adequacy in terms of manners. Poor service ruined our pre show dinner. After a long and excited planning for our first Broadway musical the Lion King (over a year ago). Our family were all dressed up, as it was during December holiday season. So we thought of starting off with a fancy looking restaurant right across Orpheum for an early dinner. Looking back we wished we walked out after having to wait for  yes FORTY MINUTES for a $ sandwich and a kid's $ cup of spaghetti with cream sauce.  Our water was never refilled, the ice was gone, melted, our glasses were no longer cold. Our table's paper top were all filled with scribbles by our kids in apparent boredom and long time waiting for our meal. . Nobody checked us out. Then the grumpy waiter shot back at us that it takes time to""cook our meal"". They were not even apologetic that it was obvious that our order was misplaced. Because by the th time we followed up with our order, it was already  minutes from the time we ordered. And they even had the gall to tell us ""it takes time to cook""   a sandwich?  minutes to boil spaghetti and add cream? We didn't even order fries! How could it take  minutes to make a sandwich and boil spaghetti? We were not even offered parmesan cheese  ! The waiter never came over to ask how our meal was  coz we were obviously eating quickly and angrily and we would definitely not answer nicely back ""how our meal was!""It was our worst experience ever at a restaurant. All my kids still do remember it. Horrible experience, awful service. We enjoyed our show. We even won the only prize of the day. I just wished we could erase the awful memory of that horrible restaurant service whenever we remember our Broadway show. The place was totally empty so you would have thought that we would have had particular attention paid to us. Soup was cold but very very tasty. We didn't really have time to send it back. They wouldn't let us sit at the bar to eat food or we would have had a beer probably also. The desert was nearly tasteless and had a hard coating on it that seemed to have been sitting for a long time. Horribly run. Reception was disorganized and couldn't get one table bussed after  minute wait. Finally just went to the bar. The bartender was doing an impressive job considering he was handling drinks for the whole place. It had a stuffy, hospice feel to it. Given the location, I'm surprised they haven't should reinvented themselves as a hip, quick, pre Orpheum cocktail stop. The filet mignon was absolutely delicious! The steak my mom had was perfectly done just the way she liked it. I thought the service was really good. Everyone was so sweet and accommodating! This hotel reminds me of Old San Francisco and has its own special charm. :) This is a horrible hotel.  Small bathroom, I can't move inside and I almost knocked my head by the mirror.  It's a high ceiling room.  Creepy feeling.  Such an old, scary vibe hotel. . . . reminds me of the movie ""the shining"".  I'm not kidding! The only reason why it got a  star is for valet service.  I was happy with it. . Those valet guys are pretty good.  I tipped them good:) Stayed here on a work trip and was excited about having a restaurant in the hotel. But room service?  Nah. How about ordering at the bar?  Nope, take a seat at a table. . . . and by take a seat, we mean take a seat and wait. . . and wait. . . and wait. . . while we deal with ""a large party"" that was about  people which apparently meant that no one else could get service, just strange looks from the staff.  After waiting for  minutes with literally no one talking to us, my date and I left to find friendlier ground.  Do not recommend stopping here  just keep walking to where people are actually ready to appreciate your business! I was in town on business and found this location to be very friendly, prompt, not pricey and delicious for breakfast.   I was always seated quickly and it was no time at all the my meal would be served.  Perfectly cooked each time and delicious coffee to boot.  Never had to worry about missing my meeting start times because of a delay obtaining breakfast.  Staff is very courteous and my check was always promptly attended to.  Excellent choice. Hahahha. . . wow you think you've seen it all until you walk into your hotel's completely empty restaurant and you sit at the bar and you are informed that you can't order from menu if you sit at the bar. . . oh and drink up because they will kick you out at :pm. Hahaha. We went there before the Orpheum teathre . We had a very disappointing experience . we were rushed from the moment we got there. Waiter and manager tried to rush our meal. Food was  average nothing to write home about. I will never recommend or go back to this place. drinks, crab sandwiches and lobster mac and cheese  whats not to like.  The service was great too. Quite a bit better than its Yelp reviews for breakfast and very nice jazz ambiance the morning I was there.  The bathroom in the lobby area is pretty miserable.  C'mon hotel owner, you are in the middle of SF.  Invest a little money  you'll get it back if you can raise your rates . because of it. They were super quick and the food was ok  but nothing special. They tried not to seat my friend y the window when she arrived alone as they told her they reserved those spots for larger parties. . . there was no on else in the restaurant at the time and after an hour it still hadn't picked up. Went here for a belated work holiday party, so, FREE LUNCH!We sat in the front area near the fireplace, which is nice, but the front area is also next to Market Street, so, we got to see all sorts of crack whore/drug dealer/homeless escapades.  Let's just put it this way, we needed no conversation, all the entertainment was before us. Be that as it may, the Whit cannot be blamed for the shenanigans going on in front of their establishment.  We had a pre fixe meal, my choice was a cup of chowder, a salad and the chicken.  The chowder was ok  nothing too special.  The salad was also ok, nothing special.  The chicken was nicely seasoned and came on a bed of crispy polenta, pretty good.  For dessert, we had a block on tiramisu.  The dessert was ok, what you would expect from a place that makes their own dessert though there isn't an italian anywhere to be seen.  Minus some portion of stars since they didn't ask if we wanted coffee with dessert. Free lunch, free entertainment, no botulism  all in all, a good day. Ya feel me? As far as hotel restaurants go, I suppose it was ok.  The prices for the breakfast entrees were ok, but every single side is evenly priced at $ dollars, which I thought was a little odd.  For example my girlfriend got yogurt to go with her french toast, and I got a side of home fries, I don't think those things are of an equivocal price.  However the food was decent enough, even if they were out of banana pancakes, which after seeing it on the menu, I had my heart set on.  I had to get the blueberry instead which was still pretty decent. We went in just a few minutes after dinner service had ended. The chef came out of the kitchen to talk to us and when he learned that we had come in to eat, he volunteered to make anything we wanted. He ended up making us an amazing short rib dish! Unbelievably yummy!  Ordered a bottle of wine and enjoyed a lovely, late dinner. Cheers! I drop by the bar here once a week or so.  The reason is that the bartender Keith is about as personable as they get.  I went the first time with friends who also like to visit because of the ""Cheers"" like reception they get from him.  I like the new tapas menu for the bar.  The Kobe beef hamburger hits the spot after a martini.  The bar stocks some of my favorite liquors, like Hendricks gin, as well. A lot better than average hotel food. . . Breakfast and lunch for me. Quiet, good place to read while eating. Eggs and sausage cooked as ordered. Coffee decent. Burger was actually pretty good with some extra vegies of some sort. Pricey to be sure for what I ate, but I wanted better than decent food in a quiet place where I could read and that's what I got. Great staff too. Enjoy the room. . . nice old architectural features. Eh. . . . . Went here because I was staying at the hotel. The menu was very limited, and the food cost way more than it was worth. Within my group we ordered cheeseburgers, fries, mashed potatoes, mushroom ravioli, and squash soup. The soup was great but everything else was really sub par. . . like high school cafeteria quality. I've heard they do a better job with lunch than dinner. Heres to hoping! It was my birthday and we were going to see Wicked.  A friend and her mother was already there and we just wanted to stop in, say hello and have a drink. The place was busy but there was room for two more at my friend's table.  So we sat down. Plus there was no room at the bar. We were there for quite some time and their server didn't come by. We wanted a drink and I asked for a drink menu but th lady states they didn't have one.  Ok. . .   I wasn't sure what I wanted and the lady kep asking do you want me to come back? Do you want me to come back?  I said look, if it's easier that I go to the bar than fine. I went to the bar and it was the same at the bar.  No smile, no Hi how are you?, it was rush rush rush.  What do you want?  And the man behind the bar was not buried in tickets and the bar was not three deep.  There was no need for such pressure. And he seemed annoyed that we wanted four drinks not two.  Interesting. A bartender at least should get a $ per drink he makes. But he didn't even take the tim to give my bf enough small bills to do so. I understand it's busy but a restaurant has to learn how to deal especially when there's an event happening every night across the street. I wish them luck. This place is weird. . . maybe it was high falutin at one time, but it's still trying to be but it's not. . . I was confused. We one went to the bar for drinks and the bar encompasses what I mean by the place's identity crises. On one hand there were fancy and older fixtures; like the actual bar and the chandelier but then the shelf where they keep the liquor looks like it was some compressed plywood shelving from Best in the 's and they slapped it together to put some suspiciously generic looking booze intermingled with your normal fare of bottles. Yet right behind me women with highly coiffed hair in old money jewels were spreading butter on crusty bread (on the plate of course NEVER in the air) infront of a cavernous old worldly fireplace. There was an old guy playing the piano and that is always a nice touch. Oh ya then I went to the bathroom and I felt like I had walked into the bathroom at some random bus stop or something. None of the randomly found character of the Whitcomb could be found in the bathroom. . . at all. . . . don't look for it. . . . it's not there. To top it off they have a door in the lobby that leads to a starbucks. A few years ago it was home to a Gay Bears Convention during Valentines weekend but this year they probably found a better place to hold it. Charlotte and I got into the Hotel Whitcomb pretty late on a Wednesday. We looked around the neighborhood a bit, but heading my Cousin's advice, and didn't wander too far. We found a few open places that were either greasy fast food, or people in wine bars dressed to the nines (we just got off a place and felt scrubbish). In the end, we returned to the hotel to get food at their attached Restaurant. We figured, they could deal with our scrubbishness since we were staying there. We were seated immediately (granted it was quarter of ), however the service took a while longer, with no clear reason as to why. A pretty good seafood pasta and a Gorgonzola Salad cost .  (including tip), and no drinks. This was a bit high for the area, but it was nicely presented and done very well. I'd honestly be happier if they didn't try so hard to be a super classy place, and dropped the prices a bit. Nothing super special here, but I will give them props for keeping the kitchen open so late. So, if you're staying here, its very convenient, but I don't think I go out of my way to stop by. On side note, a group of Chinese travelers were sitting at a table near us. The restaurant had the foresight to send over a Mandarin speaking server to that table, even though they weren't in her area (I saw her waiting on tables mostly on the other side)."
Vino Teca|2.5|Italian in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|12|-1|2.5|" My husband and I were looking for a decent place to have dinner on a warm summer night where literally every place on Union Street is packed!  We stumbled on this place and surprisingly it was empty!  I was very skeptical and almost hesitant to come in.  The nice server invited us to try their pizza and didn't want to be rude so we went in.  After being there for   minutes, people started to pour in.  The service is very good  very attentive servers, provided water, soda, wine when they were about to empty, checked in once in a while, offered more bread.  The prices are very reasonable!    We ordered the calamari which was fried to perfection  I could tell the squid was fresh.  We ordered the Margareta Pizza and added chicken  delicious!  Medium size is more than enough for two. The wine list is also impressive  will definitely come back because of food quality and top service. U N B E L I E V A B L E. It's easter. I'm with friends on union street to see the parade. I desperately need a bathroom and there's no ""porta pottys"" in site! lol. I'm respectful, and am looking for a restaurant to purchase something to use the restroom. Alas! I come upon La Vinoteca with a home made sign taped to the window that says ""pizza by the slice $. . "" So I go inside (dead by the way!). I mention to the server I'd like to use the restroom, and buy a piece of pizza to go. As I'm walking back to the restroom a scruge of an old woman in a chefs coat (obviously the owner or manager), PHYSICALLY GRABS ME BY MY PURSE AND FORCEFULLY YANKS ME BACK! and says NO. You will not use our restroom(hands still FIMRLY placed on my purse!) I ask her to please remove her hands from my purse, and said, I let your server know already, that I would like a slice of pizza to go?!? Then  she says ""NO. We have no pizza by the slice. You may sit down, place your order, THEN you can use our restroom. "" I said Ma'am if you don't have pizza by the slice, then why do you have signs taped ALL over your windows that say you do? You should really take them down then. . . She then has the balls to say to me ""OH what so now your my manager?""WOW. WOW. WOW. and not in a good way! Unbelievable! Never ever ever in a million years will i ever go back there and I'd encourage you all to do the same! Sign that was placed in window after closure as a wine bar promising upscale Mexican food soon has been removed. Another sign now promises pasta and free delivery starting Thursday /.  We'll see. To get you warmed up for the grand re opening, if and when it happens, here's a pasta joke:""Mommy Mommy  do we have to have spaghetti again tonight?""""Shut up or I rip the veins out of your other arm. "" I walk by this place on my way home every night. And, it's empty every night.   tables at the most. A total knock off of its established neighbor. . . I'm all for competition, but this is a poor attempt. Bring something new to the game. I didn't realize this was the same owner as Luisa's until I read the review, but doesn't surprise me. . . who knows how long she'll float this business, but its got to be hemorraging cash. This place is awful! I am a local and went there as we know the proprietor she is a local business lady. The wines we tasted were like grape juice and far too expensive its got to be pretty bad if my wife and i walk out without finishing our wine but we really could not stomach the wine. We raced to our usual haunt Ottimista, very classy and sophisticated with excellent wines at reasonable prices. My husband and I stumbled upon this place when trying to find a good happy hour. The sign out front said, ""Happy Hour  $ wine  Free Appetizers. ""We walked in, each got a glass of Cab, and placed our orders for what we would like for an appetizer. I got gnocchi with a spicy red tomato sauce, called ""arriabatta. "" Husband got the bruschetta. I won. The gnocchi was tender and juicy with a fresh made sauce. They placed everything out on a buffet, but the place was basically empty so we ate our full portions. Vino Tecca is a new toddler waddling on its feet. Help lift it up and guide it along. There is a lot of competition on this section of Union and this place has good enough food, wine, and service to do as well as the rest. At least for happy hour ( ?) And get the gnocchi while you're there. Unlike the past reviewers, I love this place. Aside from the pop music that sort of messes with the ambiance, the wine selection is great. The waitress has a cute foreign accent and is exceptionally friendly. I've been here twice  once for the wine and the other time for wine and dinner, and both times have been really satisfied. :P Order the gnocchi! It's yummy. And there's like five different sauces to choose from! Was a bit hesitant since it was almost completely empty, but the wait was too long at Pane e Vino.  Our waitress was very sweet and seemed really nervous about not speaking English too well.  She did a really good job, though.  I was pleasantly suprised with the food.  I think the dish I had was called Crestini or Creppini or something to that effect. . . ham and cheese rolled in pasta with some sort of cream sauce over it that was delicious.  My only gripe was that the portion was way too small.  All in all, I would definitely come back to this place and recommend it to others.  of the  of us are big fans of Luisa in her original location down the street.  I was just ho hum the one time I was at Luisa's but have met her on other ocassions and love chatting with her after she's had a few Limoncellos.  She's a fireball!  But. . . . while I was totally excited to hear about her new spot opening and waited, and waited, and waited for it's opening, have to say that I was disappointed.  Strolled in and we were the only ones there on a weekend afternoon.  It's clear that it is not quite set up as they had a contractor in there still taking measurements for something.  But the server welcomed us and assured us they were open.  Service:  while he was a sweetheart and tried his best, he didn't seem to know the menu well.  We had to point to the items on the menu and even at that , managed to get one order wrong.  Our wine took a while as I don't think he quite knew which was which as he compared the label to the menu. The wine:  disappointing.  The selection was surprisingly small for a wine bar, and the three different wines that we had were actually disappointing as well.  The only non Italian wine we had, a Merlot, was actually far and away the best of the three we had.  The Sangio did not quite stand up to our expectations.  The food:  food is okay, though I have to say they make up for their other pitfalls with the quantity.  The cheese plate had  types of cheese, at least  servings of each and for $, was far and away a great deal.  The mozzarella was not the best, but the other cheeses were fantastic, great contrasts, and the blue cheese with honey. . . . m, delish.  The pizza could have been a bit more crisp and thin crust, but it was tasty.  The panchetta and cheese wrapped asparagus was good, but inconsistently cooked, some parts more well done than others.  The bread is just okay here though it's nice that it's served warmed.  All in all, I'd say give them a couple months before you venture there, let them work out all the kinks. Meh.  Came in here during Union Street festival mainly because my friend wanted to use a bathroom, but also because we were thirsty, this place was pretty close to empty, and the beer gardens were crazy packed.  Two of us sat at the bar and perused menus while our third friend went to the bathroom.  When she got back, she told us that the bathroom was out of order, that the toilet was practically overflowing.  She used it anyway cause at that point she was desperate, but by then we felt obligated to order a glass of wine.  The wines were good, the service was ok, and the prices were normal for the neighborhood. Because of this decent experience, we chose to come back for dinner a few weeks later.  It was only when we sat down and were given menus for Luisa's as well as Vino Teca that I realized they were both owned by Luisa.  The place was about half full, yet the service was abysmal.  The waitress seemed like it was her first night on the job, and in fact I later saw Luisa yelling at her in the back about something.  The bus boy seemed to be constantly confused as to whether to clear plates or give plates.  The food was okay, but portions were incredibly small for the prices they're charging.  And we had to ask for bread to go with our cheese plate.  We weren't charged for it or anything, but shouldn't bread or crackers be included with a cheese plate?I gave the place a fair shot, but now that I know it's part of the Luisa domain over Union Street I'm much less inclined to give them my business.  Besides, Ottimista Enoteca has much better food and ambiance than this place. Horrible wine bar with a horrible owner. Just to be clear: this place isn't open yet, and may never open.  Luisa Hanson just forced out the Front Room and the John Barleycorn, (two  year old businesses), left the store fronts to rot, and now she's opening a place called Vino Teca right across the street from Enoteca?  This lady doesn't deserve to do business in San Francisco.  Her egomania is causing a swath of heartache and destruction. UPDATE as of // Luisa's, her restaurant up the street, has been shut down by the health department with the abysmally low score of %. . . here's the link dphw. sfdph. org/eh/Viol…"
Al Masri|3.0|Middle Eastern in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|161|-1|2.84782608696|" It was pm on a Friday evening and we were the only ones in the restaurant. This would be unheard of anywhere else in SF. I already had a feeling that this place was going to be a disappointment. We sat down and were greeted by who I'm guessing is the owner who commented that the server was running late (who apparently was supposed to also be the dancer. . . we didn't stay long enough to see what that was going to be like). Being the only people there we were able to order quickly.  other parties came in after us and they waited probably a good  minutes before anyone came back out from the kitchen to seat them or greet them (they all just took their seats anyway). Got our food and it was pretty decent. Not the best Middle Eastern food I've had. . . but definitely not worth the $/person AFTER using a $ off coupon. For that much money I expect better quality, better service and a happily stuffed belly. I'm guessing we paid extra for the belly dancing that never started while we were there for an hour. This is kind of like those restaurants you see on TV where you wonder how they're surviving because they're probably not making the rent and is in need of some new juju. As for me, I'll probably never come back. Took a chance when visiting SF, and on a back street we found this place after touring king tuts exhibit at the museum.  I have not eaten Egyptian food, and we didnt know what to expect.  This was also yrs ago and my GF now wife took a trip.  Place is basically a family, the mom does the cooking, the daughter was our server, and the dad makes sure everything is moving/helps/makes the rounds.  Daughter was in uggs and sweatpants. So dont expect swank  more like casual kick. The decor is nice, middle eastern, and dim/intimate.  and the food was really good.  I liked the rice that was shaped like a pyramid next to my lamb dish.  And one of our appetizers was hummus and a good starter. The entertainment was definitely a surprise when there was only us and another table of  at the time.  Music was kind of loud, and really she started belly dancing and did like  songs.  The dancer passes a tip envelope and u give if u want.   stars is because what i remember the most was the price.  It's expensive!  Like  drinks, one entree, two appetizers was like $.  Ouch! But hey  dinner and a show. . . And u get to try the only Egyptian joint in SF. King Tut! entertaining dancers, but I'd suggest passing on this one. food tastey, but resturant has foul smell. I have to admit I'm quite surprised that this place has an average three star rating. The only reason I didn't give this place a five star rating (""As good as it gets!"") is that I have never tried any other Egyptian restaurant, nor have I been to Egypt, so I cannot make a fair comparison on whether what I ate was authentic and as good as it gets. What I DO know is that everything was DELICIOUS. With that said. . . My friend and I arrived at :PM on a Thursday evening (admittedly an early dinner), with a $ off coupon I had bought on Amazon Local. At :PM we were the first ones in the place, and the only ones there until about :PM, and our server was most attentive and sweet. It's a very small place, somewhat dimly lit but with fun, interesting Egyptian esque decor. The place felt very warm and inviting  I think it's a family run establishment, and it felt very personal to be there. On the exterior, despite the bright blue sign, the restaurant is easy to miss, sort of stuffed between two dull residential buildings, and without windows you almost question what exactly is going on in there. . . We started with two appetizers: the Hummus Bil Tahina and the Zabadi Bil Toom. Entrees ordered were the chicken kebab, Kebab Firakh (my friend's) and the layered eggplant with ground beef, Musa'ah Bil Lahma (mine). My entree in particular was HUGE and as much as I wanted to, I could not finish it and had to bring it home. This did not stop me from ordering dessert, however. Desserts vary each day but last night's order was of a honey cake and a plate of coconut covered, doughnut hole looking things (""fingers"" they were called), that were both wonderful. As we arrived at :PM and had a leisurely dinner, we got to enjoy the short belly dancing show that began at :PM. Per the restaurant, the shows are at :, :, and :PM. It was a fun way to savor our dessert and enjoy a little entertainment. I took a quick look at the complaints people made (you can't please everyone!) and some of them are a bit ridiculous. Overpriced? With three glasses of wine between us, the bill after sales tax came to about $. Apps average about $ , entrees $ , desserts $ . This is SAN FRANCISCO and this is NORMAL. The menu not having much variety? It's a small establishment, probably seats about  total, and I feel like the lack of variety is overshadowed by the quality of the food. Yes there are only  entree options on the menu (and maybe one daily special)  if you can't make a choice among  items, maybe you're better off going to TGI Fridays!Overall, a great experience and I highly recommend the place to anyone looking to try something a little different. The saddest thing about this place is that those who have never tasted Egyptian food will think the crap served here is authentic. I grew up in an Egyptian household and know how Egyptian food should taste; and the food at this place is the worst Egyptian food I have ever had in my life. It was so bad that i had to call my brother, who lives in Denver, from the restaurant to tell him just how bad the food was and describe to him  what was placed in front of me. It's a real shame people will think this is what Egyptian food should taste because it certainly is not. We went on Sunday night when there was music, belly dancing performers and a buffet. The music was great although over amplified & loud for such a small space. The decor was interestingly Egyptian. And the food I'm told is quite authentic: very bland. The quality of the food was not great, dry chicken and less than fresh fish. But we were most disappointed by the price: $/per person for the buffet and $ for child's buffet. i love this place!! Dancers and waiters are friendly and work hard. Food is good! vegetable mu'SAh is insanely good! Good vegetarian options!. Always bring friends and family!. We used a Groupon coupon to go to the only Egyptian restaurant in Northern California. Ambience was very nice  paintings of old Egypt and blue covered walls. was cozy. But the food was rather uninspiring and not spiced  bland would be the word. AT least my chicken dish was. Overpriced entrees  $  $ considering what you get. And slow, slow service  we waited  minutes. Would rather go to Arabian  Nights in the MIssion District. Excellent service! Always top notch quality in bellydance shows! Specially when there's a live band, intimate and charming!! Definitely worth checking out. It's a jewel in the outer Richmond neighborhood. This place defies expectations. With its questionable reviews and location,  it started off on shot in the dark adventure.  We found ourselves in Alexandria.  The food tastes of exotic Nile deltas.  Mediterranean dishes that are familiar get transformed by a deft application of a strong cultural culinary tradition.  The samplers had me eagerly awaiting the tamarind main course and the baklava deserved its own hieroglyphic.  An Ibis gorging itself on cake and really strong coffee. Then,  there was the dancer. Valentina literally mesmerized me. She moved with the skill and grace of  every silver screen depiction.  For a moment,  I was in  North Africa and feeling like I was high on  hashish.  Next time,  I'm wearing a fez. We went last Friday evening. The place was not that busy since we came early. The food was great all the lovely spices and extremely fresh. The belly dancer Dana was very entertaining. The service was great. We will defiantly be back!! Excellent food within two blocks from my place, very accommodating and friendly service. We ordered the combination appetizers (little bit of everything with something extra) and grilled lamb. The imported cheese was delicious. Nice selection of beer and wine, added entertainment is the belly dancer. All together quite satisfying experience, will definitely repeat again. I would recommend this place to any food lover. Ambiance is the only thing this place has going for itself.  The food is overpriced and not that good.  Not going back. Our party of two arrived, it seems, a little early, at PM.  Yes, it was a week night, but during the entire  hours we were there, we were the only patrons in the place.  We enjoyed the belly dance entertainment, but it was a little awkward since we were the only audience.  Food was ok, but dinning room felt a little dated and worn. That one shining star goes out to the musicians at Al Masri.  With a portion of said star's light shining on the authentically uber kitch decor.  The other four stars that died out light years ago are for the food, the service, the dancing, and the price. My visit there was a test of endurance.  My friends had arrived around ish and had had to wait about  minutes for the buffet to be served.  By the time I got there, around ish, most of the food was gone, especially the vegetarian stuff.  So I served myself some lukewarm white rice, salad and moussaka, and asked if there would be more vegetarian dishes later. The bartender said there ""it's coming"".  So, patiently, I waited.  And waited. And waited. I checked the buffet table a few times to see if the food was there yet.  Nope.  So I asked again.  Nope.  ""It's coming"".  That's what he said. By then, the music was about to start and I didn't want to be walking in front of the musicians to keep checking the table, so I asked the waitress to tell me when the food was served so that I could go help myself without walking in fr. . . and I was about to finish my explanation but she waved me off and muttered ok.  Like whatevah. About  minutes later she brings me this gorgeous "" cake of moussaka that I hadn't ordered.  I inform her of this and she takes it back, looking pissed.  I'm going to interrupt myself here and write a little letter: Dear Al Masri, Being a vegetarian doesn't mean we eat copious amounts of vegetables and salad.  We need carbs, fats, proteins, a variety of flavors, and if it's late at night, a tomato eggplant dish is a little hard on the digestion.  If the buffet says, ""All you can enjoy,"" your customers, even the vegetarians, who are paying the same as the omnivores (what you call ""carnivores"" on your website) to enjoy, also need substantial food.  Please take this into account when planning your menu. Thank You, MeOk, I'm back.  So I go to the bartender and try to clarify.  He practically yells at me about having sent my order back  you know, the one that I DIDN'T ORDER because he had said that more buffet food was on its way?  My ears turned bright red.  Really dude?  Did you just raise your voice at me for asking what you meant when you said the buffet food was on its way?  But yeah, about an hour after he'd first said the food was coming, around the time the pissy waitress was clearing our plates and the other lady was doling out single servings of baklava (very yummy, BTW), ONE vegetarian dish came out.  Finally, I ate more salad and a some spinach pastry. At that time, the dancers also emerged.  The majority were wiggly and some jiggly and having great fun. . . at the customer's (literal) expense.  Student recital, with some notably more skilled dancers emerging around :.  I sat there thinking, ""Did I really just drive out to the boonies of SF to wait for lukewarm food, get flack from pissy servers, and pay $ to watch a bunch of slightly coordinated women (and one that might've been a man) trying to embrace their femininity by publicly shakin' it up?""  Why yes, I did.  I felt duped.  But I smiled politely because those dancers are wonderful people and their feelings matter.  I don't want them to go home feeling like crap. On that note, Al Masri customers are also, by and large, great people whose feelings matter, and who shouldn't go home feeling like crap.  So another letter: Dear Al Masri, If you want to send your customers home happy so that they will write nice reviews and return to your restaurant, I suggest the following: ) Calculate how many reservations you have and make enough food well beforehand for buffet sized portions.  Keep food hot by having a staff member close the lids of the food and keeping a little sterno underneath the serving dishes.  But keep the salad cold, and dry the lettuce well so that the salad stays crisp. Refill food dishes often until dancing begins and/or baklava is served, not after. Also, remember that omnivores also eat vegetarian food, but vegetarians don't eat meaty foods, so keep plenty of vegetable dishes on hand for everyone. ) Be courteous to the customers. That means listening to what they're asking for without interrupting/ignoring them, and NOT raising your voice at them.  Kinda basic, but apparently still needs mentioning. ) Screen dancers who want to perform there.  Less is more, as long as it's better.  We're ok with students as long as they're upper intermediate and above.  If you're going to have beginners, don't subject paying customers to the experiment. ) Keep those musicians!  And the experienced dancers!If you can iron out those areas of opportunity, $ might not be too much to charge.     Thanks for your attention, and I look forward to seeing more positive reviews than this one in the near future! We have been here lots in the past and loved it, but the past  times we have come have been a complete disaster.  Last night was the last straw.  After calling in advance for a table for , we arrived on time to find not ONE seat left in the entire restaurant.  The waitress told us to sit tight while she tried to find room.  After waiting  minutes with no updates on our reservation, it seems like we were forgotten.  My guests ended up leaving, I stayed for the belly dance show.  When they came back they were asked if they wanted seats.  My husband explained that he was just there to pick up one of the dancers, and would not be staying.  The waitress walked to the back where I happened to be standing, and her and the owner proceeded to talk about what terrible people my husband and friend must be because they didn't want to be seated, and instead were taking advantage of a ""free show"".  Apparently they did not recognize the fact that we would have loved to all sit and enjoy a meal (paid at full price) but could not because our reservations had not been kept.  The real kicker to this?  This is the SECOND TIME IN A ROW! that we have called ahead to reserve seats, and we have had to have people leave after driving an hour to be there because there were none available.  My advice, call ahead and make sure the place is completely empty to make sure that you can actually be seated somewhere! I don't get all the negative reviews.  I was a little concerned when I walked in on a Friday night and the restaurant was empty, but we were hungry and wanted to give it a try. We had prompt, friendly, service.  The food was delicious, especially the Egyptian falafel and the moussaka.  The chef/owner came out to check on us and we were offered a % discount on our next meal.   The only drawback for me (and why I give this place  stars) was maybe the food was priced a little high.  But on the other hand, it definitely had a home cooked quality. If you want a casual, tasty meal in the Outer Richmond, you should definitely give this place a try! Went here for dinner on a Sunday after I saw a special on Groupon. I was really surprised that there was a Egyptian restaurant in San Francisco so we decided to try it out. The service was good and so was the food a little on the bland side  for me though . I had the fish and my partner had lamb kabobs. The chef  came out to talk to us to make sure everything was good and and Offered us free dessert. It was  when we got there and left at  and we were the only ones dining. They had a lot they had a bellydancing performance that we really really enjoyed. And the place is decorated beautifully vary detailed even the bathroom. Will be back for the Ambiance for sure. Eh, it's the only restaurant that serves Egyptian food in the Bay Area, so that is why we went there.  Very over priced  even with a groupon, and not great options for food.  But the service was excellent. I hate the fact that they have a belly dancer all the time.  It is not nice. Possibly the worst restaurant I've ever been to. The service was HORRIBLE. My friends and I waited for two hours before we got our food, from the time we put our name on the list to be seated to the time the food arrived. I could see they were busy, but not to the point where it merited that long of a wait. And no apologies or anything. Inexcusable. Once we did get service, our waitress was completely clueless about the menu. Given that it was my first time at an Egyptian restaurant, I had questions about the dishes on the menu and she couldn't answer even the basic ones. Also, if you keep a halal diet, don't trust this place. The menu indicates that some of their items are made with halal meat while others aren't. But when I asked the waitress to confirm, she couldn't verify and flip flopped on her answer even. The food itself wasn't bad but nothing to rave about. Finally, they had a belly dancer and entertainment show, which was lame and too close to our table to enjoy. I've seen much, much better. The whole experience was pathetic and leaving with each person having paid $ (no alcohol AND we used a Groupon deal _ ) further left a sour taste in our mouths. About the only thing this place has going for it is the Egyptian themed bathrooms, but that's it. Alone tonight. This is amazing: youtube. com/watch?v=urF…This was awkward: All by myself watching a belly dancer perform. Wasn't my fault. Expired Groupon that needed to be used. Turns out I was the only one in the entire world in the mood for Outer Richmond Egyptian. Or at least in San Francisco. Fortunately that meant attentive and friendly service. Plus some really good hummus made with tahina. Couldn't quit the toasted pita bread on the site. Loved the grilled fish with caramelized onions, pinenuts and garlic sauce too. Okra and rice pilaf on the side. Did not love the unexpected $ surcharge for salmon. Close to four stars for the meal if the price hadn't been so high. Hummus was fair at $. Seafood was expensive at $. Of course you can't really put a price on an Egyptian theme that extends to the toilet seat lids. And personal belly dancing performances. Turns out I wasn't alone after all. I love the Moussaka here!  It came out perfectly with not just eggplant and veggies but taro.  The hummus is very moist and tasty, reminded me of the fresh hummus I had in Israel.  There was belly dancing and live music, the belly dancer changed her outfits  times with props.  I'd definitely come back again and try other dishes. Once again, the one star is for the enthusiastic belly dancer.  On a Saturday night, between : and pm, we were the only table in the place.  Yes, we had the soon to expire Groupon, so we made the trek to the Outer Richmond.  Not a big trek, since we live in the Inner Richmond, but too far for the mediocre food and really high prices.  I can't believe that they think that people will pay so much for so little.  If you want really good, well priced middle eastern food, go to Troya on Clement or Fillmore.  Sorry Al Masri, but we'll not be back. Excellent Basbousa! Just. . . don't go here. Especially for Sunday dinner (which is all I have tried), and especially if you are a vegetarian. The  star is for the belly dancer (nice friendly woman), the interesting, if kitschy, decor and the dessert item which was not bad. I went here with a few friends for the usual reason cited in other reviews  someone had bought a Groupon which was expiring so we figured we should use it. The hummus was dry and almost had a stale flavor. The veggie special was terrible (mousaka and falafel  the only thing common with other mousaka I have had is that this had eggplant and some kind of tomato sauce). It seemed that the chicken entrees in the buffet were OK per my friends who tried that.  It didn't matter that the place was empty and we were seated right away  the food is really bad (at least for Sunday buffet). We asked whether the vegetarians could order from the full menu since the buffet had nothing for them, but were told there was only  thing they could order (the above mentioned mousaka + falafel) ""to make it easier for the chef"". I came home hungry and still paid $ per person + tax + tip. Yikes. Generally when you have to work for your dinner it means you ordered from the ""F**king Side"" of the menu so you have your Hoe Bag in the trunk of the car for later but not when you come to Al Masri! Working for your dinner takes on a whole new meaning at this place! My friends worked at this joint. They danced, they busted tables, the added up their own checks. I mean WORKED!I was part of a fine group of folks celebrating a friend's birthday dinner and we had our plans in order well before we got there. My fat ass was starving as I hadn't eaten all day to save room for my Ultimate Egyptian Grubdown. We arrived at : and didn't see food until well after  pm. All of our guests arrived within a reasonable amount of time but when the belly dancer came to our table and asked if all of our party was here so she could start the show I knew shit was about to get REAL! Really? Imma need you to get to wiggling and giggling and not worry about my folks. Stick a pin in that cuz we coming back to her ass. The waitress auntie I really don't wanna do this shit but I'm the only one here person took our orders, damn near refused to bring our starving asses bread and water as we waited and was a hot mess from the beginning. She ""politely"" told us what food and beverages they didn't have because they had a large party the night before. Costco was open. It's cool just bring us something! She didn't! She had a rough night on her hands and it showed because we sat there so long with plates, bowls and glasses piled on our tables that we started passing them down to the end of the table to make room for our entrees. My friend's mommie and the belly dancer became the table busters! WTF? To add insult to injury when the night was thru Auntie actually added % to our total and I was amazed she even did that with her slow ass because it took her forever to figure out our totals.  My friend said she must have been using an abacus. The smokey smell of food burning from the kitchen made our eyes water and that was a good thing as we watched the pasty white ""belly dancer"" do ONE DAMN MOVE over and over and over again, the smoke kinda shielded our eyes from the real site of her. It was actually kinda mysterious. Well kinda. She wanted everyone to join in but I told her just do you Boo Boo cuz if I get up I'm taking all your tips. I believe she and the Auntie waitress were a comedy act because in the middle of her second dance Auntie walked over and turned her music off. HILARIOUS!Around  pm our table was full of wonderful food, glorious food and it wasn't half bad. I loved the family style sizes of entrees and because of the extreme delay Chef tossed us a few bowls of delicious lentil soup and extra appetizer platters which were tasty. Now, I don't know if it was because of the hunger or the good company but I would go back for the food. I won't go back for the service or the show. Save your time and money and find somewhere else to go! When you have to help the waitress and perform belly dancing routines your food should be free! IJSPS. PARKING SUCKS! The entertainment was delightful with an array of belly dancers and live music! I really enjoyed it!But the food was really not desirable, left in steamers so the texture of the food was quite distorted. Went on a Sunday for the buffet. Food is OK, not as exotic as i thought. Small selection for a buffet. The buffet area is also very awkward and small if there are other people in the restaurant. Belly dancer performed and you feel obligated to tip since there were so few people. As other reviews have shown, this place can be an amazingly good time, or less than that. My experiences here have been primarily good, and when it hasn't been perfect, it's been because factors out of anyone's control. I've brought friends here, and tell them NOT to expect the typical restaurant experience. This place is a whole other reality. It's a little on the spendy side for such a little place all the way out in the avenues, but the portions are huge enough to take home and have for lunch the next day. The menu changes often, but if you can get it, there's a dish that is a piece of filet mignon, wrapped around feta cheese and spices that is beyond compare! Also try the falafel, made with fava beans for a super creamy texture. As far as the dancers go, yeah, maybe one or two are past their ""sell by"" date, but they are all *very* talented. If you appreciate ethnic dancing, you'll be entertained. If you want T&A, go to Hooters. Insider's tip they do take out! The only Egyptian restaurant in the Bay Area.  Great food, amazing dessert menu, good prices, bellydancing, and great service.  I'm definitely coming here again. Ok food, tacky decor (like someone was trying to decorate a room Egyptian style from a dollar store), ok service (though the manager had a bit of a 'tude), & the dancers were alright. We had a reservation but when we walked in, there was no checking the book, just a ""help yourself, sit down anywhere!"". Although the restaurant never filled up, I really don't like it when we take the time to make a reservation but it just doesn't mean a thing when we walk in. On the Sunday night buffet:Note  They have a really awkward set up. None of the lids have a little hole for where the serving spoon can go. So you either put the serving spoon entirely in the container, where (as it's all metal without any plastic handle) it gets really hot & ends up falling entirely in the food, or you put it awkward on the table (there was no spoon rest). Also several of the dishes were one in front of the other under a single lid  you can open the front half of the lid, but then you awkwardly reach under the back half to get the second dish. I felt especially bad as my friend is pescetarian & I was afraid of accidentally dropping something from a meat dish onto a veggie or seafood dish! This was definitely not a veggie friendly setup. Veggie plate  HOWEVER (continuing from above) when my friend asked about veggie options, the chef immediately said she should've mentioned this (she had, on the phone). The chef said she meant when my friend came in (a little bit of attitude there). Pretty soon a veggie platter came out  it was really delicious! A plate with a giant slice of eggplant topped with tomato sauce  underneath was sweet potato, peppers, & other veggies. This was surrounded by rice & crispy fried onions. Rice  pretty good, with pieces of vermicelli noodles. Rice grains not very sticky. Shrimp  had a very strange, bitter taste. It was overcooked to the point that it was just mushy, no crunch at all. Fish  also overcooked (I recognize the texture  likely frozen & thawed), Plus it was sitting in a lot of water & became completely soaked through & mushy. Chicken  There were legs with a green pest like sauce & breasts with different sauce. While the meat was very tender & moist, it was all very flavorless. Mussels  decent but like the shrimp had a slightly bitter aftertaste. Didn't exactly taste fresh, also likely thawed. Beef/eggplant  I LOVED this dish! It was absolutely delicious. Soft eggplant in a tangy tomato sauce & ground beef for added texture. Wonderful. Lentils  good texture, but lacking in flavor. Phyllo dough/beef  the phyllo was little dry & crispy so didn't stick together well in squares & didn't cut apart easily once on your plate. The container with this dish became a big mess of random phyllo & ground beef. Dessert  bread soaked in (I think) rose water with pistachio crumbles on top. Good flavors, but the bread was pretty hard & dry, even though it was soaked through! It seemed soaked more in something oily or greasy. I've had a homemade version of this & know that the bread can have a much softer & cake like texture. This was like stale corn bread. On the service:Besides the slight attitude from the chef above, we also got a bit of a 'tude from the manager. We'd gotten a Groupon that expired back in June  I'd called in June trying to reserve a spot before it expired & when I mentioned that, the manager basically waved it aside & said that there were so many people trying to use the Groupon that they were going to ignore the expiration date. Great! I double checked by asking  so I can use the Groupon after it expires? Yes, was the solid answer. Ok, so it took us a good  months to use the Groupon, but they said there was no expiration date. Once there, we mentioned the Groupon, & the manager sat down with me & explained that there's apparently some sort of ""code phrase"" she uses when she allows customers to use Groupons after they expire. Otherwise, apparently, how would she know whether I actually called the restaurant & talked to her? What if I called this other restaurant that has a Groupon & sounds really similar to Al Masri? Of course, not that she doubts my word or anything, but she's managing a restaurant in a struggling economy & barely staying open. Etc, etc, etc. She was just a little pushy & rude  maybe when I talked to her in June she just meant we'd be able to use the original purchase amount but not the discount after the expiration, but that was NOT clear to me at all. She really could have been much nicer about it. On the dancers:Not exactly professional dancers like I imagined. These women were all students (though many who'd been studying for ,  years) of this one teacher, likely doing this as a side hobby outside of their full time jobs. While I give them (many of them much older!) TOTAL props for being confident & sexy at any age & having beautiful hand made dresses, it was kind of like watching a recital. We stayed for about  dancers, had eaten our fill, So, I am clearly not not going to this restaurant. It was definitely weird. We left before the belly dancing show that looked like it might have been good. We ate at the buffet. I was clearly let down and the options were limited and not worth the advertised price. There were some items posted that were not available to be ordered even though we were told they would be. Seating was very limited. :(  November, Friday:Low and behold the day I decide on the whim of a moment's notice to drive all the way out to the Outer Richmond for takeout. The anger I feel at the loss of my appetite has been exceeded only by my grief. The Kushari was completely bland and inedible, three different kinds of starches: lentils, pasta, rice. a few caramelized onions and a side of hot sauce for  bucks! What a jip. I am in mourning. My friends and I  have always enjoyed the food, atmosphere and decor at this  restaurant.  We'd had the buffet dinners many times but this was one occasion we decided to go on a Saturday night and order straight from the menu.    Well, it was a absolute feast of Egyptian style food that you simply cannot get at any other restaurant in S. F. !  Rack of lamb seasoned in garlic and butter was perfection; salads and huge appetizer sampler platter we shared was scrumptious.   Even the falafel was special, nice and fluffy inside and seasoned just right.  There are also lots of seafood and vegetarian choices as well and Chef Sausan prepares every single one with the same attention to detail and presentation.   The waitstaff was friendly and attentive and the Egyptian murals, chairs and statues add a charming accent to dining room as do the belly dancers who are skilled and elegant performers.  Do yourself a favor and go and have a feast fit for a Pharoah! Constructive criticism: The belly dancer was legit. But since everyone else has written that in their reviews. . . . enough said. The food was whatever. The rice was good, and it was in the shape of a pyramid. I can make good rice and put it in a pyramid shape at home. However, the chicken was cooked perfectly. I can definitely not do that at home. The reason this scored two stars was. . . . . . dun, dun, DUN: The service. All we wanted was some wine. That's it! It was a Friday night, and I had just rushed to this double date after work. SOME ALCOHOL, please. We ordered a bottle, and the server forgot. We waited something like thirty minutes to remind her. Our bad, yeah, but c'mon. It's a Friday night. It's not crowded. Get a girl some drank. So I have to start by saying that visiting Al Masri was kind of an odd experience.  Not bad, just not typical of my dining experiences in San Francisco.  For one thing, the place was nearly deserted on a Saturday night, which is atypical.  We were worried that they were going to give away our table because we arrived super late due to traffic.  But most of the tables were free when we got there. We were seated right away, and the waitress explained the specials.  The mint tea they use for the iced tea is great!  We started with the hummus and the fried eggplant salad.  The eggplant salad was to die for and I will be back just to get more of that.  The hummus was just okay, I thought.  I like it a little smoother in consistency.  They serve it with fried pita, which is okay, I guess, but a little greasy.  One of the pieces they gave us was badly burnt, but once we pointed it out, they brought us some new pieces.  It still shouldn't have left the kitchen, though. For mains, I ordered the cilantro chicken and BF got the tomato garlic chicken. The cilantro chicken was pretty good, if you like cilantro.  I would have liked some extra texture on the skin, but it was well cooked, and fell off the bone.  It was served with rice pilaf that was a little overcooked, but had a good flavor, and a tomato based okra dish that wasn't anything special.  BF liked his dish, but I thought it was a little bland.  For dessert, they only had baklava, so we passed.  I like baklava, but can get that almost anywhere. We received very attentive service, but at another table, they never received their starters, which is a little strange.  I really like the music and the cheesy Egyptian decor; you really do feel like you've gotten away to the Middle East.  The dancers are talented, if a little past their prime.  The highlight of the night was the overall atmosphere and the fried eggplant salad, which was really remarkable.  If not for that salad and the fun experience, I probably would not go back. My husband treated me to a dinner at Al Masri through an offer he saw on Groupon.  We had previously strolled past this restaurant in the past during the day and had made a promise that we would eventually have dinner there. I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into Al Masri.  It was warmly lit and gave the feeling of a little nightclub in Cairo.  Although a few people have referred to them as kitsch, I really loved the little gold statuettes of goddesses, figurines of Horus and Set, papyrus scrolls on the walls, replica chairs found in King Tut's tomb, the street sign for Mohammed Ali Street, which is an entertainment district in Cairo.  Fun.  They appeared to have a full bar, although beer was the only alcohol offered on the menu. Our servers were low key, but had gentle, soft spoken personalities.  Astonishingly, we were the only other couple in the restaurant on a Friday night.  The only reason we could think of was because of how difficult it can be to find parking in the residential neighborhood.  Difficult, but not impossible.  That might be a deterrent. Their menu is relatively small, but nice.  They offer three different dishes, each, of lamb, chicken and fish, respectively.  We ordered the appetizer plate for two, which I thought was so delicious, and it was artfully presented.  I had Cornish game hen stuffed with wheat and currents.  The flavor and moist texture of the chicken was amazing.  My husband had lamb kebabs and really enjoyed them.  Each plate was served with a garnished rice dish formed into the shape of a pyramid, along with a small bowl of okra stew.  All very good. The belly dancer the evening we were at Al Masri was delightful and danced in the authentic, Classic Egyptian style, without veils or finger cymbals.  The music is classic Egyptian, as well.  I could have stayed there all night.  We plan to go again in the future. The price seemed a little expensive.  I imagine it's been tough going for this restaurant, and they need to pay their bills.   Still, it could be a deterrent, even if you use Groupon. Finally, I just wanted to mention that the single star reviewers of this restaurant seem to have an angry personal vendetta toward this establishment and I can't understand why.  It's a good thing I didn't read their reviews on Yelp before going to dinner. I love this place ,, the lamb was cooked really good, overall the food was really good. The service was great. Parking is not the best but overall I would come back I have been an avid yelp reader, but suddenly felt highly encouraged to start writing reviews.  Of course, Al Masri will be one of my first reviews since I had an unforgettable dining experience here. Came here with a party of  sometime back in April .  We had a voucher and were so excited to try a different cuisine.  We were seated immediately when we arrived.  Place was dark, cozy, and calm with a touch of ""Aladdin"" feel.   At that time, the place was half filled.  Hostess/server (same person, and one and only) was nice.  With a big group, we decided to do family style and ordered many dishes: orders of Maza for  (appetizer)Baba Ghannuug (eggplant appetizer)Riasch Mashwiya (rack of lamb)Musa ah (Vegetarian eggplant dish)Samak Mashwi (grilled fish)Long story short, the food took f o r e v e r to come.  Each dish was served one at a time with more than  minutes apart.  When the food came, I literally just had a bite of each dish because I wasn't fond of the taste.  Maybe it was the spice that made the dish so inedible.  Again, this is my first time trying Egyptian food, I wasn't sure what to expect.  On top of the slow service, they had a student belly dancer perform for about  minutes and it wasn't the most fun and entertaining to watch. They stopped all servicing during the performance (which makes sense), BUT our dinner was   hours long  I felt miserable. . . . and drained. Long Review :  I hate to give bad reviews, and I guess these people are trying but wow! I bought a groupon for this place without reading the reviews first. My husband visited on a Saturday. The servers wear mu mus that look like they decorated them themselves with glitter paint pens. Its like they are wearing faded nightgowns. It is weird.  And the decor is nightmarishly tacky. Its like every cheap Egyptian cliche was born in their dining room. They were friendly enough, but not good at their jobs. Like everyone has said. . . It takes FOREVER to get anything. We waited  minutes for bottled beers. The eggplant dip appetizer was actually really good. Everything else was over seasoned, and saturated in oil. I'm no skinny minnie who won't eat any fat. I love butter and oil, but this was so much that it turned my stomach almost immediately. My husband and I stayed positive as the belly dancer was sweet and the servers seemed like they were trying. By the end we were even chatting with everyone. Then the server brings the check and asks us to tip on the full bill and not the groupon amount. . . . . Obviously I was going to do that, but as a long time server I cannot stomach someone telling me what to tip them. . . especially when the service was awful. Rude! Short Review: My husband and I still laugh about how this was the worst restaurant we have ever been to, and we have both lived in third world countries. . . Quaint little restaurant with a cozy feel to it. The food was OK, the service was good, and the dancing were entertaining although the dancers were most likely students of the dance rather than accomplished.  Only in San Francisco will you see a belly dancer with bight dyed pink/red hair with black highlights!!The staff was very friendly and attentive.  Prices were about average. This is a nice place to eat, relax, and enjoy the entertainment. This place is a JOKE!  I really hate writing bad reviews. . . but this place honestly deserves one. Came here for my Aunt's th Birthday and thought we would have a night of celebration, laughter, good food, entertainment and memories.  We did make memories. . . ones that we  would like to not remember.  The ambiance of the place was nice, and the Egyptian decor added a nice touch to the theme. . but that was probably the only thing likable. We had a party of  so most of our party sat at a long table, while a couple of us sat at a neighboring one next to the main table.  Immediately after being seated we were given pita and hummus for appetizers. They actually didn't give us enough for our entire party, and getting some more just seemed to take forever. Our party opted for their $ dinner which included the appetizer, our buffet dinner, entertainment and dessert. Dinner was supposed to be served up at pm, but it was a little late. . . and totally not worth waiting for.  When dinner was finally served, only about half the restaurant was able get their food while the rest waited for the buffet to be refilled.  My cousin, who had originally set up the reservation did some research, checked the menu online and even confirmed with one of the ladies that worked at the restaurant that we would have a pretty vast array of foods to choose from.  If you take a look at their menu, they have so many dishes that sound wonderful. . . so why were we ONLY served, Chicken, rice, salad and fish for the buffet?   items!  A four item buffet. . . is that even a buffet? unheard of.  I know we should have taken one look at the buffet and made a U turn to leave. . . but after waiting for what seemed an hour to eat, the party was starving and we knew it would be difficult to get a reservation elsewhere for a party as big as ours.  Next was the entertainment.  Entertaining is the wrong word to describe what we witnessed.  I would post pix up of our belly dancers, but that would just be mean.  I don't even have the heart to describe what they considered entertainment.  I'll just put it this way. . . it was almost impossible to keep the meager buffet dinner down.  When you hear belly dancers, you imagine (Google images  'belly dancers'). What we saw was more of a freak show.  More than watching our entertainment for the night, I found the expressions held on other customers' faces a lot more amusing. The party wasn't thrilled with the food or the entertainment and decided to hit the road before the show was even over. I felt bad that my aunt had hopes to have an enjoyable th birthday, but instead brought in the year at this place. I say, save your $ + tip & tax and go elsewhere. . . ANYWHERE but here. I also must add, this place needs some pest control. The abundance of insects and moths flying around the entrance is a hazard. Cute little place.  Nice service.   It was a birthday celebration with  in our party.  Only one person was happy with their food (lamb kabobs).  The rest of the party were disappointed .  We were there on a night where it was amateur night for the belly dancer and she truly was an amateur.  Unfortunately, that was not the place or day to have a celebration.  Probably a fun place to hang out but just not for a special occasion.  Sorry. This is one of those times that different aspects of the experience were pretty much polar opposites. Everything took FOREVER. We weren't served bread and za'atar for over  minutes, until I'd asked twice for it. There were two women serving the dining room, only one of whom actually took orders. However, they were absent altogether from the room for lengthy periods (and the music had gone off, too), and many of the diners seemed to be a bit confused/annoyed. The food, however, was delicious especially the baked salmon with raisins, almonds and caramelized onions. Then again, paying our check took FOREVER. If you're super patient and want good Egyptian food, go here. Took some out of town visiting family here for some fun. While the atmosphere is fun, their service has a LOT to be desired.  The woman that sat us was gruff and very impolite, sort of throwing the menus at us. Then when it came time to order, a very ditzy woman came out to talk to us about the menu.  We had to ask her to come back  times before she actually came back and took the order for appetizers then another  times to get her to come back and take our dinner order.  The appetizers had arrived and were eaten before we had our dinner order taken.  Then once we got dinner, the food was just OK overall.  Getting and paying the check was just as much of a hassle as getting the orders taken.  Not much more to say than the staff needs to actually pay attention to their tables, their own manners and think through how a table of people would typically like to eat. Had the pleasure of accompaning my wife to this restaurant, where she was one of the performers, she is a belly dancer, and had their excellent buffett, There was so many things, including fish, chicken (several kinds) salad of fresh vegetables with what appear to be a light olive oil vinagrette, vegetable dishes with eggplant. Everything was great, and for being a specialty restaurant in San Francisco, the price wass also very decent. I recommend this place. Oh, I almost forgot, try the hot chili sauce, good stuff. And the service was great, including the house dancer, she made it fun."
Daffodil|3.0|Asian Fusion in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|50|-1|2.0| I was a little disappointed to say the least. I made reservations at Daffodil for these reasons: . They are located in Union Sq . my friends from Australia were staying nearby . It had deceptively good reviews on Open Table . It was a , pt reservation on Open Table. My biggest compaint is the whole time we were there, not one other table was sat (there may have been one woman eating at the bar, and a few people who looked like guests from the hotel stopped by for drinks). Also, the decor is nice and upscale looking, but the lights were so bright, there was no ambiance at all. The food was a little on the pricey side, but t was good. American choices with a fancy twist. Anyways, I was embarrassed to have taken my Austrailian tourist friends here, because they expected me to know some cool places in SF and trust me, this did not look cool. I have learned my lesson: check Yelp reviews before Open Table. I guess the only good thing that comes of this is my  pt reservation.
L’Olivier French Restaurant|3.5|French in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|105|-1|3.44117647059|" On top of the food being complete rubbish, what's up with all the Russians and Ukrainans taking over the place? Went there for dinner, and not being Russian or Ukranian, these other customers were so rude. It was like how dare I get in the way of their walking path? Have told all my foodie friends never to come here. . . and they haven't. I had my birthday party at Restaurant last night. Many thanks to Zina and staff for making it so special. We had a separate room with the fireplace. Very cosyThe food: lots of food, yummy and beautiful presentation. The birthday cake presentation was very special and nicely done on the dance floor, followed by  a song and dance. The chocolate muss cake was amazingThe staff: The staff was extremely nice, friendly and accommodative. They even offered help with unloading and loading the car. All leftovers nicely packed and bagged to be taken homeLife music and dance floor: such a rear treat. The music was just little too loud, but all my friends and family enjoyed dancing and listening to all the singers. Zina, thank you very much for making my birthday so special Thank you L'Olivier Restaurant, its management and the team!You have done an absolutely fantastic job at our Gurnick Academy th Year Anniversary Ceremony! Not only was the food delicious (nothing was left on the To Go Table, as most, if not all guests asked for ""To GO"" boxes) the presentations (yes, in plural) of the food in all areas of the hall was just spectacular. Your team was elegant, professional and punctual. The Cocktail Hour Reception with Cured Salmon Carving Station with assorted French bread and butter along with the Shawerma Table and the various gourmet finger food assortments, along with the unbelievably beautiful Champagne Fountain with berries of all sorts was just phenomenal. Guests came up to our event planner more than multiple times and asked about your mushroom risotto and the locations of your restaurant. We wanted to thank you, as our event wouldn't be the success it was without your professional and epicurean involvement!We will soon post pictures of the event to showcase as images will tell even more! What a disappointmentI've worked in San Francisco for almost  years now, and so far my restaurant experience has been primarily Asian cuisines, Italian, and Seafood.  I was very excited to finally explore what appeared to be an upscale French restaurant in the Financial district for a business lunch.   All my prior experience with French restaurants have been either in Manhattan or in Paris, so it's possibly my standards are too high. This place was a joke, and looking back I can see why the establishment had % of their tables open during the lunch hour. Decor:  Not remotely French. The decor was nice, but it reminded me of the sort of ambience you'd find in the large restaurant of a Catskills resort. In the s. Food:I had the prix fixe menu ( which the waiter mispronounced) so options were limited but I ordered the cream of broccoli soup and Mahi Mahi. The soup was lukewarm and complete free from any hint of taste or flavor. The Mahi Mahi was sorely disappointing.  Such a fish should be served seared for one thing, but this steak was sauteed in butter to the point of tasting like chicken, and the outer layer of the fish was nearly rubbery from the excessive butter + overcooking. I will never ever go here again and I would be shocked if they stay in business. I visit San Francisco few times a year for business, and this time I decided to try European food. I stopped for early lunch at this restaurant. There were few people at that time. I ordered famous French Onion soup. It was marvelous! Then I have New York Steak. It was too large for me, so I decided to get half of the dish to go. All in all, it was a good experience. I highly suggest L'Olivier to everyone! We were here celebrating Uncle Gregory's th birthday last Friday evening.  We had a private room right off the left hand side after the main entrance. The room was very spacious.  One side was the long dinner table which sat approximately  people.  The other was used for the dance floor.  We had live entertainment.  The food was traditional Russian style cuisine that we ordered.  Plenty of food for us and tons of left overs to take home for a second round.  I really enjoyed the Braised Rack of Lamb.  Excellent services and friendly staff. The decor was well design and it felt like you were in Italy. Very romantic. There is no parking lot, so you will need to park on the street (if you can find a space) or what I did was park a few blocks away at a parking lot for $ flat fee after : pm. Quite possibly the worst food I have ever paid money for. Came here on Christmas due to someone's advice that their holiday menu is good.  I believe that must have been a joke or extreme sarcasm as their food was barely edible. First they did not have the steak. . First course was a soup that they referred to it as a bisque.  I compare it to a canned soup mixed with  pint of heavy cream that was served lukewarm. . I had a pate and prosciutto.  That came with a side ""salad"" that was a bunch of dry pre packed vegetables from a bag.  No dressing, nothing.  The pate and prosciutto was inferior to what I get from a supermarket.  Gf had a smoked salmon dish.  It smelled bad and was clearly not fresh.  I am not sure where they got it from but it had been clearly stored for a long time before serving. .  ""Main"" course, I had a rack of lamb because their original dish was also gone.  I forget what it was.  The lamb was actually solid, unfortunately it was garnished with some steamed veggies that were bland and pretty close to disgusting. GF had a sole or something because the steak was sold out or something.  It was extremely greasy but at least tasted okay.  Interestingly it came served w/ the same nasty steamed vegetables.  I guess they just throw shlop of it on every dish. .  Dessert was some random sweets that looked and tasted like supermarket dollar bin specials.  I dont even remember what it was.  Took one bite and had enough of this place. Besides the horrible food, all their dishes have scratches and are faded.  They gave me a plastic handle knife to cut my lamb.  Their silverware was old and faded and looked utterly cheap.  Im not one to complain about this kind of thing but when I'm paying $+ a head after tax and tip. . . i dont really expect to be getting Walmart silverware. I honestly can say I never had such a horrible experience.  I prefer to go to Jack In a Box.  It is tastier than this place. We were here  weeks ago for family event super happy with their services and their amazing menu. Everything was fresh and well design. They just had remodeling done looks pretty cool. . . . Love it ! To be honest we came here solely because it was open on Christmas day. It has been our custom to go into SF for an early dinner and then just wander around but this year our usual restaurant was not open so we searched and found L'Olivier. For the day they offered a prix fixe four course menu for $ plus an % gratuity and the inevitable tax. Our first question was whether we could eat four courses. We started out with roast pumpkin bisque, the only soup offered and it was the weakest link. It was not bad just not at all memorable. For an appetizer I had the salmon trio, salmon, cured (smoked?) salmon and salmon roe. It was a generous portion and very tasty. Judit had the terrine of duck pate and prosciutto. She enjoyed it though I thought the pate to be a bit bland. For an entree I chose the baked sea bass over  ratatouille and potatoes fondant. Delicious. Judit had lamb wellington and liked it well. Judit had the poached pear for dessert and I wish  did too. Delicious and light and a perfect complement to the food. My traditional yule log was ok but not terrific. Before we arrived I assumed that I would suffer some sticker shock when I saw the wine list but all  wines by the glass. for that night anyway, were $. We had to choose blind as neither of us knew any of them and we were not disappointed. Service was good. Overall  better than I expected and a solid four stars. I love the special and comfortable ambiance of this perfectly sized restaurant for a quiet nice out. Pretty and comforting, not pompous.   It's location on a dead street, next to safeway in the embarcadero center, sets the stage for an intimate dinner.  The duck and side dishes were extraordinary.  I had the seafood and though it was cooked to perfection, the bollabaise broth was too fishy and salty.  I pick French restaurants based on whether they have the bullobaise on the menu. . Comfy place. Don't understand why not always busy. I went here for dinner with two of girlfriends. We greeted at the door by the hostess and sat in the main room next to the window. It was decorated very elegant and a lively environment. We ordered the onion soup with bread. We ordered the NY steak, my friend  chicken and the seafood plate. The food was magnificent. We also ordered the chocolate mousse. The food and dessert were amazing and I can't wait to go back. Great food and great service.  I highly recommend this place to enjoy! :) I decided on this place for my birthday dinner. I thought it would be fun to dance to live music. I have been here before and the food was very very average. However, this time I was so impressed. Apparently they hired a new chef. We Ordered al a cart off the menu and each dish was perfect. I had such a great time, really didn't want to leave after spending .  hours in there. I will definitely be back On the evening of //, I had a light dinner at L'Oliver. Within about three hours, I suspected that I had food poisoning. By the time I reached home, it was a severe case of food poisoning. I attribute it to the French Onion Soup which had a heavy layer of cheese although it could also come from the handling. After seeing the doctor, I contacted the manager Tatiana, who seemed less than interested. This was really a disappointment as I have had dinners in this restaurant for more than twenty years. Because of her lack of  concern, I later was able to contact Leo Fudym, owner. He also demonstrated a lack of concern and stated that nine other people had French Onion Soup that night and that no one else had become ill. It seemed unreal for him to know exactly how many people had soup that evening after I told him the date. This restaurant changed ownership a couple or so years ago; since then, the food and the service have been in decline. This is my first statement on Yelp and is based on a highly unsatisfactory response from the owner and manager. I had my wedding at L'Olivier recently and am very happy that i chose this restaurant for my wedding reception. The food was great, there was so much to eat and everything was very tasty. Zina was very helpful and really made this day special for us. I would highly recommend L'olivier to anyone who is looking for a venue for their reception or big birthday party. A friend of ours recommended L'Olivier for our get together with longtime friends. We have never been there and were really impressed how good the food and wine selection was. The waiter recommended a french wine to us for only $ per bottle. It was one of the best red wines I ever had. The food and service was outstanding too. It was also not so noisy, so we could talk to each other. We will definitely go back on our next visit. I had a big party for my mother's birthday at this restaurant. Amazing food, attentive staff, great music and very positive atmosphere. It is French/European, food is always fresh and tastes great. I would typically come in for lunch and enjoy the French menu, and sometimes I go in for the big Russian parties. Very fun on the weekends with live music and dancing! Recc! I had never heard of L'Olivier and was introduced when I came to the restaurant for a work lunch with a large group. Our group was seated in a cute separate room with a long banquet table to which you could still see inside the main part of the restaurant. I opted for the prix fixe menu which was a pretty good deal. I ordered: Appetizer: I can't recall the name of the dish but it had polenta and goat cheese. It was good but I thought it could have had more different textures.  Entree  Cassoulet De Toulouse: This dish was hearty with the beans and meat but very flavorful.  Dessert  Creme Brulee: A very thin creme brulee but it was perfectly sweet. Overall, food was good, service was courteous, and my water glass was always full. I write very few  star reviews. I always hope my experience was just unusually bad. This place is off the scale awful  the noise level is ear bleeding and the food is rubber chicken quality. Never again. I came here for a Russian Jewish wedding on a Saturday night. By their name, I thought it would be French food, but they handled the Russian food very well! It is a small restaurant with eclectic decor and they were closed to the public for this intimate affair. When we walked in, the main dining room had about  tables and a good sized dance floor. Tall centerpieces and white tablecloths graced the tables which were laden with cold appetizers. The band was setting up on the stage. The guests, however, were shepherded into a smaller dining room on the left for cocktail hour. We enjoyed hors d'oeuvres and drinks. After cocktail hour, we moved into the main dining room and settled down. The menu had about  cold appetizers and a schedule of hot appetizers coming out, then main entrees, and cake over the course of three hours. Cake wasn't coming til pm! Whoa. We tried to be nice to our friends getting married and telling the waiter not to bother opening up the  bottles of liquor and wine on our table as we would not be drinking all of it and his was response was, ""It's a Russian wedding. It will all get drunk. "" Apparently, for a Russian wedding there is food, introductions, dancing, more food, more dancing, more food, shots, more dancing, more food, more dancing, and then cake. I was so tired by the end since I'd flown in that day and was avoiding alcohol so I wouldn't totally crash. It was a lovely reception, the wait staff was very professional, and the Russian food was solid. My husband and I showed up for our reservation and waited for several minutes to be seated. While waiting we realized that the restaurant was hosting a reception party and we were the only other guests in the restaurant. It felt very strange and we felt like we were intruding. No one came to seat us so we left. My husband planned a special night for me and we ended up having to find a new place to dine, which did not turn out so well. I wish L'Olivier would have let us know a reception would be there that night. Came here tonight with my wife for a romantic relaxing dinner. Our server Gabriel did an AMAZING job, very personable, funny, and had great recommendations. The porcini crusted sweet breads were amazing, as well as the scallop risotto with lobster sauce! Good food, great price, amazing service! Tough to rate this place.  We went there for the first time last Saturday night.  Food was really good;  ambiance was horrible.  Food:  baked brie and potato pancake salad, scallop risotto, duck breast, tart tartan, and some other cream filled pastry.  The desserts were actually a bit of a disappointment. . . you go to a French restaurant and you expect really delicious desserts.  These were good, but not blow your socks off good.  However, the other food was quite yummy. . . . the risotto was awesome. Service was good, no complaints there. Cocktails were very strong and generous. Price was very reasonable. But the decor. . . . . oh my. . . . it was poorly decorated back in the 's and has not gotten better with age.  It is just completely out of date and cheesy.  A wire Eiffel tower with sparkling mini lights like from a Christmas tree. . . . really? Fake ivy. . . . ?  Ugh.   I think this is what is killing this place. . . . if they redecorated and brought the place up to current standards, they'd do much better by attracting a younger crowd (and more people in general). If you want a good meal and are ok with a not so cool vibe, you should try this place out.  You'll likely be happy with the food.  But honestly, with so many other restaurants in SF to go to, I don't think we'll be back. . . . just don't want to immerse ourselves in crappy, 's, Hobby Lobby  inspired, ""French"" decor. Came here on Valentine's day, the quality of food was bad, my boyfriend ordered the steak was so hard, wasn't over cook, was the meat. I was very disappointed. The staff did their job to makeup this unfortunate by offering an option for my boyfriend to reorder another entry. The decor is a bit strange and the place was somewhat empty but my husband and I enjoyed our dinner here.  It's kind fun (at least for us) to eat somewhere kitschy and unusual, and the place and crowd are definitely that.  But the food was really good  escargot and baked Brie salad for the apps, then beef cheeks and cassoulet for our entrees. All were delicious.  Tarte tatin for dessert was also very tasty.  The service was very attentive and friendly  and I really appreciated how they split our apps onto two plates (one for each of us).  The wines were very reasonable too.  Oh and they gave us each a complimentary glass of port with dessert  nice touch.  Overall, I'd recommend it for a quirky but yummy dinner. Updating a star from my last visit.  Forget overpriced, snobby Michelin rated Fleur de lis.  Tonight I had awesome escargot (much better than my last visit) and a scallop risotto in lobster cream sauce that was to die for. . . . simply amazing flavor.  The staff was very attentive and friendly.  I was very pleased with the overall experience and will definitely be back again soon! . . Friday.  Large party.  Holiday party season.  OpenTable came through with a reservation for six people at L'Olivier. I dragged down the median age to about half.  Every other patron looks like they were finishing up an early bird special (not sure why, their prix fixe menu goes all night).  But I digress. I had the escargot and the steak tartare to go with a glass of bubbly, white, and red.  Nothing was memorable, but nothing was bad. Not a place I'd go to again, but glad they fit us in last minute. I used to come here often many year ago because I lived close by. The food is very average and I would not recommend this place unless it is convenient to you. It is in need of a remodel. Not a bad choice, but nothing special. Sometimes they decorate the restaurant in interesting ways, but they should pay more attention to the food, I think. It would be a fun place for a party, and the staff is nice. We had a party of  and the food was amazing.  They have a very nice back room, quiet, service was excellent, Gabrielle and crew we really appreciate it.  Nicolas  is the new chef and he is truly an artist.  we will definitely be back, probably with the husband next. Apparently he comes from Bistro Cental Parc, you can tell. I hired Zina and her wonderful hard working team at L'Olivier to cater our wedding. What a great decision that was! The food was exactly as discussed except for it was even more beautiful looking in person. Zina had carved animals into watermelon, placed orchids on the sides of all the platters, and added her special touches to everything to make it even more gorgeous! Our guests were in awe with the decor! I wish I had gotten a chance to actually eat at my wedding, but that is almost impossible for a bride. What I can say is that I enjoyed wedding leftovers for  days in a row and loved every morsel! Thank you Zina for all your hard work and I will definitely be recommending you to future brides! We were seated at :. We had the  course fixed menu. There were two of us.  The entire meal took over two hours.  The food was definitely not worth the wait. We started with the wilted salad which consisted of a few thinly sliced apples and two small pieces of goat cheese and the avocado salad which consisted of a blob of day old or week old shrimp rolled in thousand island dressing and more wilted leaves. Our entrees were salmon smothered in bbq sauce and chicken doused with some caramelized sauce on a bed of potatoes.  Dessert was a piece of chewy chocolate mousse cake and flavorless hazelnut mousse.  A definite no on returning. Good and very reasonable pricesHad the rack of lamb, excellentLove the escargot & the onion soupGood serviceWe had  people in our party and they did a great jobNever got a dish wrongAnd we switched seats on them when we played a gameWill definitely be backWant to bring my mom & my sisterThey both love French food Recently came here for a birthday celebration. Since our party had about  people, we were seated in a private room. There was another party going on at the same time and it took up the entire main room. I noticed two full smaller rooms near the front entrance as well. We had our party in the side room, which was perfect because the room blocked out the music that was coming from the other party. The only downside was that the room got extremely hot and we ended up opening the exit door in the room. I also guess there's a storage room entrance through the side room, so random staff would be walking in and out of the room. We had mini quiche and stuffed mushrooms as well as a fruit/vegetable platter. The ordering process was easy and quick. Since we had a huge party, there was a set menu with few choices. They were very accommodating to a few of my cousins that had a specific diet. The staff that was in charge of our party was very attentive and nice. I ordered the baked brie in phyllo dough as a starter. I actually really enjoyed this dish. I'm one of those weird people that actually likes the rind of the brie, so I didn't mind it. If you hate the taste of rind, i suggest not ordering this dish. It was baked to perfection and the phyllo was nicely crisp. I ordered the tournedos of filet mingon. I ordered it rare mostly because i KNOW that with huge parties, often times the meat is precooked and heated again. It didn't really matter if this was the case or not, because the meat was more towards the medium side. The meat was so dry, I was using all of the sauce to help. The truffles actually tasted great as did the scalloped potatoes and the vegetables. As for dessert, you'd be safe with either the soufflé or the crème brûlée. Both were delicious. The bathroom is near the far wall, and it was a bit awkward walking through another party to get to the bathroom, but no one really seemed to care. The bathrooms are a bit claustrophobic as well. I mean the stall is barely big enough for you. But, it's nice and clean and that's all that really matters. I recently came to L'Olivier for a birthday dinner, and I have to say. . . . it's fantastic!The service was great and attentive. The food was delicious, and the atmosphere was nice as well. As a vegan, I truly appreciated how accommodating the staff was. They prepared a vegan meal for me, so that I wouldn't have to just watch everyone enjoy their food. I had a green salad for my starter. It was a green salad. . . . I can't really say anything else about it. The dressing was a bit salty, but that wasn't a huge deal. Then, for my entree, I had a salad with grilled veggies. It was way beyond what I was expecting! It was delectable, and after finishing it, my stomach didn't feel heavy at all. Finally, for desert, I had some fresh strawberries. Yum! I have to admit, I was looking at everybody else's soufflés and brûlées. . . they looked so darn good!Overall, great experience.  would recommend this establishment for special occasions."
St. Regis Hotel Lobby Bar|4.0|Bars in San Francisco, CA|Pricey|113|-1|4.24242424242|" a glass of champagne and that fireplace. my happy place. even happier if someone else is picking up the tab ;) It's kind of weird to describe the St. Regis Hotel Lobby Bar as my ""neighborhood bar"" but that's basically what it is: it's right next door to my place, it's super chill most of the time and all of my friends enjoy going there for drinks. This section of SoMa does not want for bars so the St. Regis is not a clear first choice.  Novela, Local Edition and the W are close by for those you who want hip bars with sexy people, dive bars like Dave's and many others like it are there for those of you who want the cheapest possible prices for you libations, and there are plenty of other clubs and restaurants nearby that offer experiences that are livelier than what you're going to get at the St. Regis. However, what you *are* going to enjoy is a comfy, tasteful and very low key atmosphere with a great selection of drinks.  If you just want to hang out with your friends and talk for hours, this is a great place to end up.  I have never had a problem sitting down here with no notice and wrangling enough chairs and room on sofas for eight+ people.  And, if anyone is hungry, they offer food service from the Michelin Star rated Ame (located on the other side of the wall) until fairly late in the evening. What's not to like?  If you're looking for a more happening atmosphere, you probably want another bar  sometimes it's full in here but on most nights it's a few stragglers here and there from the hotel.  Also, the drinks and food are pricey so if you're looking for $ Bloody Marys you probably want to keep walking one block north to Dave's. Calling the St. Regis Lobby Bar my neighborhood go to spot for imbibing adult beverages sounds pretty pretentious, no? But it's just a matter of geography. My experiences there have been crazy reliable. . . as in, the St. Reg always delivers exactly what I want  a relaxed atmosphere with comfy, copious seating; a diverse selection of drink, wine, and beer; and fantastic food. Recently, I came here with a group of my friends for some belated birthday drinks. I was able to enjoy two of my favorite things: craft beer and cake. So Baked Alaska doesn't actually qualify as cake, but how many places can you find this elusive dessert? And definitely get the pork buns; they're money. On a Saturday night, the bar is typically quiet making it a wonderful spot to punctuate the end of a date with a nightcap or conversely, it's a space capable of accommodating a largish group in a pinch. Cheers! I love coming here to lounge, decompress, rejuvenate, and to entertain my out of town guests.  I just realized that I haven't yelp about it.  It's about time!Well, yesterday I came here to relax in a hot Sunday afternoon.  The service was EXCELLENT!  My waitress was warm, personal, attentive, professional and helpful.  I ordered a pot of hot jasmine green tea.  Loose tea, very good quality!I was looking for something light and savory to pair with my tea, but was unable to pick one from their bar menu.  I asked my waitress if they serve charcuterie.  She kindly replied no but somehow knew I was looking for something light.  She recommended tempura poke, ahi tuna wrapped in seaweed and lightly fried.  I took her recommendation and was very happy with it!  I ordered another one.  I thought it's fried it would heavy but no, it was light and refreshing!  Perfect for a hot day, paired well with my tea as well as the coconut mojito I later ordered.  I asked my waitress to ask the bartender to make my mojito as little sweet as possible.  She suggested that they remove the brown sugar and was motivated to help custom made the coconut mojito the way I prefer as possible.  That was nice!Overall, it was an excellent,  star experience at St. Regis lobby bar again.  I would definitely come back again. Love this place, great people watching, great cocktails, very nice service. So sad Vanessa has left, she was our favorite server. I never write enough, but it's a wonderful place for well made cocktails, good bar snacks and wonderful people watching! We enjoyed a Hirotini and a Golden Age before dinner and really enjoyed them Stopped in for a nightcap after a concert while we were staying here. The bar was empty on a Saturday night at am. I understand because there are a lot of great options in San Francisco and a hotel bar, though a really really nice hotel bar, just doesn't make the cut. The drink menu is interesting and well curated. The bartender who served us was super nice and fun to talk to. He was engaging enough but didn't talk our ear off. I can't remember what I had but it was something in a wine glass akin to a manhattan and I really enjoyed it. Love to go here for a mojito or classic martini and the tuna poke appetizer.  The cocktails are impeccable and this is a nice, quiet refuge to have a lovely libation and do some low key people watching. Would not mind a bit more variety on the bar menu or to see it change up a bit more often, but seriously no complaints, the classics are delicious! Steve the bar tender was awesome and filled our wait for AME's reservation with good conversation. I had the drink with the pepper so good! Such a cute but classy place to grab a drink. Was having dinner at Ame last Wednesday as an early Father's Day celebration and had some time to kill before my reservation. Grabbed a seat on the couch in front of the fireplace. Our waitress was on it and quickly got us a menu and snacks. The complimentary snacks were an Asian snack mix. We got a glass of Schramsberg blanc de blancs north coast  ($) and a Jack daniels and diet coke ($). You are at the St Regis so the drinks aren't cheap. But it is a nice place to have a drink or two while enjoying the ambiance and some good conversation with your drinkmate! Posh, polished and totally swank. Channelling that very British vibe, this most definitely is a St Regis! Attentive service, great snacks, awesome eats and well made drinks. All this and wrapped up into a very cool, sophisticated vibe from the many patrons! Looking for an after work cocktail or a liquid libation in a hotel lobby that is probably better then the one you may be staying in. . . make this your go to place in the Arts District. Chin Chin! One of my favorite ""local"" bars. I know it's a hotel bar but I can always find a seat, the wait staff is always fast and friendly. . . and the pours are quite generous. They provide little snacks  wasabi peas and some other crunchy Asian mix item (I don't know what it is)  but it's always nice to have some bar snacks during happy hour. As you can imagine, drinks are not cheap  glasses of wine are $ $  but it's worth it for the top notch service and comfortable surroundings. They have great seating and lots of it. ""The Ruby"" is my favorite! Bar is really nice, delicious drinks and good service. I especially love their complimentary bar snacks! The Regis Bar is a very classy place and you will not find any hipster crowds here.  This is a very upscale lounge with sophisticatedly dressed people drinking their favorite embellishments.  The drinks are pricey and well made, but thats what you would expect for drinking at the St Regis. Needed a place to chill for a couple hours after the convention ended and before our dinner reservation, and the St. Regis is a close walk away from the Moscone Center. Our server was friendly and attentive and the place is cozy enough, but my god, $ for an Echigo beer?? $ for sparkling water? Oh wait, it's a hotel bar. Ok ok, I'm back to reality. I would probably stop by here again if in the area if I needed to conduct business, but if it's just me or I'm with family, I'd probably go somewhere more reasonable. Walked down after lunch from the ""W' Hotel.  The lounge is really pretty , old Hollywood Glamor .  The service fast and Friendly.  They had sound of Jazz as the background music, which made the atmosphere upbeat.  I had the I had the Visper Martini with Lillet, the James Bond recipe, it was really good with a different taste , all i needed was one.  My friend had the Chardonnay and was pleased. Not to loud but had some noise, so you didn't feel like you were in a dead space.   I will definitely go back with friends from out of town if I am downtown. Once MOMA opens back up that would be a great place to go. Classic, unpretentious but sophisticated, high energy lobby lounge with skilled old school bartenders who can make any drink without problem.  This place is so great, and reliable, it feels like a warm blanket.  All the barkeeps are great, and it's a place I return again and again. Working in the hospitality field, I am very particular about hotel bars. This one is deserving of the St. Regis name. Perfect service, comfortable yet upscale, and welcoming atmosphere. The cocktails? Will light you on fire. Yum! I highly recommend taking out of town guests, having an early evening meeting, or for a romantic pre dinner drink. You cannot go wrong with a drink here. *drinks only review*Pretty damn good spot for classing it up for some drinks! We went here with some team members for pre holiday party drinks on a Saturday evening and this is really a great spot. Drinks are pricey (as to be expected) but generally well made. Service was really good at the start but fell off a bit towards the end of our ~ hours there. Waitresses vanished for a while and it took an inordinate amount of time to get orders in and to get orders delivered  I'm talking people who showed up had to wait  minutes to place an order. They have quite the whiskey selection and bartenders make a mean cocktail. Definitely try the Vesper Royale (~$) if you're a fan of a VERY boozy drink. If there's a drink to avoid, it's the Elderflower Fizz (I think that's the name). Sounds good in theory but the soda water really waters down the taste. Would have been great had they left the soda water out and kept it with only the sparkling wine as the baseAnd a bonus if you're a points whore like me: since this is in a Starwood hotel you can earn Starwood points for your spend (which will most likely add up quick)! Just give the staff your SPG number or hang onto the receipt and submit it after the fact. I'll certainly be back when looking for a change of pace from the usual bars around the office Nice lobby bar in the St. Regis, right on Mission and rd. We came here to chat before going into the adjoining restaurant, Ame. Modern, understated elegance, but typical hotel lobby bar, except perhaps the people seem slightly more refined than your average hotel bar. Or maybe everyone was dressed up for holiday season parties. Not crowded or noisy, but comfortably busy. They do have some drinks they are known for, St. Regis, that is, like their signature Bloody Mary, attributed to them in their New York location back in . If you like Martinis and have a couple of Benjamins burning a whole in your pocket, try their $ Martini. Service was attentive, friendly, but restrained, like the rest of the hotel. I had a Tanqueray and Tonic. My friend had a Sapphire Martini, slightly dirty. Not the $ Gin Martini. Not sure of the prices because my generous friend took care of it. I took care of dinner next door, though. The Lobby Bar is awesome. . . . . . . . . . Modern spot for exclusive drinksQuiet Sophistication atmosphere and Décor is Classy. Excellent drinks but expensive. Without the crazy. Wine and drink selection. Staffs are professional and friendly. Better lounges. While the rooms are very nice, the person who cleaned my room also stole my flat iron.  When I contacted the hotel to have them send to me, they said they didn't find it.  I'm sorry, but stuff doesn't just disappear into thin air!  Be careful no to leave anything behind when you stay at this hotel, as you most likely will never see it again! Nice modern spot for stiff drinks!I came here during the weekend before Halloween and the place was packed with people in their cleopatra, pilot, phantom of the opera costumes. Despite all the seats being taken, I didn't mind standing around scouring for the next open seat as I chatted with my friend. After  minutes, we were able to sit down in oversized chairs and enjoy the wasabi peas and snacks. Their cocktails averaged ~$ and they have one page of selections. Most of the drinks look interesting, i. e. #PumpkinSpiceLatte, Diplomat, and etc. I tried the Diplomat and it was super strong and sweet. Overall a really nice hip bar where you can sit, relax, and chat with friends without feeling cramped and screaming over everyone. The price is a little steep but I would come back for an occasion. p. s. Entrance to the bar is on the alley and there is most definitely no view. However, if you catch SF during an event, you can enjoy some fancy people watching. I've been here a few times but the last one had to be one of the more interesting drinking experiences here. Im sitting at the bar with a friend and this crazy drunk dude saddles up to us and starts a conversation. We'd been chatting with the bartender for a while and how he's coming with new drinks and that one of the spirits' websites had featured his recipes. Next thing I know the drunk guy is all over my friend and Im having a good laugh. He tells us he's going to buy us drinks and whips out the American Express Centurion card. Yes the titanium black card. He buys our drinks and tips the bartender $. He then proceeds to tell us about how his argument with his wife is totally a buzzkill and that he's at the bar to ""beat her downer"". After his last drink, he stumbles around, and one of the staff basically have to lead him back to his room from the elevator. Crazy patrons, good drinks, and good times. Elegant Spot for a Quality Cocktail!Had a crazy day at work?  Or a long day of shopping in the city?  Whether you're a tourist or a local, this is a fantastic spot for a cocktail after a long day, a quickie before a night out, or even a first date. The bar is as sophisticated and elegant as the hotel. Their Asian Inspired menu adds a twist to the classics. And, even if there's a crowd, it's quiet, so you can chat or relax by the fireplace. Ended up here one night when I was reunited with old friends and we really just weren't into all the loud bars in SF on a Saturday night, since all we wanted to do was just sit and catch up all night. It felt a little uncomfortable when we first went in, because first of all we were all very underdressed (I was showing my friends who were visiting from out of town all day. Naturally we were in comfortable clothes), and also because we were much younger than the overall crowd. The drinks were expensive, OF COURSE, but we got settled in the comfortable couches with the YUMMY cocktail (lavender gin fizz!) and bubbles and we started feeling good. We ended up staying there til they closed, and I really couldn't have asked for a more comfortable, chill night. One minus star because of its obvious flaw, the price. But thanks to the price they are able to keep out loud and obnoxious bar crowd, which I really appreciated on that particular night with my old friends. Definitely will be going back when I need another night like that, or for a fancy little night in town. Comfy seating, decent service, and the availability of excellent appetizers (highlight: pork buns) makes this a great spot for an afterwork drink. It's a fairly brightly lit space which means: better for meetings than dates. It can get quite busy, but on a recent Friday happy hour visit we were able to find seating quickly. . . of course all bets are off when a big conference is in town! I have liked this bar since the first time I came to San Francisco likely because it doesn't feel like you are in a small town in this bar. I am questioning now though if its really that great a place to come on such a regular basis, first of it is kind of in the middle of the driveway and lobby, there is no view to speak of and it feel a little like the walkway to Ame too. Also Clase Azul Reposado Tequila is priced the highest in San Francisco as far as I am aware and they resent increase the price a little too. It's also irritating that pointing out to a bartender their exceptionally steep price on said tequila, he replied that that's something he is proud off. Such a stupid thing to say it makes you want to ditch both him and the bar. I also had a taste of a very bad cocktail here recently that tasted nothing but water made from cucumbers, to the same bartenders credit, he did replace it with something better, they shouldn't have bad things like that on the menu though. Came back for their drinks! Earlier than expected, but good nevertheless. My colleague and I came here after Jersey Boys Wednesday night and sat from around  pm  : am. Even though it was late, there were still quite a bit of a crowd, but not loud obnoxious people  more of the classy type at the venue. I liked my drink quite a bit. It's called Bummer & Lazarus. Give it a try :)Our two drinks with tip came up to $. I absolutely love this bar. It's very chic and upscale; perfect to start out a night, or to just grab a few bites and cocktails with friends. The servers are sweet and the drinks are good. My recent cocktail was the gin and sparkling sake drink. Delicious!! They have good tequilas and champagne too. Also, those crunchy wasabi peas (bar bites) are addicting! Love this place Hotie Totie.  People who live near the roof pay  k a month to live here.  Hot cars and quality service out front. Stopped here twice during the holidays. One evening after dinner for dessert and coffee and another evening with a group of friends. Their dessert was pastry chef delicious. The coffee was so good that cream and sugar were unnecessary. The second visit I ordered a fortified wine I had never heard of or tasted before. The were out but she asked if she could substitute a  year old tawny port for the same price as the wine. Wow that was the smoothest port I have ever tasted! It was a generous pour and some of my friends tasted it and also loved it. Love the vibe/decor here. Love the heroic paintings. The waitstaff including the bartender were really nice, friendly and helpful."
7 Mission Restaurant|3.5|Vietnamese in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|150|-1|3.51785714286|" Foods are in good portion and reasonable price. We ordered entrees and rice for a family style. I like our fresh rolls with peanut sauce, eggplant with fish. BBQ pork is awesome and I love their wonton soups (just sprinkle some black pepper) but I don't like chicken with pineapple much cos its very soggy and bland. We got there after the Giants parade when they're busy but we stayed until there're two tables in the house. I didn't take long for the foods to get ready despite that they're busy. This is my go to chinese delivery spot in soma. I usually order for myself & coworkers always tag on their order. Their food is fresh & tasty. Not the best chinese food ever, but for delivery the taste & portion size can't be beat. My usual order is the veggie chow fun. Loads of wide noodles with fresh veggies. I also really like their tofu salad. It's super yummy. Their prices are very reasonable. Their delivery service usually takes an hour minimum, so be sure to plan ahead. I just ordered delivery from this place. NOTHING was fresh, The pot stickers were horrible, the egg rolls were over fried, the pork was dry and over cooked. . . . . . what a mess. Never again! They food is really good but the service is horrible that why its a  and not . I eat her often. I don't recommend coming in around lunch time. You can never get a seat or you will be waiting about min for one. Every time I come i get the same thing which is the sweet and sour chicken with fried rice and a cup of water. Ok now this is why i say the service is horrible. When trying to get a refill of WATER it takes about  min unless you wave you hand around like your trying to answer a question for middle school. They need a little improvement on going around at least every  min just to check and make sure everything is ok. Overall the the food is excellent. Did I mention CHEAP!!?? Really didn't want to rate since it's such good food and I don't want a line.  But they deserve it.  Best service,  best food.  I do lunch. I live right across from this place and I've turned into quite a regular. This place is great for a few specific dishes like their sesame chicken, potsickers, or beef curry (or at least those are my favorites). I tried deviating away from those and let's just say the quality definitely isn't there across the board. Despite that this really has turned into my go to place for cheap asian food. I order online and walk over to pick up. After my second order the person at the counter, remembered my face and at this point just hands me my order when I walk in. Always great to become a regular. Minimalist Vietnamese and Chinese sit down and take out.  The vegetarian rolls and vegetarian pho were good if wholly unexceptional.  I reckon this is a quick and decent choice for folks in the general area. For the price,  Mission is awesome. I always go for the Mongolian beef with brown rice. It's solid and is my go to meal when i don't want to spend much.  Mission is the go to restaurant for the best chicken pho and spring rolls with peanut sauce. Drip iced coffees are a favorite and the staff is very friendly and accommodating. We go at least once a week for take out. Great place! I'm only giving  stars cause the food isn't bad, and prices are cheap!Now, for the service. . Pshh!! The don't even deserve one star for their service. I walked in, no one greeted me so I just sat myself down and looked at the menu,My waiter walked at least three or four times pass me before acknowledging me. After  minutes waiting for someone to service me, my waiter with a bad attitude and a bitch face took my order. Btw! No water or utensils were given to me until I asked it! Anyways, satisfied with my food, I waited another  minutes for my waiter to take my plates away and give me my check, she was literally in front me drying spoons and forks. She definitely saw I was done cause she looked my way about five times. I didn't wanna cause a scene so I didn't go off. She whispers to her co worker, they both look at me then her co worker gives me the check. The only reason why I go here is because the food is good and it's very close to my job. They really need to give that waiter a reality check on customer service! I've gone to this place twice. Had good experiences with their Pho. The third time I was waiting in line and saw the Health Inspection, it stated that the cooks didn't wash their hands with soap and did not use gloves when handling the food. After reading that I left and haven't gone back. Go at your own discretion. Free delivery with a $ minimum through Grubhub. Took about  mins,rare beef noodle soup  pho bogood broth, definitely hit the spot. I would ask for less noodles next time. They didn't automatically include Hoison and Sriracha sauce. sad lifefried shrimp  i would not order this again. the batter was orange and the taste was odd. couldn't be drowned in sweet and sour sauce. pan fried noodles  def needed to add sriracha and a tad bit of soy for more flavorall  items + tax + tip  was less than $ Cheap food for the starving stomachs. Tried the spare ribs clay pot  not bad but just barely acceptable. update: their bbq beef rice and chicken wings are actually pretty good. beef chow fun is fine but a little bit too salty & greasy. personally I would not recommend their clay pot to my friends. Decent chinese food place close to SomaWhen I first saw ""clay pot"" on the menu outside the door, I was excited. Damn! Even though I wasn't hungry, I Just had to go in and try it. From the menu, the food items looked legit spare ribs clay pot sounded authentic. Unfortunately this was not the case the whole thing did not really taste like authentic clay pots. There wasn't a lot of soy sauce, and the rice was mixed with carrots (what??), onions, and bok choy. Which is fine I applaud them for adding ingredients, but that's not how authentic clay pots are supposed to be! It's supposed to be just spare ribs, with rice, and lots of soy sauce! That's how they make them on the streets!Oh well, at least the price was pretty good. The decor inside looks like a fast food place, which is not bad. All in all, a pretty good place to stop by if you're looking for a quick meal and decent tasting food. I ordered. Food came in  minutes. This is what you call chinese fast food. I was super hungry and I didn't feel like going out so I decided to order in despite the terrible ordering experience last time. I expected to wait around  minutes but  minutes after ordering the food came. I ordered the spare ribs clay pot rice, vietnamese coffee, and some other stuff not worth mentioning. I was off of coffee for awhile but I saw the Vietnamese coffee on the menu and buckled because I'm weak and I love coffe. Recommendations:Food: Get Clay Pot Rice : bit. ly/yummyclaypotrice~or~If you're confused/fickle you can order one of their combination dishes that have egg rolls, fried shrimp, salad, and a choice of ( BBQ beef, BBQ pork,  spice chicken) with rice. Drinks: Vietnamese coffee : bit. ly/vietcoffeeVietnamese coffee:  Stars   perfectly strongService:  Stars   Fast delivery and super friendlyFood: .  Stars   Decent take out food. It won't knock your socks off but the best if you're in the area. I don't mean to be a harsh critic but the service here is totally lacking. My coworkers and I went here yesterday evening before happy hour and were astonished we had never tried it before. It's basically around the corner from our office. I ended up ordering the beef and scrambled egg, and my coworkers got the chicken and bok choy and the chicken with green beans and rice. The food was okay. I actually thought that my dish was INCREDIBLY salty and the fact that the waiters failed to give us glasses of water did not help. I thought a dish as simple as beef and scrambled egg would be solid tasting. But I was left disappointed with my salty dish. My coworkers also complained about the saltiness of their dishes as well. I don't know if I'll be going back here but if I do I should have the sense to try one of the claypot dishes that other yelpers have recommended. And my only other reason for coming back would be the close proximity to the office. However, if the claypot fails me then I will not be returning. Slow service, right on th street by Civic Center, little parking, hole in the wallOh I forgot to go into detail about the slow service  it took about  minutes to get our check after we were done eating. And no water for us either. I was craving some pho and decided to give this place a try.  There were a few open tables when we arrived so they seated us right away. We ordered imperial rolls, vegetarian pho,  spice chicken and bbq pork plate. The imperial rolls weren't horrible,  but I wouldn't order them again.  The pho waa piping hot and all of the veggies looked and tasted very fresh. Squeeze some sriacha into it and it's perfect.  Hubby had the bbq pork and liked it a lot. The girls shared the  spice chicken and finished the whole plate. Serving sizes are very generous here.  sodas &  waters and our tab was under $. What a steal. This might just be our new pho spot. I live right around the corner from this place and I've been here quite a bit. The service and some of the food is a little hit or miss. They get everything out to you super quick though. Lemon chicken and sesame chicken are the way to go in my opinion. ~ TheWaterGuy Food arrived warm and fast! Placed my order at :pm. Arrived at :pm. Wow. Food arrived hot. Ordered beef pho noodle soup and veggie fried rice. Happy camper. Terrible!  We ordered our food at pm and it shows up  HOURS LATER at pm. Driver also gave us the wrong order, so now we're out $ and have a pile of gross beef we're not going to eat.  Awesome. A great place to order from if you don't mind wasting your money and time. I think it's best to order 'noodle' based dishes from here and stay away from appetizers or any rice plate. . . . Delivery was  min which was great, but food was seriously lacking. Never been here and tried to play it safe with spring rolls potstickers lemon chicken and chicken chow mein . . . . I could only eat the chow mein, everything else was gross  way to much fish oil, soggy rice, weird spring rolls  sauces were bad. Clay pot ricks!Rice is crusty on the bottom and lots of food for reasonable price. I have not tried anything else there, but the clay pot makes me happy.  I get excited thinking about going and everyone always says how good when I take them. Happy clay pots here!  Enjoy!I was going to go four stars as the ingredients could be better quality, but very few meals make me this happy so five stars it is! Really good, hardworking people who give you large portions for cheap prices. Pho is good. If you're eating in, I recommend some of the clay pot dishes. Unlike other Chinese restaurants, their food is not salty, so ask for soy sauce and hot sauce. Definitely a go to place if you're in soma and on a budget but don't want to compromise taste. At a hotel and order food for delivery because I have a  year old and it's dark outside.  Food was decent and prices are fair. Food came up to  something & tip the driver  bucks although he correct me and told me that it should have been  something. Which took me by surprise.  A tip is gratitude. If anything it took over two hour and a half to get my food. Idk if driver deserve more than  bucks as tip oh. . . My. . . WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?I've been craving Chinese food for DAYS, but I've been just admiring the photos of them on yelp, hoping the visuals will satisfy my craving (I am trying to get in shape. OBVI). But today, I COULD NOT take it anymore, and had to take action. I thoroughly browsed through Chinese restaurants around my area for the last good hour of work (don't tell my boss plz), and determined that my victim of choice will be  Mission Restaurant. Looked through photos during my commute home, and got myself thoroughly ready for dinner. Walked in the restaurant, took a quick glance at the menu  and ordered the Combo Clay Pot. A few minutes later. . . my clay pot came out. The nice mr. server set it down in front of me, grabbed the lid, and opened it after a split second of pause. . . . it was almost theatrical. I could almost hear the gong going off. An Immense amount of steam was immediately released, fogging my iphone camera lens that I had ready to instagram and snapchat this magnificent bowl of food. Undeniably, it was love at first sight. I admired my steaming pot for a good minute, took some photos, and started digging in. THat's when the clay pot took me to a whole another LEVEL. I forgot about everything. I don't care where this chicken came from, or the mushroom, the rice, the shrimp, the sausage. The perfect medley, the balance of flavors, temperature and texture were enough to send me over the edge. The pot stayed sizzling, piping hot throughout the duration of my eating session, and the jasmine rice had formed a perfect crispy bottom to add some extra fun to my meal. The server was really nice, and had a smile on his face the whole time. I KILLED the entire meal. I'm so full I'm having trouble sitting down and typing up this review. All that. for $. +tip. I'm ready for bed now. I'm going to have good dreams. Quick, affordable, and tasty!  mission has yet to disappoint in dining in or for delivery.  I like to order their  rice dishes, pho ga, and their shrimp spring rolls. Holy! hot dam we have a winner. One of my fav. Food dish on this planet is imperial egg roll vermicelli noodle bowl. This place got it the best that I've had so far. Details as follows for delivery:Chicken Fried Rice (Instructions: white meat chicken only please and spicy please): this was interesting, it had the consistency of Japanese fried rice (fluffy, not a lot of oil and what oil used was peanut or a light veggie), it's was ok but there should have been some bigger flavors, there weren't, but I thought it was a pass. BBQ Pork and Egg Roll  Rice Noodle (or called imperial egg roll vermicelli noodle bowl): This place has the best noodles that I have ever had, now that might not seem like a lot, but to a noodle fiend like myself you can taste the difference. Theirs are fatter, thicker, and soak up sauce way better (plus they strain better so you don't have soo much water at the bottom). The BBQ pork was the most tender thing that I have ever ate, Mississippi smoked BBQ included. Honestly, my only beef with this is that the wrapping for the imperial rolls are not the glass wrapper dough (like they use for any salad roll). Easy way to tell this is if your eggroll is brown/tan it's normal wanton wrapper, it is a dirty white  you got glass wrapper, which gets crispier. Shrimp Salad Roll (): IT HAS BBQ BEEF IN IT. They don't tell you that, I am. I liked it, my vegetarian GF did not (and it was her order), more food for me. The ravager wins again.  Corn and Crab Meat Soup: We both tried this and gonna have to pass, it's an egg drop soup with some imitation crab, and some veggies, stuff is in it, but not the most fantastic thing ever. But, then again, if you're a vegetarian you gotta be pretty much used to that now huh?Egg Rolls: Pork, carrot (nice addition), some dikon, with wan ton wrapper. Good, and if you dip them in the vinegar chili sauce great addition. On gloomy school days, I come here for Pho, as its just a block away from school.  Its not the best, but its not that bad either.  The price is acceptable considering their location ($), plus they take credit cards, so I gotta give them that. Poor customer service. It was my first time going to this restaurant and I was completely disappointed by the service I received. I ordered a CLAY POT dish, and thirty minutes later, I was still waiting for my food to come. I called the waitress to ask her why my food was not ready yet. She replied by saying, that they did not have enough clay pots, therefore, they had to wait for other customers to finish using the clay pots. Ten more minutes passed, and I was still there waiting for my food. Three or four customers came in after me, and they got their clay pot dish before I did. I had to called the waitress one more time and ask her about the status of my food, I also questioned her why other customers who came in after me and who also ordered a clay pot, got their food while I was still waiting. She replied by saying that because my clay pot comes with onions it takes longer to cook. By this time I had no more patience, and I asked the waitress to call her manager because what she was telling me was unacceptable. She said that her manager was busy and he could not come to talk with me. Five minutes later, when I was about to leave the restaurant because I was sick of waiting, there she comes, with my clay pot. In short, I waited about  minutes to get my food served. The manager refused to come talk with me, and the waitresses never apologized to me for making me wait that long. Giving the fact that I had a very unpleasant very first impression, I strongly do NOT recommend this place and I personally will never go back to this restaurant. Good for a fast and cheap eat.  But I found a hair. . . The curly kind. . . on my egg roll. . . Check it out.  Will I return? Uh I don't know. . . I am really glad I live near this Vietnamese place. Must've been here dozens of times in the past couple years. The food is cheap and most dishes are solid, and the guy who runs the place is super friendly! SOUPS Chicken Pho:  starsMy favourite chicken pho I've ever had, with perfect firm springy noodles, delicious broth and tender white chicken meat. Vegetarian Pho: .  starsThe same delightfully tensile noodles, with a healthier broth lacking the chicken salt from the chicken pho. Contains bakchoy, broccoli, bamboo, black mushrooms, cabbage, celery and I added tofu. Satay Beef Noodle Soup:  starsToday I was looking for a hearty soup because this winter has put an interminable chill in my bones that clear pho can't drive off, so I tried the Satay Beef Noodle Soup for the first time. . . New favorite dish!! It is so yummy and has all the fatty beef tendons and thin sliced lean meat you could want. Asparagus and Chicken Soup: .  starsAnother comforting dish for cold nights.  It's an egg drop soup with soft curds of yummy protein floating in the thick glazed soup. Chicken Curry Soup:  starsThe only one of their soups I didn't like.  The flavour is a little weird, maybe too much curry powder.  The best Vietnamese chicken curry soup I've had so far is at Sunrise Cafe (yelp. com/biz/sunrise caf…) on Bryant St. FOOD Beef with Eggplant:  starsChicken with Eggplant:  starsChicken with Double Mushroom:  starsSauce has a weird artificial flavour. Claypot rice dishes: .  starsDelicious and SO much food for what you're paying. Five Spice Chicken: .  starsBBQ Pork with Imperial Rolls Vermicelli: .  starsThe BBQ pork comes in thin strips reminiscent of bak kwa (Chinese BBQ pork jerky), but these imperial tolls are deep fried, crunchy and packed full of good flavour. Crab Rangoon:  starsAll the crab here is imitation crab. I was wondering for while about this little place. . . Every time I come from work. . . I had the BBQ pork disk on Saturday afternoon. It wasn't full , but there were some interesting people sitting in front of me. . I made a request for brown instead rice. White rice make u fat. . . I found the pork to be  very delicious, and they serve it with steam broccoli and slice of carrot. . I had to order extra pork"" Cuz I eat a lot"" I wish they add more pork instead of too much rice. . WOW! WHAT ARROGANCE! i have been a happy commercial customer/ diner here since  ( i own almost / of the adjacent block and it's properties), so i eat there a LOT! as do a bunch of my employees. . . . . . WELL, NO MORE! i just walked up there to get my usual dinner (sweet & sour chicken, as of late) and this waitress whom i have never seen before (genarally a very nice young man works the counter and takes my orders )  FLAT OUT DENIES ME SERVICE! FULL DISCLOSURE:  i had the ""audacity"" to try to pay for my meal ( a total of $. ) with a $ dollar bill, a $ dollar bill, and then (GASP)  quarters to cover the last  cents. . . . i almost always pay via CC, but just didn't feel like walking down the street to my car to grab my card, SO SUE ME! i assumed that paying the last $ dollor of my bill in change would be sufficient, seems reasonable, right?WRONG! i was immediately informed she could not take ""that"" with a TON of attitude as disgust, like this little waitress was so much above little old me. i was understandably VERY insulted, and made a scene, informed her i would make sure they loose the business  of ALL of my employees and tenants (people are usually very loyal to me and my company, which i founded here in SOMA in ' because, well,  i reward loyalty). . . I guess i'm just at a total loss on this one, i'm a pragmatist at heart, and this level of egotism and elitism will do nobody any good. SO TO SUM UP: good cheap food, but that much arrogance has the tendency to spill out all over the food. not to mention that combating that type of atmosphere isn't easy, and leads to indigestion. lol. Good, cheap chinese food is NOT rare in SOMA by any stretch of the imagination. So save yourself the unpleasantness and walk the extra  block to one of the  chinese joints on th st. , or even just step up to TU LAN!! FINALLY BACK OPEN ! WOO! HOO! best vietnamese food outside of the triangle!JEEZ, I SURE HOPE THE $ IN CHANGE WAS WORTH THE LOST BUSINESS. I JUST NOW STOPPED MY  BUSINESS PARTNERS FROM GRABBING A BITE THERE TONIGHT, AS WELL. so,  dinners lost already tonight alone, i hope it was worth it! Meh waayy too oily. I know Chinese food is oily but there was enough oil at the bottom of the box to bathe a person in it. I stumbled across this restaurant because it was so small that I almost missed it. As a result I got curious and went in for a visit. A couple of revisits later, I can say that I'm duly impressed. The restaurant itself is very small. The decoration is not exactly all that good. But the family cooks with the type of down home earnestness rarely found nowadays. The food is not Michelin Star worthy, of course. But their prices are absolutely excellent (most menu items are under $ FOR very generous portions), especially in comparison to some of the restaurants in Chinatown where the average dish is smaller but is priced at more than double, sometimes even quadruple the price of  Mission's dishes. The place is not in the best part of town for sure. But as another reviewer said, if you happen to be staying in the Best Western Carriage, Best Western Americana, and the Good Hotel, then this place is literally  steps away from you. The best Pho I have ever had in the city! I've been coming here for years and have never been disappointed. Great authentic food and great service. Love the BBQ beef, Pho, clay pot, and yellow curry. Yum! You definitely need to try this place. My favorite hole in the wall restaurant. Friends, I can't really review on much other than their quick service and their excellent claypot!  I'm not sure it worth trying anything else.  I always get the veggie one and ask that they keep it in the oven a little longer to make the rice nice and crispy on the bottom (maybe it's a Persian thing and if you are Persian or know a Persian, you'll know what I'm talking about).  It's usually busy, both at the restaurant and the phone going off  these are all good signs when there are so many choices in SF.  The only warning is, sometimes a really crazy person might walk in (rare but I go enough that it's happened twice since I've dined there).  They have never been rude or disrespectful to the person but try to handle it the best they can.  Usually they leave without weirdness and I appreciate that. Again, CLAYPOT. After  hours, no food delivered. Canceled order to get refund. Suddenly get call about how they're not too far away (restaurant is by this time, closed). On the phone, I Refuse to accept the food. Guy on phone is begging me to take it, even for free. I refuse again. Awful. Will never order from here again.  hours?  Really? I've been back many many times since my first review and this place is now my go to spot for quick, cheap, and tasty chinese/vietnamese food. The combination clay pot is delicious. Also, surprisingly the PHO is really good as well. I'm usually skeptical getting pho at a hybrid restaurant but this one definitely passes the test. This is a pretty good lunch spot. I love the spring roll. Sweet and sour pork. I noticed that the clay pots are very popular. Its a hole in a wall kind of restaurant, it gets pretty packed during lunch. The prices are very fair. And there are a lot of items on the menu to choose from. I love their combo claypot, a meal in one pot, crunchy, chewy, with lean Chinese sausage, a little of everything rice, chicken, chinese mushroom.  Once it arrives, do not mix, leave it alone.  Let the crispyness cook a bit longer.  Have an ice Vietnamese coffee and there you have it, my last meal on earth.  Unless, I also order the Pho with Satay Beef.  My stomach will be so full I probably can't move any way, so why try to move.  I'll get stuck in one of their booth and I need the ""jaw of life"" to cut me out.  Don't mind the service.  It's the thought that counts.  In this case, it's the food that counts. Agree with the other favorable reviews.  Gave them  stars b/c decent Chinese food in SOMA, that delivers, & for me was @min.  Very important when laid up with a cast & can't get around.  The pork chow fun was surprisingly good.  shrimp w/bok choy wasn't bad, @average.  & prices are just right. $.  for lunch special here. They offer a huge seletion on the lunch special menu, all of which look really good. They had either a tofu or eggplant lunch, but not a combo and had problem combing them to make one lunch when I asked. Really fresh food, loaded with MSG and tasty sauces. The Salt and Pepper Fish is not on the menu, but I was able to order it and it was just okay. The batter was too thick and it could have used more seasoning. It's the most authentic Chinese place in the SOMA area. The prices are extremely good too. I normally stick to the beef chow fun or claypot combo. Best dish: Claypot Combo Food: / starsAmbiance: Authentic Chinese (kinda dirty feeling)Price: /person Service: I like the people that work there, they're very friendly. The ownership changed hands a while back and the food, which was decent before, has gotten even better. I'm a big fan of chow fun and theirs is really good  they even asked me if I wanted it ""wet"" or ""dry"", which is rare outside of Chinatown. The service is friendly and fast, the food is not fancy, but filling and tasty. Most of the menu is under $ and I'm more than satisfied with what I get  portion and flavor. I can't complain about their service because they're quite polite to me and my husband. As well, they're quite reliable with Seamless orders. This is one of our favourite take out places. Although the food isn't outstanding, its decent, not too greasy, and a reliable delivery service. Russ, Jason, Kien, Zaw, and I went to this place for one thing, and one thing only  clay pot rice.  we were on a straight mission to find clay pot rice and thanks to yelp we found this place.  Fair warning to true clay pot rice aficionados  this is more like fried rice in a clay pot as opposed to genuine clay pot rice.  Although it's not % clay pot rice, I still liked it.  We paid $/pop for rice in a clay pot with your choice of toppings.  mine came with chinese sausage, chicken, and mushrooms.  Now in a normal chinese place, it would take up to   minutes for clay pot rice, so you can imagine my shock when it came out in  minutes! My theory is that they took rice, fried it, topped it, then put it in a clay pot and put it in the oven.  i can tell it was in the oven cause there was some rice sticking to the bottom of the clay pot and it was sizzling when it came out. My other clay pot mates said it was good, and cheap, but not legit. I would definitely go back.  not for tube steak though. just for the clay pot rice I walked right past this place for years for fear of what inexpensive food in the soma may or may not contain until a friend dragged me in and I had the pho (#) and was very impressed. The breaded chicken dishes I personally avoid but the pho is perfect. Only ordered delivery, so can't speak to the service or decor. The prices were cheap, like most Chinese restaurants. Hot and Sour Soup: A large serving, with the right amount of thickness, sour/spicy kick, crunchy vegetables like wood ear, and meat. Surpassed my (admittedly low) expectations. I just wish they hadn't filled it with scallions. I hiss at scallionsMongolian Beef Rice Plate: For the boyfriend. Disappointing. Way too many onions = way too much onion flavor. Inexplicably cooked in a sweet sauce reminiscent of ""orange chicken"" (*shudder*). The beef could have been more tenderSatay Beef Noodle Soup: For me. :) Noodle soups are my favorite food and satay is one of the best sauces ever invented. Satay beef noodle soup is not difficult to make, which is part of its appeal, as it never fails to satisfy me.  Mission's version had that delicious, spicy, savory satay broth I love so much and the beef was quite tender. It was also packaged well for take out Yeah okay, decent food at moderate prices. It lacks a little character in the dishes to really stand out. Seems like they are a little stuck between Chinese and Vietnamese. I wish they'd show a little more creativity and dedication to the dishes. Mostly great because it is rather on the cheaper side, takes credit cards, and (at least for me) in a convenient location. No big fail, yet rather a place to grab a cheap lunch. Staff is sometimes a little overwhelmed when it gets crowded here but always friendly. Free tea is definitely a plus. Just checked the latest health score inspection result:   not that great. I find it a little sneaky that I have never seen the actual score hanging in the restaurant anywhere. Hope they improve again. Its been  years and dozens of orders later and I actually have grown to like this place. Its fast, convenient, friendly service. The food has gotten much better and the portions are large enough to save half for later. If you work in the area and want fast asian food then this is a great place to check out! I was a little skeptical coming here, but the second you walk inside it smells wonderful. They have some of the best pho I've had  the broth is amazing, the noodles are great, and the meat is delicous. Would come here again. This place gets my vote. Pho is excellent! And food makes your tummy say Mm. The staff are very nice. Note: Don't go here with picky eaters. Get what's on the menu. Don't ask to make substitutions, just eat the delicious meal prepared for you. I've eaten here a few times as it's pretty close to work and lunch spots in this part of SOMA are far and few.  I can't tell if the resto is more Chinese or Vietnamese as they serve both but their food is decent. So far, I've had their Won Ton Soup w/Noodles, which was good but it didn't have pieces of chicken or pork like others spots serve it up but, it fixed my craving, not sure I'd order it again though.  I've also had their Salt & Pepper Pork Chop Rice plate.  For some reason at the time, it was served to me warm, borderline cold but the steamed rice was piping hot.  There was a good, lunch sized portion of pork chop, which was tasty, could've used a little more pepper and jalapeno but, that's just me.  Their Mongolian Beef Rice plate was decent, my only complaint, which is common for most every Chinese resto I've been to is that they load it up with veggies, the red peppers, green peppers, green onions, onions and just a few pieces of beef.  By the time I was done, all those veggies were what was left on the plate. They serve you hot tea automatically but sometimes you have to ask for it.  I've ordered their Vietnamese Iced Coffee twice which was a nice treat to end my meal, not to mention, to keep me awake for the rest of the day. Service, just like the tea, is hit or miss, but overall has been friendly.  The resto itself is seriously a hole in the wall, it's not somewhere you'd go with a group or celebrate a special ocassion, it's seriously just to eat and run. Overall, it's not the greatest Chinese/Vietnamese food out there but, it's a nice spot if your craving rice in this neighborhood. Since my bf lives close to this restaurant, we go there for the sake of convenience whenever we don't have anything to eat. The food there is okay. It's a little bit oily for my taste. For dessert, three bean dessert has pretty strong coconut flavor to it. Like it has really really thick coconut milk."
Rossi’s Delicatessen|4.0|Delis in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|77|-1|4.61111111111|" This is my favorite deli in SF. The sandwiches are delish! The ingredients are so fresh and they give you the perfect amount of meat. My boyfriend recommend this place to me and we have been going here pretty regularly. What I really love about Rossi's is how friendly the staff is! I love to support businesses like these. If you are craving a fresh sandwich come here. They also have a wide selection of chips, candy, drinks and other yummy treats. Nice staff. I had their roasted turkey sandwich in dutch crunch and it was amazing. There's nowhere to sit and eat but that's ok. It is a very small place but great items. Love this place. Friendly, fast service, and good fresh food at a reasonable price.  I often stop in for a morning bagel sandwich or a turkey sandwich on Dutch crunch later in the day. The falafel is reasonably priced and delicious. Good cheese selection too. I'm sure that I must have ordered the wrong kind of sandwiches.  The special today was roasted turkey.  I asked them to make it on a Dutch Crunch.  The bread was more chewy than crunchy and the roasted turkey looked like leftover pieces of dark meat from a Thanksgiving dinner.  It wasn't tasty either.  The other sandwich that I ordered was an egg salad on toasted white but, she accidentally toasted rye bread  which I didn't discover until I brought the sammies home.  I asked for onions on both and there were a lot of onions!  They weren't the thinly sliced red onions, but rather the strong white onions.  It too was lacking flavor  (other than the onions) and was heavy on the mayo with large chunks of boiled eggs.  The dolmas were great though!The people that work there are warm and personable.  I did wind up buying a winning lottery ticket there too $!  Sweet! Best place ever. I only originally gave this place  stars, so people would believe that this place is that great. It really is. It's the best god damn place to eat for me, anyway. Everyday, I come here for lunch. I'm always looking forward to eat my food from here. This place has been here and run here from the same family many years before I was even born. It's a hidden on the way close to muni gem that everyone should try. M I'm eating it now! Sam and crew at Rossi's are neighborhood a Castro institution.  This tiny, unique deli offers a surprising selection of yummy treats.  The sandwiches are fantastic, made to order and a great value for your dollar. My only wish is for Rossi's to stop selling small bottles of liquors.  These bottles end up being part of the quality of life problems in the Castro.  Some of the very problems I've seen staff at Rossi's having to deal with. So i guess yelp doesn't like if you don't write a story behind your review so here i go. I work in the "" Castro "" and are often torn between where i want to eat not because i can't afford it only because the choices are limited on a  min lunch, I always walk past Rossi's & never payed attention to it because theres So much Liquor ( which is great right ? ) So i ordered Ham sammich  day and the next day i ordered Black forest ham sammich "" real adventurous Right ? "" Lmao Delicious btw in a few days I'm going to try Pastrami !! Good Food, Not expensive, Fast service.  stars I love this place !! The people/owners are always friendly and funny. It's a family owned deli that have been there for over  yrs. Its nice to still see a mom and pop shop (instead of Starbucks on every corner) in the City. And btw this place has fresh brewed coffee ! I love their fresh roasted turkey sandwich, falafel, and deviled eggs, I like all their sandwiches but those are my favorites.  It's a cute little hole in the wall with a lot of character and good food. It's a ""to go"" deli, no seating but great to pick up some sandwiches, chips, salads, wines, cheeses, chocolate, soda, beer, and the list goes on and hit the park for a picnic. I saw some of the negative reviews and I've never had a bad experience and have been going there as long as they have been in business. . . I recommend giving them one more shot before calling them quits ! (I mean nobody's perfect right). ps. To daphne who complained about the lady saying she would charge .  for a bag, you should've asked for a bag before you paid, you know we have to pay for bags now ! No disrespect but just saying! This is a real mom and pop deli. Great sandwiches, best chicken salad sandwich around! Super friendly and clean. Wouldn't have thought to stop by here, but a friend recommended it. Came here for a quick sandwich dinner one Thursday night, and the hot pastrami sandwich was pretty good. There's not too much meat, so you can still bite into the sandwich without making a big mess. The bread was very soft and all the ingredients were very fresh as well. Prices were good at around $.  for a sandwich, plus they accept credit card. Great service and food. They're so friendly and helpful. Only criticism is that the hot sandwich maker isn't gay. :( I like this place, it's cute and pack full of yummies. The sandwiches are just good, giant sandwiches. No special sauce or anything. And they have pepperoncinis! The pesto pasta salad is really yummy, highly recommend. Simple, delicious and fresh sandwiches! Inexpensive. . . It's hard to find a ""east coast"" type deli. :) It's really easy to miss this place if you aren't looking for it, but I'm glad I found it. It's a great place to grab a sandwich if you live in the Castro. The sandwiches are really good, and you can usually get in and out in two or three minutes. There are a few better sandwich shops in the city, but given the speed and friendly service this place is a must. They also have a good selection of chips (that is to say, not just the standard lays varieties). When I lived in the Castro I would typically stop here on the way home from work once or twice a week. This place looks bland, but it's actually very, very awesome.  They have a bunch of beer, wine, food, and other concessions all at extremely reasonable prices.  Basically it's like what a ""deli"" SHOULD be: Actual sandwiches, actual conveniences, all done well. And the folks who work here are really nice, and they've been working here as long as I've lived here, so they must be either family or treating them well. Old neighborhood feely friendly, everything you ever want in a deli.  Love the $.  Baklava.  Had the Dutch Crunch Pastrami, just a plain good old sandwich.  Everybody coming in ordered the ""avogobble"".  Need to try that next time.  Had too much turkey in this past week.  The Holiday cookies were calling to me, good thing I had the volume on low.  This place is so European, so many meats and side dishes. YELP is so cool! I have been craving all week for a Reuben sandwich and whenever I come to Castro, it's either for their happy hour, dancing, coffee, or hanging out with cool friends, and I certainly would have never thought of Kosher deli here if it wasn't for my trusted YELP Mobile!Man this place rocks! They have everything to fill my craving. I jumped right away and ordered two sandwiches. One corned beef and the other pastrami both on rye. I was so excited about the sandwiches I completely forgot to order the sides like potato salad or I was even thinking of humus and couscous! I did have my eyes on their deviled eggs which looked delicious!!BTW  my sandwiches were delicious!The owners  the nice gentlemen and the nice woman I'm sorry I didn't get your name, thank you for making my night and for making me your awesome Reuben sandwiches. Your pricing was just excellent! What a great deal! Thank you also for your warm smile and for your excellent customer service. I definitely know where to get my Reuben fix when I'm in the Castro from now on!Rossi's Delicatessen also sell plenty of many goodies here too including lotto and they're open late until PM. They even serve fresh coffee and you can even buy them by the pound!Cheers ~ Here's all you need to know about Rossi's: super friendly guys (and gals), great, simple, inexpensive sandos, and you'll always leave with a smile on your face."
Chick-N-Deli|4.5|Delis in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|32|-1|4.08333333333|" I don't go anywhere else for chicken. I have been coming here for years and this place has never disappointed me. Everything is bought and cooked by the talented Greek. There's definitely nothing artificial about this place  it's good, homemade, delicious food. I always get the / chicken special which always gets me beyond full. He may seem like he got a tough exterior, and can be very soft spoken, but once you get to know him, he's such a sweet guy. This place is great if you are going keto or going low carb. Just get some chicken and salad and you will be all set!Btw, this is the ONLY food establishment that I know of that has a perfect health score! That really speaks about the quality of food there! Had the / chicken special. For the price this was an excellent value. Came with the chicken, baked potato, choice of salad and buttered bread . For .  this was really filling and tasted pretty good. The sauce on the chicken was okay, thin and tangy, maybe would like it more on the ribs. Next time I'll get it without the sauce. Chicken was tender. Salad was good, I had the ""greens salad"" as it was called. Like a Greek salad without feta and olives. The potato was good since it was baked and not steamed. Makes a huge difference to me. Bread was a cut loaf that was good for dipping in the sauce. I'll be back. I've been coming here since I was a little girl about the age of  years old with my mom (When she was alive). I am now  years old and I still come here and the sandwiches are still AMAZING. I will forever come to this deli shop as long as its in business. I will keep the tradition alive and when my kids are old enough to eat a big ass sandwich like this, I will take them here also. Its a simple but DELICIOUS sandwich. The bread is amazing. I don't like sandwiches that have a lot of weird ingredients in it and funky sauces. I just like a simple yet delicious sandwich. And this place tops that. He probably would remember my mom if he saw her but he doesn't remember me. Its okay, I will still come here anytime I need a good sandwich fix. I've drove by this neighborhood but I never stopped by. But my family was hungry, so I found a place to park. Not the easiest area to find parking. But, there rotisserie chicken was really delicious. Ordered the special which includes / Rotisserie chicken, baked potato, choice of salad (I choose macaroni because it looked like the salad everyone was choosing based on how empty the serving dish was) and a hunk of buttered bread . I love the nice crispy skin of the chicken, in the special sauce (not thick like BBQ sauce but more like a marinara) and mix in the coolness of the salad. This place is amazing!Food is rotissiere meat, baked potato,, bread, choice of potato, mac, green, beet salads, coleslaw. Huge quantity, great deal. To go or pick upThe owner is cool, very old school greek guy. He may not seem super friendly, but thats just how how he is; very reserved. The place is literally from the past. Reminds me of an italian mobster movie scene. A must try Ribs = delicious.  Great meat, large portion, and limited gristle.  They have a great coleslaw, and lettuce salad too!  I love their bread with butter.  NOM.  I had to order an extra piece this time.  lolThis place = epic win. Great chicken. Big serving for the price!! The owner's really nice too :) Just came back from there and I am absolutely never going back. The owner was so rude when I asked him a question regarding their sandwiches and later on ignored what I wanted to order. If you want good chicken with great customer service go down  blocks to Pollo Supremo I was craving for good old chicken in an old fashion neighborhood Hood.  This is the place!   $.   / chicken, side, bread and butter, and a baked potato (huge).  So tasty, meat just comes off the bone.  Best coleslaw to go with it.  They got  pt for cleanliness Wow!  SF doesn't have too many of these around.  You actually see the chicken being roasted.  No Costco chicken for me.  For $.  you can get  chickens, if only I had four stomachs. I asked the owner how he can make money selling chickens for such reasonable prices, then I told him how much a roast chicken at Zuni cafe costs. ""For one chicken?""""Yea""""People who go there, they are stupid. ""Good chicken.  bucks per. Delicious, succulent rotisserie chicken at an affordable price. Love the old school decor, and the no nonsense attitude of the fellow who runs this place. They don't make 'em like this anymore."
Publico Urban Taqueria|3.5|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|138|-1|3.36538461538|" ok for a quick lunch. one of the few options when you shop at TJ. Burrito was good, though not exceptional. Price average. If you are hungry and looking for somethingn quick, that's the place. they have a few tables to sit outside though not the most relaxing environment Finally! A burrito and bread gave birth to a baby! And it's called a Torta!I know I know, I'm slow. How could I not have known about this marvelous invention? Don't worry child, I've kicked myself for it already and I'm here to tell you that although this is the first Torta I've ever had, it definitely won't be the last. First off, this is a small shop that is in a plaza. It might be easily missed but just look for the line around lunch time. No matter how long it is, get in line and order anything on the menu. The  bread came warm and lightly toasted. The beef was cooked medium rare with the amazing pico and avocado combo that blended beautifully with every bite. Unfortunately it does get messy so make sure to grab a lot of napkins! My friend had the burrito bowl and it smelled so good and the portion is so worth it for the price. I will definitely skip breakfast one day to finish an entire burrito on my next visit! This place is actually good. I ordered a chicken bowl & it reminded me of Chipotle, but better. I wouldn't really recommend the Agua frescas because they're too plain. Tasty, well portioned food for the price you pay. The staff here aren't really friendly, they seem a bit lazy to me. Found this place by accident and I'm glad I did.  It's located in a stand in the parking garage by Bed Bath & Beyond and Trader Joes; don't let the location fool you, the food hear is fresh, tasty, and well portioned for the price.  The crispy tacos I had were delicious and larger than your average taco for $. .  The taco shell is wrapped with a soft tortilla spread with a layer of refried beans, all making for a nice contrast in texture.  The fillings of the cheese, guac, salsa, and lettuce were all fresh and well balanced.  The carne asada and chicken were well seasoned, well cooked, and also very fresh.  The guys working  were nice and helpful as I had questions, it being my first time there.  I will totally be back the next time I am running errands in the area. I'm waiting for a friend of mine at Peet's and I'm starving, so I spot this little shop and decide to take a gamble. One crispy carne asada taco please. Sure the shell is the same shell that I can get at Trader Joe's across the street for $.  for a pack of , but the taco is pretty good considering. The steak was tasty and not greasy. The guacamole was good. And they gave me a soft tortilla underneath, so in reality I just split up the meat and stuff and made myself two tacos.  star for the cheap and not homemade shell. About an hour before they closed, they seemed friendly and the service was quite quick. Which was good enough for me. Great selection. Great price. Great flavor. Not the most wow taqueria experience you are going to have, but for the price this place is a . /. Great place to grab a quick bite to eat. The taco was so huge that I'm glad I took the time to sit down and really enjoy it! So I'm evaluating on two sets of criteria.   Food and service. First the food: the Magnifico burrito was an ok burrito. Not exactly a Papalote or El Farolito burrito. Carne asada was sort of blah but ok, the  rice was on the tomato y side, otherwise the fillings were pretty good and I'd give the burrito four out of five stars. Fairly large portion, but no chips or salsa included for the  dollar and something we paid for each one. Keep in mind with price comoarisons that the price one pays for a burrito at a restaurant usually includes things like salsa, chips, a sheltered table, restrooms, decorations or lightingNote: My boyfriend didnt feel so good after his burrito, its difficult to tell if it was directly causal or not. We're taking a neutral stance on that. So why are my marks for this place so low? The service!Like other reviewers, i didn't appreciate the the  new young slouchy caucasian guy at the window. He was the kind of arrogant kid that thinks he's too good for the job, but clearly isn't. So, somewhat disenchanted,  boyfriend and I took our burritos to the table closest to the window, as it was the only one available. About two fifths through my burrito, a couple of pigeons perched in the pipes just above the table crapped on my head, face, both arms, and IN my burrito. So catastrophic, it splattered on everything. My boyfriend watched my bags while I ran to Trader Joes bathroom to wash my everything off.  When I returned with my hair wet, my boyfriend went to the order window to ask about what could be done. I stayed at the table. He told the guy what happened and he unsympathetically replied, ""Well, buy another burrito. "" My boyfriend is a hero and totally bought another, but the guy was a jerk about it and the last thing I wanted after losing half a burrito to a pigeon was to buy another from this jerk. Why should they make an extra sale at our expense off a problem they know about and don't fix? (They had that anti pigeon netting above the counter area, but nothing to prevent pigeons from perching right above customers. ) I insisted my boyfriend cancel the second order and we walked. Honestly, I was getting full and would have taken the rest for a snack like i usually do and I'd have been satisfied with half burrito or a small order of chips or something,  a drink, or even nothing, just an apology would have been nice. Its just not nice to pay for something and by no fault of your own, more the fault of the vendor, not get to enjoy it all. That sign in their window says ""don't shop hungry"", but as long as that kid is working there, I'd rather starve than spend another penny here. Next time, I will just buy something inside Trader Joes's and buy myself a real burrito in a restaurant that has restaurant ambiance, amenities and service! I have been walking by this place for ages and never tried it.  I finally stopped by and had the carne asada torta! Yum, so, so good.  I admit that is all I have had because each time I go back with the intention of trying something new but can't resist the deliciousness that is the torta.  It is seriously perfect.  Last time I noticed someone having the tortilla soup and that looked so good.  Next time I will try that AND the torta. I probably should have read reviews thoroughly before stopping in this place. First let me say this. The food was pretty good. The problem was my customer service. I got some of the suckiest customer service in awhile here. The young guy( with the slouchy faded t shirt and jeans) kept saying he couldn't hear me, yet I'm standing right at the window. With an attitude he asked me what type of beans and meat I wanted on my magnifico burrito. After having enough of this fools antics I ask him how long have you been working here? He goes  months. *ding * ding *ding (the bell for the right answer) He pauses and asks why I asked? I told him I can tell he's new. The whole time he had an new hire air of arrogance. It's the ""I got the hang of this and I'm passed my probation period"" attitude. If the owner is reading by chance. . . . . evaluate and stop hiring any silly dope willing to take the job. Also check out Ryan W's review and get rid of that young dude. Small place but very delicious!! The staff is very friendly. The food is amazing. I would highly recommend this place!! I was thrilled to stumble upon this place, as there aren't too many places to grab a fast, tasty, affordable lunch in the area. I've been here twice now. The first time I ordered chicken tortilla soup and a street taco. The soup was DELICIOUS. It was fresh, hearty, and the perfect amount of spicy. The taco on the other hand, I was not impressed with. The chicken in it wasn't amazing, and their pico de gallo looked and tasted like tomato sauce, which was not appealing in the least. Maybe I got the bottom of the barrel that day, so perhaps I'll try it again another time. However, the second time I went, I was in the mood for a quesadilla. I ordered one with bell pepper and onion. What I got, however, was a tortilla filled with black beans, salsa, rice, guac, peppers, onions, and cheese. I was a little confused, I thought I accidentally picked up someone else's order by mistake. But the guy explained that that's what they put in their quesadillas. And I mean, it was AMAZING, but I'm still confused  if that's a quesadilla, what do they consider burritos? Anyway, I highly recommend the quesadilla and tortilla soup. Good prices. Didn't take too long. Nice people work there. Safe (ish) area. I plan to return! I come here because it's close to work. It's under new ownership and it's average but usually pretty quick. However the burrito roller had the nerve to look at me today when I added beans to a quesadilla when it was 'busy' (two people in line) and say ""thanks a lot for the special order. "" I work in the service industry and that shit is unacceptable, they lost my everyday business after that move. Terrible customer service. Come here often for lunch. Cheap, fairly good and usually quick. They seem to have changed owners recently and now take cards. The downside is that they get overwhelmed and super slow during lunch. They used to be way faster. I've passed by this place in multiple occasions on the way to the Peet's right next door and decided to try it one day. Most days when I passed by, there's a line and the seats are taken up but it was usually during lunch hour so it's sort of expected but if it's there's that many people there, it must be good, right?I show up at am and was the third in line and looked over the menu. I decided to go with the burrito bowl since I wasn't in the mood to use my hands on a burrito. The guy taking my order was friendly and my food was made pretty quickly. As for the burrito bowl itself, it was a pretty large portion and had the usual fixings of rice, beans, corn, salsa/pico de gallo, guacamole and meat (I got carne asada). Everything about it was good except one thing  the food was luke warm. I don't expect the food to necessarily be piping hot but this was on the brink of being cold almost. That aside though, it was good, the guacamole was made with real avocado that I could taste. Nicely seasoned rice, a healthy serving of beans, meat and salsa. The lettuce, I could sort of do without but it was fine. The price was a bit hefty though for a burrito bowl (~$). Decent burrito for its price. My Perfecto Burrito wasn't fully wrapped at the bottom, so my fillings fell on to the table. Thanks! I really liked this place. I was in a rush an needed a quick bite to eat. I saw this little taqueria and was pleasantly surprised. I love Mexican food and was happy to find that Publico did it justice. I got the Tostadita with carnitas. It was fresh and tasty. My food came out fast too! I wasn't put off that they only accept cash. This place is sort of like a food truck so you can't blame them. Plus there is a Chase ATM right next to the ordering window. Also the prices are super reasonable!The only thing that sucks is that I literally ate my food in a parking lot because that is where they are located. Prices have gone up in the last few months but food is still the same and service has gotten worse.  The last four times I've ordered they have gotten my order wrong  I don't like lettuce in my burritos and I prefer refried over black beans and I'm very explicit about this when I place my order.  Today they got both wrong.  And I had to wait  minutes for my order.  Think I will just stick to the items on their menu from now on, and/or go after the lunch rush since there's only one guy making the food. . . Very good. Carne Asada quesadilla. Chicken burrito.  Chips.  It's simple and easy for a quick meal while you're on the go. Location is right in the parking lot, so not the best place, but you make do. Wouldn't be opposed to coming here again.  It was good. Portions were decent. This review is based on the price and how the burritos tasted. This place is a ripoff. They charged me $ for  super burritos and didn't give me chips. Every other Taqueria i've ever been to in and out of the United States gives you chips and salsa,guacamole to go with the chips for free. These guys are idiots and i am never going there again. The only reason i didn't make a scene right there was because i was on my lunch break. They have a stupid sign up saying that all prices are final and that there is no bartering,negotiating etc. These idiots wouldn't need that stupid sign if they would just charge what Taqueria's normally charge and give chips. This is the most expensive Taqueria i have been to in San Francisco in the last  years. They will get no repeat business from me. I recommend skipping this place and going to Taqueria Cancun on the corner of th and Market. The burrito's didn't taste how burrito's normally taste. They are scamming. They aren't running a restaurant, they no overhead cost, when i went there i only saw  people, they work in what almost looks like a painted up wooden outdoor shed and they are charging more money and not giving simple things like chips and salsa and guacamole. I've been to several other Taqueria's that are actually restaurants,have to pay overhead cost, have several employee's and still manage to charge a good price, offer a better service, and offer things that chips,guacamole,salsa free of charge. I'm not the kind of guy who would normally feel the need to ask about things like this before placing my order because other places normally do it right. It would be like going to McDonalds and ordering a number  and not getting french fries. This definitely isn't where you'd go for authentic mexican food.  It's kind of in between Chipotle and what you'd find in the mission. Not everything is good, for example, the tortas and the soup suck ass, but the burritos and tacos are clean with reasonably not suspicious meats. But most of all they have an awesome salad with avocado, black beans, and corn. This review is based upon only on price. Just can't stand when a taco stand charges for every last item including papers, chips, etc. This will be my last time at this joint. Plan an extra dollar for items like chips, extra pico de gallo, hot sauce and the like. I ordered a carne asada taco here and bit in to find a huge piece of twisted metal wire in my food. I was obviously freaked out and disgusted. The kid at the counter gave me my money back but, there's not a chance in hell I'd ever eat here again. The one bite I did have was pretty gross and flavorless anyway. Great service!  Tasty carne asada burrito! Not bad for a walk up in a spot positioned to serve mediocrity. Got a carne asada burrito with some guacamole and black beans. Pretty decent. Conveniently located in an indoor parking lot. I've passed by last week and decided to order something from here today. I ordered a Jack Cheese Quesadilla with Chicken and it is delicious. The way the quesadillas are made here looked very interesting. Quesadillas I've ordered at other taquerias are folded up in the shape of a semi circle resembling a taco. I've found this very interesting and it's definitely culinary creativity. Another spot that will definitely satisfy my Mexican cuisine cravings. I am definitely coming back the next time I am in the area. I am craving for something else from the menu as I write this review. When you are here and you're craving for Mexican cuisine, Publico Urban Taqueria is the spot to turn to. Efficient services and friendly staff members. FYI: Cash Only A little suggestive sign in front says: Never shop on an empty stomach. I took the advice and got their crispy taco with % avocado guacamole. This treat brought me back to life after hours of brain drain garment decisions. Their crispy taco is the best, and the ingredients are fresh. I go every every time I need a boost from exhaustive shopping at Nordstrom Rack. I was really hungry and couldn't wait so I stopped by this little shop located right outside of Trader Joe's on th street. I had seen it so many times while going to buy groceries, but finally tried it (after I yelped to make sure it was decent first of course :D). Bottom line: Decent place for some Mexican food to get you full that isn't too expensive. Better than Chipotle, but not as good as sit down Mexican restaurants or Mexican places in the Mission (but what is?). I got the El Perfecto Carnitas Burrito for around $.  and it's definitely a sizable burrito that was hand crafted instantly and delivered into my arms within  minute! Blazing fast service, just how I like it. It was pretty much a super burrito with rice, beans, guac, sour cream, some other stuff probably, and meat. There was actually quite a bit of meat, like I could actually taste the carnitas and there were some big chunks of it in there. Second to the meat there was a lot of rice. I felt pretty guilty eating the rice and tortilla carbs. Gg. The girl in front of me got the nachos, and boy let me tell you, she had me wishing I had gotten those instead. At a price of $. , I almost turned around and went to order myself one, but being so mentally strong (minus the fact that I came here in the first place since I was hungry), I forced myself to keep walking and settle with just the burrito. The nachos had a lot of stuff on them, that's all I know. So yea, I think I'll try the nachos next time I'm here. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the pricing, quality, quantity, and service of the food here. How was that such a bad burrito? Maybe I am spoiled in the Mission but that definitely makes the list of worst burritos I have ever had. I can't pinpoint why. . . . It just tasted. . . Wrong Used to like this place but it's been going downhill! The Mexicali salad has no dressing anymore, the tortilla soup shrunk to half the size. It's bland and lukewarm. What happened El Publico? Gettin too much business because you're the only food place in the strip mall so you think you can cut back now? It's sad really. I eat mostly meat and vegetables and don't need rice, beans, tortillas, chips and everything else other Mexican joints try to shove down your gullet. Like jack in the box I realized Publico has a secret menu when I ordered just a bowl of meat. To my surprise I was presented with an enormous amount of freshly grilled chicken topped with pico. Seriously, we are talking about a pound of chicken here. Best part is that it is under $. I can trot into trader joes next door and spend more on raw chicken that would not taste nearly as good. The quality is high and the taste is excellent. If you are paleo, max out Publico before you go shopping. Best quick Mexican for best price I've seen. Wish they had better hours but the food is great. Good price  Soma is lacking Mexican so this place is great to have nearby. Be careful: they often close   min early. Highly recommend the super burrito literally the only place to eat in the nordstrom mall on a sunday. okay food, average prices, quick services Their salad is a great deal. Really fresh. I asked for a side of guacamole and it was the smallest container EVER for . . Boo! overpriced for barely an okay taste.  i ordered a rice/beans/cheese/salsa burrito to go.  i got it and i left.  what they delivered was a rice/beans/salsa and / teaspoon of cheese burrito.  next. I'm usually kind of picky when it comes to Mexican food. Most places I've visited have put a big emphasis on specific menu items or are known for their ""special"" sauce. Then there are places like this that are very humble for what they offer and talk a good talk when it comes to their food. I had the El Perfecto Burrito with rice, beans, and carne asada. Great flavors all around, like the world's best symphony orchestras playing sweet music to my taste buds. Although the tortilla was a bit saugy, it was made up in everything else. The chips were okay but the salsa made them better. If I were to go back, I'd like to try their tacos. A friend of mine also found them to be a good source for soup. Don't expect to find a hole in the wall, sit down. Rather, they have a small. . . stand?. . . located outside Trader Joe's and Pier  imports. Don't be fooled though, it is legit. There is also limited seating. But I'd suggest to take it to go, unless you want to be BFFs with the pigeons. Public Urban is a good go to. I'll surely come back here when I can. This hidden gem that is tucked away in a small city shopping center in Soma off Bryant and th street (Trader Joes, Bed n Bath, etc). Truly a hole in the wall operation with first class fast food!! Hooray for the Mexican salad, trust me just try it. The street tacos are also fantastic, as they are stuff to the max with your choice of meats. I like the chicken and carnitas best. I spent  years in San Diego, and this is the place the reminds me most of the tacos from there. Solid, tastey. Could use more selections, but they are good at what they offer. This place was serviceable. I liked the nice colors the menu had and the selection seemed OK. I was starving after shopping so I got a Carne asada burrito super with black beans and guacamole. I also ordered a drink. The girl that worked there was pretty cute, though when my order was ready she forgot to give me my drink. I was surprised to see there were no chips included. When it was ready, the chef basically said ""here you go gringo. "" I laughed, but he should be careful about saying that because someone else might take offense. I didn't. I give the lower rating because of these things that fell below standards and bang for your buck. I forget the price but it was probably as much as papalote. Cheap, tasty street Mexican food.  Good crispy tacos.  Try the pollo verde topping. Surprisingly good, fast and just what we needed prior to shopping at TJ's. Got the veggie taco and they were very generous with the avocado and queso fresco.  yum! Beware. Cash onlyHow can grilled pepper and onions turn out tasteless?Mushy rice?How fresh is this stuff? That is what I get for going to a taqueria in a shopping center/ After a day of walking and shopping the Gift Fair  it was a treat to stumble upon this place!  As i stood in line and watched other customers eat their yummy looking food, I couldn't decide what i wanted.  I ended up with a Mexican torta  Super yummy licious!  It was also really big   hours later, I ate the other half and it was still just as good.  It was a perfect ending to a long day! The Crispy Taco with Chicken was one of the best things I've eaten. Soft taco shell with beans, cheese over a hard taco shell with generous amounts of delicious grilled chicken and avocado at a great price. Solid. A little gem tucked away in a busy strip mall Freshly made and nice ingredients.  The chicken was very fresh and very nice tasting.  I like the location and decor of the stand.  Wasn't incredible but good enough to eat a quick taco or two.  Very basic. My favorit thing here is the Mexicali Salad: Two crispy tortillas stacked with black bleans, choped romaine, grilled chicken, corn, radish slices to add crunch, heaping portionsn of avocado and sprinkled with queso fresco. It is the perfect combination of yummy goodness. . all for $. . . . a steal! cash only. quesidilla's not half bad. This tiny spot with outdoor seating near TJ's and Nordstrom Rack offers tacos, burritos, tortas, quesadillas, salads, nachos, soup, enchiladas and more. The meat options are limited to safe, popular options: carne asada, chicken chile verde, carnitas verde, pollo asado. Choose from black or pinto beans. They are vegetarian friendly and try to use organic ingredients and local vendors whenever possible. The street tacos come on two small corn tortillas, soft and pliant, with onion, cilantro and salsa. Tacos are generously loaded with fillings. There is no salsa bar. * Chicken chile verde taco ($. ): big tender chunks of marinated local chicken had a nice grilled flavor,  the chile verde was too salty and sour, the red salsa wasn't spicy at all and didn't have much depth of flavor, cilantro was visible but didn't have much flavor, very wet overall* Carnitas chile verde taco ($. ): niman ranch pork shoulder was fatty and luscious, but I didn't like the chile verde (too salty, sour) sauce or the red salsa. The taco was way too wet again. I liked the meats but not the salsas. Cash only. Disappointing. Ordered a veggie burrito and it was EXTRA oily. On top of that, I gave the cashier $.  for a $.  bill and was expecting $ back. He insisted that I gave him a $ & $ bill but I am certain I gave him two $s. I argued back but then let it go because he was not budging. It's especially disappointing because the burrito was so sub par. had the pulled pork (carnitas) and guac . . . SO GOD. id go there again to get takeout!"
El Pollo Supremo|4.0|Latin American in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|118|-1|3.77272727273|" Chicken here is ALWAYS superb, has been for decades. And the staff is friendly and fun. That would be five stars for this neighborhood. Drinks are good, fried plantains have been alright. But then the deductions begin. . .  Really, really HORRIBLE cole slaw, just awful! Salsa tastes like water with red food coloring and a little onion, WTF? Tortillas: hot, clumpy mess wrapped in foil Fish taco consists of a greasy fried and breaded fish stick jammed on top of some sort of vegetables on a soft corn taco shell, flavorless calories. Again, they have some of the best chicken in the City (organic to boot!), why oh why does nearly everything else have to not just suck but suck BADLY? They coulda' been contenders but are stuck in the backwaters floundering along. Always blows my mind when I run across a business like this, Popeyes is a block away and has AWESOME side dishes. My recommendation: just get your chicken here, then walk over to Popeyes and get the rest. PS: this has no relation to the chicken place on 'Breaking Bad,"" however, if you are high on meth you may be able to bear consuming this cole slaw. . . Ok at best. Not worth the trip out the door. Chicken dry, salsa more like pulp tomatoes,  piece white meat comes with  wings. Need I say more Fried yucca is good. Chicken is good, but the breast was a bit dry. Didn't care much for the sides. The salsa was lacking in flavor. May not be the most stylish place in the Outer Mission, but the chicken is pretty darn good. Organic too! Great place to eat a cheap meal. My girlfriend and I share the # meal three times a week :) If you decide to share a meal, be sure to order a large drink as the drink that the meal comes with is tiny. We always get the potatoes salad even though the gf says she likes macaroni salad. Overall, solid place in the neighborhood. I would recommend this to friends. Chicken was flavorful and fresh. Got here a little after  and was the first customer. Parking on the lot was empty at that time.  minutes into eating our order people started filing in. I removed one star because the lady at the register was not too friendly. It was my family's first time in this restaurant and she was clearly annoyed when I changed my order from the family pack to the special. She wasn't too thrilled explaining what the Moro rice was. Sans the service from that cashier, the food is something I will return to. Please put at least a sink so customers can wash their hands off! The chicken is best eaten with hands, just to get deep on the meat and I had to wait till I got home to clean my oily fingers off with water and soap. I really, really like this place. I don't know what they season their chicken with, but I'm pretty sure at least one of the ingredients is magic. The restaurant isn't much, but we love getting huge orders to go. Just try and get it home without sneaking a piece. ;) My boss took me here for lunch and the first thing to cross my mind was ""aww man, he took me to fast food chicken"". Boy was I wrong. The chicken was good, real good. The cooks were in back with a huge, full grill of chicken. Potions were big and prices cheap. Parking a tough, it is San Francisco, but patience pays off. I will go back again soon. I love their organic rotisserie chicken! It's a great value for my family and the service is fast. They also have cool sides like plantains and yucca! This place is a neighborhood gem. The chicken is grilled to perfection full of flavor and organic. They have a great yelp check in deal. If you check in you get a free fish taco which is delicious. I have came here a couple times. I haven't been there in a while. But every time I go it is bomb. com. I love the sukini and the French fries. Everything is always so good. Just wish the lady wasn't so stingy on the cream Bombie rotisserie chicken. Great places. Free fish taco with yelp check in. The only healthy fast food around (order the white meat chicken and you're golden, pony boy). Back home in LA places like this are abundant, here in SF this is the only place I've found that serves up this rotisserie chicken Latin influenced cuisine. No microwaves and quite fresh. Why aren't you here yet? I really like this place! The people there are very nice considering the type of people I've seen giving them trouble. Reliable organic chicken that takes less than mins. I work near by so I go often and realized how much they deserve a good review. Not a fan of the $ minimum to use a card but I'm aware of how banks can be. Luckily there's an ATM at either end of the block. We could all use some extra exercise anyway. They have the best chips and salsa! Service is slow even if you call your orders in but the food is good. We always order the chicken w/rice and macaroni salad and of course, extra chips and salsa. As an Caribbean American chef my review says it all! # Stars Love it!! First off, I was a daily customer for some months now, with a consistent experience of sub par customer service, so I wasn't expecting much today. I arrive at the register a couple minutes after their opening to not be greeted by anyone. After waiting a minute for either the man at the grill or the rude little woman packaging tortillas to turn around, I repeatedly yell ""Hello"" and ""Hola"" to get their attention. I was either completely unheard over the silence of an empty restaurant. . Or I was being ignored. Once another customer came in, the man at the grill turns and tells the lady, who took another minute to finish her prep to come to the register.  So that's  minutes of my timed lunch that was wasted just to get their atention. So I order a large chicken soup. In regard to the food, it is one of two reasons I come here: the other is convenience. To top off the wait, the soup I ordered wasn't enough for the $ minimum on card so I couldn't complete my purchase due to not having cash. Even if I did want to add a drink and a side it wouldn't have been enough. Funny how I come everyday, and they let me use my card for transactions even smaller than the one I had placed today. No soup for me. In conclusion I gained hunger, irritation and a sense of regret for previously accepting their awful service. Thanks El Pollo! So if you grew up eating flame broiled chicken in LA like I did (before even el pollo loco), this is the only, I mean only place in San Francisco to get it. The chicken is so flavorful and the skin is crispy and delicious. The salsa is just right, a little bit of a kick but not too much.  times out of ten the chicken is awesome. But occasionally the chicken is overdone or burnt. So yeah, it is not perfect. The sides can be hit or miss. The rice, beans are pretty consistent. The corn, sometimes meh. Everything else is just ok. They used to have more fish and seafood but I guess they didn't sell enough so they don't have it anymore. They actually used to do a killer clam chowder with mucho clams but oh well. Get the taquitos & a Jamaica drink! dalé Been coming here with my family since the early 's it's good to see one of the restaurants or places that I've grown up going to is still open which is a rare thing nowadays. The menu seems to be the same and hasn't changed much. Their chicken is still as good as I can remember, it was juicy and flavorful and I didn't have to wait long for my order which is always great in my book. Can't say I'm a fan of their food. I happened to stumble upon this place while taking a stroll up Mission St and decided to order some chicken to try out. They also had a free taquito deal via Yelp. I ordered a quarter  chicken and taquito to go. I did not care for the taquito at all. It tasted really plain. As for the chicken, it was really dry by the time I arrived home which was a  minute walk. Even the leg meat was dry. The skin has a nice seasoning to it, but I really wish it was moist and juicy. Overall, I won't be back to this restaurant anytime soon. It's just not my cup of tea. amazing grilled chicken! Best Pollo Asado in town!! Hands down. Not many people understand the texture that a well prepared pollo asado entails. The chicken is savory and juicy when fresh out the broiler. Yet still very tasty when a bit dry. I've been looking around for a spot like this. Glad I found it! Would definitely recommend! Una estrella es la categoria que le doy pues tienen un servicio pesimo, he ido hoy con mi familia a comer a este lugar y estoy bien decepcionado , soy cubano y se lo que es un mojo para yuca , por favor! el mojo no es solo aceite y ajo,pero lo peor es el servicio. En ningun restaurante de San Francisco cobran por el agua de la llave , esto es realmente ridiculo , he pagado dos dolares por dos vasitos de agua para mis ninos y la han cobrado como si fuera agua de botella, luego , al momento de pedir servilletas y cajas para llevar la comida senti como si me estuvieran haciendo un favor y ni siquiera fueron suficientes para empacar. Perdieron un cliente!One star for the worst customer service. I ate there with my family today and I am very disappointed. I am Cuban and I know what mojo for yucca should be like. Please! Mojo is not just oil and garlic. But the worst is their service. I don't know of any restaurant in San Francisco that makes you pay for tap water! Ridiculous! I paid two dollars for two cups of water for my children and they charged me as if it were a bottle of water. Then when I asked for napkins and a to go box, it was as if they were doing me a favor and it wasn't even enough for the food we bought. They just lost another customer!! This is definitely ""The Real Los Pollos Hermanos""  and it's really good! I believe ""zesty"" is the word. Everyone likes zesty!The chicken is great, the sides are great, and the price is definitely right. The chicken soup is also fantastic. Great little hole in the wall that makes me glad I live in this neighborhood. Chicken is good if you have  min to hang around and wait for it. I have been there possibly  times and each time the wait gets longer and longer even though their main food is chicken! I went in this last time and I was not told the wait time was  minutes until after I paid. I was pretty upset and watched the same reaction from every customer coming in. A few were smart and asked about the wait and walked out instead. I sat and watched along with about  other waiting customers as the workers packed  trays and trays of chicken for larger orders that were being picked up yet the measly  piece chicken I ordered. took exactly  minutes and to boot their bathroom was out of order! This place is like a mom and pop El Pollo Loco that is less clean, and less tasty. What's nice, however, is that the restaurant offers a wide menu, even offering plantain as a side dish. I really wanted to like this place (especially since they had sweet plantain!). but unfortunately  chicken was dry, our taquitos stale, and sides were just  ""Meh"" We only order the organic chicken which we love.  Their chicken soup is also very good.  If you want flame cooked chicken this is the place.  Good, Cheap and Organic.  Have always gotten good food from here and glad they are near buy.  Wish they were open later. I was totally looking around for Gustavo Fring behind the counter.  And maybe Hank and Walter White in the parking lot. But all I found was good chicken.  And a cool ""super chicken"" mascot. I am quite happy to have an El Pollo Loco knockoff in the hood. Just judging from the chicken, Pollo Loco wins out, but I give Supremo a very close nd place.  I'll be back. El pollo NO supremo. You know how when you're starving everything taste good? This was not the case. I ordered the Fish and Chix ( pieces of chicken and  piece of fish) and it wasn't satisfying at all. The pieces of chicken didn't have much meat and the outer layer was charred. My fish was huge, the length of the plate, but it tasted disgusting. Barely had any fish in it and the tar tar sauce was super plain. Filet O Fish from McDonalds has better tar tar sauce! Horchata was not refreshing and it tasted watered down. Also, after I checked in a deal came up. Would've been nice to know I could've gotten free taquitos before I made a purchase. Healthy, Cheap, Fast & Family owned. Is there really anything else I could ask for? I have been coming to this place for years now and I love getting take out! I eat out a lot and I'll admit most of the time it's not healthy so this is my go to place when I need something simple and healthy. Looking from the outside it may not be anything special but wait until you try their chicken! It's worth the drive so I say go and be surprised. Good food.  Chicken, nom nom.  Just don't come close to closing time. . . lol it's the last pieces, d'oh!  Tres leches cake was great though!Service = okay. Prices = cheap. The first time I ate at El Pollo Supremo was in ! Ever since then they've been my favorite place to get some yummy yummy chicken and cuban inspired food. When I was getting my fix last week, I noticed that the chicken is now certified organic!  I was very happy with the quality of meat that they are providing for there customers. Just a few suggestions when ordering here, the plantains are AMAZING! The black beans and rice are also super flavorful and pair wonderfully with the plantains chicken and horchata! m. . . . just making myself hungry writing about it all :p I havent yet tried the fish tacos (saving them for my next visit)! Super excited! Wow the chicken was soo good.  I liked the fish tacos, but they were fried, and that was unexpected.  The platanos and yucca were all very yummy, we had boiled fried and sweet  everything was pretty fantastic.  The corn tortillas could have been better, but we're picky. Chicken DRY and too salty.  Black beans and rice ok, but nothing special.  Burrito tasted fine but kind of small for the price.  Will we return?  Nope. I don't know if they had a bad day, but I was so disappointed to discover that the salsa packages both had mold on them, and the plantains, that I usually love, was fried in such rancid oil that it was uneatable. We used to get the chicken dinner when my kids lived at home, and I had looked forward to the return. The sweet potato fries saved the evening, the chicken was fine, but no tortillas with a  piece chicken dinner? My family used to order food here during my middle school years but stop going by the time my brothers and i were in high school. Then my mom finally decided to order food here again after + years since she was craving for their grill chicken. Since then, we started to come back again. My family usually either the  pieces or  pieces family pack including two dishes (usually the beans and rice) and tortillas and salsa, and order couple corns as well. Their chickens are always good whenever we order especially if you're hungry. But Sometimes the chickens can be dry since the chickens may be sitting on the grill for a while. Beans and rice are average. Their corn, its usually flavorless whenever we order but its still have the juice when you bite into the corn. Will definitely come back here whenever we crave for their chicken or don't feel like cooking since its so close to my house As many times as I pass this place by, I finally tried their chicken a couple weeks ago. MEH. Service was good, but chicken was dry. Like, super dry. Basically they grill a ton of chicken all day and stack them on top of each other until someone orders. Not as many sides to choose from compared to other restaurants within walking distance. This place has a lot of potential, though. They really need to step their chicken game up. I don't get it. That's what I used to say back in school when calculus would try to be explained to me. I still don't get it. Which brings me to El Pollo Supremo. My wife would rave about how good this place is and how the chicken is and how her family likes to go here.  So we came here today. It's Sunday so they serve Lechon Cuban Style sandwiches. Which I usually would like.  But this place is called ""Pollo"" Supremo, not Lechon Supremo.  So here's what we ordered:Pollo Torta:  it was dry.  Dry as heck!  Chicken was dry.  Bread was dry.  This sandwich needed lube bad.  Mayo, salsa or something.  Lechon on the side:   I ate the Lechon with some corn tortillas.  It was also very dry.  Like the Mojave Desert. I ordered a soda and they handed me a little kiddie cup.  I think if they realized how dry their food was they would be giving me a large cup of soda.  Something to wash this food down with. Someone please explain why my wife likes this place.  Because Pollo Supremo is much like calculus.  I just don't get it. i know how to eat and i love this shit My second visit to El Pollo Supremo was a bit disappointing, and I figured out that the key to the place must be timing. The cook at El Pollo Supremo evidently cooks a meal for the dinner rush that he expects in the early evening and then, in my case? When my friends and I rolled in at eight or eight thirty? Served us the same dinner rush chicken hours later. The first time I visited El Pollo Supremo early and the food was good, hot and fresh, the second time my friends and I visited we were evidently the unwilling recipients of old tough dry chicken. While I appreciate the low cost of El Pollo Supremo in general? Nobody should have been fed this chicken, it should have been bound with mayonnaise into a salad, made into soup or thrown away. The problem that half of the reviewers had with dry chicken, coupled with the ecstatic reviews of other reviewers, as well as my own personal experience has lead me to believe that they do this the same way everyday. In a perfect world the restaurant owner will read this review, make a little bit less chicken early and try not to serve old chicken.  In the world that we live in I suspect and suggest eating here at six PM!Also? Several reviewers loved and recommended the flautas. I am not in agreement. The chicken in the flautas had an odd flavor to me, they were greasy, the chicken filling dryish and not that flavorful, although the guacamole and salsa that El Pollo Supremo make are quite good? I like it better on chicken. Next time I will come early and stick with simple chicken, beans and rice and yucca. Seriously? If the owner of this place cares about his customers then he will pay attention to the complaints in so many reviews of dryness and make better kitchen decisions. It is like eating at two very different restaurants and a completely inconsistent dining experience. Was visiting a friend in Daly City so we rolled over here since we were hungry and it reminded us of Pollos Hermanos. Walked inside, and noticed everything was clean and looked pleasant. Prices were nominal for SF. I had the Burrito Supreme(?) and my friend the torta. My burrito was decent tasting and well sized. Reminded me of El Pollo Loco, so not bad. My friend got the torta. . . I should've copied. I initially wondered why it was so pricey, even for SF, but once he opened it, it was monstrous, and came with fries and a drink. Solid. Will return next time I'm in town. This palce is so bomb. It's like a Mexican style BBQ place. They BBQ these whole chickens and they are so good, the skin is crispy and rendered down to no fat. They have a YELP CHECK IN OFFER if you check in you get free chicken taquitos and they are SO good!! Best taqutos I've ever had white meet legit chicken and the crispiest tortilla with no grease. YUM! The salsa is the freshest salsa you've ever had. The rice, oh that rice. . . . does me so good. The beans are standard, we always take the left overs home and mash them for refireds the next day. Oh and if you get the family dinner thing (whole chicken, cut up, tortillas, beans, rice, salsa) you'll have enough for   people for  meals or   ppl easy for one meal, jsut get extra tortillas. The chicken taquitos are a MUST have. This place has been a family favorite for years and is always a treat. Good price for a great family meal. I absolutely love their roasted chicken. Really don't know what else to say except it's great tasting and worth it. Their fried black beans and rice are also a favorite and worth trying. Add a side of fries and some horchata and you simply have a great meal. The staff are friendly, parking's usually good and it's not a bad place for either eat in or take out, the food's what matters!"
La Taqueria Menudo|4.0|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|115|-1|3.5|" Good food, good people! I think they've been getting better every time I come by. I'm almost never disappointed and they're all so friendly that I think they've earned another star from me. I had the veggie taco this time, and it hit the spot. It was much bigger than I thought it would be, at only $, which was a pleasant surprise. But, as my motto goes, if Mexican food is expensive, you're doing it wrong :) Ate lunch here. Parking at meters. Food was inexpensive, most items $. . We ordered menudo, enchiladas, and burritos. Beef in the enchiladas and burritos tasted dry and overcooked. I will try chicken or pork next time. Restaurant decorated in Mexican tiles and red table cloths. I have been ordering my lunch from this restaurant in a span of  months and have had no bad experiences with this place, but today it changed. I ordered my lunch at : waited for over ten minutes but didn't see anyone cooking. It seemed as if they forgot about my order and rushed my meal. When i got back to work to eat, I noticed that my grilled chicken was still very pink. It just sucks that you wait on your lunch break and don't get to enjoy the meal and might have a good chance of getting the runs instead. To top it off, there was no other order being made prior to mine. This is my neighborhood taqueria, and before last night we visited it at least once a week. Those days are sadly over. Last night I had a horrible experience. I don't think I've ever been treated so rudely by a restaurant staff member.  I ordered and paid for super veggie nachos. When the cook handed me regular enchiladas I apologized and said I had ordered sour cream, avocado and salsa as well. He yelled at me, ""No!""  He then consulted the woman at the register, and she confirmed I was correct. He grabbed the food from me, rolled his eyes and threw the food on top of the nachos. He then gave me a chillingly dirty look at shoved the bag in my direction without a word. Seriously??  We are regular customers, and I was just asking for the food for which I had ordered and payed!  That little temper tantrum just cost your restaurant weekly patronage. The food is decent, but I won't tolerate disrespect from anyone. Ridiculous. Good mexican food, but there is better further up Mission St. The cashier here needs an attitude check and a lesson on customer service. Without customers, La Taqueria Menudo will not be here. The cashier/order taker is the first point of contact with a customer. I'm astonished that the restaurant allows her to act this way. I went to La Taqueria Menudo with my boyfriend after walking around the Mission. We wanted burritos and decided to try this spot out after reading the positive Yelp reviews. Boy was that a mistake!We ordered our food to go and then took a seat while waiting. As we were waiting, I noticed they had fresh carrot juice on the menu. I went back in line to order a large carrot juice as the woman rudely says that they do not have it. Me being confused, I asked why it was on the menu and she cut me off in a scolding tone simply saying ""we don't make carrot juice. "" All I can do is say OK, right? Well, I asked to redeem my free soda offered on Yelp. That woman became very nasty withe me saying to give her my receipt and yelling at me for not having it in hand. I asked my boyfriend to hand me the receipt and she grabbed it out my hand. She started mumbling angrily and just said ""which one?"" As I couldn't understand her, I said ""sorry, what was that?"" She raised her voice once again and said ""WHICH ONE DO YOU WANT?!"" and pointed to the sodas. After making me feel guilty for asking for a soda, I asked if I could get my receipt back (since you need it to get your food). She said no and gave me a dirty look. I learned that redeeming a promotion on Yelp is a crime at this restaurant. As for the food, it's alright. The male employee handed me my food without being abusive like the cashier, so maybe not everyone is so unpleasant. Unfortunately that cashier was enough for me to never, ever want to come back. I'll be sure to let my friends/family know as well. As others have said in reviews below, there are PLENTY of better taquerias nearby to go to. AVOID THIS PLACE. Most of the time I'm here, it's not very crowded. It's usually mi madre y a couple of other people. The food is pretty damn good too. I love their burritos and super suiza quessidillas This joint had been my jam since i moved here  years ago. The pozole is fantastic and their tacos are always spot on. This place is AMAZING!! The place is clean, staff is so great and the food! Well it's perfection! I have been to many places back home in So Cal but this place hands down us by far the best in No Cal! The Suiza Quesadillas and the Shrimp Tacos were the tastiest I have had! And the carnitas tacos were so yummy!! I will def be coming back on our next stop to Mission District The nachos here are pretty standard. But the water here is terrible, it's room temperate and has a weird lime taste, not to mention the tiny oz plastic cup it comes in. I do NOT recommend coming here if your thirsty Basic taste what to expect. No hidden gem. Probably won't come back. Maybe if I was local or near by then in return just for some causal taste food. Something about their burritos, nachos and quesadillas get me consistently coming back. Not as greasy as others in neighborhood Food always fresh. All food is delicious. But my favorite is alambres and súper suiza quesadilla. / This taqueria has gone downhill since managment changed. The food isn't as good. . . slighly more greasy. I will say they have some good salsa verde. That hasn't changed and its one of the better salsas out of all the nearby taquerias. We were craving Pozole so we went to La Taqueria Menudo  loved their tacos already.   It's hard to nail a homecooked pozole and it tastes just like my mom's!   La Taqueria Menudo got it. I always toil between this spot and Mexico Tipico when I'm making a trip to Casa Lucas produce and today I realized that Tipico will always win. Tipico has great pozole but they only serve it on a certain day can't remember which, so I went to Menudo because I HAD to have Pozole, it was an emergency. My dude ordered chorizo con huevos which was really good, the beans and rice were good too but the beans had a pile of unmelted shredded cheese, which was strange, toss that sum'bitch under the salamander! My pozole left a lot to be desired. U know how pozole has all those accoutrement? Bitches love accoutrement. Especially this bitch. Well this pozole had no such tasty toppings. It was a bowl of good broth with like  small piece of good tender pork, a couple piece of floating fat chunks, like literally less than / cup of hominy, two tiny lime wedges and a shaker of dry oregano. Frown faces for days. Where's my tostadas or fried tortilla strips? Where's my effin shredded cabbage or iceberg? They're next door at Tipico that's where. The tacos and burritos here are on point, but I'm so disappointed by the menudo. The only other menudo I've had was homemade so maybe it isn't fair to compare, but the actual flavor of the soup was sort of one dimensional and kind of bland. It wasn't terrible but I wouldn't order it again. Now it would be absurd for me to come to a place called La Taqueria Menudo and not order the menudo. After all, I'm in a constant hunt for the best bowl in the city, and ironically, one of the best ones can be found a few doors down at the brightly lit Mexico Tipico. So the gauntlet's been thrown down on the linoleum tile to see who makes the best menudo. I came here after taking Jamie W. to the airport on a Friday thinking it may be worth a try despite some advance word that the menudo was on the meh side. The place is bigger than Mexico Tipico but also darker (photo: bit. ly/MsYl). The server at the counter wasn't much for chit chat since I probably looked like an out of place yellow gringo. Local families appear to come here staking the tables, listening to the Latin pop on the jukebox or staring at the soccer game on the big screen. Yes, of course, I ordered the $.  bowl of Menudo which they subtitled Tripe Soup for people like me, and indeed it was stock full of honeycomb tripe. There were a couple of good size calf bones in there, too, so with the lime wedges, chopped onion and cilantro bits all folded into a piece of foil, I was set (photo: bit. ly/HbyHj). It was pretty decent flavor wise, and frankly, I had some part of an internal organ with almost every slurp. It's just that the red broth was not quite as rich as others I've had recently like at Mis Antojitos, and the tortillas tasted a bit on the packaged side. As a chaser, I had one of their $.  Super Tacos with Carnitas (photo: bit. ly/ioZEC). It was a sloppy affair with the guacamole, salsa and sour cream all on the runny side as everything was piled onto two stacked tortillas. This was also decent eating, nothing more. All in all, I think the menudo here might be worth a return visit if Mexico Tipico is too packed (as it usually is) to wait. FOOD   stars. . . decent menudo but wish it was a bit more given the name of the placeAMBIANCE  .  stars. . . a bit dark and on he loud side with all the families cavorting about as they wait for their ordersSERVICE   stars. . . surly at the counter but the gregarious manager comes by to check on youTOTAL   stars. . . middling menudo may be enough if that's your only option I ordered a pork tamale and there was no meat in it at all, just cheese and jalapenos. I think the lady messed up my order. Also got super nachos with really tough steak and stale chips. Gross. Between  , It was a fun crowd but the burrito wasn't good =/ I have been coming here since i was a kid, it's the only place i go for a classic mission burrito   I always get the super burrito with steak, the meat is always fresh and tender and the burrito is HUGE and at the same price as other similar places so you can't go wrong. Another item off their menu I enjoy is the ceviche, a traditional seafood cocktail, a real treat on a sunny day; the shrimp and fish is really good  and always fresh of course. Don't forget to try their menudo on the weekends its better than homemade and always good when getting over a hangover. PS. It's a little out of the way but definitely worth it. Wow, I used to love this place. . . that's before they changed ownership and cooks. Pros: One block from my house Food tastes fresh Cons: female cooks do not know what they're doing wrong orders, missing items (I've had to return to the store several times to correct an order) the French fries are OVER cooked not just once but several times. not friendly at all (except for older cashier lady. . . . but she's been there since the other owners) fancy cash register for accuracy but the cooks don't follow what a waste of moneyIn a nutshell: I miss the brothers that owned it along with the young male cook. Maybe it's time to try the Taqueria a few doors down. Okay white people (im white too) don't be afraid of all the Hispanic people next door at Mexico Tipico They know something you don't. . . Menudo SUCKS. The only reason I am not giving it one star is I was fooled by their salsa bar and larger local than Tipico so I came here to menudo many times, UNTIL I GOT SICK OFF THEIR  CRUNCH TACOS! ( and I never get food sick, NEVER)Trust me people! Go to Mexico Tipico next door I worked in a Spanish clinica and no one EVER wanted Taqueria menudo always either Mexico Tipico, Taqueria Vallharta, Guadalajara Taqueria or Farolitos Taqueria. See you have choices! all these Taquerias are within  blocksListen to a local and avoid the food poison. =) I love trying new taquerias besides El Farolito and Taqueria Cancun (they are both very good), and decided to finally write a review for La Taqueria Menudo. The super burritos here are tasty! I always opt for the carnitas (fried pork) with black beans which resulted in a medley of tasty delight. A plus is that they do accept credit card. However, the one thing keeping them from being  star is that their chips are stale when you carry out. Plenty of parking in the residential area. Menudo is tasty and well made depending on whom is workings otherwise the food is awful. Sometimes the fault is on the counter person taking the order carelessly and sometimes the cook is the careless one with one's order. If one's lucky the food is great. We've nicknamed this place""hometown""! This place always cooks their dishes with fresh ingredients. We always order their tacos or their burritos. The meat is never overcooked or dry! In addition, they make fresh salsa and the green sauce is just the right level of spicy! They've also updated their decor which makes it more appealing to dine in. Out of all the taquerias on the mission, THIS IS THE BEST ONE! Please see my Nobel Prize winning theorem in the field of Quantum Restaurant Mechanics applied onto Taqueria Menudo, with particular mention of the  Crunchy Tacos, Pollo Asado plato, fish tacos, and all the complimentary salsas: chillo, pico de gallo, salsa verde, and more. Taste x [($Price/(. )(. )Portions)]_Service x [(Ambiance x Location^)]=HR! {HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! SQUARED} Love the food! Friendly staff! I love this place. I come here all the time.  Tacos or Pozole is my usual. Whether I'm hungry or just need to eat my feelings taqueria menudo is always there for me. Thanks for always being my carton of ice cream :)     Depending on the guys who are making the super tacos they may come out a little different, but always good. I've never had a bad experience here, great service all around."
Doña Mago|4.5|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|14|-1|4.46153846154|" Great prices, quiet and intimate spot right off the busy street. Best food on the block! Quick service, I would have like to have seen authentic Mexican drinks such as horchata or Jamica! Hankering for some posole. This spot serves up basic mexican breakfast plates to a blue collar crowd. GRAB A SEAT and take your pick. Everything is around $ or less. The posole was passable and helped my morning after status but not something I'd seek out again. The best place to enjoy original Mexican food  great experience Doña Mago is very kind and lovely woman. Totaly on my favorite list . Thanks so much. . !, You know just cause it looks sketchy outside doesn't mean it's not a good spot! In this case, do not judge this book by it's cover! This is one delectable spot! Their mole must be on point, cause when I went to get a chicken quesadilla, all I saw were plates of mole from the lunch crowd. If you want authentic, fresh, amazing Mexican food. . . Look no further! Yes the outside looks a little run down, but that's how the mission district is. The food is out of this world good, the prices are reasonable. They have a big screen tv with soccer on most times. They accept credit cards, but only with a  dollar minimum. Enjoy friends! I only tried this place because of Yelp reviews. It is truly a ""hole in wall"". Who knows how many times I've walked passed this place and NEVER thought of eating there. If I had a Mexican grandmother, I would be swearing that I was eating in her kitchen.  Chilaquilas con carne were so good. Also, like grandma, they don't really wait on you. Don't expect refills on water or coffee unless you go up to the counter. The tortillas are the best I've ever had  thick, hot and chewy.  Look past the trashy exterior and give it a try (and save me a tortilla). If you want Mexican food  like my grandmas home cooking. This is it. It is good and no one beats there prices. Dona oh dona. . . where have you been all my life?um it's a transportation device to another place in your food heart. . . . yes the chiliquiles. . . . so good. Came across this place by accident after realizing that Gallardo's hadn't opened at their new th St location. Really good, really cheap, really fast service. We were  munching on our eggs and chorizo and huevos rancheros in no time. Tasty white corn tortillas to sop up all those beans. I'll be going back definitely! Their milanesa is off the hook, and their tortas with that queso fresco makes my mouth water. The waitresses are super nice. It seems like all the compadres come here to eat, the dishes are like eating at home and the prices are great. I didn't give the / just because at lunch time it's always packed and we have to wait to sit, but that's a good thing huh? Means it's popular. Surprised there aren't more reviews for this hole in the wall that's cheap and good. And on mole Fridays (or Viernes) they're incredible!Two tender drumsticks slathered in a chocolately, not sweet, just slightly bitter, sneaks up on you spicy mole sauce, fresh grilled tortillas to scoop up any sauce that's left, nice rice, refritos that pleased even this whole black bean lover. Oh yeah and a strip of white cheese. There was so much mole that everything got a share of it, which was fine because the mole is really that good. Only downer was the ""salad"" with a slice of tomato and some shredded boring lettuce, but that was such a small part of the plate I can't bear to remove a star, that mole was so good and for get this $.  But you have to go there on Friday to get it, 'cause that's the only day they serve it. But here's a reason to go there another day: a steaming hot mug of champurrado, a chocolatey, cinnamony hot beverage, so good, but by the time it cools down enough to drink your mouth has that wonderful spicy after burn from the mole and it overrides the champurrado's flavor. So go on Friday for the mole, then come back another day for the champurrado. Okay, now I'm giving away secrets! Also known as ""Familia Lopez"", Dona Mago has the best food ever! You can get breakfast all day! (I LOVE their Chiliquiles, and like nearly everything they serve, it comes with beans, rice and homemade tortillas); lunch ( tortas, fajitas, sopas) and dinners; I love the grilled chicken/shrimp fajitas! Dona Mago's Rocks! For dishing up heaping portions of homemade deliciousness at an affordable cost to the consumer! I have been eating here since it opened, and the food for the value is still as good as it was in the beginning. Cash only! Great Burrito.  Just try this place out of curiosity because everytime I walk by after yoga class there are lots of people sitting there having dinner.  Well $.  for a regular chicken burrito, this baby weigh heavy in your hand.  It beats the $.  burrito I got at my regular hang out(sorry Castillito, Farolito).  The meat was cooked after its been sliced, not dry like those that have been cooked and then sliced.  Dona makes it juicy and flavorful.  The rice is done really well too.  One down side is they don't offer black beans, only pinto, but that's not a problem at all.  Needless to say I'll be back to try the Tortas since the other reviewers recommand it."
First Cup|4.0|Coffee & Tea in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|35|-1|4.33333333333|" Hidden gem! I stumbled upon this place after moving to the block about four years ago and I couldn't live without it! It's a small family run business with delicious food and lovely service. Breakfast: Best fresh squeezed oj I've had. Get a breakfast sandwich on a croissant or one of the pre made ham and cheese croissants if they have any left. Lunch: Korean BBQ burrito. I get mine spicy with kimchi and jalapeños. It's huge and flavorful and you won't be disappointed. You order at the counter, and while there are a few tables and high bar seating, I usually take my food home or to the park at ft mason (just a block north) if it's a nice day. It isn't open for dinner or on Sunday's (which I respect  these awesome people need a day off!) and it can get a little nuts when the high school across the street is on lunch, but worth the stop. I LOVE THIS PLACE! A neighborhood gem. The owners work here and take great care in preparing excellent food. The Korean influence on some menu items is definitely a plus. It might not look like much from the outside, and may occasionally be mobbed by Galileo high school students (at around pm during the school year), but it's worth making a stop here for something off the beaten track. Was in town for work. Wanted a quick bite. Ordered Korean BBQ sandwhich on French. Pretty good. It is a small hole in the wall so perfect if you are on the run. Not ideal if you have kids w you or you have a group of people as there are not many seats. This is the first non chain serving ""bagels"" that came up on Yelp in the Marina/Cow Hollow area of SF.  Though I was disappointed that a ""bagel"" only place didn't come up, this place was very nice. I got an Everything Bagel to go, with lox and cream cheese.  Would recommend getting food to go from here. Service was great (probably the owner). Decent prices. Extra change of .  cents for using a credit card. . . so pay with cash if you can. It's a good spot, for what it's try to accomplish. . . good food, with nothing fancy. Absolutely amazing! I have lived here quite awhile and have missed this shop somehow. I walked in and felt welcome and was well attended to.  I ordered the turkey sandwich on a Dutch crunch with avocados and cream cheese! I fell in love! I will come back once a week at very least! .  stars for the sandwich, which was surprisingly good, but small and they don't have anything pickled there (pickles, banana peppers, etc. ) +Right behind the ,  and  bus stop on van ness, so you can grab a quick pastry or a cup of coffee on your travels. When the middle school and high school kids get out for their lunch break, it's swarming with kids and make your life a little more difficult in trying to get something to eat. Lox and coffee.  Both worth their weight in gold. Their Lox on an everything bagel had jalapenos.  I never would have thought to add this myself, but I can't imagine this sandwich without it now.  The bagel was extremely fresh  enough to force me to brush my teeth again before work. The coffee was excellent as well.  I walked by several coffee shops on my  mile trek to get my lox, but it was well worth the wait (and the walk).  I'm far from a Starbucks fan (burnt, overpriced, and way too commercial), and this brew was just right.  I will definitely be coming back here on my next trip! The lady at the front desk of our nearby motel recommended this place and it was great! Delicious pastries we got ham and cheese croissant and some apple walnut pastry. Both were tasty. We would've gone here again but they were closed on Sunday."
Tacos El Paisano|4.0|Food Stands in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|27|-1|4.16|" Time: :pm/°F partly sunnyPurpose: Exited freeway heading westbound on Caesar Chavez. Message came through about possible start up. Pull over and message client back, about to drive out of space. Corner of my eyes saw this trailer with pictures of food offerings. Got out went over just to check it out. Set up: Permanent trailer on heavily travel intersection located on Caesar Chavez/Valencia. Trailer can be tough to spot as its flush inwards with fence.   table fence in next to the trailer with sandwich board ad chain to fence. Side window pops open with menu section above window for order/payment and condiment containers on ledge. Staff: One lady with heavy accent as she can understand some english but hard for her to explain. All I did was ask let me take a look at the lengua meat? She had a hard time understanding basic english. I pointed to my eyes with fingers zooming back and forth from the menu to her. Then she laugh at me and I'm not sire as to why? I finally said it's ok uno taco e lengua por va vor? She leap up and got busy right away. Cleanliness: Grade B, for a location with trailer this clean is pretty good. Condiment were in each section not messy or scattered around. Eating area was clean as was the trailer itself. Eats/Drinks: One order of lengua taco $. Comes with  pcs of round tortillas and about oz of meat.  Lengua was cook slightly almost well done serve not in cube cuts but rather like that pulled or jerked meat look. Since it tasted somewhat bland I went ahead a put onions, cilantro, lime juice, pickled  jalapeño/carrot, and radish. After that attempt first bite was good bit lacking seasoning. I had better elsewhere that's why I spoil from previous places. Products/Services: Tacos, tortas, huaraches, burritos, al pastor, chorizo, cabeza, lengua, tripas, suadero, carne asada, burgers, hot dogs, ensaladas, vegetarian, mexican coke, jarrito sodas, juices, water. Punch Lines: Inexpensive, smiling worker, place to sit, quick and easy, people/traffic watch, hard to find parking, not too easy to spot, cash only, mexican bottle coke, good verde salsa, fresh green lime wedges. Tradeoffs: First non brick and mortar place to offer cabeza and lengua that I've come across. Most establish places won't even consider having it on their menu. Such finding is really hard to come by. Final Thoughts: When I saw the name of business ""tacos el paisano"". I was thinking boy they're confuse here as paisano is a Italian word meaning "" homie"" or ""cousin"". So why would a mexican eatery name the business with an Italian word in it? I'm hoping one day I can find "" La Pizza Amigo"". There's a more formal way of saying and writing it too. Paisano in the street is like a slang word. Just saying but you never know these days as business names are getting more and more funnier. Overall I had a good little protein snack sitting there watching all the things people do on a daily basis. Best mexican food in Mission, the meat is really good, it's not greasy and very substantial. Plus they are very nice with customers!! i love this place. . . . not crowded, awesome lengua tacos, nice owners. The only thing missing is cabeza here.  But i do have to crown this my favorite taco place in SF. . . . tried a bunch in the mission random ones in soma. . . the only rival is guadalajara in excelsior so far. I got a Jarritos and  tacos.  Yummy  tacos, I was transported to Mexico city for a moment.  The weather was unpredictable as always and this time it was a sunny day in the mission.  Seating is a bit small but they do have some seating.  We had to share a table with a nice couple.  The hot sauce is hot. This is a pretty cool taco truck because it has a little section of chairs and tables with umbrellas where you can enjoy your food while soaking in some sun or in the shade. I ordered two super burritos which were $.  each I believe. My first bite of the al pastor burrito was AMAZING! And normally the first bites aren't the best but the first bite was definitely the best of the burrito. I feel like they skimped out on the meat, and the avocado and sour cream which made it supreme. Bf got the carne asada super burrito and it was good, not the best we've had but decent. There was plenty of meat in that one! I'd give the food a .  stars except the skimping out on meat part, but their salsa was weird. . . And to us, salsa makes a big difference! It was a kind of orange liquid y that tasted a bit. . . Weird at first but after a couple bites it didn't make too much of a difference. They only had mandarin and tamarin jarrito, $.  and water is $. Overall it's a decent place if you're just hungry and want food but you're not missing out if you don't go. tacos and horchata are great Your friendly neighborhood taco truck. Insanely LOW prices, and clearly family owned. The burritos are pretty good, especially given the price. It takes them a while to make the food though, because, well, it's family owned joint. There are open seatings next to the truck, which is great if the weather is good outside, but not so great if the weather is bad, especially if you have to wait in the cold while they take their time making burritos. A good place to sit down and have a casual taco Also, I've become mildly obsessed with their suadero tacos (brisket goodness). They are incredible. Who knew tacos from a taco truck could be so good?! Cause I didn't. . . but maybe because I shy'ed away after eating those fake stuff. . This place is a hidden gem. Located on the corner of Valencia and Cesar Chavez, behind a fence with some mismatched chairs and tables. I came on a beautiful, perfect day. . . . for a car wash next door. (yelp. com/biz/mr ecowash …) Not knowing what to do while by baby was getting cleaned, I decided to go for a stroll. That's when I stumbled upon Tacos El Paisano! I didn't think much of it and just walked past it  heading straight for the Salvation Army next door. (It's because I don't normally buy street food because they're usually overpriced. .  sad face #BrokeCollegeStudent). Coming back, I began to get a bit hungry. My friends always told me that taco trucks were the best, so I decided to try a Pollo (chicken) Taco. I always thought one order of taco came in a set of , but boy, was I wrong? Wondered why the guy gave me a bit of an odd look. . and now I know. The Pollo Taco smelled delicious! Added a few condiments on it and m, my tummy wanted more! After seeing that my car wasn't finished washing yet, I decided to make a second order! While waiting for my first order, I read a few yelp reviews and I thought I would try the Al Pastor this time! (Some reviews said other places don't usually offer this). Omg. . . before I even got the tacos in my hand, my mouth was already drooling inside. It just smelled SO, SO GOOD. I couldn't wait to have the taste in my mouth. I quickly added some condiments, snapped a few photos for friends (Instagram & Snapchat, haha), and stuffed it all down! Thinking about it is currently making my mouth drool. . . sigh. I admit I was also thinking about a third purchase, but by then, my car was done. Party for my belly over. . . :( Some little side notes, I came on a Saturday and the atmosphere was great! A band called Hipsteria was playing right by the taco truck, and it was just a beautiful day to chill there. You may hear the noisy cars and buses pass by, but the food was good, and the weather was great. Got a nice breeze coming in once in awhile :) I would definitely come back again if I'm in the area! Can't resist those tacos! Mm. $ for snack size tacos served on the underside of a frisbee. I had a steak and a carnitas taco. Fresh ingredients and the friendly service. You can't beat this place.  I really like tacos de lengua and you gotta be careful to make sure that it's fresh and not reheated. They're very fresh and tender here. The jazz music is great on the weekends. It's a taco stand. I KNOW it's a taco stand. I have had the tacos, which are good. Fresh, tasty, quick, cheap. But today I was wanting a burger. Go figure. What kind of moron has a burger at a taco truck? But, when I asked, he said he could do one rare if I wanted it that way. Ok, fire up one rare burger please. Mom had the pork tamale. She gave it a thumbs up. The nephew had a chicken burrito. Said it was tasty. But my burger? Excellent. Juicy, rare, well dressed with cheese, lettuce, avocado, some bacon, tomato. The meat was not typical hamburger. The guy had taken meat and just chopped it up and made a patty and cooked it fresh. really really good. Next time my mom is jonsing for Mexican and I am not? Down the block to Paisanos we go!Did I mention it was the best  buck burger I have ever had? Gives Joe's Cable Car Burger a run for the money. And the jazz is good on the weekends. One star off because even on a nice sunny day it's windy and really noisy with the traffic, but hey, it's a taco truck. Or a burger truck. Or something. Good, that's what it is, good! I've become a regular here: Everything is freshly cooked, nothing stewing forever. Tasty and inexpensive. Maybe the Yelp set in SF just isn't down for taco carts on the corner of Chavez? (Re:  reviews). That seems odd as Off The Grid gets incredible amounts of attention while this family owned authentic taco cart is what the original mobile food looked like. You can marvel as much as you'd like at that carrot julienne teetering atop beef braised beer on a tortilla, but nothing, I mean nothing, will ever top chopped cilantro & onion on a bed of traditional Mexican cabeza. Each taco is $. , and there's some mighty remarkable traditional al pastor off the spit with pineapple here. And for whatever reason. . . al pastor on the spit isn't as common as you'd think. In the parking lot of a car wash, accessible off Chavez, they've set up a shaded area with picnic tables, and the standard salsa bar. I walked up here on a Saturday afternoon and a jazz trio named Hipsteria was playing on the corner. I'd imagine that some might think of my love of this place as yet another example of the Hipsteria of white dudes who like street tacos. I just love tacos, love authentic meat shacks like this and the fine dining experience of being street side using the top of my car as a table. Perfect ambiance on the corner of Valencia & Cesar Chavez, behind a chain link fence. Noisy from passing cars & muni. You order from a truck & take a seat at one of the mismatched tables & chairs (this joint's got more seating than some sf brick & mortar restaurants!) On a sunny spring day like today, you can't beat this outdoor lunch excursion. Tacos are on the small side (think street tacos. ) Bf ordered an al pastor & a carne asada. Add toppings (cilantro, onions, salsas, radishes, etc) from a makeshift bar. My carne asada huaraches (thin fried corn pocket filled with mashed black beans, oblong shape) was surprisingly awesome. Meat consisted of medium sized pieces of crisp fried steak (an acceptable amount of grease was involved. ) Topped with tomatoes, lettuce, avocado, & cotija cheese. Large enough to share. Total: $.  (includes a bottle of Mexican coke & a bottle of fanta)Order taker/cook was a super friendly guy! Only issue we've had  the random hours this dude keeps! We've come by several times (such stalkers!) during regular business hours to find the truck shut up. They're elusive, but if you can get 'em while they're open, you're in for some truly tasty eats. Fowl play. Starts and stops with the chicken. Delicious. Grilled with minimal oil. Hint of lime. It's excellent. So is the staff. Friendly. Welcoming. Sense of pride for their little corner of the Mission. So why two stars? It stops with the chicken too. As in the $ taco and $ torta had almost nothing else. No beans. No salsa. OK for the taco. Way below average compared to others on the torta. Four stars for the chicken. Four stars for the people. An unfortunate two ""I've experienced better"" stars overall. Without  a doubt, some of the best mexican you can get in SF. They cook the meat right in front of you when you order it (they don't scoop if out of a vat like a lot of taco shops). The al pastor is my favorite, but the pollo is also quite good. Beyond the food, this place is excellent because it is run by one of the nicest families around. On more than one occasion I came up a dollar or two short (it is cash only, of course), and they just told me to pay them next time around. I know it is a small thing, but it means a lot to me. Get there early if you want nopales in your burrito, they run out! Decent. Ordered a cecina and al pastor taco. Both lacked char and the tortilla was a bit raw as well. Gotta heat those puppies through!! Street tacos  people! Yum!  I wanted something quick and filling while on my lunch break, so I used my Yelp app to help me find something.  This little truck got great ratings, so I decided to make a stop.  $.  for a taco sounded like a decent deal, so I ordered a carne asada one.  The guy running it sauteed the meat right in front of me, placed it on top of two little corn tortillas, then had me fill it with ingredients at the front of the truck: green salsa, spicy red salsa, peppers, cilantro, and onions.  Pretty awesome!  It was a tad bit salty, but satisfying.  Since I ordered it to go, after I finished filling it, he covered it with foil, but there is a little seating area next to the truck.  Definitely plan on returning! best new addition to the neighborhood!!i've been here a handful of times since they opened in the spring and i've never been disappointed. the lengua tacos are particularly delicious. the price is right and folks are super friendly. it is in the parking lot attached to salvation army on the corner of cesar chavez, so not the most intimate or quiet of spots, but totally worth it! (how long does it take to eat a taco anyway?!) parking is tough as of right now. . . they;'re doing work on cesar chavez. . . but across the street from here on valencia there seems to be parking. this place is all outdoors except for the llittle truck they do the cooking. okay.  the food tastes great.  the service was great.  the location sucks. . . and again, its outdoors. . so its kind of cold in this area.  don't get me wrong.  the food itself, well, the papusas.  can give it a star or two higher. the price for the papusa is .  each, which isn't a lot. . . but its more than  dollars which is how much it normally costs. it was quick and fast, and fresh.  she made it right there on the spot too.  she didn't take a long time and like i said before she's quick and friendly. the only other thing that dropped a star off. . . . they give this tiny little container, like you use for ketchup, or for salsa at most restaurants. . . its much too small a cup of the cabbage that goes on top of the papusa.  maybe if i had asked for the food to stay and eat there. . . but i don't want to eat where all the cars are driving by. . . as its windy. . . and i'm assuming i'm eating lots of particulates in the air. but this is a good place.  give it a try!  they have LOTS of things on the MENU. the burritos were cheaper. . . well, compared to some burrito places that is. These guys are awesome.  Tried their tripe taco, which was excellent, and their pork papusa, which was also great. They made the papusa on the spot.  Owner is very friendly and enthusiastic, their menu was pretty interesting, and they had some beautiful looking meat stewing that I will definitely try next time. yummy!  easy! quick!  love the tacos tripas.  love the food quality.  love the people.  a great little gem.  support it!  eat there! would hate to see this little taco truck leave the mission. Summary below:* Cheap  %  % cheaper than than the rest of taquerias in the mission* Variety  Tacos, Burritos, Huraches, Pupupas, etc.  I had the tacos and they were worth the $.  I paid for them. Portions are a little small. . . * Atmosphere  Very busy intersection and the ambiance is spartan, even by food truck standards.  In an existing used car lot and next to the Salvation Army. Good place for cheap eats in the area. . . . . . . . . ."
Ti Ti Cafe|4.5|Sandwiches in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|12|-1|4.7|" Freddies # is listed now on Yelp as having moved.  Actually, it just merged back into the Mothership on Francisco/Stockton in North Beach:   Freddies # (not actually called #, as that would be redundant)I had a LOT of visits to old Freddies #  and I loved the Italian Combo.  There are a ton of sandwiches out there, this is one where when you actually have it, you realize that it is awesome.  There are a couple of keys.  .  The Bread.  I always go with Sourdough.  I prefer Hard, but I'm told most prefer Soft.  I like the Hard because it stands up to the sauce/dressing, and it tastes better.  The Soft melts in your mouth with the fixin's  .  They are generous, and the sandwich it a truly solid meal.  .  Most Importantly.  The Pepperoncini Spread or the Jalapeno Spread (imagine like a tapende/sauce/aioli).  OMG.  It is THE BEST.  You mix these things together, and you have a big Italian style sandwich that is as good as could get.  I skip the Mustard/Pickles, but add oil/vinegar.  To me, the Italian Combo at Freddies is what I imagine the perfect version of this sandwich to be.  So, Ti Ti is here now.  I haven't been in the last month or so, but went right after they opened when they replaced Freddies #.  I was told they basically are keeping the same menu, just under a new flag.  They did change the size/pricing a bit with their menu.  I had the Italian Combo, and it was good.  Not sure if the trend has continued, as I know some businesses allow a limited window of transition when they change hands to build the regular base to the new banner.  If they still have the Freddies menu, get the Italian Combo. I wish this was open later.  Given the price of the rent and the type of neighbors, why doesn't this place ramp up the hours/volume?  It's good enough to hang, although they better round out the menu.  One sandwich is great, when you live a block away, though! It's true: in this coffee tea you should try the best coffe of SF. The owners are friendly and the place is small but very comfortable. Today I tried the ""Italian combo"" sandwich and it was so delicious! The sandwich was very fresh. The owner is very kind too :) No frills little place  only $ for a small sandwich that is plenty big (including tax). Ordered ham sandwich on a hard sourdough roll. It was fine, but nothing to rave about. The ham was salty and the kind that you assume comes in a rectangular shape. Roll wasn't quite stale, but it didn't taste super fresh either. Ladies working were nice. Would give a .  stars and a second shot to try the roast turkey. Came here today for a tuna hero on sourdough.  I was impressed with the attention to detail  on my epic sandwich, and it was delicious. Quality ingredients, and the two people working (guy who seemed like owner and a female) both were very nice and seemed to care, which goes a long way!I'll be back.  For more sandwiches! First heard about Ti Cafe on Man v Food in the Uk and was always going to look him up when we were in San Francisco. Stopped off on the way to Ocean Beach, it was just before he opened up at . am and we were second in line to a guy from Pennsylvania who was there for the same reason as us. I ordered the Lex Luther and my wife just asked for a chicken style sandwich. The guy taking the order was very helpful in my wife's case and talked her through the options available making sure she got a sandwich to her taste. These sandwiches are big and have to be cut in two to carry out. Sure there is nowhere to sit inside but we had done our research and knew that anyway. When you get your sandwich the weight of it tells you that you are dealing with one serious piece of lunch. We took ours out to the beach and had half for lunch and took the other half back to the hotel for later. We didn't need a restaurant reservation that evening. Easy to see why this place is so popular but get there early and beat the queue. Was sad to see Freddie's go. . . guess what?  This place is just as good if not better.  Super nice owners too! The new owner has really revamped the space. . . it's much more comfortable. . . the interior even has some art on the walls.  Nice touch. Like I said before, the sandwiches at this location have always been good. . . now they're great. . . bigger. . . fuller. . . no skimping. I ordered the Club with pepper jack on soft sourdough and recieved a sandwich that rivaled my thigh in size. . . ZOINKS!  This sucker is gonna take me two days to finish.  Mm it's so good though. . . I'm already looking forward to it. It may be a hole in the wall but this is a friendly, clean and bright sandwich shop. I stopped in and ordered a Club sandwich on a Friday afternoon and have to say that despite the Dutch Crunch not being all that crunchy, it was still one of the best Clubs that I've ever had. They also have falafel and dolma which will likely be the next things I try. Without asking, my sandwich was wrapped in separate halves. Perfect for sharing, or at least not having to rewrap the uneaten half for later as occasionally happens. The woman who made my sandwich did so with care and pride, as though she were writing a love letter in calligraphy. Wonderful smile, beautiful eyes, and an amazing sandwich. I'll definitely be back. Great neighborhood spot, good prices, large portions, friendly atmosphere. Used to be Freddie's, which had been around forever, and they kept it consistent when ownership recently changed. I work down the street and my coworkers and I have been coming here for years, and they have always treated us like family. Come check it out if you're in the neighborhood!"
Just Won Ton|3.5|Chinese in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|190|-1|3.7868852459|" Came here because a friend of mine said this place was good. . . it was ok, it wasnt great. I got the scramble shrimp and egg and mongolian beef for me and the gf. The portions are really really really bad. . . They gave me  pieces of beef and mostly rice. The scramble egg and shrimp was ok but small. I should have know the portions were bad based on the togo boxes, they were smaller than the usually chinese clear squared take out containers. Maybe its better if you eat at the place. . . I've been going to Just Won Ton for over ten years.  The food is always fresh and the service is excellent.  The won ton has a large shrimp in it mixed with well seasoned pork and bamboo shoots. , the dumplings are so good.  The Shanghi noodles is very tasty and the soft egg over noodles with oyster sauce is excellent.  For an appetizer, don't forget to try the curry pot stickers.  They are excellent and I don't know of another restaurant that makes them. Small place but excellent food.  Highly recommended. Best Wontons I have had in a restaurant.  The wontons have nice big chunks of shrimp mixed in with well seasoned pork and bamboo shoots.  The broth was flavorful but on the salty side, which went well with the wontons.  Normally I would have a problem with the salty broth but it tasted just right.  Ask for extra wontons. I have been to Just Won Ton a number of times.  It is a tiny little mom&pop with a friendly staff, great food, and low prices.   Like most of the Chinese food in the Taraval area, it tends to be high on the starches (wheat noodles mostly) and lowish on the vegetables.   The duck won ton noodle has a nice amount of duck and the won ton is pretty good. Not the best won ton I have had, but pretty good.  The scrabbled egg beef ho fun is great too.  You will see on your table a spicy bean and preserved vegetable condiment. It seems to go well on a lot of dishes. I would love this place even more if the waitress was nicer. The soft scrambled egg with beef over rice is bomb and their hot sauce is to die for! I was going to tip more than % but the waitress mugged at us for using so much of the hot sauce. =( Also, the portions are definitely larger when dining in compared to their take out. What a hidden gem!  Don't get fooled by its location and setup.  They're a simple and awesome restaurant providing delicious food at great price.  Their staple dishes are noodles with wonton and/or dumpling which are both homemade.  Parking is much easier to find than the restaurants row on Irving.  I'm coming back to try their rice noodle dishes and other specialties like porridge and rice plates. . I've been going to this place for + years and I can easily say that this is my favorite Mom & Pop joint. I love noodle soups and this place's egg noodles are on point  not the most flavorful/eggy, but the texture is perfect with just the right amount of chewiness. I usually get their dumplings instead of wontons, but both are very authentic. Their soft egg dishes and beef chow fun aren't bad either. Another plus is that I don't feel all gross and thirsty from MSG overload after eating here :) Finally, my dad loves their homemade chili oil (it is made with some sort of pickled vegetables and black beans. . . probably an old school authentic recipe that only real fobs can appreciate) and I agree that it is pretty good. When I was in college and visiting home for the weekend/holiday, I'd make sure that I eat here before returning to school. This hole in the wall place gives me a sense of familiarity and coziness, and it makes my stomach very happy. Speaking of which, I'm going to call them for some take out after this review! A hole in the wall type of place in the outer sunset/Parkside. I've been here a couple of times and will continue to come back! This is a rather small hidden place on Vicente that might be hard to spot at night, but it's next to the big seafood restaurant. They don't have the best wonton in the world but it's really good for the price. I can't recommend their soft egg and shrimp over ho fun enough! It's probably one of the better ones in the city. The waitress that is usually there is extremely friendly as well. I would avoid the rice plates. Most of their BBQ rice plates are rather small in portion but it does come with a few bak choy on the side. Want to come back again to try their appetizers that people have been talking about! Good service, good food at cheap prices. A must have is the beef brisket, dumpling Hoi Fun soup. The beef Chow Fun with an egg cooked runny over it is not bad as well. Ordered and they were out of my choice so I settled for the Mongolian beef. Super generic choice so it should be decent! Everyone sitting here is Chinese, pops says that's a good sign! (He's Chinese) ok I'm back to finish this review. . . . my stomach is bloated and rumbling and they were hella stingy with the "" beef""! Never again! Soup only here! Or that egg over rice plate! Thasit! Best meal in town. The wonton soul here is the ultimate comfort food. It's a bit hole in the wall, but the taste is phenomenal. Small in a cozy way, tastes great in every way imaginable! Go here. Eat some wonton soup and be happy!Every single thing here I've had is delicious. I always get wonton soup or the ho fun and it never disappoints. Save this place for cold wet cloud San Francisco days and you won't be disappointed. Cannot recommend this place highly enough. Is there a six star option because that would be a good start for this place! We love this place!  They have the best won ton noodle soup ever.  Wish we lived closer and could go more often.  If the place were bigger, I'd give it  stars but it's a small establishment so sometimes it gets crowded and you have to wait.  The waitresses are really nice also.  We love the hot tea we're served when we are seated.  :) Soft scramble egg with shrimp or beef, wonton with Ho fun is so yummy!  The deep fried won ton is the best snack! A hole in the wall but in a cozy and modest way. The fish balls and fish paste slices were super yummy and ""crispy"". Wontons were soft and actually had shrimp in it! I wasn't a big fan of the wide flat noodles (ho fun). The pieces were either too big or too small  like someone Fruit Ninja ed the noodles for real. . . but you don't need to get those kinds of noodles; that's just one thing out of their decent sized menu. The Sesame Dumplings though! I'd come back for those for sure! DELICIOUS!A hidden gem on Vicente, I tell you! We were back again Friday evening.  As usual, we had the wor won ton soup as a starter and finished the entire bowl. I had the tomato beef over rice which was excellent.  There was so much, I took home half of it for lunch. This place is a real find. What is there not to like here?! Food is beyond delicious if that's even possible. . . And the portion is more than generous. My god brother took my family here when he first moved into the neighborhood and I have been coming here whenever I get the chance to. I love their won tons, potstickers, their scrambled eggs with beef over noodles, and that sauce yumy. My dad would make excuses to pick me up from school just to eat here haha good times. I don't know why I never wrote a review but here it is! It's the worst when you're craving their food and their closed. . . . . . :,( Really? Only .  stars?I really liked this place! I went on a Sunday morning with my aunt and we had a wait a few minutes, but not too too long. It's REALLY REALLY small inside. We ordered shrimp and egg (to go for my mom and brother), Singaporean noodles, wor wonton soup, and beef and egg over ho fun. The ho fun was DELISH, def my favorite. Very well made, I would def order again. The wonton was ehh, it was good, but I mean not my favorite ever. As other reviewers have said, do yourself a favor and order egg and shrimp/beef/whatever over rice or ho fun. THE BEST. I love this place. I have been coming here since i was in elementary school. small and family like the food is always delicious i recommend the scrambled egg and shrimp over ho fun and their friend wontons are actual won tons with shrimp inside not just the wrappers place is tiny but worth it. Awesome tiny hole in the wall in the Richmond but great if you beat the early morning rush.  I had the fish juk, slippery egg with steak and chow fun, and gai lans with oystah sauce.  The women that work there are very nice too and thought my cantonese was cute.  :) One of my favorite places to eat. I remember my aunt would bring me here to eat lunch multiple times when I was just a kid. Food is good for the price and I love ordering the Friend Won Ton. HANGRY post.  I really like Just Won Ton's wet scrambled egg with beef chow fun, but I did not appreciate the FORTY FIVE MINUTE WAIT for my to go order.  Yes, the restaurant was busy (all seats taken, in fact), but this was no excuse, especially when a couple who came in and sat down  minutes AFTER I already placed my order not only got their food before I did, but they got their food AND finished eating as I stood off to the side and watched, hangry.  And when you do not appease my hangry ness, you lose Yelp stars.  Sorry, Just Won Ton.  Otherwise you'd have been a solid  star establishment. P. S. I did feel bad for another couple who looked to be on the verge of hangry.  They had actually places their to go order just before mine, but were still waiting when my food finally arrived!  I guess at least it wasn't just me.  Because just like misery, hangry loves company. I was very disappointed. I remember this place to have delicious won ton and dumpling soup and side dishes that I loved. Oh ok so it's been more than  years. . .  The same soup is now lukewarm and tasteless.  No more little side dishes so we ordered dry chow fun an a chow mein. They were oily and burnt. Yes burnt!  All I could taste was soy sauce. The reason they got a one is because of the server. She was friendly and attentive. Something has changed here.  New owner?   The quality and quantity if the food has gone downhill.  Here is what I noticed:  shrimp in the wonton has gone from giant to very small.  The shrimp in shrimp/egg over rice or fun has also been reduced down to just bigger than bay shrimp (the number has also gone down. . . maybe I got ?).  Quantity of food has also reduced to be non filling. Seated right at noon, the place is empty.  Throughout our dining,   tables started filling up.  We ordered the wonton noodle soup and the beef brisket/wonton noodle soup. Noodle is good/chewy.  Wonton are ok, looks home made/wrapped.  Soup is flavorful.  Portion is huge, loads of noodles and wontons.  Service is good. We have been going to Just Won Ton for decades. My parents would pick me up from basketball practice at Hoover and we would drive down the hill, all looking forward to piping hot ho fun and won ton. My favorite was the giant zhongzi, but their zhongzi maker quit years ago and they were never able to replicate her delicious recipe. Nonetheless, the ho fun steels the show, and is always worth a trip out to Vicente. The food is consistently ""pretty good"".  I haven't had a dish I didn't like yet.  When you consider the dirt cheap prices, that's worth  stars. From the just won ton I had for my husband and too for me the chicken was spicy. Definitely the spicy chicken recommendable  if someone take just it he or she must provide for this place at least four from the stock of five. The hot full black sauce bean with radish yummy. The waitress from where I got my service  was really efficient and friendly too to provide service and speech ok for coming in the next time. I was a little skeptical about trying this place because of  its appearance, but I'm glad I gave it a try after reading the Yelp reviews.  This place looks a little shady from the outside, once you walk in, you'd be surpirsed by its cleanness.  We ordered roasted duck wonton noodle soup and soft scrambled egg shrimp over ho fun, both dishes were amazing.  The food here reminds me of my childhood food from China, very simple and authentic.  Once again, never judge a book by its cover!  Another hidden gem is found! I have been coming here for over  years and this is the first time I have been disappointed and my wife too. She had the soft scrambled egg with shrimp over rice. The shrimp in the past were closer to prawns which was great but now the shrimp is closer to Bay Shrimp size! The rice was dry and hard. My wife asked for Hoi Sin Sauce and waiter brought Oyster sauce. Shouldnt he know the difference? I ordered the Dumplings with noodles and duck. The broth was not like before, kind of bland. The Dumplings were over cooked because it fell apart in the soup while the bamboo shoots were chewy inside the dumplings. The potstickers were ok but the skin seemed thicker than in the past and the bottom of the potstickers was not crispy. The last thing was they ran out of Coke. This is the first time the food was sub par and service was bad in over  years which isnt a bad track record really. I think the owners are getting tired as anybody would being in business that long. I will try again though. Good hole in the wall place for wonton noodle soup!  I have been here a couple of times.  The first time I had beef wonton noodle soup and the second time I had the rib wonton noodle soup.  The flavor is authentic, but not as enjoyable or my americanized tongue. . .  My daughter had the dumpling soup and didn't care for it.  Gailon is good.  I'd like to come back and try the soft scrambled egg dish everyone seems to rave about! Soft scrambled egg and shrimp chow fun. That's it. I don't understand why this place doesn't get better reviews. Their food is cheap, tasty, and just down home moms cooking. I really love their broth for their won ton soups and their won tons are packed with meaty flavor. Their soft boiled egg over their ho fun noodles are delicious. I asked for the noodles to be slightly burnt for that wok flavor and it was just perfect!! This is a must go back for me. Good price, good food. . . good to go. As an Asian American growing up in San Francisco, I strive for tasty Chinese food. Just Won Ton is definitely a go to spot for good ol' Chinese comfort food. Whenever I come here, I am greeted by the friendly waitress and seated immediately. I order my ""Usual"" the Egg/Ho Fun/Beef. I come here so often, that the waitress would already know what I want. That already deserves  star for the service! I wait no longer than  minutes for my food to arrive, and I am presented with a work of art. The amount of food is ridiculous. It's literally a giant mountain full of food for less than $! Just Won Ton is a hidden gem in San Francisco. Make sure you guys visit this spot for good Chinese comfort food in a friendly, family environment. You would leave satisfied, and a stomach full of happiness. Convinced friends to stop here on our way out of town to try the recommended ho fun with soft scrambled eggs and beef (modernluxury. com/san fra…) and it was exactly as described. Nice chewy ho fun noodles with yummy scrambled eggs and tender beef. Not too greasy or over sauced. I just about put away the entire platter. Another friend ordered the ho fun with soft scrambled eggs and shrimp. I didn't try it but she seemed really happy with it. Others ordered the wonton soup instead. The noodles were okay and so were the won tons. The broth was light. I found the soup a little bland compared to the ho fun. Between the four girls we ordered two plats of ho fun and two bowls of the won ton soup. It was pretty optimistic. I suggest you stick to less than  dish per person if you want to finish it all. It was only $ per person including tax and tip. The place is pretty basic but it's clean and not divey. Not much ambiance but that's not why you come here. I've only tried a few dishes from here so far, but I have to say, they are really good!  The soft scrambled eggs and beef ho fun is really tasty along with the tomato beef chow mein.  On top of that, the service here is really good and the waitresses are a lot nicer than those at other Chinese restaurants in the area. Take out was great. They're best known for the Ho Fun dishes (see back of the menu) so i went with the scrambled egg with beef Ho Fun for about $. . Very good, very friendly service. Food looked simple, but very tasty, and had great comfort. Very large proportion for takeout size. The lady gave extra fried won ton which was tasted great. Coming back for more. . . hopefully. This is my go to place for take out won ton soup. It's fresh and the won ton dumplings are great. The actual premises smell and most every surface is sticky, namely  the vinyl tablecloths and the floor. I can't really say it's dirty as much as everything is so cheap (even for a cheap Chinese joint). But it's always filled with local Chinese who seem to enjoy the food. So, the ambiance is abominable but the won ton soup is solid. Love, love, love the sui gow and won ton soup. This place feels nice and homey and way cleaner than the other won ton joints in the Sunset. Review only for the porridge. Bleh! Get your porridge jook somewhere else. Awful. It's not good. Should've just stick to the reviews and go with the wonton noodle soup or beef scramble eggs. Better yet, Cheung Hing has better porridge. Go there instead. Beef hor fun w soft scrambled. Would have liked a bit more 'wok hei' but the scramble was packed with umami and the portion size was rite. $. . Good service. Tasty tea. I had the spicy chicken won ton noodle soup yesterday and it was really good! I'd come back again for it. The bf had the potstickers, which he said were bomb! He also had the BBQ pork noodle plate and finished it all before I even finished my soup! A much deserved  stars from my previous review. I definitely recommend the spicy chicken won ton noodle soup! The prices are really affordable too. Everything came out to $.  before tip. Wonton noodle was the best I've ever had. Place was clean and quiet, with very polite staff. My friend ordered the soft scrambled egg with beef and hofun, which tasted amazing. The price of the food was cheap in contrast to the high quality. We also ordered the potstickers, which was also very delicious. Overall, a good place to eat with lots of parking around the area. Just Won Ton just offers cheap food, no ambience, no decor. the walls are bare. no tv. the usual rice plates, chow fun/mein, won ton, stir fry entrees. almost everything is ish. eats: won ton soup (. ) about  large sized won tons with crunchy fresh, tasty shrimp within. one piece of fresh bok choy broth was just msg enhanced, didn't drink the kool aid.  stars for won ton, ish for the broth. leftovers:  stars for cheap eats. minus.  for the excess msg fast. friendly service. should be  stars. Good Service, my waitress was very nice. The egg noodles used were kind of bland for my taste, the soup used was really good( i could tell that they really put the time and effort into making it), wontons and dumpings were on point :) I'm surprised this place is still open , I've been coming here since I was  with my grandma and grandpa , and I'm  right now , I always loved this place! Always come here to eat won ton noodle soup or beef stew noodle soup with flat noodles ! The prices increased over the years and is about the same as a bowl of pho on irving now   , however I always love this little place and the noodle soups here are spot on delicious! Much better than the noodle soups you would order at a larger chinese restaurant and the portions aren't too bad! , overall / stars! Your typical hidden gem hole in the wall.  Expect a nice meal for cheap. Not a first date kind of place unless you really don't want the second date.  The have generous portions of won tons with woodear, pork, and shrimp in the.  The pot stickers are also really good and crispy.  Their house specialty would be the fun noodles with egg beef gravy topping  I've never had that before, and it was really good.  Again, not much in the way of ambiance, but great grub. Comfort Food a couple blocks away from me? WIN.  I've gone here since I was in Pre school!Soft Scrambled Egg and Beef Ho Fun (Like Chow Fun)Won ton soup with noodle and beef stewBeef with tofu and blackbean sauce over riceHong Kong style (Pan Fried) House noodlesTheir hot sauce is full black bean with radish and spices.  Not exactly the spiciest, but definitely a more flavorful approach to hot saucesTotal mom and pop dive.  Every so often, I see the owner pop out of the kitchen to see how busy it is.  I remember him when I was  or .  He was kinda scary to me then, and now he's just adorable.  If you need extra broth, ask.  I think it's on the house.  Oohwe oh deamn. a couple weeks ago, a couple of my friends and I woke up at the ass crack of dawn, set out to SF, and then ran  goddamn miles. needless to say, we were starved after the marathon. Since the finish line was by ocean beach, we ended up passing through the sunset on our way back and my friend exclaimed there was a place that had the best won ton soup and ho fun noodles nearby. this place is a serious hole in the wall, but I've found that usually means some tasty grub is about to get in my belleh. we ordered the won ton soup, and the scrambled eggs over ho fun. I had mine with shrimp, and my friend had her usual with beef. one of my other friends is allergic to shellfish, and the server offered her won tons without shrimp. I'm not sure if they had these premade, or if they made them to order, but either way it was a very nice gesture. the soup hit the spot! I don't know if it's because it was cold outside, or I was feeling like I was near death, or a combination of both, but the broth was nice and clean and the won tons are tasty. the ho fun dish is some serious comfort food. a big ass plate full of noodles, topped with very soft scrambled eggs, meat, and sauce. ask for their hot sauce! the pickled whatever it is on the table is yummy too. if I was still at SFSU/lived nearby, I would probably be here at least once a week. Delicious:Soft scrambled egg & beef over ho funWontons Good value ($ $ / dish)Not Delicious:Fried tofu  dry If you don't like Christmas music, avoid this during the holidays :)  It's the aesthetic definition of a hole in the wall restaurant, a local neighborhood no frills place to eat. What it lacks in aesthetics, it makes up for in food quality. If you like Fried Won Ton, and are tired of other restaurants definition as being either just the fried wrapping skin, or the fried wrapping skin with a morsel of dried ground meat the size of a pea, then look no further than Just Won Ton's version, which is a robust full, juicy fried won ton, similar in size to what you get in the soup, so it's a delicious meal rather than a disappointing appetizer. The spicy chicken in the won ton or noodles makes the soup very flavorful and zesty, so I'd recommend those. Good, cheap food.  Awesome won ton noodle soup, and if you're feeling indulgent, definitely try the soft scrambled egg with beef or shrimp over ho fun.  The staff has always been very attentive and friendly. . Local Restaurant (   minutes drive from home). My Favorite dish  Soft Scrambled Eggs & Beef over Rice. I come and dine in once a month at least. Spicy pickles. Quiet (it may not be good for the biz owner). Food is cheap. able to take to go as well. Restaurant is always quite (business is slow) so most of the time, there's only the lady with her son possibly that will be taking orders from customers in the front. They're always nice and paid attention to whatever you need. Very briefly. . . We love this place. Low key. Good prices. Great service. Homestyle Chinese basics. Best dishes so far:Soft Scrambled Egg & Shrimp Over Ho FunWor Won Ton SoupCurry Pot StickersSesame Dumpling (desert)They also have a beef version of the Ho Chow Fun: Soft Scrambled Egg & Beef Over Ho Fun. Beef is bigtime chewy. Suggest steering clear of anything with beef for that reason. Dig it. We found this place on whim when i was craving wontons. A hole in the wall but definitely our new go to place when the wonton cravings attack! Would have gave them  stars but they're liars. They serve more than just won ton. Satisfying food is all I care about. Flavors are on hit at this spot, and satisfies time and time again. . . except when they ran out of BBQ beef. This place is a little dirty on the outside and blends in with the fog, easy to miss. *looks like is best to eat in, rather than take because their portions are smaller Like other reviewers have commented, Just Won Ton's Soft Scrambled Egg & Beef or Shrimp Over Ho Fun (that's chow fun to most) is their strong point ( stars): it is simple and tasty, focusing on the main ingredients and forgetting the (much needed) flavoring garnishments. The ""wet"" scrambled eggs, beef/shrimp, and flat rice noodles dressed in oyster sauce do most of the work to bring taste to your tongue. Any sweet yellow onions, green onions, garlic or parsley were noticeably absent. The noodles were oily but not greasy, if that makes sense. The other entrees my family tried were underwhelming and proportionately small for the price. Noodles in the Beef Brisket & Won Ton with Noodle Soup and Shanghai Chow Mein didn't have that fresh, housemade quality (more like packaged instant noodles). Some were undercooked and clung together from not being stirred in boiling water. The wontons were small and the filling is a tad bit better than dim sum quality. The Shanghai Chow Mein also left much to be desired: flavor tasted like Americanized microwaveable packaged chow mein and the cabbage was quite bitter. Spicy chicken won ton noodle soup after watching the US OPEN on a cold and foggy night just warmed up my bones. Also a big hit is the scrambled egg with beef over ho fun noodles. I read about this place online, and I decided to try it out with my gf. We had to wait for a table because it was a smaller establishment. The food was good, so it seemed worth it at the time. A few months later, it was my best friend's birthday and we decided to take him out. This was nearby and so we dropped by. Of course the restaurant was packed, and once again we waited at the entry for  minutes. Another lady comes in and asks for a table for . I was thinking ""good luck with that"". Well, another  min goes by, and a few people are getting up to leave. So, we were finally going to sit down for lunch after waiting nearly half an hour. The table gets cleaned, and another table clears out.  I was waiting for the restaurant staff to seat us, when they called in the other lady and asks them to sit down. I was not pleased since we'd been waiting there much longer than she was. I stopped the manager and asked why they were being seated first, and they replied that they had to seat the bigger party first. I objected and indicated that we arrived before and they knew it. Well, I decided to make a scene because I was really upset at this restaurant, and they didn't apologize for their actions. Clearly, it's more important to make a buck than to have good customer service. This place sucks. The staff was rude. And the food was just average. Nothing fancy about this place.  In fact, it's pretty much your hole in the wall, but those are also some of the best places to eat.  Now, ""the best"" wouldn't be something I would use to describe this place, but I definitely think it does a good job.  My friend has been coming here for over  years and it has been consistent.  This little neighborhood joint has definitely lasted the times and it's just nice to support the mom and pop's.  Bottom line: Do it! Very good prices, very small. Twice I've ordered a dish with eggplant and the eggplant was undercooked. Stick with the wonton and noodles and you'll be OK."
Chico’s Pizza|3.5|Pizza in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|200|-1|3.54929577465|" Delivery took  hours and driver was rude!After not being able to find the door of my building entrance I came down to meet him and he handed me the pizza with an angry expression and no words exchanged. As he walked away I could hear him cussing in frustration. Pizza was average  too doughy and bland. Taste improved a little when I warmed the cold delivery in the oven. Wings were not good either. I would definitely not order from Chico's again and wish I had listened to the other yelpers who had a similar experience with a long wait and rude delivery person. If this is your first time ordering, consider me you from the future and save yourself the pain. Good, cheap and opened late. Happy I found this place and will order here again. We ordered through Seamless and the pizza arrived quickly. Great pizza, great service, awesome wings!Ordered a family sized pizza ($. ). Half Hawaiian, half Chico's Special. Wait was about  minutes. Toppings filled the top, meaning no slice got jipped! Pizza was yummy. Only thing I didn't like was the thick crust. Buffalo Wings were delicious. Not super spicy. Was cooked to perfection. Will definitely be ordering pizza and wings here again if I am close by! The pizza is really good, my only gripe is that when you get it delivered is only moderately warm upon arrival.  I have had it delivered + times (and I live  blocks away) and only once has the pizza been hot, or to my liking.  It is really quality pizza though so I would definitely recommend to anyone. Delivery was quicker than expected on a Friday night (  mins expected, delivered in ). Pizza was the best I've had to date in SF. Delivery guy was friendly. Would recommend Not the best location but hella good pizza/food! Some people are complaining about a weird taste. That is the seasoning in the sauce, i like it but it does have a unique taste which makes chicos pizza different than all the others. There garlic cheese bread w/o sauce is bomb though and hella affordable. Cheap and tasty pizza! The wings are very good too. We had to wait  mins or so for our order but that was okay because then you know they're making it fresh. We got ours take out but they do have some seating. This place is busy and deservedly popular. The pizza was okay. The pepperoni was sparse and uneven. Overall, it probably wasn't worth the hour and a half wait. Delivery took  hours and  minutes on a quiet Monday afternoon.  The delivery driver's excuse was he had to circle the block to find parking because of construction.  But the restaurant is only  blocks away from where I had it delivered.  Couldn't he have just walked if parking was that bad?  I didn't even order pizza, just cake and mozzarella sticks and bread (don't judge ). After an hour and  minutes of waiting I call for a status update, and they tell me it will just be a few more minutes.  An HOUR after that, my food arrives ice cold and hard, slices of cake were pathetic looking to boot.  I asked for a refund, they refused, even though I hadn't eaten any of the food.  After that I decided since I paid for it, I might as well try it.  Had to throw it all out.  Cake sickeningly sweet store bought crap, garlic bread extremely salty. What really gets me is I ordered online, so the guy got his % tip anyway.  TERRIBLE service and food. Horrible food , speed of delivery and rudeness of driver.  Do not order from Chico's, here is why:Delivery time:   minutes quoted, delivery was + hours on a Tuesday night with no major games of any kind being played.  Called, said  minutes and it was another  before arrival. Delivery person: Called that he was downstairs and that I had to come down to get it because he couldn't double park.  Total BS as everyone in SF double parks.  I find him sitting in his car, down the block and I have to walk up to him while he is still in the drivers seat of his car.  He hands me the food, and drives off before I can even complain.  Too bad I included tip already at time of order, he didn't deserve one. Food: Horrible.  our appetizer mozzarella sticks were cold and un edible.  The pizza itself was nowhere near fresh, and was almost cold itself.  The soda was the only thing that was supposed to be cold, yet it wasn't. Overall: bad speed of delivery, bad delivery service and most importantly bad food!  Will not order from them again. As soon as I walked in they were extremely friendly and welcome to me to their pizza parlor. I proceeded up to the counter well they were more than generous and nice enough to tell me what their menu was and they were extremely friendly. By then decided to order Tuesday is the combination in  slices of pepperoni which is really good choices. I also asking about his choices which she was also more than enough to give me answers about. One of the best experiences I've ever had with any food place thank you very much Chicos pizza. Ordered pizza delivery from them for a movie night at our dorms. It was easy to order and they looked pretty good! Plus we could get   inch pizzas for like $. We ordered a pepperoni and a cheese pizza because we had some vegetarian friends. Unfortunately, after the delivery came I realized that they sent us  pepperoni. I called immediately after and told the gentleman what had happened and he promptly made us a new pizza and delivered it within  minutes for free! I would have paid for a new one but the business went out of their way for us tonight. Mistakes happen! Plus the pizza was yummy with a super chewy crust! Will recommend to everyone. This was a surprise spot for great pizza! Super shady location but if you're not alone and up for a yummy slice of pizza, don't skip out on this place!I got a slice of pepperoni pizza and it was the most delicious slice I've ever had!! It tasted like it was almost home made, plenty of toppings and realy nice big well baked crust!!I would highly recommend checking this pizza place out, especially after a night out in the local bars/clubs. Such a good slice after many drinks! :)Super friendly staff and fast service!! Awesome pizza! My family and I were on vacation and just got done with a long exiting day in the city doing all the touristy things.  We got to our room at the W hotel and had some late night munchies for some pizza. Chicos pizza delivered their delicious pizza right to our room!  My family and I devoured our large Pepperoni Pizza and  piece wings witch were the bomb. comI highly recommend this place Yep!  I agree with other delivery reviews.  My pizza was never delivered because I didn't answer my phone?  I don't always get recepetion and I even left directions on how to get in my buidling and a sign on my front door.  The delivery guy gave my pizza to the security guy downstairs and said, ""here if he doesn't come and get it it's yours"" Scary area, expect to get pestered for change and to feel enormous guilt walking past all the homeless people with a big box of pizza.  Good place to go when you're in a hurry and only have $. .  You can get a slice of pizza and a drink. Despite this Pizza place being a bit trashy and in an incredibly dodgy area on th Street, I am in LOVE with their Pizza. I think it's one of my favourites in San Francisco. Especially when it is fresh. I find it totally addicting. From their cheese, to pep, to veg, to even the Hawaiian Pizza. . . its quite yummy. They accept EBT as well and its quite reasonable for the price. If I lived in the neighbourhood (thank heaven's I do not!) I'd be ordering take away pies often. Not sure if they do delivery. Chicos is incredibly necessary to businesses around the area and as much as I fear th street its a jungle and its nice to have a really good Pizza shop on th. Much better than the other one across the street! Delivery guys are THE nicest I've had in the entire city. Food is good, prices are cheap, delivery is fairly quick. the wings, is on point! addicting! Delicious, fast, and friendly. Pizza, salad, and garlic bread were all wonderful. The perfect alternative to room service! I thought Fat Slice in Berkeley or Nazarrios in the Castro was good, but OMG if you want a fresh pizza by the slice, without paying an arm and a leg for it (combo slice $. ), come here. The slices are thick and nicely topped. Yum This place is literally the worst. I ordered a sandwich and a side of cheesy bread and they gave me an estimate of  minute wait time. After an hour passed, I called to see if my order would be here soon and the guy on the phone said the driver was a couple of minutes away. After another  minutes passed I called again and he said the driver was down stairs.  minutes later, the doorbell rang and the driver was there with my food. I open it up, and SHOCK, my food is cold and stale. I take a bite of the sandwich to see if its any better than the bread which you can see right off the bat is disgusting and it was just as bad. I call the restaurant and ask them to refund the food, and he says he can only refund it if it is untouched. I was shocked! I had just waited TWICE as long as they had told me, and then they brought me ice cold and stale food and refused to refund it since I had tried it. DO NOT EAT HERE! Delivery was a little shady. . . Guy in unmarked SUV. But what else do you expect when you order a pizza at midnight? Pizza itself wasn't bad. . . But not something we would eat sober. . . . Nonetheless a medium veggie pizza was $.   that includes free delivery. Chico! Late night pizza up in the TL! It was pretty good taste wise but it's just a normal pizza. Quality is on the low end but decent food. Don't be out too late and just deliver man. We stayed at a Hotel and had delivery from this place. They delivered in  minutes as promised right to our hotel room. The pizza was average and crust had cardboard texture. I won't recommend based about the crust. $ for a slice of cheese and a can of coke. You really can't beat that when you're craving something greasy and quick. A drunk homeless guy came in and bothered me while I ate asking for money, so I probably won't come back to sit down, but I'll definitely order something for delivery. This used to be one of my favorite pizza spots. They knew my address and everything. Tonight I called for a pizza. One hour later I called again, but no one picked up. Then I called  more times to try to reach someone  minutes later. Finally, someone picked up and told me my order wasn't taken. Pretty terrible service if they can't take orders into account. Never depend on their service. That's all I say. This place is terrible. Food is not even ""just okay"" and the service is phenomenally dumpy. Add an hour to the estimated delivery time too. I heard they had a serious rat problem too, and the owner cant read well. Uhmm, nothing much. I only ordered from this place because first We were very hungry, pizza place near home and it was a deal of  pizzas plus coke for twenty something dollars. We ordered and the phone guy said that would take  minutes to one hour delivery. Okay, past : and I think they forgot to make the order, so I talked to the phone guy and he said pay only $, the pizza will be deliver in minutes. Okay, the pepperoni pizza is okay, very cheesy (good), little pepperoni and thick crust (don't like). I loved the great pizza and delicious buffalo wings ! I was at work and ordered for delivery. Delivery person very good service and over the phone they where very helpful thank you Chicos ! Next time I think of pizza at work will think of Chicos Pizza was really good every time I order from them i order a small veggie pizza and it be great an there open late! Pizza which was so awesome to have and very perfect to think that this is one of the busy pizza servicing place. It was friendly experience at this loction for some great and awesome setting as well. The charge is fair and very great here. Would you like to be the place but I will be here. They were on time, pizza was still warm and delicious. Hand tossed pizza that reminds me of my favorite pizza place from my hometown.  Have a few pizza places in my neighborhood, but found my new go to :) seriously?? an hour and a half for delivery?  min late? and rude on the phone!! never again. Had a late night craving and this place hit the spot. Cheap and tasty! Delivered at estimated time and delivery person was in and out. This is my go to pizza spot whenever I'm wanting some. They also have fast delivery, great service and very reasonable prices. When every other locally owned pizza place is over charging you because you're in San Francisco, make sure to get Chico's. You won't find better pizza at their great prices. Definitely recommend. Awesome pizza.  Awesome price.  Well rounded deal. Don't let the neighborhood scare you away. Rather than contribute, I normally only consume information on Yelp. But, I had to brush the dust off my keyboard for this place. I was in San Francisco for the MacIT conference, and ate Chico's  times. The service was wonderful, the delivery guys were quick and friendly, and the Pizza was Awesome. Thick crust, lots of cheese, and they don't hold back on toppings. I walked by the storefront one night on the way to a conference event, and it is in a very sketchy area of the city. Do yourself a favor and get it delivered. Found them on Eat, this is now my ""regular"" place for pizza. Good portions and fresh ingredients. . . no fake Italian sausage.  Their prices is the best part!  I'm a satisfied customer.  Thank you! I hate walking here but their pizza is so good and the walk from my bfs house isn't far. Anyway, their pizza. Love it. So good so cheesy! I love how the bread sauce cheese ratio is so balanced. My bf said they had a price increase but so we don't go as much but when we do, it's so worth it. ""Perfect drunk food"" is a phrase we often use for Chico's slices. Hot slices, large toppings, cheap prices  one of the best simple slice joints in my hometown. We ordered online and they have taken an hour and a half. We still havent received our food. I called in a half an hour ago and they said it would be  to  minutes. I would NOT recommend this restaurant. I really enjoyed this pizza. Good flavor. Good chew to the crust. Good smell. And the price was right. Great jorb. For what it is Chico's is great. They make a great simple pizza, if you want bone marrow I think you should look elsewhere but if you want a basic pizza with sausage and pepperoni this is the spot. The neighborhood isn't great, call in your order if you want a whole pizza this is not the place you want to stand around at for  minutes. And be ready for random people on the street to ask you for a slice on your walk home or car. The pizza is what I am used to from the midwest, not fancy but good. Lots of cheese and toppings and a low amount of sauce compared to most pizza places in SF. The crust/dough isn't to die for but it's decent. Overall this is a superb late night pizza to go place. Three stars because the pizza is good. But it takes forever! I live a littleOver  blocks away and it's been over  minutes. That is ridiculous. Crust is very good. Wings are pretty good but stick to the foil too much. Definite room to improve on delivery times. Edit.  star. I called to ask where the pizza was and they didn't seem to care. ZERO STARS! Terrible service! Over an HOUR late. Pizza was cold and I refused it. Driver was so angry. He called my cell and left a message filled with profanity. I will continue to tell me friends about the terrible ETA and customer service. Don't get me wrong, the little slice of crackdown that Chico's located in is and has been my home for sometime. Chico's though. . it tastes like the cheese is plastic based. Enough said. Go to tulan. Purchased a Pesto Salad form their location on Eddy St around :pm, right before my shift.  As i am eating the salad, I noticed a fly on top of my lettuce.  I quickly called them to explain my situation and the guy was adamant about me not telling the truth. ( really, would i go through the trouble to lie to u about having a fly on my $ salad) This place kinda grew on me. Had a friend back in ' who introduced me to Chico's. At first for some reason, wasn't very impressed. It was okay the first time I tried it but nothing special. Tonight I just ordered an extra large pepperoni for my roommate and I,and gotta say it's really hitting the spot. Got here very fast. . . The dough tastes kinda odd/interesting at first(kinda soggy yet crispy? lol) but it's not bad combining  it with the consistancy of the sauce they use which is actually pretty good. The quality tastes kinda like Cybelle's but maybe a little better. Not the best I've ever had but definitely good for those  late night munchies. Excellent fast delivery(although personally I wouldn't ever go there. . th street not my favorite part of town). . I would order from here again. Do you remember the end of ""The Blair Witch Project"" when the pushy girl keeps screaming and follows Mike downstairs. Then we see Mike standing in the corner, and she drops her camera and it keeps rolling. Remember that classic freak out scene? I think that would be a typical evening at Chico's Pizza, only nobody would pay attention since you're more than likely to hear somebody screaming on that adventuresome block of th Street anyway. I guess I must be Mike in this allegory since I took my life into my own hands, walked briskly from Mission and decided to get a $ slice of anything. I pointed at the Pepperoni Pizza (photo: bit. ly/bdFOw) and smiled nervously, even though the staff here is amazingly cordial. What I thought was semi amusing is that I didn't ask for it to go, but they packaged it up in a box anyway figuring I wanted to get the hell out of Dodge. No, I like to live on the edge and decided to eat it at the empty counter toward the back wall. That was me standing in the corner. Did the Blair Witch possess me and make me wait to be murdered? Not really. The pizza was searingly hot and pretty good really. Thin crust, plenty of pepperoni and cheese. Four star good? Well, I wouldn't go that far, a tad greasy for my faux epicurean taste, but kudos to the server who gave me an extra half slice (photo: bit. ly/VeFAI). But of course, that meant I had to stand in the corner that much longer. Will this movie never end? (cue for a high pitched movie scream) Oh wait, was that me?FOOD   stars. . . generous slices, kinda greasy but you can't beat the priceAMBIANCE  .  stars. . . you're kidding, right?SERVICE   stars. . . courageously great attitudes from the staffTOTAL   stars. . . run, Ed, run! It's a small spot without much room, but it's worth a visit. They sell by the slice (which really appeals to me since that's the Jersey way) or by the pie, so you can get dinner to go or just have a snack while walking down the street. The fellow behind the counter was friendly and the service was quick.  I had the combination pizza and really enjoyed it.  Being from the Northeast, I tend to prefer thin crust so I can fold my slice in half, but this slightly thicker crust was tasty.  The fellow described it as Chicago Style, but I would put it closer to a Chicago / New York fusion. If you're walking down the street and need a bite to eat, I suggest stopping in for a slice. Facts are: I'm lazy. I work late at night. Same with the boyfriend. So we have often settled for mediocre late night delivery places because we get home after am, and if there's nothing in the fridge, what else can you do?But Chico's! I'm not sure when exactly they started appearing on my options for Eat, but it has changed our lives. We are happier, kinder to each other, better looking, and our libidos are out of control!. . . I mean  this place is magic. The pizza is excellent. Their sandwiches are delicious and piled HIGH with everything you want (particularly the Big Daddy sandwich  omnomnom). They have Snapple. They are incredibly obliging about special requests. Sometimes they run out of the Snapple you asked for, but what does Fernando (the most wonderful delivery guy EVER) do? He apologizes for the lack of, say, Peach Snapple, and presents you with a *BAG* of ice cold drinks to choose from. Actually, I assumed he was ""Chico"" himself until I asked his name last night, just because his customer service is outstanding and he truly seems to appreciate our patronage in a way that you generally only get from an owner or manager. Love this place. Fast delivery very good sandwiches (( pizza yummy )) I love this place (: Ordered the Calif Pizza, great but would have been  stars if they had remembered the mushrooms I ordered on the pizza. Salads were fresh and tasty. We got delivery and the order showed up on time which is great.   But everythinh was room temperature and they forgot all the extras. Major bummer. You only have one chance to make a first impression. I ate there the best cheeseburger in SF i'd love to go back there again. . very nice stuff and very clean kitchen which is not usual for Tenderloin area. . . These guys are awesomely fast for delivery.  Even their basic cheese pizza does it for me.  Very well priced, friendly and very accommodating. Definitely, suggest for a busy parents with  crazed children seeking pizza.  They are my kid's favs. I grew up in the neighborhood so this was the only pizza place around. For a $ slice of pizza it's really not that bad! Not too thin, not too much sauce, and just enough cheese. I love their sandwiches though! And they open until am on weekends for the drunkies. The only reason why I gave them  stars is because there's a lot of crack heads and bums in the area, but that's nothing new on sixth street! After I left Mezzanine around ish, everybody was kind of marching down the alley like Zombies. . . turn the corner and march down th the street past Monarch and people are going into Chico's, so I'm like, yeah, I'll go. It's /, which is great. . . because I. WAS. HUNGRY!  I was pissed off because  guys walking in before me and one of them was one of those indecisive mofos that sits there going ""uh. . . um. . . "" for like  minutes. So his friends ordered real quick. This gave me time to decide want I wanted: Pepperoni, and the Supreme one with bell peppers sausage, pepperoni, and all that. So Now I'm hungry and even this guy's friends are like ""Come one man just decide. . . . "" and the two guys behind the counter are like ""Just decide. . . . please we have other customers waiting. . . "" So finally it was my turn and I ordered and I got the pizza slices (which are huge by the way), and a Snapple. I like the fact all the drinks are in the fridge and they are ICE COLD.  It came out to a little under $, so the young man said, I' going to add the $ cents to make it an even $. At first I was ""Huh?"", but then I was like whatever. . . plus I understand and most places have limits anyways. . . and businesses get charged for every card transaction so. . . whatever.  If that bothers you, pay cash. :) But I brought $ with me on this whole trip, lol. The pizza was hot and I could've even stayed to eat and watch tv on a booth but I just decided to take my food and enjoy it in my room across the street. :)It came in a cute little pizza box and when I got back to my room and sat on the bed and ate that pizza, and drank that ice cold Snapple I was in heaven. The cheese was very gooey and good. It is not the healthiest. . . I mean it is pizza! But it really hit the spot, so thank you Chico's pizza. And. . . why are people complaining about the neighborhood. I'm getting tired of it on every page that belongs to a SOMA business. Ok. . . the Tenderloin is close by; there are homeless people in every state in every city. They never bother me or even beg. Get over yourselves please. . . They added extra mozzarella cheese on my slice of pepperoni :DThe only con is that the bathroom is yucky because Chico's seems to be an establishment oft visited by homeless folk. LOVE LOVE LOVE! I've been in SF for a year now, and have continuously been unimpressed with the pizza I've tried. That has just changed! Chico's Pizza has fantastic crust, they overload their pizza with tons of fresh cheese and delicious toppings (finally, a place that doesn't skimp) and the guys who work there are super friendly! I wish I had known about this place sooner. Don't judge this establishment on it's location. It's not that bad, and once you've tasted that slice of heaven, you'll know it was so worth it :) This is the best pizza place in the soma that i have ordered from. These guys are fast. I ordered online and they had my pizza here in less then  mins from  blocks away. They have much better pricing then most other places. All the different types of pizza cost the same no matter which one you order. Adding toppings cost extra like normal. The pizza is good and hot. I have ordered from other places that the pizza didn't taste good. I used to order from SF Pizza. SF Pizza was  block away and took almost an hour. Chicos is  blocks away and took under  mins.  Highly recommended. I haven't been inside but i do order take out. It's nice to see the history Chico's has with the community posted on their walls (yes, including the surveillance camera photo of Jay Leno! LOL) . Whether your eating it for lunch, dinner, or a highly focused sober session; This is the place to be! to all the people complaining about ambience: it's at th and mission. what did you expect? gary danko?the pizza here is AMAZING. they're open late, so i like to stop there on my way back from a night out. they have the best veggie slice in sf. veggie is my favorite, and they do it well. the crust is great, and they have all the stuff i like on it. they're one of the few places that has figured out how to put fresh tomatoes on a pizza without making it soggy. i've never had delivery, but i've heard that this is one of the few places that will deliver to treasure island, which is convenient if you live out there. the only thing is. . . yeah, it's at th and mission. there are some interesting characters there. i only go after dark if i'm with people, or able to park right out front. but there's nothing the restaurant can do about the people on the street. The absolute BEST BBQ Chicken Pizza ever! It's not on the menu, it's a hidden treasure, so just ask for it! With a living social deal,  slices are $. The crust was crisp and the service was fast. In a sketchy area though its worth a try. Stopped in on Saturday November th,  before the Red Bull event. Ordered the $ slice and drink combo. The pesto slice was a cheese slice that was already made  and then had the toppings added to it when you ordered and then recooked in the oven before being served. As I attempted to eat the slice  one of the most disgusting homeless people I have ever seen in my life with no shoes on entered the facility and stood next to me. I nearly threw up  and walked out unable to finish the / of slice that was left. Overall, this might have been one of the worse slices of pizza I have ever ate in my life and I doubt I will ever be back. The best pizza in SOMA  i just get cheese & pineapple, but the crust is phe nom nom nom enal. & a large single topping for just $ AND free delivery?! Chico has got my back  thanks Cheeks! Ordered an XL cheese from Eat at :PM on a Monday night.  Arrived at :AM.  Literally**the worst**pizza I have ever eaten.  the cheese inspired product masquerading as dairy is this dry, salty, unmelted (unmeltable?) substance, which retains the outlines of each and every shredded piece.  I seriously question whether there is any real food, anything that once came in a package with nutrition facts on it, anywhere in this absolute f*cking sacrilege of a pizza.  Half eaten Chuckie Cheese pizza left on a toddler spit covered table for four hours would be cuisine up against this nonsense.  The wet tasteless in flight circular sodium nugget, served  on an off season red eye TWA flight to Orlando just before the company went belly up, would be a marked improvement.  I would rather get hepatitis than eat this sh*t again.  Am I getting through to you?  Chico's, you should be so, so ashamed of yourself.  Whoever made this should be fired and dragged by an angry mob to Times Square for a public execution. /spitsoh, and it was cold. HANDS DOWN, BEST PIZZA BY THE SLICE IN SF!  I have been a fan of this place for over  years even back when they were located on Mission street.  I believe that they might have changed owners since then but the quality of the pizza remains the same.  I always order the Vegetarian with grilled chicken stripes.  They never skimp on the chicken and they slice is so massive that one slice is always enough.  A slice of pizza with a drink is less than $.  Yes, the location is in a very sketchy neighborhood,  so I never come alone.   However, every time I bring someone new to this place, they are always impress with the pizza. I don't know why I have waited do long to write a review for Chico's Pizza but here it is. The food itself is fantastic to say the least. The pizza is nicely priced and the size is very fair. The toppings are great. You get big chunks of veggies and sausage, and the cheese runneth over. . . it's perfect! They also have some side options like chicken, bread and salad with some desert options but I rarely get anything other than the pizza. As soon as you walk through the door the pies are on display for all to see and smell and I love it! The only reason this place gets such an okay score from me is because of the location. It is in the tenderloin district and in the middle of several back alleys and single occupancy rooms. You see all types there! Even though the service is great, the people are friendly I wouldn't linger at this establishment because I have been going here for about  years and it never fails, I can never get done with my slice before someone comes and asks me for change. But i digress, don't let that stop you from eating some awesome pizza"
El Sol Taqueria|3.5|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|128|-1|3.64285714286|" It was good food, nothing extraordinary, but decent, good food for the money made quickly with a friendly staff. What more could one want? Very good service, quick! Everything delicious! Very Clean! Price just right not overpriced everything fresh! Tried a burrito and a quesadilla on separate occasions, and walked away happy. My favorite in my proxy! Never too greasy and the salsas are fresh! Love the service fast and friendly. . . . Chile verde chicken burrito and the flautas are my go to indulgences. Breakfast burritos are tasty and filling:) Nice tacos, burritos in tenderloin/union square. Good taste, there is better places like pancho villa but was happy after my visit. The burritos and tacos are decent. Avoid the nachos as they always come out soggy after they microwave it. Coming down from the Seattle area, this place was calling to me from the moment I noticed it,  across from our hotel!  For $.  I got ALL of the food in the picture!   It's excellent value for all this deliciousness! This is a small taqueria downtown. It does what I need it to do  it gives me fast, quick, pretty hot burritos for relatively (SF prices) cheap. Obviously it would be better if the ingredients were made to order rather than buffet style, but then again that would take away from the ""fast"" aspect that I so desire. So overall, this place is legit. If they eliminated their minimum for credit card processing so I could get points on my dining rewards I would go there even more often. Great place, authentic food. Fastly made, lost of choises to make. Whether you want chicken or beef and so on. . . The tables were clean and the floor was suprisingly clean. The only thing is that they don t have a lot of tables for . Was around the area looking for something to eat and we came across this place. Small location , few tables. The variety of burrito sizes varies from regular to super to baby burrito. Wasn't sure exactly what the size difference was from super to baby because they both had the same contents. The burrito was good, they had a variety of meats like al pastor, asada, chicken. Very good burrito. Their horchata drink was bomb! Visit Date //Great place with great food. Authentic Mexican food. Not a bad place, though not exactly the best burrito I've ever had either. It was flavorful and filling though, so that's above average food in my book. Considering the place looks like a hole in the wall and is located in a notoriously seedy section of San Francisco, I went in with tempered expectations, but went away without any complaints. I particularly appreciated the sizable amount of chicken they added to my ""Regular"" burrito. I often find that a lot of other burrito joints will skimp on the meat and are a bit too heavy handed with the cheaper fillings (rice, lettuce, beans), but El Sol did it right. I also appreciated that I was able to save a bit of dough by opting to hold the sour cream and guacamole (neither of which I care for and never eat, but which are normally included in the price a burrito). And the fact that they provide you with complementary chips and salsa is a real nice touch. The main negative is the $.  credit card minimum, which is just barely higher than the price of most of their dishes (I literally think my burrito was $. ) that you end up having to buy a drink or a side dish if you aren't carrying cash. I'm sorry, but that's pretty shameless extortion, so I had to dock some points. Good overall, though. I would return if I ever found myself back in the Tenderloin district looking for a quick meal (though not sure if / when that will happen again. . ) I read lotsa reviews before trying it, and yelpers seemed to like it! I got the vegetarian nachos and here was process: Chips on plate. Shredded cheese on chips. Microwave. I paid  bucks for microwaved nachos. Nuh uh. Nuh uh. Maybe their other stuff is good, but I can eat rubbery chips for free at home. Overall the food was good; nothing to write home about, but good. I had a Flautas dinner. I was a bit taken back when the plate came with black beans, but was a cool mix up. My only negative comment was in watching them prepare my plate, they had to throw the rice and beans into the microwave; I'm sure plenty of places do this but I can see them doing it. Would be nice if they had the rice and beans on the stove slow cooking and soaking up more flavor. I wouldn't plan to come back as there are just too many great Mexican places around. First I am a little biased. Raised in San Diego and spent a lot of time in Mexico. SD/ LA I have a spoiled pallet. My bar in SF is Pancho Villas so this place had a lot to compete with. _I live above this spot so I thought I would try it out one night. Affordable but still not worth the price. The tortilla on my burrito was cold, which to me is a no no. Chips are not made fresh, and the meat was dry. Spicy salsa was mildy spicy. This is a spot you go to LATE and night if you are starving or drunk. Not disgusting, but there are better spots around the corner. I read dozens of reviews before getting a vegetarian burrito tonight. Let's keep this in perspective  this is generic Mexican food. You can only do so many things with rice, beans, tortillas, etc. It can't be less than  stars if you like Mexican food, nor more than  stars unless you haven't eaten for a month. My burrito was $. , rather a lot for a RBC burrito, but it was freshly prepared in front of me, large, and as tasty as RBC can be.  I may eat here again, but not worthy of a special trip.  A solid . I have been a big fan of Iguanas in San Jose. Beside the mediocre Chipotle, I hadn't been able to find another good place to get burritos until I found El Sol! Their pollo asado is lean and not cooked greasy. Their regular burrito can fill me up all day. It's $. . My favorite burrito is rice, black beans, pollo asado, lettuce, and salsa. Simple and yummy! The staff is nice :)Small place. They also asked if I wanted chips and salsa. I said no. I didn't know if they were free. If they are, too bad I didn't get them. But, I will cause I am going to go back for sure! I really enjoyed my food but my boyfriend didn't care too much for his. I got a vegetarian burrito with pinto beans and green salsa and without sour cream or cheese. The salsa was really tangy and the burrito was warm and delicious and super filling. He got a beef burrito and said that it wasn't bad but he wasn't impressed. The chips were not good though, stale and bland and kinda squished in a weird little plastic bag. We were really tired and hungry and were ready to eat pretty much whatever, but I actually liked my food and I wouldn't mind going back and eating there again. I have to say I'm extremely disappointed! This place held me down my first yr of law school living in the TL. The prawns burrito was EVERYTHING  I went last week for Fat Tuesday and it was such a waste of calories, it didn't have its usual freshness to it. It also lacked the unique flavors it once had. Also, they raised the price by ALOT. AND the store was pretty dirty from past patrons. El Sol is my favorite taqueria in this part of the Tenderloin. I prefer it over El Tesoro and La Rosa, which are both nearby. El Tesoro is decent and I know some folks who go there plenty. As for La Rosa, I'd rather eat whatever I can find strewn about on the streets. So naturally, you'll find me ordering a chicken burrito or some nachos at El Sol Taqueria. I usually order to go since the taqueria doesn't have much seating. Sometimes when it's not busy, I'll dine in and watch the show outside that is our beloved Tenderloin. This is your standard taqueria. I give them  stars because I come in here a lot and their service is always awesome. ¡Me encanta! Really great regular burrito! It's huge and the meat/rice is seasoned perfectly. Good price too considering the size. Would be giving five stars but for the disappointing chips and salsa. Chips are just generic mission tortilla chips  not warm or cooked in house. Portion of chips is also really paltry (small sandwich bag). The ""hot"" salsa is pretty mild as well. Excellent highly recommend plenty of food we were down on our luck and had to panhandle for our food but this was well spent money the best hear Union Square Food was okay.  Had the super burrito al pastor.  Truth be told have had better.  Not too much flavor.  The salsa for the chips was good.  . Staff was friendly. Besides being able to practice my Spanish with the workers, they also have an amazing burrito that was both huge and very affordable (especially in SF). One thing I didn't like was the fact that their salsa wasn't really spicy enough for me. The quesadilla was alright but I'd definitely recommend the burrito any day Ordered the carnitas and beef tacos from El Sol. The tortillas were so soggy I couldn't pick up the tacos, which were really too huge for tacos. My friend got the nachos, which actually looked much more appetizing. Given the amount of delicious, authentic Mexican food in the Bay Area, I doubt I'll try this place again. Tasty food and friendly staff. I get my lunch here every couple of days. I'm not a connoisseur, I just like burritos!NB: there's not much seating space. This place is less than a block from me and when I was craving Mexican, I decided to give this place a try.  It was good Mexican for decent price!  I ordered the dinner chicken enchiladas and it came with  enchiladas, refried beans, rice, lettuce, salsa, guac (didn't charge extra for this), and sour cream.  It ran me around $ with tax, which is pretty pricey for one person but since the entree was so large, it made sense.  They also give you free chips & salsa which adds a nice touch to things.  This place is quick and has the option for you to sit down or carry out.  They take credit cards ($ minimum) which is nice and has about  varieties of Jarritos drinks (which I found out, Mango, is officially the best one now lol)Overall, I've had better enchiladas in my life but given the location, speediness of orders and quality of food, I'd give this place  stars. I seriously love this place. I have a pepper allergy, but love mexican food, which is a problem. They go out of their way to make sure I can eat what I want. Went in last night for a shrimp burrito, and it was incredible. All it was was shrimp, cilantro, onions, refried beans, guac, sour cream, and cheese and it was unreal. Each ingredient is so flavorful you don't need to get all crazy. Tired of bridesmaid dress shopping, we almost went to Colibri down the street. Thank GOD we walked out of there before paying $ for an empanada because El Sol has delicious meat, a variety of it, and I think the four of us payed $ for all our food. Which left more money for beer. . . . and a dollar for the homeless man that poked his head in. AMAZING prawn burrito (my husband and I make a point to visit their Dos Amigos location on Brannan every time we're in SF. . tried this location for the first time last week  burrito tastes identical).  Kind of pricey ($) if you can finish one by yourself. . . but they're big so we always manage to split one.  A handful of small tables inside.  Complimentary chips & salsa (teeny tiny portion). Once in a while, I'd order their super quesadilla, which I used to love. Well, i still do, but it shrinked in size almost double and this fact I don't really like. And I want to think it depends on who is cooking, coz last  times there was a lady, taking my order and cooking and it is really smaller than the one I used to get from the man. It's still enough to get really full, but before it made  meals for me ; ))And if comparing pricing: it's $ or $ more expensive than in major taquerias. Ok for me since it's tasty. Not familiar with any other items. So, taking off  star for shrinking in size and I also was charged $ for  extra small conteiners of  salsa (minus nd star), even though I didn't want their chips, so they might 've given it to me just instead. . . . I decided to walk to work today instead of getting the bus and passed by this place. They had a sign outside advertising breakfast burritos, so I decided to give it a try. There was actually no sign of a breakfast burrito on the menu board, but they do have it. I must say it was one of the tastiest breakfast burritos I've had in a long time. Fried potatoes, freshly cracked eggs (not from a carton like some other places), a generous helping of cheese and a sizeable amount of salsa made this a fantastic breakfast. I asked for it without meat, but it seems you can get it with chorizo also. It cost under $, which was a lot less than I was expecting. I will definitely be back to try their other options. Disappointing. I got the super quesadilla, which was small and not all that tasty. And it was quite expensive. food is pretty good, but what I really like about that place is that they see to have the nicest customer service I seen in any food place I am not an expert on Mexican food, and know nothing about the standards in San Francisco since I am just a tourist, but I just came back from this place and the  food was great. I had a delicious Super Quesadilla and a very refreshing Horchata. The only reason I am not giving this place  stars is because the service wasn't the ""friendliest"". Awesome hole in the wall. Only four tables to sit at but we didn't have a problem walking in and snagging one. Truly authentic mexican food. Corona or Modela to choose from. My cousin let my mom have a bite of her burrito and from then on my mom has been asking me to get her one. I came here with her and ordered the Super Burrito. I thought the super burrito would be bigger than the regular but it just comes with cheese, sour cream, and guc which the regular doesn't come with. Seeing how I know I can't finish a burrito and its technically my mom's first time we ordered one to share. The lady who took made our burrito was very nice. We asked her to cut our super burrito in half. She wrapped each again in foil so it looked like we ordered two really small burritos. The burrito was good but nothing amazing. This is a good place if you are hungry and want a place to sit where people will leave you alone. Although the place is small I think there is always a place to sit if you need. I once randomly walked by around pm and saw my friend sitting there enjoying a burrito. He got off work really late and this was the only place where he could get something hearty and where he can dine by himself. This isn't the taqueria you go out of your way to dine at. El Sol taqueria is small about four tables and there food is edible while the service comes with a smile. The best thing about their standard taqueria menu is the baby burrito, a small burrito for those of us who watch their manly physiques or people with small stomachs. They offer chips and salsa with their meals and  have some horchata or agua fresca. I've had the quesadilla  and their tacos; they were filling but something totally awesome seemed to be missing from the food. This place has really grown on me.  Consistent and tender, they're always there for me (well, except for before  am). Food poisoning. . . . . Do I need to say more? How do you soak up a dozen free colonial punches and ginger snaps?  Tacos.  For best results with the friendly staff use your Spanish.  In the hungry future I'm very interested in trying the nopale (cactus) and goat cheese burrito.  This visit I split half a dozen tacos with my dining companion.  She ordered a chile relleño, because she's a little peppery.  She  shared a few bites with me.  The chile wasn't spicy or fried to death and the queso was flavorful.  The presentation was classic but efficient.  Some shredded lettuce, crema, and guacamole with fresh pico de gallo.  Now for the meaty details on the carnita tacos and the al pastor tacos.  The carnitas weren't dried out, crusty or all fatty.  They were not heavily seasoned so you could spice up your taco as much as you like. The al pastor did not satisfy my desire to find and devour the best al pastor in California.  It was just ok. I absolutely love the fish tacos here."
El Norteno Taco Truck|4.0|Food Stands in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|125|-1|3.76923076923|" Food was good, but beware the will make up prices depending on how drunk or an easy target they suspect the buyer will be. None of the prices were listed and we ordered guac and chips, a water and a coke. $! as the guy just made it up right there. At that point it was already made so had to accept it. El Norteño is pretty decent for a taco truck. In my opinion, nothing spectacular and nothing lack luster. . . just decent. I've had all of the meats in both tacos and burritos, they do them okay. If I do Mexican it's usually in a restaurant not from a truck. The fact that I went here today was strictly based on convenience. $.  for a Mexi Coke & $.  for an al pastor/camaron burrito sans frijoles. I just love this truck. The price is right. The portion is right. The tortilla they use surpasses a taqueria restaurant in the mission. Why I say that is because it's soft and not dry. A lot of places on mission I've been to well I guess they wanna toast it. But here everything is like wrapped in a warm tortilla blanket ready to be eaten. Pretty big burrito to. A great, quick place to grab tacos if you're in the area for jury duty. They do offer veggie tacos  they're good but nothing special. For instance, it includes rice, beans (your choice of refried, black, and something else I couldn't make out), lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, etc. The tacos are served Northern California style, meaning way over filled for a taco. They also offer a choice between mild and spicy; the spicy is actually spicy, which is a nice change of pace from the terribly mild Mexican food found here. Not the best veggie taco you'll find, but a perfectly satisfying (and cheap  $. /taco) lunch. Credit cards accepted and there didn't seem to be a minimum. First note: I am not a food truck fan. I like to sit relax and eat, not stand in the hot sun and get my food in a rush. Don't try to convince me of those food truck malls. Nothing compares to a good cozy neighborhood location. But there are those days you are hungry and time is precious. I also work in a food desert. If I liked Subway or McDolands I would be in heaven, but I don't. So El Norteno is my next best option. As my friends know, if they don't have real toritalla chips I will never be a huge fan. Having a truck, I'm sure this is not an easy task. I give a little break for this. Nice people though,  pretty good burritos.  If you want extra hot sauce you have to beg for it. ;)The husband and wife that run this truck are so nice so it keeps me coming back. Best Taco Truck on the  strip! The tacos Al Pastor and Carnita burritos are the bomb! randomly walked by here on my way to the flower market. i had never had a non greasy, fatless yet still authentic burrito until i came here. nothing drips from the ends. their rice was perfect and they accept credit cards. i had tripe. no one ever offers that unless they really know how to cook it. plus points! they also have lengua, chorizo and tortas. So I'm stuck on jury duty and super thankful  that this little truck is across the street. I've tried the al pastor and crane asada tacos and the chicken burrito. All we're really tasty, full of flavor and quality ingredients. I'll be back even after I'm excused from wasting my life away across the street in court. I've been eating here at least twice a week since January. No joke. The carne asada and carnitas tacos are delish! Meat is moist and they have super spicy sauce! Also, their nachos are really good and come in a half order or full order. They're loaded with your normal toppings like cheese, sour cream, guac, jalapenos, beans?, and meat if you'd like it. I don't know what I'm going to do when I'm no longer near this truck. There will be tears. Service is quick and good too! I believe they also accept cards. + points. Food trucks ftw! This place is killer. The carnitas are the best I've had anywhere in SF. The people who run the food truck are friendly as well. Service is quick, food is amazing, people are friendly. Doesn't get much better than that. Haven't had burritos as I'm GF, but I hear they're pretty darn incredible. Update: Amazing food. But, the nachos. . . don't order if you are not a fan of cheese sauce. I'm personally not a fan, so I didn't find the nachos very good. I do however, love everything else I've ever had from here. I got the carne asada burrito and was disappointed.  The meat was chewy, like rubber from a tire.  Everything including the rice was equally bad.  I'm not sure if I ordered the wrong thing at this place?Not sure what the hype is all about. Last week I worked a  hour shift and got off work at am, had to go to  Bryant Street to file a police report, took  hours, I was already irritated because I was getting the runaround, finally got it handled, afterwards I was so tired but also starving because I had not eaten since the night before, the scents and aromas from this Taco Truck were amazing and I saw  guys already buying their lunch there, all of whom were Latino (no  rule, if you want good Mexican food, go where you see lots of Latino customers, Chinese Food , asian customers) i order a Super burrito with carnitas y carne asada, no frijoles, extra crema, extra savoia!This burrito was AMAZING! I will definitely patronize them again and I highly recommend them! Delicioso! Favourite: lengua tacos msThank you for the fresh meats (and parts)Thank you for accommodating my random requestsThank you for speeding things up at lunch timeThank you for giving me extra sawsesDefinitely a staple for the whole justice department across the street. And the made up ladies in black who look like they took a cab fromSephora downtown only to come here? Impressed, if that's the case. Note: they are not always here, as they do take days off for catering. Note : they now take credit cards through Square (and their receipt is cute, so it will make you feel bad if you didn't tip them!) I was riding my bike around the city and I seen this truck around this location and I said ill give it a shot and it was or is good. The price on menu is excellent and there burritos will make you full. Every think taste good, Just like a restaurant but on wheels. This girrl is on fiyah!! Omg!  I'm writing this up while simultaneously trying to extinguish the fire  in my mouth! Wo ha!Was feeling like tacos for lunch today, so I decided to walk on over to the El Norteno Taco Truck. Ordered a steak and a chicken taco and I was asked if I'd like them mild or spicy.  I'm sure you can figure out which one I opted for. Ss (ohh! that burns so good!). I have a pretty high tolerance for heat; for me it was borderline  intolerable. I'd recommend getting the tacos mild but asking for the spicy sauce on the side.  Spicy sauce/salsa: they definitely use orange habanero peppers and if you know what habanero peppers are, you would know that these lil babies not only pack a lot of great flavor, but are near the top of the list of having the highest levels of capsaicin. Pretty much the hottest pepper you can find at your local grocer.  This sauce is addicting, but definitely needs to be consumed with precaution! You will sweat, cry, go numb and possibly blind. . . But it's so good you will ache for more.  Remember. . . ORDER MILD  SPICY SAUCE ON THE SIDE!   Now excuse me while I go chug another gallon of water. This place is, THE BOMB! The tacos are super delicious, I haven't found another great taco place in San Francisco as good as this truck for tacos.  Its cheap, fast, and they are really nice.  Its pretty fresh as well.  They have a constant and steady traffic flow for lunch because its that good. I usually get only tacos Al Pastor, Carne Asada, and Carnitas. I've also had the lengua tacos there and it is pretty delicious as well. This is definitely a place to eat at. I don't think I've ever had a torta until I've been to this place. My coworker, who's Mexican, told me he was going to get tortas from this place last week and I decided to join him. The torta's come in either  piece or  pieces, no  pieces. Very weird. It worked in our favor cuz I only wanted  and my coworker wanted . The entire thing comes wrapped in its original bread loaf package. It's basically like all the contents of a burrito, but in between a loaf of bread. It's delicious, hearty, and for  pieces, it was only $! What a steal. I absolutely loved every bite! There's always a line here and you know its good when there's a bunch of Mexican people waiting in line! I will definitely be back many times! Well, I hate that my first review is a negative one, but I must let the people know. Yesterday (Friday) I got a super burrito (chicken, black beans) from the truck for lunch. It has given me food poisoning. The burrito was tasty, and it's the second time I've eaten here. But sadly, my quality time with the toilet and entire Saturday of non functionality, terrible stomach pains and inability to eat are telling me that I wont be back. Hopefully I can eat tomorrow :( The best of part of having Jury Duty?  Getting to eat at El Norteno.  Love these guys.  Always friendly service, totally willing to talk with you about exactly what you want in your Burrito.  No ""language barrier"" you know?  I had an awesome Breakfast Burrito today (not on the menu but they made me one anyway, which is cool) of eggs with Carnitas cooked ""Machacha Style"" (sauteed with onions and tomato. )A bit pricey, yes, compared to other burrito shops in La Mission, but for the convenience factor, it's worth it.  You want cheap?  Go across the street to McDonald's then, you savage.  Enjoy eating the ""food"" they serve over there.  I'll be quite content with my REAL Burito with REAL hot sauce and REAL ingredients, from El Norteno, thank you very much. The perfect taco truck: the food is quick, cheap, and very tasty. And I love that when I ask for hot sauce, they actually put hot hot sauce on it. The al pastor super burrito is my personal favourite: I usually cut it in half because it's so big. Coming back from TechCrunch Disrupt, I walked past el Norteno and given I have trouble turning down Taco/Burrito trucks, I decided to give it a try. El Norteno is similar to most other taco trucks. I had the al pastor burrito, supreme, with red sauce. The burrito was ok, but my big complaint was how dry the burrito was. There was an incredible amount of rice, leading to an off tilt Rice to Meat ratio. Additionally, the pork, which is normally a pretty moist meat in burritos, was dry to the level of dog food. It was grisly, had very little flavor and the incredibly dry texture left a lot to be desired. Even for a restaurant on wheels, I expect more than what I got at this trip to el Norteno. I hope others have enjoyed a better experience. This truck has the best burrito I've had yet. Sure it's a little 'pricey' for a truck. But what you're paying for is the consistency and the quality of this delicious food. Just one of these burritos is like two meals. Cut it in half and save it for later. My point is, if you want to complain about the price, don't go out at all! Pack your lunch! Everything around SOMA is likely to be $+. This truck is better than most of those places anyway. I'm super serial. P. S. Best breakfast burrito you've ever had in your life son! They charged me $ for a pinto and rice burrito.  Dry as hell.  NO! This is my favorite taco truck ever; we go there at least once a week and can't resist the camarones sandwich which they smother in some kind of amazing crack sauce. They've also got tripe, tongue, brain and some other specialties but I can only vouch for the shrimp. It's a little pricey but the portions are big. They're friendly, fast, and have a good selection of imported drinks too. A tasty haven from Jury Duty!  I sat through a long but interesting jury selection process during which I almost exclusively thought about where I would eat for lunch.  Enter El Norteno with its tasty burritos for all!  I had the shrimp (camarones) burrito which was excellent, one of the better shrimp burritos that I've had in the city. . . tasty fire grilled shrimp, excellent sauce, and a pretty decent sized burrito.  It was a bit pricey for a taco truck ($!) but I guess that's what the $ daily juror pay is for. . . I have been frequenting this place about once a week for a year, so it's a travesty that I haven't raved about it yet. It's the place to go if you want a standard taco truck taco or burrito, or a ginormous torta (the small is the size of my head). The gentleman who takes your order is super friendly, and the food is consistent, without fail. And, they're there even on a rainy day, which I appreciate from my food trucks."
Angel Cafe|4.0|Coffee & Tea in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|184|-1|4.22916666667|" Service needs some work, but overall good and coffee is good. I like the variety of desserts on the refrigerator case. Asked ""how much is a bagel with JUST hummus"", it's $.  so I said ""OK just give me the complete hummus bagel with all the veggies"". What do I get, a $ bagel with just hummus. SMH. Large homemade dolmas are the best!  The family that owns the place is friendly.  Good service.  There is a lot to choose from my favorites are the dolmas, baklava, chai iced tea, and the spinach triangle pie thing. Love this place! Family owned business that radiates excellent customer service and quality coffee drinks with a variety of food options (bagels, cookies, deserts, dolmas, salads, wraps, sandwiches, etc. ). I've been to this place many many times and am never disappointed. I came here after reading the reviews, and once again yelpers you did not disappoint me. The gentleman working was so friendly, and it was : am! The breakfast bagel I ordered was delicious and their coffee is strong, not watered down. Plus they offer Krispy Kreme donuts. What more could you ask for? Stopped in for lunch and must say I was impressed by cleanliness and the very tasty looking food on display. I had the Hot club sandwich and it was delicious the meat tasted fresh and veggies were crisp. A very polite staff and great food! Located in the heart of the Tenderlion it is one of S. F. 's hidden gems!! I adore this little spot with my entire heart. Although I've lived about  seconds away from their front door for  months, I had yet to try this place until Monday. I don't know why. I pass it every day and think that I need to go in and try it, but never seem to get around to it. It wasn't until we had guests go and fetch us muffins and vanilla lattes on Monday that I gave this place a try, and I am SO glad I did. The muffins and coffee were both delicious, though the coffee especially. It's seriously some of the best I've had in a long time, and I'm pretty picky when it comes to coffee. I don't know what coffee voodoo magic they're working in this place, but it's spectacular. When I went in today, the woman behind the counter was kind yet to the point. I actually really liked her personality. She called out a greeting to me as soon as I came in, then came over and stood patiently as I decided what I wanted. I finally settled on a dirty chai and a piece of toasted almond cake from the pastry case. ""Do you want one shots or two?"" She asked, calm but slightly stern. ""Hm, let's go for two. "" Then she gave me the most wonderful impressed raised eyebrow and approving head nod duo that I have ever seen. Sort of pursed her lips as she did it. It's hard to recreate in words, but it totally made me laugh.  She was fast, efficient, and friendly while she made my drink and retrieved my pastry. I only had my card, and offered to get cash from their ATM, but she told me that she would just charge the  cents extra for running the card since it's cheaper than ATM fees. When I checked out, though, she knocked off  cents to make it an even dollar amount. A nice little gesture. She then asked if I lived around here, then gave me a loyalty stamp card.  stamps gets you a free cup of coffee. I will definitely be back. The dirty chai is truly the best I have ever had, and I've probably had hundreds by now. People aren't kidding when they say that their chai is the best ever. The espresso and chai were perfectly balanced I often find that chai taste gets drowned out by the intensity of the espresso in dirty chai's, but they marry beautifully in Angel's cup. The toasted almond cake is sitting in my fridge, so I've yet to try it, but it looks lovely. They have so many gorgeous pastries and desserts, along with a large array of savory foods, and a GIGANTIC selection of drinks. There's enough here to satisfy anyone and everyone. Highly recommended. This was my second time here for lunch in four days and I am only in SF for five! The falafel is amazing! The falafel pita is a flavor explosion in your mouth and you can request it to be as spicy as you like. The owners are extremely friendly which I greatly appreciate. It is nice to be greeted by a smiling face and that along with great food turns me into a repeat customer. Been there twice since my last review. First time I bought and paid for a cert breakfast sando. They ran out of what I wanted but charged me for it. Then gave me doughnuts to equal the charge. Which I didn't want! Now I ordered  breakfast sandos again and didn't get what I asked for? When I stated the order was wrong they told me I must have made a mistake? I will never be back. They are a train wreck waiting to happen! Service: /Food: Lebanese Platter, /The man and woman behind the counter were so nice and helpful the entire time my boyfriend and I were there. They were very friendly towards everyone who came in and were more than happy to grab us an extra napkin or fork. Every exchange with them was met with a smile. You can't help but love this place. As for the food, good lord it was delicious. From the lentil rice to the falafel to the grape leaves. . . I left very full and very happy. I can't wait to come back and try out the rest of their menu! Iced chai here is amazing! They have all sorts of pastries and sandwiches. They also have pasta, deviled eggs, different types of Mediterranean snacks. Very friendly staff, they have relaxing music that plays though the cafe. Located outside are some chairs and tables if you can't find seating inside. Best chai I've had so far. This is a family owned business and the owner has reached out to fix my previous complaint. Which you don't see too often. As long as he is making the chai lattes we will be back, I think they are the best I've had. And as I said before the breakfast sandwiches are delicious! Overall I love this place and I will be back. Thank you Nagham for reaching out. This coffee is shop is about a block away from my apartment, so not only is it super convenient, but they have the best service! Nagam runs his shop like it's his baby, and he treats every customer like family! He always greets us with a hug or a smile. I believe it's his sister and father that work alongside him. The sweet lady behind the counter always makes our sandwiches to perfection and she's super fast! There was one time we had a huge order of about  sandwiches,  drinks, and  pastries and something was left out of the bag  no biggie. I realized it when I got home so I gave him a call, and he met me on my corner to personally deliver the forgotten item! What other shop owner does that?! My bf and I come here every weekend for breakfast sandwiches and dirty chai lattes. They have the BEST homemade chai I've ever tasted! I won't go anywhere else. I also like that they'll throw in a free homemade cookie every now and then. Today, we were surprised to find a little ""lagniappe"" in our goodie bag they had thrown in a free piece of delicious blueberry bread! We'll be regulars for a long time! The people working here are lovely and very attentive. Baked goods are delicious, great homemade Mediterranean fare (falafel wrap was delicious) and they have matte lattes! Best one (only one) I've had. I love this place! Fresh, inexpensive food. Clean and comfortable. Excellent friendly staff. Quick service, usually. Large, clean bathroom. I usually go in the off hours, get a sandwich and tea, read and relax. I've also had breakfast and dinner there. The morning customers seem to be mostly to go. Less busy in the evening. Regardless of how busy, the staff of one or two works fast and remain friendly. I think there's only two people on staff, one guy and one girl. I like to hang out here often and always use the fabulous, clean bathroom before I leave. I love that it's clean, quiet, and well lit. It's perfect for a leisurely meal with a good book. Also great to hang out with my better behaved friends, but not for a large group. . . .       First visit   . . . quick recap . . . will updateCoffee . . . . . . . . . . Service . . . . . . . . The latte was very smooth and wasn't bitter. Yeah I did gulp it down . . . quickly so it was a quick accessment. This review is really about the very warm and understanding staff (owners?)Another word the service. Quick recap:  I was there because I was early for a dinner party @ Dong Baek.  I order a latte in a glass cup.  Looked around and when the drink was ready . . . when up to pay  *&$^ . . . my wallet wasn't there . . . (quick ver) . . . check everywhere for  min             ^%$#$^ I did not have cash nor I did not bring my credit card.  They were still friendly and said I could pay next time!  There wasn't any sign of . . . yeah right or any doubt or disgust . . . nothing          they were still friendly even all that . . . they trusted me!  I told them I am going to a party . . . I am going to get some money from my         friends . . .  They even offer a paper cup to transfer the drink and just pay next time!  I quickly gulped the drink and rush to the restaurant and gotten the cash and         returned to the coffee shop and paid them plus a big tip for the trouble.  I will drop by there again not only give them service . . . there were some        dessert items in the fridge that were tempting!  Very trusting and friendly people!  Gonna try the other items on the next visit to balance the review and     thank them for trusting in me! Chicken Shwarma and Turkey Pesto were both delicious! The service is friendly and their desserts look incredible! NOTE: Minimum purchase on a card is $. . Otherwise, bring cash. Hours are wrong. This was the rd location where the hours were wrong. I usually would not be upset. But when I am ""guiding"" people around and this is the rd spot where the place is closed, then I'm pissed. And especially pissed since we only tried to open the door after seeing someone come out. The door was immediately locked and then a guy came out to tell us ""can't you see door locked, we're closed"". This star is for the incorrect info. Their desserts might be good, but you can judge since we couldn't. . . Putting a case of cheesecake, tiramisu, pie and the plethora of other dessert options at the front of your store is likely to get me in your door.  I was half expecting a witch to shove me in an oven after being lured in but no. . . I just ate a crap load of dessert.   Well played Angel, well played. First off, customer service here is pretty good. Most of them are nice and aside from an occasional language barrier things run smoothly when you interact with the person behind the counter. That being said, I have had mixed experiences with their food and drinks. The Yerba Mate Latte they advertise in their window is .  and made with a syrup rather than the real thing. It's mostly foam and the espresso tastes oily. I've given the drink a few tries in the hopes that it was a fluke but each time I've been disappointed. The pre made food is old and their sandwiches are just okay. They don't hesitate to mark up their prices though. I live around the corner and stop by here when I'm in a hurry but the cash only policy pared with the less than average food has really turned me off. Again they're nice people but this won't become my go to cafe in my neighborhood unless it drastically changes. ~The owner did reply to my earlier post and even though not much has changed here I'll give them one more star AGAIN for being so nice. I always have a pleasant interaction and sometimes when you're late to work/are cranky/haven't had espresso. . that's all you can ask for from your local cafe. A smile goes a long way. Came here because it was near our hotel and we were on the way to the airport. Had a couple of sandwiches (Reuben and Pesto turkey) along with some coffees, a dolmeh, and a bit of the highly recommended tiramisu (sp?) cake. All was very home y tasting and not the one bit bad. Seating is sort of weird, and homeless people were around, but overall fine. The cash only thing was a detractor for me. Particular highlight was the $.  dolmeh. Very good. Its a must try coffee shop in the area. Cannot say it is the best coffee but definitely they have amazing home cooked goodies. Staff is really friendly and willing to help for anything. This place is still thebomb. comMoms cooking is on point! Angel Cafe has an exhastive offerings: gourmet pastries, krispy kreme doughnuts, pannins, falafels, dolmas, coffees, mediterranean eats, huumus, sammies, the list goes on. . . eats: falafel (. ) very large. had spicy taste besides being cold dolma(. )dry, premade, cold. when nuked, still cold, crunchy. .  starsleftovers: blaming myself for not asking if falafel/dolma was ""fresh""wasn't told. should the server have? still, lots of goodies to choose, would skip mediterranean eats. premade, cold. service quick, friendly, .  starsyep, giving them a pass. (for now). Best dolmas ever! My favorite vegetarian sandwich beyond a falafel can be found in this little, corner deli.  The balance of veggies and fresh mozzarella in the Heavenly Angel allows me to forget how healthy I'm eating  it just tastes that good.  Naturally, I also had to try the dolmas.  They don't look very appetizing and they taste as good as they look. We are on vacation, and were just looking for a savory snack in place of dinner and we wound up in the Angel Deli. The owner and his staff were exceptionally nice! The owner was simply genuine, in a way rarely seen  especially in  customer service.  The owner even slightly modified the ""format"" of one of his sandwiches so my friend could have a meat and cheese plate instead.  He took great care in making sure he made the orders just as we requested.  While we were in his shop  a customer of his who had moved out if town stopped by to say a quick hello as she was in the area and passing by.  I can see this is a place that people would gravitate to just for the service.  Wait  did I mention the food was fantastic!?! ""Great local coffee and bagel place for the morning caffeine fix""When I travel and when I'm at home, I like to find local coffee shops to support rather than always reverting to Starbucks. Although, Starbucks is sometimes the most convenient and only option. I was staying in the Hilton at Union Square and came across Angel Café. Since it was walking distance, it was worth checking out. Yes I do realize there is a Starbucks inside of the Hilton, and I do go there a couple of mornings when I was in a hurry. Be careful walking to Angel Café, bring a buddy, it definitely gets a little sketchy on your trek over there. I definitely wouldn't make the short journey at night, for safety purposes, but in the morning it was just fine. Angel café is very tiny where you order, only a couple of tables there, but there's a ""secret"" room/hangout area that you can reach from the back. They have a lot of bagel options, delicious espresso, mouth watering pastries, and sandwiches. The owners are very friendly and helpful. The bagels reminded me of being in Manhattan, they were fantastic! The coffee was also some of the best I had while I was in San Francisco. It's definitely worth the trip into Angel Café. Frist off when you walk into a cafe there shouldn't be a buzzer going off when you enter the place. That's just absurd. I walk in and the barista girl rudely asks if she can help me, basically ""what are you doing here?"" As I proceed to look around I ask her where the deserts are from, thinking they were prepared on location and she says, ""Italy. "" M FRESHLY DELIVERED FROM ITALY. Even with globalization tiramisu cannot be brought from Italy labeled as FRESH especially when being served in some random TL cafe. After I scoff at their weeks old deserts from across the world and order a coffee. As I sit down, I try looking around for the wifi password and some other bald barista guy tells me I can't use my computer where I'm sitting and I have to go to another seat. Really bro?? There's literally two other people in your cafe. This place is a joke. I love this place. Very clean and relaxing spot to get coffee and a light lunch. The owner here really takes care of the area near the cafe which also makes this corner a little bright spot here in the Lower Nob/Tenderloin area of Geary. I highly recommend this place. Plus they have free wi fi! Situation Sunday afternoon for lunch Ordered the Turkey Pesto Sandwich, Falafel, and Cheese CrispPros The people that work there are friendly The Turkey Pesto was decent They take credit cards The have a few tables outsideCons The Falafel and Cheese Crisp were bland $ credit card minimum Their bagels are the best! Super friendly owner chatted with me and even gave me a chai latte when I had already paid and wanted to add it to the order. Great fresh sandwiches. Almost makes up for the girl who was grabbed by a homeless guy on the tables outside and then her bf started a fight with him. Classy. Recommendation  take it to go or stay inside!! Feels like a genuine European Cafe, food and service are both authentic. This Deli is near my mom's house and she brought me here to have lunch.  The man was very nice and he had a lot of made from scratch food, such as hummus.  He carries a large amount of mouth watering desserts and he makes any kind of sandwich you can dream up, within reason of course.  You feel right at home and the food is great. Great corner cafe, I had the turkey pesto sandwich. . . huge fan of pesto and these guys got it good! Tastes like a splash of vinegar is in it. . . perfect. Bravo! Very friendly staff with a genuinely caring, sweet, and giving spirit. This is a neat spot to come have an evening chat if you happen to be in the TL. One of my favorite things about Angel cafe is their lounge area. In the left corner there is a small doorway that leads to a downstairs room with a unique atmosphere. The walls are lined with painted burlap sacs and they usually have a random movie from the s on that you probably forgot even existed very nostalgic. Their Chai Tea is very good which is important to me, so I will definitely be back! One of the best coffees in town. Great sandwiches. Awesome place. Angel, I love you! Delicious bites, the nicest and most wonderful people own this cafe. When I was thinking of moving to the Loin, I stumbled in here, drenched in rain and frustrated with the stressful search of apartment hunting. The moment I walked in, I was welcomed, warmed and fed. I go here nearly everyday now. Food is inexpensive and wonderful. Coffee is delicious! I love you Angel and I'll be sad if I ever move. I am just eating the best lox bagel on this planet ! Cheese bagel lox so good !! Also ordered a medium latte, very flavorful. I always go to Angel cafe, well whenever i have cash lol The  people who work there are super nice, smiling, make great food, smile at me, i mean come on what more can i ask for! Thanks guys, keep up the good work :) Fantastic service!  The wrap was very good.  The espresso was even better!  Took a canolli home and it was also delicious. I love this place! Super friendly and I'm in love with their Salmon Bagel!And don't miss their falafel wrap, it's also something that you will go back for. I go here to use their printer and they are always helpful. They were really nice when my friend and I walked in last week for coffee and some breakfast so we had high hopes.  The fresh squeezed oj hit the spot but the breakfast burritos were awful.  Potato and bacon were undercooked (seriously, the potatoes were still crunchy and the bacon was all flimsy light colored fat).  We each ate half of our burritos and then had to promptly leave because they had made us sick.  Probably wont stop here for any thing but coffee again. When my boyfriend happened across this unassuming corner cafe on a visit to San Francisco, we knew we'd found a gem. Not only are the hummus and veggie bagels delicious, but the family who runs this place is genuinely kind and friendly. Every time we're in the city, this is the first place we go for breakfast. Lovely place, friendly people. I had breakfast there x this week! Bagel sandwich is excellent, freshest bagels ever. Coffee is strong just the way I like it. Eat outside and people watch, it is fun. I will definitely look for this place again when I visit San Fran. I have only been living in the area that this fantastic little spot is located for a few months and already I am a regular customer here. The first time I visited I just needed a coffee because for some reason I am incapable of grocery shopping regularly. It was good not like specialty shop good but really tasty and did the trick. The reason I returned again was because I recalled how great all their pastries and other middle eastern foods looked in the big glass display cases they have surrounding the kitchen area. I wound up getting a bagel though because it wasn't quite lunchtime. This is where they really hooked me! Unlike a lot of cafes they really hook it up with the toppings which are always fresh (no sad brown sprouts here!) and flavorful. After discovering this delightful fact I have been working my way through their vegetarian sandwich selection even though I'm an omnivore! Also, besides the great food, the people who work here are some of the kindest folks on the block. They remembered me after my very first visit and wave even when I'm just walking to the bus, making every trip here just like visiting friends. Friends with delicious treats and drinks. This place is one of the more dependable and quality cafes in the area. The transformation they have made a few years back really has made them stand out on leav and Geary. The neat royal blue decor, sharp and clean, fit with an Internet cafe calmly situated in the back (sometimes with soccer or other sports on the tv). The family oriented, friendly staff have always been above and beyond friendly most of the time. The ladies making the sandwiches are hard workers and seem to be passionate and energetic. The owner. Pa and his wife are cordial and are regularly found working or buying local products in the area. The falafel sandwich is top notch. . giant perfectly crisped ground goodness with homemade tahini, hummus, and an oober fresh cucumber salad stuffing the warmed lavash bread (I like to add avocado). . with a traditional lebanese pre meal of dolma or the traditional spinach and cheese or cheese and parsley stuffed yum yums. Phat deviled eggs, quality coffee. . yes, minorly overpriced, a few numbers could be dropped a bit. . but overall this spot has served my senses well for years. do it Best. . . Falafel. . . EVER!!After my sad falafel experience at the more chain like Ayola, i almost felt like i had to find a better one. I've also have had a pregnant woman craving for Baklavah lol ^. ^ This is Sanfrancisco, shouldn't be that hard right?? I came across Angel Cafe. This bright blue corner cafe is really close to where i live. It's definetly family owned, clean, and everyone is so so sweet customer service spot on with added charm. It gets really busy at lunch and the place is alittle small to keep up with their hustling business. I wasn't the only one getting a Falafel wrap *which was promising* Someone infront of me was getting this sandwhich which was filled to the brim with meats and cheeses. It looked good if i ate that kind off stuff. The Falafel was perfect. Filled with vegetables i never expected. Zuccini, cherry tomatoes *you could tell they were locally grown*, thick chunks of cucumbers, onions, some homemade pickled vegetables, afew pieces of broccoli, grape leaves, fresh herbs, and some spicey peppers since i ordered it spicey. The yougurt sauce had good flavour. The hummus had a wonderful light earthyness to it. The wrap was soft, thin, and warm. It wasn't made with refined flour, and had an almost sweetness to it. The falafel itself was huge. I've never had falafels like this, it was not made with abunch of breadcrumbs. It was soft but had a slightly crunchy but not hard outerwhell. They were huge and filled throughout the whole wrap. It was wrapped tightly so everything was kept in place *which most wraps never are* so it was easier to eat, it was wrappy in parchment paper and then again in foil to keep it warm and in place. This is by far the best falafel i have literally ever fricken had. I have never had Baklavah that tasted this traditional either. It was good. The portion seemed small until i took it home and saw how thick it really was. Perfect portion. I paid $ even for a falafel wrap and piece of Baklavah. It seemed over priced to me until i went home and really looked at what i ordered. The falafel wrap was HUGE. I couldn't really finish it but i did just because it was that awesome. It essentially is the same price as Ayola, but the wrap its like /xs bigger. Plus Ayola is alot of bread and lettuce, Angels is little bread but tons of fresh local vegetables and huge falafels with just the right amount of sauces. The Baklavah was really good as well. The flavours was spot on. They have a pretty exclusive menu with alot of coffees, sandwiches, traditional greek foods with some pastries. I figured if i could not get traditional good greek food at a family owned/run traditional cafe, then there was no hope for good decent priced mediteranian in frisco this place did not disapoint. This place is AMAZING. Run with smiles and love. Everything is homemade and fresh. You can tell they are happy and love what they do. The area really isn't that bad. If you think this is in a bad area in SF u have no idea lol. The area is fine. Any area you can still text in without risk is not a bad area lol. So impressed, i look forward to coming here in the future to trying other things, however the Falafel is beyond perfect so it's hard  me  imagine getting something else."
Eden Cafe|4.0|Delis in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|22|-1|3.77777777778|" Great food, tapioca, sandwich, and price! not much in the store but good food. The food is nothing special, but the prices are unbeatable in Hayes Valley. They also sell a small selection of Japanese and Korean snacks & drinks as well. Seating is limited so I recommend ordering take out. Minimum $ purchase for credit card use. They also have a ATM machine at the front of the store.  stars for what it is, how sweet they are, and the surprisingly tasty sandwiches. There were few alternatives for food after a family visit to the symphony and the son and hubby were ravenous. It's small and not fancy, but since we were the only ones there, we sat at the table indoors. From my hipy, zero waste perspective, I was pleased to be served our sandwiches on glass plates. Anyway, Eden makes a good sandwich. The boy snarfed down his tuna melt with much joy and very little sharing. My husband (who loves a good sandwich) was impressed by the hot pastrami sandwich. The only place in the area with boba. It's not the best boba, but it'll do when I have an afternoon craving. And you can't argue with $. for the thursday special salmon teriyaki rice bowl，sometime they were out of it，finally i go it today，it tastes so delicious！！ I was intrigued by the Chicken Teriyaki Rice Bowl combo that came with a Bubble Tea for $. . I didn't realize that the whole thing was just going to be microwaved. Not fun. However, it got me full. The Bubble Tea was fantastic, on the other hand, it even came with tapioca pearls! I would normally pay $.  $ for Bubble Tea alone at any other place. The tea pushes this rating up to  stars. Also, the lady that worked there was very friendly. Amazing variety for such a tiny cafe. Indoor and outdoor seating. Generous portions of good fresh handmade food. Friendly service. And to those who say they are slow? They make sandwiches like you would at home, carefully and one at a time.  A sandwich and a free bubble milk tea or free salad all for $? People complain about the ingredients being from Costco? Have you ever worked in the restaurant business? You think you are going to pay $ for a certified organic sandwich?  Some people expect champagne on a beer budget! This really is just a small take out spot.  It's not bad for what it is.  The proprietors are nice and provide good customer service.  Its really a competitor for fast food joints in terms of price and convenience, but it serves ""real"" food.  Don't come here expecting great deli chow. gross food. everythings just costco ingredients and the lady takes forever to make a freakin sandwich. dutch crutch was stale and chewy"
San Sun Restaurant|3.5|Chinese in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|117|-1|3.66265060241|" The food is decent for the price you pay. Happy hour pricing starts at pm and ends at pm daily meaning if you are short on cash come here during those hours. I love that they provide free tea and extra soup for your noodle soup free of charge. They also have tvs if you want to watch sports. Decided to stop by San Sun because our regular go to Vietnamese restaurant was closed on Sundays. I remember coming here often after school when this place was still on Stockton St. I was hoping that the quality has gone up much like the space in the restaurant. The menu is absolutely enormous. Everything you can expect from both a Vietnamese and Chinese restaurant is on this menu along with multiple variations. The waitress was very accommodating although she and get coworker can lay off the cell phones before they take out order. My SO and I order a bowl of pho with all kinds of meat, but opted out of getting tendon and replacing it with brisket, fried chicken noodle with bok choy instead of cabbage and a grilled chicken noodle bowl. This was a lot more food than both of us could handle, but all the dishes were good for the most part. Some pieces of beef on the pho was slightly discolored, but like a smart yelper, I knew that it was normal and not a sign of rotting. The grilled chicken on both the noodle bowl and fried noodle was so mushy. It had barely any chew to it and fell apart with ease. I don't know about you, but I like to have a meaty texture when eating chicken. Has this place lived up to my experience from my high school days? I'd say it has and I'll be coming here again. I just hope that next visit will warrant a four star or more rating. I always come here for pho. I'll always give this place  stars, I've been a regular here for over three years. I'll admit though if you're a tourist or don't speak Chinese it might be a little tough ordering. Once they recognize you're a regular the atmosphere totally changes. The food is always on point and service is fast. They have over  things to choose from, I lean more towards the Vietnamese pages with Pho. If this place wasn't in Chinatown which is pretty far out of the way for me, my boyfriend and I would definitely be a regular of this place. Came here after :pm and noticed they had a happy hour and some of their drinks were only $! You really can't get any cheaper from anywhere at all. We got  of the lemon iced tea and an iced soy milk for $ (excessive, but it was so cheap you just can help it). It was a really hot day for SF (+ degrees) so I didn't want any noodle soup (or I'd get a heat stroke) so I opted for a beef chow fun. It was pretty good here. Babe got the Beef stew with the wide egg noodle and it was ONLY $ since it was on the happy hour menu. It was so cheap and so delicious. The flavor was on point, and I think I like this more than my beef chow fun. I just personally don't like the egg noodle because it's hard but thats what babe likes. It really is such a shame that it isn't at a more convenient location. I came here for the first time with a few coworkers during lunch. After sauntering through Chinatown, we entered this restaurant. I just couldn't begin where to look in the menu, because there were just so many different styles of noodle preparation!Eventually, I was recommended to try the satay sauce egg noodle. It came out literally a few minutes after ordering, and I was excited to dig in. The seasoning was good, but I wish it wasn't so watery. I was hoping it would have more of a thicker gravy texture so that it wouldn't drown out my noodles. On the flip side, it could have just as well been a noodle soup dish where the noodles completely soaked up the broth. It was edible, but not fantastic. This review should really be .  stars. Fortunately, this rating is only on this one dish and I hope to try the other dishes in the future. Other than that, service is decent for a Chinese restaurant, and price is reasonable, but it's cash only. i'm a regular at this cafe. very good service for a chinatown joint. their happy hour prices are outrageously cheap. their pho is bomb and big portion. their dirnks are cheap, around $. con: parking. I stumbled upon this restaurant while walking through Chinatown.  A clean, modern, and cheerful place with friendly service and reasonable prices.  The Pho Tai was impeccable. really good spot!they have all kinds of noodles soups, menu is extensive, and they serve the noodle soups in metal bowls so your noodles remaind hot. Love it!kind service and clean restaurant, a rariety for chinatown. I got the chiu chow noodles and it was a generous portion and cheap!They have HH specials. . . great spot for lunch! Large, clean, well lit, good prices, and decent food. Loved that they have $ for an entree after pm everyday! It's quite a steal. Additional items on fridays too! Also, I appreciated that the kitchen was willing to alter their menu items if you can't eat spicy. :) Excellent quality food and very reasonably priced.  Try both the iced lychee and fresh lemonade drinks, they will make your tastebuds dance and sing! They have an enormous selection of over  dishes!  The portions are very generous also.  Staff was friendly and speaks English.  I highly recommend it for visitors looking for authentic Chinese food at very good prices. Cheap, fast, quality =  yelpsWon ton noodle soup .  yelp they use chow mein noodles vs. Canadian style won ton noodles. Beef chow fun  yelps solid choice. Raw beef and beef ball pho  yelpBeef and vegetable rice .  yelp smaller quantityMassive menu and they have deals after  pm. Excellent place to go in Chinatown.  It's very large, clean, well priced and has a huge variety of foods, plus wifi which is both excellent and quite unique to the area.  You could tell it was good because it was off the main road and full of Asians.  I went with a friend, he had the pho and I had a rice dish.  Both were delicious and well made, very fresh (though a bit salty, but I'm quite sensitive to that; others would love it).  It was cheap enough that we got that plus a special drink and a scoop of ice cream and it was all less than $, quite the steal. I have had some absolutely horrible experiences with the SF Chinatown and the food there, so this place was a very welcome treat. Clean pho place in ChinatownDid not expect a pho place in Chinatown that was this clean! The inside was huge, with lots of seats and TVs close to the ceiling. I ordered the Pho that was part of the ""afternoon tea"" discount items, fully expecting the reduced price to lead to a small bowl of pho, but boy, was I wrong! The pho came in a huge metal salad bowl, with lots and lots of ingredients and many kinds of beef. The lemon iced tea was also very, very well made, with just the right amount of syrup and actual lemon flavor. The menu also has non vietnamese items as well (e. g. chinese rice dishes), probably because the place is in chinatown. All in all, an ok place to visit if you're craving for some pho in a clean place in ctown. Awesome place with great food, service and price.  I ordered a wonton soup which is my favorite , but what  made it even better was the option to choose my own type of noodles.  I had the pure rice noodle which I never had before abd it was thr perfect compliment to wontons. Also you must try the  color bean drink.  The menu has pictures with each item that helped since I am visual person. This place is awesome! You get SO much for less than $. Their noodle soups have ginormous portions and the sides are delicious. Beef Chow Fun is amazing. You can taste that old, aged wok. This restaurant has a very extensive menu. . And I mean extensive! A minimum of a double sided  page menu with at least  different dishes on each page making it incredibly hard to decide! Everything from Vietnamese, Cambodian and Chinese!  Food comes in stainless steel dishes/bowls, even the cups! (kinda reminds me too much of what I see being used in mainland china)I ordered the beef ball/shank/beef tripes ho fun noodle soup. It was good except I think it was missing a little kick to it. The soup had scallions, parsley and a side dish of the regular bean sprouts , mint leaves and lemon. I would come again to try something else. Glad that they accept credit cards! I ordered the dumplings with veggies. The soup is huge and really lovely in a savory broth. Fast service. The atmosphere is kind of boring, but clean and bright. A decent hokkien/teochiu (southern Fujian, northern Canton) noodle and rice joint.  They also offer Vietnamese food (a lot of Chinese from Vietnam are Teochiu).  I order the combo soup noodles  with thin rice noodles.  It was pretty light with fish balls, pork, shrimp, kidney, fried onion, g onions and bean sprouts.  The soup noodles remind me of the ones in Taiwan (most Taiwanese have ancestors from southern Fujian).  You can choose a variety of Teochiu/Fujian/Cantonese noodles : wide rice noodles (Cantonese fun), thin rice noodles (Fujian rice vermicelli or mi fen), thin Cantonese egg noodles, yellow noodles (round spaghetti like Fujian egg noodles), a couple of varieties of kway teow (round rice noodles from Fujian). This is one of my favorite restaurant I eat out and I always get number  all the time. Eating me some Chinese food for lunch I haven't been here in a while. Free wifi. The service is always friendly . If you go there around  to closed Don't order any noodle soup. First Time Experience:Walked in around pm on a Saturday afternoon for lunch after exploring chinatown. We randomly decided on this restaurant b/c we didn't do our research, it was nearby and there was a good crowd of Asians in there. We assumed that it had to be good if Asians eat there too! Wrong. . . Place is a no frills kinda place. . . lots of seating, no real decor, the orange seats match the orange polos of the waiters. Everyone just seemed to be focused on eating their food. Our waiter gave us water and complimentary hot tea. The menu was huge! It had tons of pictures, which was helpful. We ended up getting some beef stir fry, orange chicken and chicken fried rice. . Beef stir fry looked gross. . . like a congealed mass of beef, onions, and lots of corn starch gravy. Didn't look appetizing and tasted ok. Mall Chinese food tastes better than this crap. . Chicken fried rice was good, but nothing original or special. . Orange chicken was absolutely disgusting. The serving portion was quite sorry. We were both shocked how little there was especially given then fact that % was fried dough surrounding a morsel of chicken. The orange glaze was overwhelmingly citrusy. Just not goodService: Waiters here are all Asian women that speak broken English. They were polite, but not very helpful. We received a lot of glaring looks, since we were the only Americans in there at the time. It definitely made us feel uncomfortable. CON: Unlike other asian restaurants, you have to order white rice in addition to your meat entree. I didn't know that so I had to eat the beef stir fry by itself. . . thankfully, my friend ordered chicken fried rice so I took some from him. I'm just always used to asian restaurants always giving you a bowl of white rice with any entree order. Definitely will do my research on where the better places to eat are in chinatown. I do not recommend this place, especially to Americans that are unaware of authentic asian cuisine.  items on the menu. That's right. FOUR. HUNDRED. That means if you went there every day for a YEAR, you wouldn't get through everything. Got take out with some colleagues one day. Since I spoke the most fluent Cantonese, I was delegated to put in the order. After repeating my order x, the woman takes it, then says ""ok!"" and hangs up. *sigh. Typical Chinatown. Just assume it'll be done in  minutes if they hang up without giving you a time. What we had:Seafood on Crispy Noodle  Was pretty solid, but the seafood was the super cheap kind. Like, squid, fish balls, and fish cake. A couple of shrimp thrown in (tiny shrimp). I guess for $, I'm not expecting THAT much. But still. Some fish would have been nice. I mean. . . most of the seafood in the dish was processed. o. OBitter Melon with Chicken  Solid dish. Pretty sauced up, but the bitter melon was done right, and there was good flavor all around. Chicken was good, and NOT DRY. Ginger and Onion Beef  I was told this is one of their signatures. LOTS of ginger and onion. Though. . . the ginger wasn't all cut the same way. It should come out in slivers, so you can consume it all. I found whole slices of ginger. . . which make it tough eating. Service was pretty good, and they were quite prompt with our food. It was a bit confusing walking in to get our take out (wasn't sure if we were to walk to the counter in the back, or wait in the front, or what. . . ). Space looks clean, and I'd say if you want a variety of Chinese food, solid price, this would be a good place to try it. Delicious!  Great service. . Combination pure rice noodle $. . Chicken & Leek dumpling soup with vegetables $. . Combination fried pure rice noodle $. . Fish & Bitter Melon fried noodle $. . Pork Kidney with ginger and onion $. . Salted Fish & Chicken fried rice $.  I first ate here in high school when they were first located on Stockton in a much smaller place next to Little Paris. What people aren't understanding that this place is a chaozhou or teochew cuisine WHICH is Chinese and not Vietnamese so please don't just assume its a Vietnamese restaurant because they serve Pho  i could go on about this but i'll just continue by reviewing the food. They have a large menu with pictures to display what dishes they serve. The new location is a lot bigger and cleaner. I always get the Chicken Pho on cold days and scrambled eggs over beef chow fun on the warmer days. My mom loved the seafood fried crispy noodles. They most definitely raised the prices but can't blame them for needing to keep up with surviving in this country. They have great customer service and free wifi :) Found this place wandering around Chinatown on a rainy day . The service was amazing, the food was brought directly to us. I most definitely recommend this restaurant. I love their crispy noodles! lets go as simple as possible: large variaties of food here, cheap with very plain taste. First off please note that this is a chiu chow style cuisine,known for its seafood and vegetarian dishes and is commonly regarded as being healthy. Its use of flavouring is much less heavy handed than most other Chinese cuisines and depends much on the freshness and quality of the ingredients for taste and flavour. As a delicate cuisine, oil is not often used in large quantities and there is a relatively heavy emphasis on poaching, steaming and braising, as well as the common Chinese method of stir fry. Love their chicken and leek dumplings, I always have it with half egg and half rice noodles. They also do a great job with pork kidneys with green onions and ginger, the Chinese version of liver and onions.  Pick and choose correctly and you will be rewarded.  Quality of food was slightly better in their original location on Stockton, however growth and increasing staff can dilute what they've done well in the past, but I will still visit and get my dumplings! starts for the chicken and leek dumplings in noodle soup.  stars for the pork kidneys, they don't give as much as they used to.  stars for affordability.  stars for service and cleaniness. Happy hour =$.  Sapporo?! Sounds amazing to me.  The food seemed to be extremely oily but still yummy.  We got the chow mein, vegetable pot sticks, and hot&sour soup.  By far the BEST hot &sour soup!  It was only $.  &they gave you so much.  I shared with my boyfriend &we both got  servings each.  The service was alright, didn't get my water glass refilled but I think the waitress was training which is understandable.  The waitresses were still very sweet. Short Story:Meh. . . an okay place that serves Chinese and Vietnamese food in Chinatown. Long Story:I came here on a Saturday afternoon with friends and I got the house special fried rice.  The meat tasted a bit funny and the shrimp was not completely de veined.  Although this is pretty common of most Asian restaurants.  The service was lacking as was the ambiance and decor.  But then again, you can't expect a whole lot coming from Chinatown. Verdict:I will not be back. While the food was acceptable, I would look elsewhere. We had been trekking through Chinatown and were growing hungry. Not wanting to indulge on Dim Sum we stumbled upon San Sun. Probably an OK place if I had never had real Vietnamese food, but given that I have certain expectations it was a real let down. I've dined at Chinese run Vietnamese places before that have really good food but unfortunately this wasn't one of them. July th was great fun this year, making the pilgrimage to San Francisco, except the highlight of eating out in Chinatown with family didn't come close to meeting expectation. We relied on Yelp for a leg up and have a hard time acknowledging anyone rating San Sun above  stars. There were few patrons in the restaurant which should have raised a flag. The decorum had little appeal. The eating utensil were no better than that used to camp out. The menu was many pages long and everyone was hungry so we went against our better judgement and ordered. The greens eaten were fresh and hot but nothing else ordered was palatable. The barbecued meat was extremely dried and over salted. In fact two of us eating that dish had upset stomachs for a couple of days. I've traveled Asia for  weeks once, living out of Beijing and have never had a regretful meal there. This experience was so bad it will be quite some time before our family will try this kind of experience again unless we have a personal review we can trust. It looks like a Vietnamese restaurant from the outside, and even their first few pages of the menu are dedicated to Vietnamese dishes, but this is quite clearly a Chinese style restaurant.  Don't be deceived by the menu because their pho is far from good.  What kind of place actually asks you what kind of noodles you want in your pho?  Our hero wanted to try what it would be like with egg noodles (oh the folly of such a decision), and was sorely disappointed. The service is kind of clueless and was unable to provide any decent recommendations of menu items and had minimal English speaking abilities.  The waitress didn't even understand that our hero wanted to order wings as an appetizer, and he was left waiting until after he finished his main course for a dish that never came. PROS: It's hella cheap. CONS: The Vietnamese side of their menu is definitely not authentic and poorly thrown together.  The kitchen looks kind of dirty and sketchy.  Servers have communication issues. Been coming here since their old location and it's still really good. Never lets me down. I ordered the Beef Satay Noodles and it was good as usual, but I asked for not so spicy. When I got my order, it was REALLY spicy. That was the only thing that disappointed me, but every other time I go, the food is always delicious. The service is always great. A friend and I ate here; she got stir fried noodles with vegetables and tofu, and I got vegetable noodle soup.  Both dishes were pretty unpalatable.  My soup was bland as can be, a very simple clear broth with stuff thrown in.  Her dish was covered in a slimy, clear gravy with little flavor and bad texture. Given how simple my dish was, it's remarkable that I got quite sick after eating here.  My stomach wrestled with itself for a good   hours after finishing half a bowl of soup (needless to say, I left the rest behind). So why two stars, not one?  Well, I imagine some people like bland food.  It wasn't awful in that regard.  As for getting sick, it's a dice throw.  And as someone who has traveled to less hygienic lands, I'm pretty forgiving of stomach distress.  One just always hope the meal was worth it.  Not this time. A very traditional Chinese canteen.  A lot of good eats from noodles to rice plates.  What really made me write this review was their fried fish balls.  I had to order a second plate.  It was extremely yummy! I loved them at their old location, but they had to move because of the new Chinatown station to be build there.  Now I have to deal with walking up the hill to this newer, larger, quieter location.  If I have time for a meal in Chinatown  this is where I go.  The only two things I have tried and will get would be . Satay Noodle Soup (in various meats, depending on my mood)  . Satay Beef Crispy NoodlesThat should say a lot about the satay. I thought this place went downhill after the move until I came back recently.  I have discovered why.  When ordering noodle soups, please DO NOT order any type of rice noodle.  Go with egg noodle.  Not sure what it is but trust me you will enjoy your meal, a lot.  We did order a stir fry kidney dish, which was good but was filled with onions.  The whole plate had maybe  pieces of pork kidney and was the most expensive thing we ordered compared to the noodles. If they were consistent in their food, they would receive  stars in my book. Since one good dish can't outweigh all the downfalls of this place, here are  stars to my love for their satay noodles! Great soup! My girl and I got the Cambodian combination rice noodle soup. Delicious. They give you big portions so we shared.  We also got egg rolls, can't complain. One star less for IDing and questioning me AFTER I received my beer. And for the weird fact everything was in metal bowls, cups, plates. It felt like prison. With delicious food. I ducked into this restaurant as I was running away from some bad men in Chinatown; that's the last time I'll parkour in the area. The adrenaline subsided and hunger began to set in so I sat down. Their menu landed on the table with a thud and it is huge! I flipped through the all of its pages, changed my mind five times before finally deciding on the scrambled egg chicken ho fun; funny to say and delicious to eat! It arrived hot with the scrambled eggs on top covering the chicken and ho fun on an aluminum plate. The ho fun was well cooked with a soft texture and adding some Sriracha sauce really makes everything come to life! I swear I heard the chicken bawking, ""why me?"" as I chew away at the meat. The price is very reasonable at about $ per plate and this place's endless menu choices menu are ideal for those who want to try four different cuisines in just one place. In addition, it is a great hideout for any foot chase involving bad men or lustful ladies. I remember eating here whenever I went to SF Chinatown with my mom when I was young. It was always the combination hofun noodle soup for me with a ton of hot sauce and chili peppers. My soup has to be red. I don't remember the menu being that crazy. . . so many options!  Different kinds of noodles, meat, etc. The combination noodle soup was delicious. The kidney stir fry was just ok. The sauce was way too thick and the kidneys were overcooked. Too dry. I still prefer VH noodle house's kidney with ginger and onions. I need to come back to try their noodle stir fry and the other millions of options! Very delighted to still see this restaurant around.  This restaurant has been with me growing up. I don't live in SF anymore but whenever i go back to visit, the food is always good.  My favorite dish is the beef and egg over chow fun.  It is the bomb.  I also really like the satay beef noodle, and their pho is good too.  Their food is always hot and made to order.  This is the to go place in whenever I go to SF!  This place is awesome, they have free wifi toO!  This place surely reminds me of my childhood! Pretty good, but nothing special. We got the chow mein with beef curry, a won ton soup, and half of a Hainan chicken. The chow mein had great flavor. The soup broth was forgettable, but the dumplings were amazing. The chicken was a rather sorry excuse for Hainan chicken, but it was accompanied by an amazing dipping sauce that rescued it. I have better memories of the old location. It was ok for (downtown) Chinatown, but it's not near as good as most of the places in the Sunset or the Richmond. Huge food menu with low cost. I love Gourmet chicken here and varieties soup a lot. . . You cann't imagine how taste it be. . . Until your tongue takes it here. So hurriley go there and say with praise WONDERFUL ! I love the food here. We always order the spicy beef tripe and the salty chicken fried rice. The only thing I HATE about this place are those damn metal coated plates, bowls, and utensils. They never stay in place and one of the ladies here spilled that greesy shit all over my shoes b/c again, those plates never stay in place. It is pretty simple really. Their menu is too big. There is no way, NO WAY that a restaurant can make that many things well. Focus on making several things great instead of a thousand things mediocre. And think about it. . . With a menu that large, how can they stock everything so it is fresh? They can't. i only get #, a noodle soup which comes with both vermicelli and egg noodles, shrimp, pork, and a bunch of chives. they also give you a vinegar and garlic mix that you can add into the soup (i usually add about one spoonful). San Sun is a pretty cool place. The restaurant is clean and inviting. Service was great. The menu is huge, reading like a novel. If you don't like reading, you can always gaze at the menu items on the big HD tv's. Free Wi Fi to boot. Food is very good and comes out very fast. If you speak to the staff in Cantonese, they might place your food on a regular plate and not the aluminum plate everyone else seems to get (just an observation, I'm sure there's no bias   =)   ) An overall enjoyable experience, having lunch while catching bits of the NFL playoff game. A very quick place to stop in for an inexpensive bowl of Vietnamese, or Cambodian soup. This place is really lunch only. I've had better Pho, and don't expect to get the best bowl of Pho you've ever had. Yet, it's decent. Stay away from the seafood soups. Fishy smell. The ingredients are a bit sketchy by American standards. Yet, service is fast, and they serve complimentary tea. Love this place for it's combination ""ho fun"" noodles (the flat wide rice noodles). The combination comes with shrimp, pork and chicken meat. The broth is very flavorful, very similar to Oakland Chinatown's Vien Hoang. This place serves tons of other stuff too! Great lunch spot and super reasonable too. San Sung is amazing. Everything in this place's wonderful: taste good, cheap & good portion. On top of all these, there're like  food items to choose from the menu. I'd recommend trying their noodle. They're delicious, & has good consistency. They go about $  $ for noodle soup. Their beef & fish balls're pretty good too; very rich in flavor. You can get them for about  bucks. Combination Fried Noodle ($. )  Love this dish!  I highly suggest make it a Crispy Fried Noodle for only  cents. The crispy noodle, sauce & meat all blend very well together. Overall: You can't go wrong with this place. I went to this place  times within a week and ordered different food everytime; They all turned out good! Their noodle's the highlight of my experience here. Good authentic Chinese food, cheap price & good portions  What's not to love?!?! However, the service can be pretty bad at times. This is my go to soup place in Chinatown.  Always good, always cheap, always clean and there are plenty of televisions to watch a game on.  Plus the best bars are right around the corner. I visited recently with my family of eight. We each ordered a noodle dish. Portions were generous and the food was tasty . Best dish of the day was the grilled chicken with noodle soup. Prices were inexpensive. Will be back.  Star average on Yelp? You've gotta be kidding me!We saw all the delicious pictures from the outside and it looked clean and modern inside. So we gave it a shot. Dissapointed!I ordered the Satay Beef tendon with noodle soup. What I got was Dinty Moore Beef Stew Soup with Tendons + Tobasco sauce with Noodles. Then again, there was no soup! The ""soup""  was so thick it was more of a sauce. And it tasted dead on like Dinty Moore canned stew. My spouse ordered a basic chicken noodle soup. She said it tasted like instant noodle soup base with cheap quality noodles. Also very few chicken bits. But at least hers came out as SOUP and not SAUCE. Also I'm not a fan of the steel dinnerware. Bowls, cups, and chopsticks are stainless steel.  It feels and looks tacky. Are we in prison? Plus steel chopsticks and steel bowls dont make very nice noises when rubbed against each otherI would give this place  star but I usually reserve those for places that are offensive or insulting in some way. . This is more of a .  star place. Half a star for the place being clean and modern looking. Service was average for this type. Service was quick. Food was good. I was a bit iffy about coming here. . . as we were in Chinatown. . and my first thought from the name was Vietnamese food in CHINAtown? But I gave in and decided to give it a try. . They have a HUGE menu. . and it was kinda hard to decide what I wanted. . . and I settled for what I typically get at a Pho restaurant. . since my niece was getting a Chinese noodle dish, my husband was getting a, what I call, unique dish. . . so we were set. . we'd get to try everything. . . then my hubby suggested we order wonton too. . which we did. . :)We all ended getting the yellow noodle. . . which I kind of regret. . not because it wasn't good. . but I wish I got to try a different noodle! The wontons were YUM. My  tripe was as expected. . and my niece LOVED her yellow noodles. . . she's super picky so I'm super happy she liked the food and ate lots of it. She also really like the wontons as well! This would definitely be a place I would consider eating at again the next time I head to Chinatown! Good pho.  Good vermicelli.  Huge menu with good prices.  Nascar was on the tv, which is weird, but interesting.  Service could've been faster, but it wasn't bad. I like this place! Although their menu is ridiculous with their hundreds of items, I've enjoyed my food each time I've been here. Bun with grilled chicken  Fresh veggies and noodles, chicken was juicy and had good flavor. Loved it!Seafood noodle soup (menu said Cambodian style?)  Piping hot with a good balance of noodles and the seafood and meat. Yummy!Seafood congee  If you've never had chiu chow style congee this may look wrong to you, but it tastes so right! Chiu chow style congee is pretty much super cooked down rice in soup. Definitely can't compare to grandma's but they did pretty damn good. Revived me when I was dying from a terrible cold. And they had generous amounts of fish cake, fish balls, and shrimp. Great for those cold gloomy days ahead. Their service was normal, actually pretty friendly for Chinatown standards. I'll be back! We ordered five things and they were all pretty bland. Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings  worst I've had yet.  It was more like they battered it with flour and then sprinkled the chinese pepper salt on it(the one you eat with congee)Curried Fish Balls  these were alright but still pretty bland for a 'curry' dishHu Tieu Combo w/ Egg Noodle  this smelled good but tasted pretty blandShrimp Foo Young  not terribleWon Ton  my bf complained it was bland Service was great! Our waitress was helpful and fast. The food was just OK. Beef noodle soup was so so and feel really thirsty afterward. Milk tea was not strong enough and it was a bit tasteless. I would say if you are visitor don't mind to come here. If you are in SF all the time come try it and see if you like it or not. Had the curry beef rice for  bucks or so. Pretty tasty!SCARY and HUGE menu!They accept credit card too! Win! The Pho and rice dish was  stars.  Really great if you can put up with the  Star service, and the ridiculously large menu. I had to ask at least three times during the meal for a refill on my water (I tend to go overboard with the Sriracha  sometimes), the soup took + minutes to arrive in a partially full room at pm.  And a neighboring family was making a huge racket banging silverware on the table throwing chopsticks around, etc. . . and the staff made no effort to correct it. This place has always been a ""must go"" every time I come to Chinatown. I love their varieties of noodle soup where you can choose the types of noodle you want. Their price is very reasonable for a portion size that big. They moved to this new location from their old site on Stockton St. Now I don't have to worry about getting a seat any more! :D This place reminds me of China. The decor, set up, and even the flashing bathroom signs. The restaurant is clean but that's because it's still new. Let's see how it holds up a year from now. There are numerous TVs all along the wall. Kind of pointless though because they don't air anything interesting. There were two TVs that were used as clocks, one that was rotating menu items, and another one airing a Jerry Springer like show. When you get to ordering, the menu is overwhelming because it's pages and pages of food but at least they have pictures. When we got our food, they came in metal bowls with metal chopsticks. There was even a page in the menu that emphasized that the chopsticks were not to be taken home. I must admit that they were pretty niffy.  I ordered the Taiwanese noodle soup. The flavors were good but I did not care for the meat. My beef was so rubbery that I could not eat it. They also have a good selection of noodles. Overall, good place for a quick lunch. I would come back! Overall .  starsBeen here many times over the last year. Food doesn't disappoint. Menu is HUGE and has tons of pictures to help the diner chose. TOO many options if you ask me!Imperial Roll are good, but dinky in size. Scramble egg (runny type) plates are excellent. Think it's odd that everything is served on/in/with metal  ie chopsticks, side dishes, bowl, plates, cups. Feels a bit like prison. Was walking around China Town latter in the evening. Found this place open later then most others,, Yea!!   Used the restroom,, Very clean,, Yea!!   A great place. . I hope they keep it clean as it is now,, as it is hard to find nice clean economical places to eat in China Town!! Well hard to find even clean places. . .   Huge menu, cool flat screen t. v. s, free WiFi! Great place to sit and relax when visiting China town. .   And the price is right, Huge bowl of fish ball soup for $ with complimentary hot tea. . I look forward to going back and trying more items in the near future.   The minus one star almost minus two is for the poor service. . Do not get me wrong the people are very nice, I met the owner he is very friendly and we had a nice short conversation. . .    But the staff needs to be trained to better describe/suggest items to those of us ""visiting China Town"". I actually would have ordered more food but did not feel I was welcome to as I was told when I first came in the kitchen closed in  min and needed to order everything now. I was not offered to order more even when  yes SEVEN other tables came in well after me including  arriving  min before closing. I was not checked on or offered a beverage other then tea as I would have liked a diet coke. The servers do not smile and are not inviting. . . Now this may be a cultural thing but they are in business in a high tourist area. . .   I WILL be going back as I really liked the food and the price! Solid food in a nice location!  Huge menu with  or so items.  Many of the soups are meals in themselves!  Entree portions are generous to say the least.  Every thing we had was very well prepared.  Following the custom in China, dishes tend to come out as they are ready resulting in everything being hot when served which I like.  Two soups,  apps,  entree and  beers came to about $ with T&T.  Great deal, will be back next time in SF. Solid diner style chinese.  There was a good split of Chinese and non chinese customers. Tables have the Sriacha, fish sauce and other necessary condiments.  Menu is huge.  We had the sweet and sour fish and grilled pork over rice  both great. I'll be back  lots more I want to try. The two stars are for neutral/indifferent service, and for pretty okay but not outstanding food. My tofu was chewy and just. . . There in my chow mein and vegetables. That being said, there's an ENTIRE page for vegetarian food, pictures for every dish and noodle option. Portions DO tend to go large, so come hungry!Total for my family of four was $, and we even threw in an appetizer. Very affordable. Don't take beef! I was a fan of the original location on Stockton, so I was concerned that the new location might lack some of the charm and quality now that it's so close to Grant. But it was fabulous as always. We got there a little late on a Sunday. It wasn't crowded and we ended up closing down the place. I had a spicy prawn dish that was excellent. My son opted for pork kidney and was also pleased. I enjoyed talking with the staff. They were great. I love san sun! Whenever i'm at chinatown, this is where you'll find me. I usually order the hainam chicken. They taste pretty good compare to other restaurants! And the fried wonton are delicious snacks! This place has gotten much bigger at the new location. Cheap price and workers aren't rude! It's been a year since I've come to this place. . . I was so looking forward to come back. Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations. Food was not comparable to a year ago. Portions have changed and their milk tea is half the size it was before AND it's not as good anymore! Still love the Mapo Tofu, but I don't think that will be enough to make me come back. . . Sorry San Sun! ): One of my favorite restaurants in Chinatown. The menu is huge, the portions are big and the food is excellent. The prices are reasonable and the place is very clean. Huge restaurant. Huge menu. Simple and easy menu to navigate. It's all written out for you and you can personalize pretty much everything. It's like. . how do you say, the self serve of restaurants, minus the part where you don't cook the food. . ? lolI think someone counted like  flat screen tv/monitors playing the news/advertising food they serve. FREE WIFI~They serve foods that you would find in a Chinese and Vietnamese restaurant. I've come here twice and I've made the following conclusions:) Chicken pho with ho fun (rice noodles)  Yummy. The portion size is just enough and they don't skimp too much on the chicken. Soup is yummy. ) Hainan chicken with rice  not something you should order 'cause they don't make it like other places. . a lot of bones and not too tasty) Lemon grass chicken with rice noodles  smelled delicious and tasty according to the other members of my partyThe prices here are good, since it's Chinatown so it's cheaper than most restaurants outside of Chinatown. Great pho.  Great prices.  Not much else to say. My girlfriend and I had our very first meal in San Francisco here while on vacation. I'm used to the Vietnamese restaurants in New York where they all pretty much have the same exact menu and everything is laid out in the same place on the menu. I was a little dumbfounded with the menu here at San Sun. There were just so many things to choose from. Pages and pages of different foods; some not even of Vietnamese or Chinese origin. I ordered the closest thing I could find to a classic NYC styled # pho noodle; the pho with everything. I can't remember the name of it now but it was the last item on the pho page of the menu. It was a pretty big bowl of noodles and beef parts. The broth wasn't bad either. It wasn't all too amazing but it definitely hit the spot. My girlfriend ordered the better dish of the meal. She had the Beef with Egg Sauce over Haw Fun. This thing was so amazingly delicious. We have beef and egg sauce all the time back home but we've never had it over haw fun. It took a lot of willpower from her to share some with me and even more willpower from me to not eat it all when she did share. The place is pretty clean and very well lit. There's even hand sanitizer outside of the bathrooms to use. Our waitress was a very nice lady. She informed us that you can park outside of the restaurant for free if you eat there. Definitely one of the best meals I had while in SF! The place is really big, always enough space for everyone. I ordered a wonton noodle soup. The tea they gave us had some chrysanthamum in it, which was a nice touch. The noodles were pretty dry and hard, probably not cooked all the way through. The wontons were whatever, not bad but not especially tasty either. Overall, just fine, nothing to brag about. Big props for it being clean, because that seems like a luxury in Chinatown. Since discovering this place a few months ago, I've been coming here for lunch at least half a dozen times now.  I always order something new since there are over  items on their menu.  What stood out for me so far are their fried rice (I've had  of their options under that category so far), each time perfectly cooked with a hint of smokiness that I look for.  They also prepare their shrimps, which are thoroughly de veined, and cook them well, with just the right amount of crunch and firmness upon biting into one.  And for those who are bitter melon aficionados like me, they also serve them just right, al dente and thin enough so you are not overwhelmed by the bittrerness but not so thin that the flavor is lost.  What I also like about this restaurant is its cleanliness, including the bathrooms.  In Chinatown, that counts for a lot!! I love this Vietnamese restraunt.  The pork dry bun is the best in the neighborhood.  This is also one of the cleanest restraunts of this type.  Prices are fantastic and If atmosphere matters to you, this is an oasis. Can't go wrong here. Don't underestimate a Pho restaurant in China Town. It's way good. Nice restaurant to sit and eat. Not like those small, crowded, or no seat restaurants in other parts of Chinatown. Yummy fried rice in a variety of flavors and meat choices. So very good after a long hard bike ride over the Golden Gate Bridge. The place was super clean, service was good, the menu was easily discernable, and the food was terrific. I wasn't completely sold on the shrimp egg foo young because it had too many onions, but everything else was divine. Great little place to eat local in Chinatown, San Francisco. Don't miss it. We stumbled on this place out of the 's of Chinese food restaurants after walking through the ally's in China Town. The first thing we noticed was the menu was huge! Can't remember how many thick plastic covered pages there were but if you are the kind of person who can't decide from hundreds of choices, don't go there!I have not seen choices like this except at a Vietnamese restaurant, so there must be a mix here which I like as I get lots of choices. We got  dishes. My wife got sweet and sour chicken. We got chow mein and I got fish with bitter melon. It was really good. Its always a treat when I find bitter melon. The prices were some of the lowest since we arrived in SF. So we will diffidently find this place again when in SF. One thing worth mentioning is that my wife is allergic to carrots, peanuts, lettuce etc. We talked to the waitress and she checked several times for us to make sure there was no peanuts or peanut oil used in here dish. Of course if a restaurant fails to find out or go out of their way to find out, we would not even give them  star! no matter how great they are. . . pretty modern for a Chinatown cheap eat joint. They have plasma's everywhere and use a touch system for a huge menu of Chinese ad Vietnamese dishes that can frankly be confusing with the sheer scope of the options available. Ordered the Vietnamese beef rice plate with an order of imperial egg rolls and a Viet iced coffee. All were pretty mediocre from the stale rice to the tiny imperial rolls. The prices are rock bottom and the place is clean with good service hence the extra star. I see much better options nearby worth a second look. I was so bummed that I haven't been to old Stockton Street location. But I'm glad that old location has CLOSED!The new location took over the historic Sun Wah Kue location, which been there since the Pacific Railroad Act of . ""You knew that, right?""On my debut of the new relocated restaurant, I was browsing through the glossy, colorful and extensive menu. The new joint serves Chinese (Mandarin & Cantonese) and Vietnamese Cuisines. ""Did somebody say, Vietnamese?""And that is what I ordered for lunch #: Bun Ghau Yau Bo Nhuong.  For $. , the bowl had grilled chicken, cold vermicelli noodles, a cut up egg roll and fresh vegetables all in one bowl with a dipping sauce. You have noticed the egg roll without the ""s"", is because I only received one in my dish. Other than that, the bowl was fine. I also had a Vietnamese Iced coffee with my meal. I needed because I was sleepy. As I was enjoying my meal, I was also watching NBA Basketball. ""A couple of old men, dining there and sitting next to me, cheered for. . . Jeremy Lin? I'm shocked!""And here is another shocking part. The Health Department gave the new restaurant a score of: , which were graded in the beginning of February of . That is pretty clean for a Chinatown business. A new and clean restaurant, but I do feel optimistic about the score of .  Unlike the historic Sun Wah Kue restaurant, no free slice of pie. Decent food and I hope the new San Sun will start a new chapter where the old business left off."
Silver Cafe|4.0|Burgers in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|24|-1|3.88888888889| We were walking in to eat here my disabled friend my daughter and myself. I went to go park the car after getting my disabled friend as close to the door as possible when I returned he said he had to use the bathroom. The restaurant owner told us to walk across the street and use the gas stations bathroom my friend would never make it over there because he's disabled they could clearly see that but they didn't care. A neighboring business said yes they do have a bathroom they just don't want anyone using it. How heartless not accommodate a disabled person in an emergency we left and they lost our business please do not eat at this restaurant they don't deserve your business. Their donuts are absolutely delectable. I have never met a doughnut that melted in my mouth as their doughnuts here do. I also don't believe this place makes a single doughnut that isn't delicious. I used to grab doughnuts here just about every day, but now that I'm dieting, I've had to refrain. If I could, I'd eat their doughnuts everyday, and if you're in the Excelsior and have a chance to try their doughnuts, it's an opportunity that can't be missed. I come here almost every morning not only for the great breakfast but for the great hospitality. I passed this place many times before and kick myself in the head to think I didnt come here sooner. I always get the breakfast special with bacon eggs toast and a coffee. Theresa is very nice! Service  /Very nice and helpful ladyGreat serviceNot bad glaze donutCurious about their hamburger . . . now that Joe's Cable Car is gone. next time in the area My favorite coffee shop in San Francisco just happens to be just a couple blocks away from my house. I've been coming to this spot for almost  years and I've seen at least  owners part the keys over to someone new. This time, they've hit the jackpot with the owners. Their hazelnut coffee is probably the best coffee I've had in a while and their donuts are really hard to breast both for the price and taste. I usually don't bother with the other stuff like the breakfast menu because it's literally what can make at home for a fraction of the price, but the donuts and coffee is, bar none, the best. Silver Cafe is a greasy spoon donut shop right across from the always busy  Mission bus stop @Silver.  They get my business when the bus is late!Their coffee is serviceable, and the bacon 'n egg breakfast sandwich is delicious thick bacon with hearty sourdough.  They go heavy on the fat though, after a trip to Silver, I had better hope I have a nice roll of Tums on hand. Silver Cafe is both delicious and ordinary. Okay, the lady behind the counter actually makes a mean vanilla latte. The donuts here are also good and I have also purchased breakfast for $ which I believe was eggs,  slices of bacon and a huge order of tasty pancakes. . . Really not bad. Great coffee. The chicken in the basket is some of the best chicken ever. Get it. Just do it. I'm new to the neighborhood so I don't know if the cafe recently cleaned itself up or what but I didn't see ant bullet holes or graffiti when I visited.  The inside of the shop is clean with plenty of seating and a campus dining hall appearance (only replace the student diners with a diversity of working class types).  I love the mix of people that come here, young and old of all ethnicities, because it mirrors ths heart of Excelsior. The cafe is located within  feet of  bus stops and you can see all  of these stops from the cafe window.  If you see a bunch of people loitering out front, chances are that they are waiting for a bus.  I love grabbing breakfast there.  For $.  plus tax, you can get  sausages,  eggs, and  huge pancakes.  I love their donuts EXCEPT for the apple fritters.  Usually, apple fritters are my favorite donut but I find them too oily there.  Oddly, their other donuts don't share the same level of greasiness and are, instead, light and fluffy.  My favorite is their eggrolls which cost (if I remember correctly) about  cents each.  I have not yet tried the fried egg sandwich that alot of others had mentioned. Overall, Silver Cafe offers good food at a fair price at a very convenient location.  I have visited this place a few times already in the month that I've lived in Excelsior and am sure to visit many more times.
The Blarney Stone|4.0|Pubs in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|183|-1|3.96153846154|" Definitely one of the best bars in the Richmond. Shannon makes me happier than anyone in the entire world. Hang OUT at this bar it's a great time. So many games so many good drinks SO many great bartenders :):):):) Good crew . Chill holiday night . Owners work behind bar mostly neighborhood fellas. Good for groups and big screen sporting events . I'm always a fan of a good neighborhood bar surrounded by lots of poppin restaurants. Blarney Stone has provided me with a place to go drink and chill for many years now. They get busy during games, but there's a lot of seating and an outdoor area, so not too hard to grab a spot. Usually my pal Jeremy P and I will grab a burrito at Gordo's down the block and bring it in. You can do this with whatever food you like, which is nice. I think B Stone just started serving food, which is why I give only  stars. The food is HIGHLY mediocre. But I guess if you don't know that a place serves food, there's probably a reason for that. I was on the struggle bus (but what's new) and ordered the Fried Chicken Sandwich ($) with a side of Tater Tots. I expected fresh fried chicken, though thinking about it now, I'm not sure why given it's bar food, but got an *obviously* pre frozen, breaded hockey puck with wilted lettuce and an old slice of red onion. Truly a sad excuse for a chicken sando. The only redeeming quality of the meal were the tots: crispy, crunchy, freshly hot out of the fryer. My friend Mike had the Chicken Tenders ($) and they were just awful. Salty to the max, drenched in some kind of salty ""buffalo sauce"". Someone in the kitchen really used a heavy hand, this stuff was puddling in thick pools around the plate. They were also extremely tough to bite, as he offered me one and I nawed for a while. With a side of soggy fries, this dish was no bueno. But I digress as The Bloody Mary and all the beers on tap make B Stone a great place to hang your hat for a while. Just maybe save your appetite for a Sheppard's Pie from next door, pho for Turtle Tower down the street, or any other local restaurant. Or just stick with a side of taters to share. Great spot to relax and watch a game. Go here with my boyfriend to watch Notre dame play we love it. Bartender Nate is awesome. Great neighborhood bar for watching the game. Friendly staff and good drink selection. Busy busy busy place when the Niners are playing. I'm not sure how we managed to snag a table, but we did and we were happy to have a good view of several TVs. If I were just rating this place on the service or its value as a place to watch sports, I would give it  stars. But, alas, I was starving after soccer practice and needed to eat while I watched the Niners eek out a painful win, and the food was just not good. Two things were good, in my opinion: the burger and the tater tots. Unfortunately, my so called ""friends"" ordered me french fries instead of tater tots while I was in the bathroom (come on, guys. Really? French fries over tater tots? What is this? Communist Russia?). The fries were terrible, lukewarm, and just not my kind of potato (which is saying a lot). My boyfriend got the chicken tenders and they were god awful. First of all, they were soaked in buffalo sauce. . . um. . . did we order chicken tenders or the world's largest boneless buffalo wings? (Who even wants regular sized boneless wings?) That part wouldn't have been so bad if the buffalo sauce was actually good but it was so salty, I wouldn't have been surprised if that sauce recipe called for equal parts salt and buffalo jizz. Just gross. And the chicken sandwich was also gross. Just a poorly heated piece of freezer meat. So. . . just go to Blarney Stone for the beer and the sports and you'll be fine. If you order food, you'll most likely be severely disappointed. Nice bar with great attentive bartenders.  Never wait for a drink.  Giants bar mostly but they don't discriminate because I'm an A's fan.  Always have a game on and multiple tv's.  Nice people, younger crowd most nights.  Just the kind of place I like. What a great neighborhood bar!  My friend and I got a spot at the bar where Shannon our bartender took such great care of us.  The pours are super generous and they use fresh fruit in their cocktails. I saw them bring out a ton of grapefruits which inpired me to order a greyhound (vodka with grapefruit juice). Boy, fresh fruit juice makes a whole lot of a difference in the quality of the drink. I can tell that the workers love their job and the ambiance was great. It was very busy but it wasn't uncomfortably crowded, which I loved. One thing to point out, I noticed Shannon kept making margaritas, which my friend ended up ordering. It was really good! I swear I saw her make over  of those so it looks like a very popular drink of hers. If you like a good margarita on the rocks. you should try hers.  You wont be dissapointed. I plan to go back to try their food. I'll update my review once I do, by looking at the pictures, I look forward to trying their breakfast one day. They have tater tots! Yum!! My favorite place in the Richmond district! This Irish bar features cool bartenders, a nice patio, and a shuffleboard. There is plenty of space to enjoy your drinks and watch your favorite team! They also have brunch on Saturday and Sunday, and the food is good too. Cool atmosphere overall! Go check it out! :) This is my favorite bar in San Francisco. I will admit that there was some bias in the beginning because it was the first bar I went to when I turned , but after going there + times over the last year, this five star review still stands, and is not biased at all.  The Staff: Amazing. . . . Nothing more I can really say.  I have personally met everyone who works there and they are all very nice, down to earth people.  They all remember who I am every time I arrive for a Sharks game and always remember to turn on the channel so we don't miss the game. The People:Amazing. . . Just as the staff.  all very awesome people of the Richmond (and other) districts just stopping by for a drink.  There are also a BUNCH of regulars who go to Blarneys and they all rock!  I've made plenty of friends there and the conversation is always amazing.  The people and environment of this bar make it feel completely awesome and it barely feels like a dive bar because it's very well kept and clean. Service:Amazing. . . . Yes, the rd amazing in a row.  Great drinks and for a good price  especially during happy hour! The cons:The only real con of this place, which does not take away from it's  star rating, is that it is COMPLETELY packed during any major sports games (during playoffs) to the point that you can barely even find a place to stand.  This is NOT a huge deal at ALL but more of a warning for people that get cluster phobic or don't like being in a huge group. I'm a regular here now.  Love this place.  / Intricately awesome Bloody Mary with a giant pickle!  Before we went to Aziza, just near there, we hopped into this place.  It was honestly pretty cool.  It is a nicer dive type place  complete with an outdoor patio.  Inside is rich in color, tons of random Irish or sports team stuff every where and of course, a wooden bar.  It isn't a tiny place, but it isn't huge either.  I would have a had time bringing a group. The outside is fairly nice and I always love being outdoors, so it was a huge plus for me.  It was also clean, had a few tables and a little greenery.  The bartender was pretty cool too.  He made the most elaborate Bloody Mary I've ever had . . .  seriously!  And it was so unexpected to. Cool place. Cool drinks. Cool staff. I've been coming here since I turned . I love it! Nice bartenders, every seating has a good view of the TVs, back patio for a smoke, laid back regulars, and the area has good food. Best part of Blarneys is the fresh squeezed grapefruit for a greyhound! It's the best! I wish I could give this bar  stars. Beyond the awesome bartenders to the great (affordable) drinks to the weekend brunches this place is a haven. Having gone here since turned  and moved recently to the neighborhood I not once in my .  years had a bad experience. EVERYONE is really friendly and nice, there's ample seating and even if there's a game on and it gets rowdy, there's still a maintainer crowd control feeling. Nothing bad to say about this place AT ALL. EVER. NEVER. Solid  starts for the boys.  The do a good job and they were there for the hood when the hood needed them.  I loved the previous owners as well but it was a bit depressing at times.  I do miss live music Friday night so bring that back eh? Cool spot.  Irish bakery next door has awesome sausage rolls and Shepard pies.   Beer Jameson and Irish snacks.  Great stop. Blarney Stone is one of my new favorite bars! We came on Saturday morning to watch the Bruins hockey game, and there was a good amount of people already there at :am. We were pleasantly surprised by their brunch menu and their egg and cheese sandwich was SO good. Their bloody mary is also fantastic, and they have great beers on tap. The bartender was so friendly and we ended up chatting with him most of the time. It was a pretty good crowd for the rest of the game, and the place filled up once the Giants game started. There are a lot of TVs and they are very accommodating in terms of changing the channel. If we lived in the area, we'd be there all the time! awesome!I can't forget them for serving delicious food items. I had three and all were delcious and it differs from one another. For having great justification I love it much. I highly recommend it. Charge is fair thouhg a bit high and location is fine. Tip your bartenders Awesome place to grab some drinks! The bartenders are super friendly, drinks are well priced, awesome atmosphere and they've got shuffleboard and free air hockey! I missed the fact that the air hockey is free but saw it mentioned in someone else's review. I must go back just to take advantage of that! Stopped in with some friends last night since we were in the neighborhood and had no regrets.  Nice chill bar, nice chick behind the bar who provided good service, pretty standard prices, and nice pours.  Nothing outstanding mind you, but if I were in the area wanting a pint and a whiskey or three I'd be more than happy to return. Best. Tots. Ever. Living in the Richmond district, this is the default spot for a great night out within walking distance, or a great place to grab a weekend brunch with XL fresh squeezed mimosas and awesome bloody marys. Doey is a great bartender. Oh yeah, and did I mention the best tots ever?. . . because yeah. BEST TOTS EVER. Pretty chill place. I would go here again, but I wasn't too crazy about it. Service is good. I had a great experience here and will certainly be back! The crowd is very richmond young, white and asian, and relaxed. I just feel like it's a safe place to get a drink without having to worry about walking around the neighborhood at night (as opposed to SoMa). The bartenders were very friendly and efficient. . . I never had to wait longer than  minutes for a drink (and it was a busy night). The drinks were strong! Wow. wow. wow. Great prices too. Loved the modern jukebox. The outdoor patio is totally legit! Bring your drink outside and drink under the stars. Side note: There's a small step to the patio, but big enough for girls in heals to miss a  step and fall to the ground. I saw  girls (including me _ ) do gymnastics as we try not to kiss the concrete. A  ""watch your step"" sign would be great for the future :) Good first impression when we walked in, several TVs playing Sunday football and pretty busy. I knocked off a star because there was a large group of chargers fans trying to watch their game, and the bartender switched it off at least twice and turned it to a game that was already on  other TVs. If it were me, I would have also been upset. I wasn't there to watch any game in particular, however, there were  games in OT that i would have liked to see (especially given there are  TVs) that they didn't  have on. To be fair, I didn't ask them to change the game so I can't complain too much. Waitress was very attentive and nice. Food was average bar fare. They have a nice patio but it was chilly today so I didn't check it out. The best part of this place shuffleboard! And air hockey. A good, consistent bar in the neighborhood to go watch sports and start a night of drinking! Plus, you get to bring outside food into the bar and having the bakery next door is a def pro! This bar is a place that I am proud to call home on Saturday mornings. As THE definitive Michigan bar in SF, The Blarney Stone meets all of my needs and exceeds my expectations. When it comes to sports the atmosphere is great. It invites a truly energetic crowd that turns up regardless of the kick off time. Viewing angles are great as every seat has a clear view of the five LED TVs that surround the perimeter. Without a doubt , the best sportsbar in the Outer Richmond. Drinks are great and the mimosas are created with freshly squeezed orange juice. Their bar food is serviceable, flanked by their excellent tater tots and buffalo chicken strips. I have to conclude this review by mentioning the great service from Bart, the bartender, and Kelly the main waitress. Even when things get crowded, they always find a way to make sure you're taken care of. Mostly, I come here out of convenience since I live nearby. But it is a fun Irish pub to go to on a weekday night, play some shuffleboard with friends, have decently priced drinks (fresh squeezed grapefruit and vodka is $ ish), and meet some unpretentious people of varied ages. I've come here on a Sunday morning to watch football and have brunch, and the food is pretty great (first time trying fried pickles, an amazing would be heart attack) with $ mimosas. Great for sports, unhealthy food, and a chill night where you don't want to put too much effort. This bar is my favorite neighborhood bar in San Francisco.  The bartenders could not be better. The atmosphere is spacious yet cozy, and boasts large screens for sporting events (go giants!)There are an assortment of fun bar games to play, and locals to converse with. They also have an awesome brunch. I have nothing but amazing things to say about the Blarney Stone! I had an excellent time at this bar. Bartenders are friendly and promote a good atmosphere. Excellent pub local bar feel. NIce bartender, cheap happy hour.  Only serve food on the weekends.  Plenty of TV's if your looking to watch a Giants game. Decent. There's no Blarney at the Blarney stone. . . just a good pour of Guiness. . . and a shot of Jamieson. I was so buzzed after watching Paul McCartney at outsidelands. . . that I had to come here and get a drink or two or three. It was pretty busy but service was stellar. Great atmosphere, Great help and good drink selection.  days a week! I will now review the Blarney Stone, to the theme of Cheers:Making your way to the Blarney Stone today pull up a chair and take a spot. Taking a break from all your worries, sure a drink would help a lot. Wouldn't you like to get away? Sometimes you want to go The Blarney stone is it's name, and they're always glad you came. Smoke in the back patio as you can see, Not each bar is all the same You wanna be at the Blarney StoneThat's its name. Damn I love this place. Hospitable bartenders serving fresh squeezed citrus drinks, numerous HD TVs tuned to all key sporting events, Irish style weekend breakfast/brunch, parlor games from free shuffleboard to air hockey, spacious and landscaped back patio, clean restrooms, and many other positive attributes are maintained by Vince and Bart, the co owners originally from San Francisco who provide all types of patrons a great experience visiting this Outer Richmond watering hole. Whether you are a regular, a post Outside Lands party goer, or a group of Mission district residents looking to switch it up, all walks of life will have an amazing time at the Stone. Mix it with the amazing nearby food options (e. g. , Tommy's Mexican, Aziza, Hot Sauce and Panko, etc. ), you can spend quite some time in the neighborhood. I'm a Mission resident and thrive on spending free time at my local joints, but visiting the Outer Richmond every so often is a must, and the Stone, along with Trad'r Sam, are dissimilar Little Russia inhabiting bar twins within walking distance that will leave you smiling. Whoo hope y'all wore green yesterday! I definitely had little splashes of green on myself to avoid being pinched. Keisha and I were trying to find a bar to hit up for our first stop of St. Patty's day and I chose this place cause of the name. Haha. . It was definitely happening here when we arrived. Loads of people in this little bar. There's also a patio in the back where you can purchase food & smoke obviously. I had their Skyy Blood Orange Refresher which was really refreshing just like juice. Then I got a Bloody Mary  spicy, and OMG. . . it was the best Bloody Mary I've ever had (although this was my nd time having a Bloody Mary). It was very tasty & had a nice kick to it. Mmm . . . I'll definitely hit this place up for more Bloody Marys if I'm ever in this area again which is rarely. haha. . . but if I was, I definitely would! :) They have a lot of tv's which is great for sporting events, but there isn't a whole lot of seating. The back patio is kind of hidden, so I didn't even realize it existed until I'd been here a few times. The drinks are delicious. They have a Skyy Blood Orange drink that is really phenomenal and they're only $ which is nice. If I lived nearby I'd probably go more often. I've heard they also have really great brunch, but haven't been able to check it out yet. Good priced drinks and plenty of TVs including a projector screen to watch all your fav sports. Best bloody Mary in the city. Love. Warning: if you say spicy, they give it to you SPICY. I am not a local, but came here with a group of friends who are in order to watch the SF ers win the NFC Championship. We got there about an hour before the big game and the place was packed. The bouncer told us that people were there hours before they even opened just to get a good seat. The only downside was that there was not enough seating for everyone and even standing space was a little tight. They have numerous TVs which made it easy to keep an eye on the game. The bartenders were very friendly and incredibly speedy. Considering the bar was packed I never had to wait more than a minute or two to get a drink. The prices are very fair and they also had a good specials. There were also serving beer and food on the back patio which was great because all the football fans were quite hungry. The atmosphere was very casual and fun. I really enjoyed my time here. I will be visiting again in the future. Not that I frequent the Richmond too often to go out but Blarney Stone gets my vote of awesomeness. We decided to double date last night and headed here after some Korean BBQ down the street. For $.  I ordered us our four drinks Jameson on the Rocks, Old Fashioned, Vodka/Soda, and a Speciality drink. Not so bad Blarney Stone not so bad!We also placed our card with the bar to play Shuffle Board which is awesome! A dumb game, but a ton of fun to enjoy while enjoying a cocktail. The staff is friendly, the price is right, and the atmosphere is laid back and fun. I also LOVE that they have a jukebox! In the event I venture back to the Richmond, I'll certainly venture back to the Blarney Stone! A compact Irish pub that's got tons of big screen TVs and beers on tap. Perfect for watching games with a great crowd of people and some cool, super positive bartenders too. One caveat: the food preparation can veer way off course. Chicken tenders came out fried to a radioactive, brittle burnt brown crisp. Even if it's fairly early in the day, say am or noon, maybe it's a good idea to change the cooking oil a bit more often. Still, Blarney Stone has a cool game day atmosphere and the *correct* partisan affiliation: nothing like hailing to the Leaders and Best while the Victors gets blasted over the loudspeakers after every score. ;) I was going to watch the St. Mary's USF basketball game in the City last spring, so I figured what better way to show up than stumbling and reeking of gin? I had about  minutes before I had to go there, and this place was able to get the job done quickly and for a reasonable price. I did like the atmosphere  friendly neighborhood bar, just classy enough to stay above dive status but by no means fancy. I was there just before the busy time would typically start, but you could tell it probably gets really crowded during peak hours. Would definitely come back here next time I'm in the neighborhood. Best bar to watch a Michigan game!! The bartenders are friendly and wore Michigan shirts. On Michigan game day, all TVs are playing the Michigan game!! Food here is not good, so come here only to drink! Would recommend you go next door to the Irish or German bakery and bring some food back to the bar if you are hungry! I have been here twice now and both my experiences were similar, so figured a Yelp review is in order. Service/PriceIt's ok.  I found the mixed drinks to be a little weak and the pours of whiskey neat to be a little light.  Prices are decent  good pint of beer is around $, well booze is $ or $, decent spirits will run you $ to $. Typical experience on my visit the other night  while drinking my beer I asked the cure female bartender to see the whiskey list, she replies ""Sure"" then goes about her business.  Several minutes later she comes over and asked if I made a choice  ""um, well I never got the list. ""  ""oops, sorry, just a moment. ""  Several more minutes pass and the same question from her to which I reply ""still haven't seen the list"".  This was all done with smiles and we laughed about it, but . . . well you see what I mean. Then when she left and the guy took over, he completely ignored us.  I think he could tell we were wrapping up and thus there was no business here.  I just wanted a refill on my water and he ignored my polite motions to get his attention  he walked by at least  times and served the person next to me while never looking at me.  I finally spoke up loudly and got his attention  he refilled my water and said not a single word.  Usually when there is a shift change and I get a glass of water, I'll tip the bartender a buck, cause they have to make a living too.  Not this time. Not really complaining about the service, just showing why I think that it is not top notch. Bar Stock  BeerPretty good.  They have  to  on tap (didn't really count them).  But they have a good range of selections, pretty much for everyone's taste.  I got the Smithwicks  one of my favorites.  This is clearly the reason to come here. Bar Stock  SpiritsAgain I will use the descriptor ""ok"".  They have a decent though not extensive selection  the core holdings you find in most bars and a couple higher end selections.  But the list is nothing to write home to father about.  In the whiskey department they have  Irish, and handful of scotch, and a handful of American (mostly bourbon).  The list has them all listed together with no differentiation between them.  Also, the first two bourbons I asked for, they were out.  Similar selection of other spirits  decent but light on the higher quality gins, vodka, etc. ClienteleThe crowd both times was an interesting mix of older (drunk) locals at the bar, young (drunk) partiers towards the back, couples canoodeling in the corner, and a few lonely hearts spread around.  I have had a few interesting conversations there, in the interesting way of having a debate with someone much younger and drunker can only go.  It was entertaining at least. DécorI would describe this as a poor imitation of an Irish pub crossed with a sports bar.  Lots of wood  bar, floor, tables, walls.  It's basically a standard large ""Neighborhood"" bar/pub.  Plenty of TV's to watch the current sporting event, and TV's are usually turned to sports.  My only complaint in this regards is that the TV's mounted above the bar are too high to watch comfortably while sitting at the bar.  Since the bar is not that deep and the TV's are pretty high, the viewing angle is pretty steep  leading t a sore neckAlso, it seems that the younger set thinks that ""dive bars"" are cool and therefore calls most any local place that is older and not high end a ""dive"" bar.  This is not a dive bar.  Believe me, I have been a many a dive bar, and you can look up the common definitions of a dive bar  this is not one.  It is way too well lit, has way too many TVs, etc, etc. CleanlinessThe place is kept reasonably clean and the bathrooms were not too bad.  But I will say that both visits were earlier in the evening  : to : range.  I would wager that by the time midnight rolls around, the back patio and the bathrooms will start to get fairly rank and you may catch an occasional whiff of the love smell of urine or puke. ParkingBest to walk because:. Parking can be a bitch in this area. You are drinkingSo, three stars it is.  I enjoyed it there and will likely be back on occasion, but there are (IMHO) better places to go. Come one come all!  My coworkers & I dropped in to catch Game  of the NLCS. Can we say Awesome! Low key, good crowd, multiple  tv screens , plenty of seating , pitchers on tab all around.  Since they didn't serve food that day, the staff allowed us to bring in take out from Volcano Curry across the street.  You can't beat this.  Def a fan.  We'll be back! can't even remmber being here. (See pics) Review #. Local lively bar but you can still relax if you choose to with pockets of people choose one vibe over the other. Drinks were slightly weak but service was friendly. I came here for St. Patrick's Day and the place was, expectedly, a zoo. The owner was really cool, super friendly and personable given all the craziness inside. I've been here other times since then when it's much calmer and I really like the place. It's really big and open. They have a cool outdoor patio area which makes it a perfect place to day drink. Lots of tvs and a big screen projector that they put games on. They have pool tables too. They do have a virtual jukebox but they need to replace that thing asap because it sucks. The screen is broken and it takes like five minutes to select one song. Drinks are good and bartenders are friendly but one pissed me off because she just blatantly skipped two songs that I had played on the jukebox. I don't care if you don't like Britney Spears; I paid for that shit. Not cool. All in all this is a good bar for pretty much any occasion. The Blarney Stone is a nice, chill Irish bar in the Outer Richmond district. The bartenders are very friendly, down to earth and always down for a good conversation. This is a great bar to just grab a drink at with friends or coworkers when you don't want anything too crazy. They allow you to bring in food, which is always a plus & for games (Giants, Soccer, Olympics) they have tvs & a big screen. This bar gets packed with crazy drunks whenever there is a big event Golden Gate Park (but hey, what bar doesn't). This is the kind of bar I've recently become a fan off. I realize I'm getting ""too old"" for the crazy drunken nights and now just want a drink here and there. This is the perfect place for such nights. Came in here for a drink and to watch the Giants game.  They had four flat screens and a large projection TV tuned to the Giants and the Olympic games.  After ordering a Guinness and a mimosa with fresh squeezed orange juice, we decided to order some food after checking out their menu.  We ordered a grilled ham and cheese sandwich with tater tots and the FFS, which was two eggs, two slices of bacon, a sausage patty, tater tots, blackforest ham and toast.  The food to our surprise, was very good.  The bartender, who also took our food order, was friendly and provided great service.  Overall, a great experience at a neighborhood bar with some pretty good food. Best.  Bar. Evar!  (Or at least on this block)I'm a huge fan of this bar.  They squeeze their own oranges, limes, lemons and grapefruits and when they're in season, blood oranges.  The bartenders are awesome. A half star off for the accoustics.  With a few sound treatments,  stars.  :) Friendly serve and a good time. . . a few blocks away from Tommy's so hit this place up after we shut down the Mexican Restaurant.  The owner recommended it! I was treated so bad! I was there for a couple drinks my phoned died I saw An Iphone charger plug in the wall with no phone on it  so I asked the bartender if he could charge my phone because my husband was home with my son incase something happen I always like to have my phone with me with battery.  He looked at me an said I dont have aniphone charger, I told him  my  story  and pointed to the wall and said its over there would u be able to do that for me please He look at me and said I dont charge phones and walked away. I stayed there staring at him I also work in the industry and I was in shock with the way he treated me, specially because all I wanted was to charge my phone for  min to see if my son was ok. He came back and my sister asked again because she couldnt believe the attitude he gave us, and she said she always goes there  and knows all the bartenders and he look at her and said I DONT CHARGE PHONES. i ASKED ARE YOU THE OWNER, HE WAS AROUND   SHAVED BLOND HAIR, and he said walking away yes, I didn't believe him and I hope he is not the owner because to be RUDE like that he should never own a bar. I asked for my check and left didn't even finish my beer. Never gonna go back again!"
Mamá Art Cafe|4.0|Art Galleries in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|115|-1|4.10256410256|" The place is nice. Mama is a cool place to chill, sip your favorite beverage, while you enjoy viewing their wall of art exhibit!They provide venues for many cultural organizations, including an ongoing ""Arts Reception"" and a ""Filipino Community Youth Center Open Mic"" along with their Annual Festival. They embrace an eclectic culture of the Mission, while providing you with the best, organically grown coffee beans, all in one location!With so many cafes, coffee shops popping up everywhere in the City, blocks and blocks away from each other; what makes Mama's Art Cafe unique? I would have to say, this place seems to have a local vibe, low key, and best of all; they seem to promote a local community needs and exposes Art to the public from all walks of life!  My cappuccino was nice and smooth, and I was pleasantly surprised with the presentation of their latte! They do close early on Sunday at :pm, but the nice woman was kind enough to take our order, even after they were closed. Fantastico!!Until then, Cheers! ~ :p I love Mama's! Great coffee and space. Crucita (mama) makes sure you feel at home. If you don't like coffee, try the Mexican hot chocolate. It's amazing!! The mocha, too :) the lovely place is located down the street from my place. A great place to get some work done if when you don't want to be bothered by family members. Service here is superb. And their lattes? hmm hmm good. pair that with some of their pasties and you just made yourself a great study session. :) Mamá Art has a fun, ever changing atmosphere and a parklet out front. They even did an amazing exhibit on Cuban film posters. The staff is friendly, bilingual and laid back. Our go to order is a large drip coffee (which I dress with brown sugar and cream), an iced latte, and two veggie bagels. The avocados are always perfect and they have that sandwich down to a science. Our toddler goes insane for the veggie bagel and you will too. Love the fact this family owned coffee/art house is just down the street from my house. Mama is always quick with a hello sweety or sweetheart which makes my day. My love for soy white mochas has only grown since I found this gem of a place. Cute cafe, good coffe, great ambiance. I'm usually not a fan of Mexican hot chocolates. . . . but the lady changed the game with her Mexican mocha. . I'm a fan!!I wish their lox bagels came with sprouts though! Hidden gem in SF! I am becoming some sort of an expert in cafes where to go and get work done and this is so far the best! The coffee is great (of course fair trade. . . ) and unique, I had a Mexican Mocha uhm deli. Good atmosphere and today, a super treat, live music with guitar David Trevors who comes to play every st Thursday of the month,  pm. An interesting art expo too. My lucky day. I love the veggie bagels at this place and treat myself to one  or  times a month.  I'm not much of a coffee aficionado, but their iced coffee is good and they offered me a Mexican Mocha one time which was very good, even though I was a little shy of having the cash on hand to pay for it.  Mama is a really sweet lady and treats me well each time I'm there.  I've never used the wi fi there, but noticed that they did take down the (not unreasonable) signs requiring a $ minimum purchase to use their internet connection.  What kind of a douche would go ahead and use it anyway then have the nerve to write a negative review complaining about it?  Sheesh!They often have interesting artwork there.  It's definitely worth stopping by for the good cafe fare and friendly atmosphere. Only decent place to get a latte around this area. I would even say it could be better than my usual starbucks. A definite recommendation. I will have to try the breakfast  sandwich sometime. So happy that this coffee shop is in the Excelsior instead of a Starbucks! Their brewed coffee is delicious especially the organic Colombian. We buy the whole beans in bulk to brew the coffee at home as well. The egg and bagel sandwiches are also delicious. It's a great spot to get some work done, and it's nice that the tables aren't too crowded togother. Also love the rotating art on the walls! Great neighborhood Cafe, with nice ambiance, and good coffee and food.  Their breakfast bagels are delicious, and a must have is their mexican mocha, to die for.  Highly recommend visiting this cafe. After passing by this place so many times whenever i go walking to the bank especially that living in the excelsior/amazon crocker for a long time, finally got to try it Egg bagel  $  its pretty good. The egg is like thick size. It was steamy when they give it to you. It also cheddar cheese, cream cheese, avocado, onion, cucumber, and tomato. Even it maybe expensive, this bagel can keep you full for breakfast since it quite filling and thick. Small regular hot chocolate  $: kinda pricey but i like that it actually hot. compare to most places, hot chocolate is usually luke warm. The hot chocolate that i had at this place had a lot of the chocolate flavor. At least it wasnt flavorless. Has photos/painting/arts on wall to make it homey. Looks like a family own local coffee place since its seems like its a mother and daughter working together at the cashier when i came inPlay music in backgrounds Its roomy and cleanFriendly service and it seems that the workers enjoy talking to the customers and it seems that they will remember you if you become a regular I was happy to find this place on a random Saturday. I am pretty easy to please, but the baristas I met were very friendly and made me feel welcome. I liked the local art on the walls  some photography. The drinks seems decent enough, but I admit ice latte like I had is easy enough to make anywhere. I just felt happy when I came in and ""Mas Que Nada"" started playing while some sunlight shone through onto the DIY looking furniture. Possibly I am overly generous on all my reviews, but damn the torpedos,  Stars to Mamá Art Cafe! I moved into the Bernal Heights neighborhood recently and decided to do some exploring in the general vicinity. I ended up needing coffee at : AM on a Saturday and discovered Mama Art Cafe. This place is functional, funky and get's the job done as a caffene dispensary. The breakfast bagel sandwich was delicious and I recommend it! Megumi,Sato,KamataniI am a reguler costomer. I come to Cafe Mama,almost everyday. To see my friends at there  times a week. Owner&Mama are very nice people. that why,we are having good times. Workers are very friendly too. I will recomend to anyone. Come to Cafe Mama! You can enjoy fine organic Cafe&Nice music too. Sometime,I play the Piano to my friends,also. Good atmosphere for everybody. Everybody's favorite is Bagel sandwich. I think Cafe Mama is a like second living room for everyone.    Thank you. I hate this stupid place. The owner of this cafe is RUDE, ARROGANT and very NASTY.  My sister witnessed her be very degrading with an African Immigrant who was asking for the wifi password. My experience:I was walking my dog while my sister was inside placing an order. I politely waited outside, and called my sister to come out. She starred at me for about  minutes straight with this dirty look on her face. I acted like I didn't see her. I DO  NOT RECOMMEND OR SUPPORT ANY BUSINESS WITH THIS CAFE! Good breakfast bagel! It's a sunny day an I'm walking on Mission Street in search of a cafe with wi fi. Instantly I gravitate toward the outdoor music playing right in front of Mamá Art Cafe. The place has white walls with pops of orange, brown and yellow and covered with beautiful art. It's spacious and the you really get a sense of productivity and comfort in a community setting. The coffee is pretty good and the owner is someone who obviously knows her regulars. All in all, warm, fresh and understated. Love it. Nice little coffee shop in the outer mission with a good seating area out front. Also a nice selection of bagels and sandwiches. One of the only local coffee shops I even know of near D. C top of the Hill area! I thought i was confined to Starbucks when I stay over there EW. Right on mission next to Burger King. . . Tons of street side parking when i went weekday around am. Found Mamas thanks to a business friend suggesting a coffee meeting here. Great White mocha! Great Lox Bagel! Super fresh n delicious. The ladies that work here are all super sweet! Very cute and cozy deco inside, lots of places to sit inside and out!Ill be back Im glad I know about them now! I only had the coffee here and it was pretty good. I was allowed to use the wifi after purchasing just a coffee, despite their signs all over the counter that say you need to spend $ minimum to use it. Yelp says it's free, but seeing signs like that are kind of a turn off and not very welcoming, especially when there are more than one of them clearly in sight. I appreciate that they still let me use the wi fi for work but please get rid of those signs. I enjoyed the people watching there though! Some really interesting people come here during the day and the workers here seemed to be very friendly and close to a lot of the folks who walked in. Fresh flowers were also on the table, which is a plus. The place is spacious and is a good neighborhood place. My suggestions would be to get faster wi fi. It was a bit slow. Get rid of the $ min signs unless you enforce it. Otherwise, it's an empty threat that's not welcoming as a first impression. The lady behind the counter was really nice, and the drink I ordered was actually really good. However, I came here to study and quickly found out it was a poor place to do it due to the music playing loudly over the speakers. Additionally, there isn't enough seating. I love their Mexican Hot Chocolate! It's rich, thick chocolate and has the right amount of cinnamon and spice:) The coffee selection is alright, but they are lacking a bit in their food selection.  Would love to see more fresh pastries.  I like the fact that they have local art and music here, which is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  Now get some awesome food and we're in business! I have to first say that I've only been here once but you know what they say about first impressions. . . . So here's my take based on my first visit to this cafe. I was burning some time while waiting to meet up with my honey and walked into this place. I waited for about  mins. for someone to appear and take my order. Hm. Finally, someone showed up from the back, I asked for a tamarindo tea. They were out of it. hm. Ok, I went for my go to order at any cafe  a mocha with soy milk. No soy milk. Ok. Nonfat milk it is. Then I asked about the empanadas that was advertised on a sign at the counter. . . . no empanadas today, at this time. Guess it's only available during lunch. I was there at pm. Oh well. i got my mocha and sat down at one of the small round tables at the window. My mocha was not that great, it tasted like it was from a powder. Overall, I wasn't too happy with my first experience here. I may come back for the empanadas if I can time my visit during their lunch time which I guess has to be before pm. Good coffee, fair prices. Nice selection of pastries. The outside seating area is nice as well. These guys are magical people in a magical oasis in Excelsior. We love this place! Can't wait to go back. Bagels rule, coffee rules. I crave the Egg Bagel here from time to time. It's toasted with butter, then they add scrambled eggs, red onions, tomatoes, and cheese on a bagel of your choice. Each cup of espresso drinks are made to order. Fresh grounded beans and fresh steamed milk every time so don't worry about how long the espresso or milk been sitting there. Regular black coffee are self serve so go right ahead, pour it yourself first, then pay. I love how their arts constantly changes on their walls. From photographs to paintings, to hand crafted arts. . . you name it. They sometimes have local music artists that come play their instruments as well (guessing Sundays). I get a breakfast bagel and a soy cap; both are always solid. The reason to come here is the atmosphere. It seems to attract a minimal amount of hipsters and its a nice quiet place to grab a cup and read/study. I have met a few random people here and they have all been really cool down to earth. Definitely a cool spot to go to. I like the atmosphere and plentiful seating and even a nice parklet outside. I came in here with a friend to redeem the yelp deal. The place was pretty dead. The lady didn't come out of her office until a few minutes after we arrived. I got a veggie bagel and an egg bagel. $ each. I liked the atmosphere of the place. The egg bagel had a big slice of egg in the middle, cheese, and I forgot the rest. Lol. It was good but didn't like the onions on it. I liked that the veggie bagel had cream cheese on it but didn't like the cucumber and onions. I would probably get the egg bagel if I were to come again but the veggie bagel did smell really good. .  stars: Crap I checked in after I paid so I wasn't able to purchase the yelp discount. This cafe is near my friend's house and I had to get some work done. Free Wifi with a purchase ok! Got a Bagel with cucumber and cream cheese and a white chocolate mocha. mocha was eh, too sweet and not enough espresso flavor. The bagel was tasty. The place I liked, lots of light, relaxing and nice service. I would go back. I like this place.  Nice people.  Good coffee.  And a parklet out front. Super friendly staff, tasty bagels and coffee, cheerful and bright physical space. Had some trouble with the wifi, but mine may not be a representative experience in that regard. I love going to Mama's on the weekends real early in the morning and getting a medium organic coffee that has the best aroma and tantalizing taste.  The blend of beans is amazing and the coffee has a unique delicious taste.  They are very consistent and believe it or not, Mama's is a real treat to have in the Outer Mission! Went here while I was waiting for my Car to be serviced. It was a nice place. Got an iced soy vanilla latte and egg bagel no onions. The service was very friendly and the bathroom was very clean Whenever I get breakfast here, I get a bagel. I've tried the veggie bagel and egg bagel which are each $ flat. I do prefer the veggie bagel because there is avocado, but both works for me. I've tried their hot caramel machiatto and it was good. It wasn't super amazing but it was good. It was $ something. I did not have to add anything to the drink. it was good when I got it. I plan to try more of their drinks. Their food menu is pretty small and you will not be able to get a bagel if you come at PM because they stored everything away."
Mission’s Kitchen|3.5|Diners in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|88|-1|3.91891891892|" Love this diner! Delicious food, generous portions, AMAZING service, reasonable prices what's not to love?!? It's not ""hip"" and since it's a part of pre gentrified Mission, I hope it manages to stick around. Gotta try the chilaquiles, maduros, breakfast burrito, and omelette! Carlos is a wonderful host and the ambiance on the morning I went was ladies selling flowers and a mariachi band. Will be back! Great staff, good food. I usually do breakfast at least  times a month here. Food can get greasy though depending what you order. But overall the service is quick, the cooks hustle. I do miss the  guys that used to cook Sunday mornings, but the new cooks are ok. Oh and the  beautiful and very friendly waitress's that ""USED"" to serve there. So guys no need to be running there now, them  women are gone!  lol We attempted to eat here today and a very nice waitress took our order and drinks and did mention that it would take a little while for the food. After about  mins and our sons saying they were hungry about  times we decided to see what was going on. Meanwhile the two ladies that came in after us had their food and somehow ours was still two tickets away from being cooked. We decided to go elsewhere since most places can serve up an omelette in about . We will not be going back which is too bad because the food is good. We got our drinks for free at least. I try to not leave a bad review . But some how  things came together. Coffee is great . Servers they try the best. But in bussiness specially ,food industry they are way back. . . cooks have no pasion for food. something really simple they make to complicated. Specially in  breakfast with over cook sausage almost chicharrones . Red new potatoes huge size, blend flavor. Where is the eggs disappear in the mix onions are same crunchy other to caramelized. Bell pepers where cut by knife with out been sharp. no matter if the place has no speciallity in burritos. they have to learn how managment a breakfast some many info out there to prepare a breakfast burrito, Even and starving person goin to relized isn't and spetcular breakfast burrito. I have been going to Mission Kitchen since they opened ,  my family have been  loyal customers here ,  and havent had a problem until this past wekend . Went to have breakfest with my husband on a sunday morning , and of course we decided to go eat at Mission Kitchen , we talked about goinng to other places , but my husband loves their Plato Central Americano so much that we ended up at  Mission Kitchen . We get there and we are greated as usual , and a table was cleaned for us in less then  Min , waiter takes our order and brings us Coffee and Hot chocolate , couple min later our food is ready and placed on the table . As we our eating close to finish my husband noticed a hair in his rice , so as anyone else would do , my husband lets the waiter know and shows it to him , the hair strand was thick and black , who knows if there was more in the rice . So as regular people we didnt make a scene and we didnt make a big issue about it , so the waiter says "" we will make you another plate "" , so we where ok with that , we waited less then   min and he arrives with the second plate , then he proceds and ask my hysband if he would like toast  , and he said yes , white pls . . . . as we seen the menue many times and since we order the samething everytime we go there , we know preatty much the price and what our order comes with , my husband couldnt finish his plate , and i was preatty muh done with my plate we where just about ready to pay and be on our way , well as we are waiting pateintly , husband ask for coffee , and for some odd reason the waiter is tottaly ignoring us and from this point , it just looks like we where not cared for anymore , he ask another waitress that was at the cash register doing nothing for coffee and all she does is calls the next waiter to serve us , and he never came as well , so my husband and i decide to get up and pay to and be on our way , well it took them  minutes to notice that we where leaving and the waiter quickly gets the bill ready , AS AM REVIEWING THE BILL I NOTICE AN EXTRA CHARGE , i tell him that , that was not on our order , then he gets a lil red and says to me that he charged .  for extra toast , then i said well the bill doesnt say ""toast"" and when did we order extra toast ? , he told me that since he had to make another plate , he had to charge for extra toast , but keep in  mind there was a hair in the plate , and the plate comes with toast , so i left it alone and piad the bill, well my husband wasnt to happy , and goes back in and lets him know that the plato centro americano comes with toast and why would he charge extra ? ,  well he says , since we didnt charge for the second plate , he charged for the extra toast ! What ! you still have the nerve to say "" we didnt charge for the second plate "" when there was a hair in the food , you have to be kinding me , i think if he would of never try to charge for extra toast i would of left ok , but after finding a hair and being ignored after the fact , yeah i think anyone would also be upset I've been here twice now. . . And the food and the portion sizes are great.  The price is also easy to manage,  imo you pay about the same price for a combo meal at McDonald's that you would here.  But the service,  frustrating.  I usually base my service on my water. . . If it's empty and I gotta ask. . . .  You've been ignoring me. . . .  I had to ask here and didn't get it refilled until After I was done eating.  Not sure I'll come back again,  even with the delicious food they have.  If you go. . . . Expect tasty food but slow, unattenetive service. Coffee and Huevos con Chorizo, $.  after tax.  Good serving size, and pure deliciousness.  It came with rice and beans, and a tortilla (I chose flour).  The coffee was alright, but the chorizo was pretty good.  Not very greasy like I'm used to, but great quality. Being a '"" giant that I am, I normally have to find a local farm to eat some of their livestock in order to feel full. Not here though, I left feeling fat and happy, ready for the days adventure.  The service was great and they kicked on some jams at : a. m.  I guess before that everyone is waking up and doesn't want to hear music.  : hits, bam Michael Jackson in your face, start your day mo'fo!I will be eating here again. so this place is legit, my friend took me to this place and it was supper authentic hood breakfast. the price was great, the food was very homemade and fresh. if your around this place please go and support this local business Love the food here. Will be coming back. The food was alright. Nothing to drool over. The waiter had some complications and didn't really help until the end of the meal. Wish the service could've been a little better. Though I wouldn't let this discourage me but I don't think I'll be coming any time soon Mmm. . . the breakfast nachos are ""CRACKING"" as my boyfriend would say. CHAILAQUILES is what I think they are called. BOMB. COM. Came here for a quick bite before we started our day. The service is super friendly and the food is great. I not an expert on Mexican food but this definitely tasted authentic. If you're in the Mission and looking for some grub, I would highly recommend this spot. Fantastico! It's all good. Their breakfasts are pretty lunchy too. Note to self:  ""Chilaquiles and steak. Mild! Not Spicy. ""Love this place. Huge breakfast.

I am a regular.  I love my amigo Chefs that always prep me a wonderful meal.  It is an old school diner.  I ordered many dishes from their burgers, breakfast burritos, Latin dishes  they never failed me.  Every dish I ever had gave me a #mouthGASM I def would recommend this place to anyone who loves to eat at diner type places & would enjoy a meal for a good price. I have passed by this place several times before on Tuesdays before I go to Dance Mission to take hip hop dance classes. Last Tuesday after work I came here to eat for dinner. As you go inside the decor reminds of you diners in the s and s. I didn't want to have a heavy meal. I ordered two items: Queso Fresco and Mission Omelet. The first item is fried cheese similar to fried mozzarella sticks. It was sort of salty maybe because the cheese itself was salty. The second item omelet consisted of chorizo, mushrooms, and ground beef. What I liked about this omelet was it wasn't heavy as other omelets I've had in the past. Nothing spectacular about my meal but overall I had a fulfilling dinner. On our stay in San Francisco this place was across the street from the place we were staying at. The service is extremely friendly and great. My crepe was amazing and yummy and def a great price and my fiancés Denver omelette was meaty w/ great filling home fries!   If you're in this area it's a def must come! One star for the steak sandwich I had a few months ago, and another one for the the chilaquile sauce that was actually spicy. It's a decent place to eat at, but maybe it's because I've always had the same server. I've enjoyed what I've eaten here before, but today there was an issue with the service. From the outside it is nothing special but once you enter you are greeted by the warm and friendly staff. We sat at the counter for breakfast around am and there were only a few other patrons around. The server recommended I order the chilaquiles for breakfast and I am so glad I did. They are delish but fair warning: it is a heavy dish so definitely wear your stretchy pants and maybe take a spin class beforehand to offset some of the guilt :) A lady that works there, be careful because she over charges. It's a good place to eat and um the prices are reasonable. Just watch out for your bill! I've walked by this place a thousand times and never took note of it. Well, I should have. The prices are great. The service is great and extremely friendly. And I loved the chilequiles! I became a fan of that dish while vacationing in Puerto Vallarta and I was overjoyed to find a local restaurant that faithfully prepares it. It's a diner, so it don't expect fancy decor. The lines are too long & it's hard to find parking but the chilaquiles of mole poblano are delicious. The woman waitress Lolis or Lolita has no respect, she likes to caress mens face & play with their hair if she knows them & doesn't matter if their couple is sitting their. This place is a great spot to have brunch with friends/family. The service is excellent. They're friendly and chipper, of course a bit slow when it's busy. The owner[manager?] is really friendly, he even gave us some quarters to put in the jukebox one time. The food is good as well. I really like the tiramisu that they serve. The omelets and scrambled eggs are on point. Might I suggest the home fries? Those are so yummy! First of all parking is hard to fine. Mission's Kitchen is a great place to eat breakfast and lunch. The pancakes, burgers, and omelettes are well made, has Mexican breakfast as well. Not to pricey, service is good and friendly. When the place gets packed watch out because the waiter might forget about you. Overall food is fantastic love this place but they lost there touch and the service/waiters sucks now of days. . . . . With My Friends Enjoying Good Food. . . . Back AgainCheeseBurger Time. . . . Good Place To Have Breakfast With Friends/Family. . . . Good Food. . . . My friend had mention to me this place for breakfast/lunch. She once brought me Chilaquiles for breakfast to work and they were soo good. I had to go and get some more. I have there chilaquiles and also there club sandwich. Friendly staff, good food and cheap :) You can call in your order before going to have it ready to eat when arriving This place is tip top. To me it is one of San Francisco's top spots. Portions are good, large and excellent quality. Bilingual staff and the food is prepared right in front of you. Went here b/c Pollo Campero had a line around the block. The waiter was so nice. Very homestyle food. Big portions. My salmon was tasty.  Sat at the counter like the old days. Great lunkfast spot.  Half Mexican restaurant, half greasy spoon diner.  Best Chilaquiles in town! #Boom.  Great greasy spoon. Want St Francis quality without the handlebar mustache or the goat cheese scramble? Come on over, spend / less and leave happy. I'd be here daily if my health wouldn't suffer as much as it surely would. Do it. Huge portions. Great prices. Great food. What's not to love? its a decent place i like the sandwiches and the chilaquiles i would always go with a friend and we used to have a really good time i would recommend this for breakfast/brunch and lunch good, clean , really friendly service, great for mexican and american breakfast at very affordable price.  great hash browns crispy, not soggy. Great local diner with a great staff. The portions are big and the prices are very affordable. I love coming here and ordering the mole chilaquiles, they are delicious. Am I the kind of girl that will swoon and fall in love with the first diner that brings me a pitcher of sweetened condensed milk?  Yes I am.  They brought us an entire pitcher of sweetened condensed milk.  OMG.  I did not know you could put it in a pitcher.  Yes, I think I am in love.  This place is super cool, you walk in and you are greeted by a painting of a chihuahua (Chico! Chico! Chico!) and a warm hearty welcome.  The staff are all super nice and the food comes promptly. We had juevos rancheros and french toast  you get a pitcher or syrup and a pitcher of condensed milk for your french toast (and for pancakes too).  The food was good and plentiful, filling up the giant plates it is served on.  The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is relaxed, no wonder they attract a diverse crowd.  Love it! The servers here are so friendly and have great attitudes. The food is always really good, with really generous portions.  I've tried so many things and loved them all. The Mexican omelet is like a burrito inside egg instead of tortilla the beans are really good. The frittata is always super bomb. Sweet things like waffles, pancakes and french toast are great they come with mounds of fruit on top and either syrup or yummy Lechera. I have no complaints about this place at all.  Oh and somebody said they use RC cola I beg to differ, it's Coca Cola. Come here for cheap in price, good in quality food, a fun atmosphere, wonderful service. Understanding that this is a very casual diner, how is it possible to hate on this place? You've got comfortable seating, a very friendly staff, great food portions and extremely reasonable prices. A breakfast here will run you approx. $ and you will be well fed. It's also kind of cool how the indigenous Mexican population seamlessly eats side by side with the dot com crowd. You'll definitely want to get to know Mario (among the rest of the wait staff); he's awesome. This is not a place where you would expect farm fresh or organic fare. But if you're looking for a fun, casual, inviting atmosphere with generous portions at reasonable prices, then look no further than Mission's Kitchen. And you can trust me on this one; I'm an Elite. ;) This was seriously awful.  I am a huge fan of mexican diners, obsessed with Red Cafe, and figured I'd branch out and try another spot. . . . . The reviews couldn't be more wrong.  My central american breakfast cost $, had inedible bacon (how is that possible!), the gallo pinto was so dry and overcooked it tasted like sawdust, and the cheese was a rubbery rock of fried nastiness.  They even got the plantains wrong  deep fried, so missing all of the essential delicious gooey goodness.  They even got the soda wrong  its not cool to try and pass of RC cola as diet coke  you can clearly taste the difference. I will not be going back, and I recommend that you don't waste your money as well.  I am sorry write such a negative review because they are nice. . . but the food was disgusting, and in the mission there are so many more delicious options. I'm giving these guys  stars because they're everything a breakfast place should be. This is not because the food is going to blow you away.  That said, I got a bomb waffle with fruit, eggs, and bacon, and it was all greco.  I always feel comfortable here, and I think that's the most important thing in a breakfast place.  The waitstaff are just on top of their shit!No line, plenty of seating, great prices, and prompt service.  Please go."
The Store On the Corner|3.5|Korean in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|111|-1|3.94117647059|" So far tried the spicy pork and the bulgogi. Not  star good but still pretty good for the portion size, price and wait. Less than  min wait, pretty quick. A few businesses can boast that their name implies what they truly are. Well, surprise surprise, The Store on the Corner is quite literally, a store on the corner of New Montgomery and Minna  a deli style grocery hole in the wall that has a tiny kitchen churning out Korean food at a blazingly fast pace. The food is cheap, the quantity is more than sufficient and (hence?) the taste is alright, nothing to die for. I got the vegetarian bibimbap which is basically a rice bowl with a bunch of pickled and flavored vegetables. I'm not a big fan of Korean food flavors, so I didn't enjoy it much, but if you like your Kimchi and you're hungry but have to rush to that meeting in half an hour, I think you might like this place. I tried the bulgogi beef and it tasted soy saucy. The food was ok overall. The only reasons I might go again:. close to my workplace. cheap price. fast For limited Korean options in SOMA, this spot is pretty tasty.  They just started doing Korean beef tacos too and they were pretty damned good.  I had  tacos and  kimbop.  If i were feeling like a pig I might've gone for  but I'm trying to control myself these days. :) For $ you can get soondubu with rice, a small side salad and some kimchi. I would say that's not bad at all considering I can't seem to find any other soondubu place within walking distance in this area. There's constantly a few people in line during lunch but they get you in and out pretty quick. Been meaning to try this place out for the longest time and finally stopped by today. Soondubu is decently spicy and the meal is very cheap for what you get and if you consider the area you're in. One thing though is the kimchi kind of sucks :/ But I will be back for the soondubu. I work right across the street from Store On the Corner, and I've made it my go to spot for that late night dinner. I'd love to write a flowering review about the quality of the kimchi or the flavors of the spice beef, but they just do a really solid $.  bibimbap. Beef is a better pick than pork, but chicken is probably my favorite. They run out of it earlier in the day, so don't get stressed if they don't have any left. I'd probably suggest against the egg (at least late at night), because its been in the steamer all day and can be a bit gamy. I've gone for lunch in the past, and that is very much the time to get the egg. For a dollar, it's a good deal and they cook it so the yolk is just a bit runny. Great for take away, plus you can buy a beer to go if you want. This place reminded me of my mom's food back home, so delicious! I went here on a whim with a co worker looking for a place with some Bi Bim Bap and I was not disappointed at all; it was fresh and delicious with just the right amount of portions. I'll definitely be coming back here soon to try out more of the menu. Aside from the very literal name, this place has some great things to offer. It's fast and the line is short, which is tough around lunchtime in this area. They basically have all the ingredients already made and ""assemble"" your bibimbap or rice bowl when you order. Think fast food, Korean style. And they accept credit card, which is also strangely tough in this area. It's pretty good, but not the greatest Korean food you'll have. It's definitely not bad for the price and convenience. And if you order the bibimbap you can at least pretend you're getting a healthy intake of vegetables, which is always a plus. Get an egg on top for an extra $, because egg makes everything better. And your bibimbap will be even more colorful. good prices, real quick, nice portions. good red sauce. Plate of bulgogi sure why not, salad and kim chee also come with the plate in a clear to go platter. filling yes, flavor wise just ok, had several bowls of bulgogi at other places this one out of all was barely passing in flavor, meat was tender, beef was slightly overdone for my taste, portion was good, meat was stringythe salad was washed mixed greens dipped in a slight vinegary type dressing, the kim chee standard potent on the bar of   probably  not super potent again standardthey do offer different items on the menu if not several drinks, and snacks even smokes if your looking for something quick try this spot if your looking for something that will wow you sadly this is not the placefood *service *price $ambiance ** bar type seat for maybe  people, pretty much order and go The Korean food here is great. Great value, portion size and flavor. But the th star is for the genius of the Korean need tacos  wow. Yes, they are .  each, and  breaks my $ lunch by .   but the belly filling and fun quality eating it  not to mention the amazing taste, is very worthwhile. I love their bulgogi, and japchae, bibimbap and spicy pork. Really a great loaded dish. Most meals are under $! Big portions, decent price. The Japchaebap hits the spot. A little bit of beef, hella rice, and a heap of japchae. Which is sometimes all you really want, damnit. SOMA why you gotta be like this? Anyways, I'm glad we have the store on the corner. If you blink, you'll miss it. Coworker got the spicy pork  that was an insane pile of meat. I always like supporting the family owned business. Alas, I only discovered this after I knew I was leaving the area. Tofu soup. Tofu Soup. Tofu effing soup. And everything else. . . Veg & Meat friendly. Family run, so great. Just go. Been coming here for years so its about damn time I write a review for this overlooked gem. In a sea of overpriced and mediocre food downtown this place stands out as cheap and good. Love the spicy pork & bi bim bap; they always hit the spot. Just thinking about them is making me hungry, time for a lunch visit!Family owned/run very cute older Korean couple and their son (who is a nice guy). I spotted a lunch line within an unassuming convenience shop while walking down the street. Strangely enough there's a little lunch to go spot selling mom and pop Korean food. I had the beef bibimbap. It doesn't come with an egg or the crispy rice since it's served within a plastic container. But the flavors are good old Korean. They are a little stingy with the beef. The chili paste is tasty awesomeness. I recommend only if you're craving quick to go Korean during lunchtime. The invigorating flavors of the bibimbap saved me. Wow, has it been  years since I yelped this place?  This is my go to place whenever I'm near that area.  This place is reasonable ($ for a made to order to go box) and the food hits my hungry insides wanting kimchi and spice.  I bring it back to the office and everyone is jealous how yummy it looks.  The family is nice and the price is too.  If I was a poet, that would have been a good rhyme.  This is quite a balance meal with half veggies (salad & Kimchi) and smidgen of meat and rice.  Fast and hardly a wait.  They have remodeled and the kitchen is doubled the size.  There is a tiny counter place for one person to scarf down and eat.  I wish there was a nice park nearby to enjoy my meal.  They really keep it ""corner store"" with all your junk food you need, from Hawaiian potato chips, candies, and sodas. I'm always here for some quick korean food. The bulgogi and spicy pork options are tasty. The jap chae bap is also a decent alternative. The food won't blow your mind, but it's quick and decent. Reasonably priced lunch/dinner for SOMA that's just the right amount. The store owner and family are nice people to talk to. When you first walk in, it looks like your average convenient store, but in the back the family that owns it is cooking some really awesome Korean food. Prices are reasonable around $, and you'll be in and out within  mins. Store on the corner is the very definition of 'hidden gem'. It's one of my go to's around the office for lunch, lately I find it very difficult to last more than  days without getting a strong craving for the Spicy Pork. It's a lot less spicy than what I like, but that's where the Sriracha comes in handy. Tried this today and it was good. I had the bibimbap veggie style for  dollars.  There are very few Korean alternatives in the financial district area so if you're craving some Korean food (and don't want to feel like you got robbed  like at some Korean places within a mile of this place) definitely a place to checkout. Just to be clear the three rating is to say that this place is good and worth a checkout. Stumbled on this place at lunch today. Ordered bulgogi. Meat is mealy. Looks and tastes cheap. Came with rice (fine), salad (meh) and kim chi (good). I love Korean food, and there's certainly not enough of it near my office, but this barely scrapes the bottom edge of acceptable. EDIT: I'm intrigued by all the positive reviews here, so I'll just step back far enough to say that I came once, tried one thing, was underwhelmed. Maybe I was there on the wrong day or ordered the wrong thing. Anyway, there ya go. This place used to be a convenience store with a small counter in the back where the owners (?) made homemade Korean food with a bunch of rice cookers.  That concept is about the best thing ever!  Recently, they expanded the lunch area and minimized the convenience store aspect, so selling food must have been way more successful.  It makes sense, because their food is damned good!The soondubu (Korean tofu stew) is tasty and filling, and is a great choice.  The japchae is good too.  The only knock on it is that if you order the vegetarian version, all you get is a massive tray of japchae.  It would be nice to get a bit more veggies and less noodle.  That said, this is definitely one of the best workday lunch spots in the area.  Best of all, there's almost never any line. Arbitrary rankings:Shrimp with the head still on:   /  Cheap, fast, and delicious. This is a great place to grab lunch if you work in the area. It used to be a convenient store that happend to serve food out of the back, but they recently remodeled to be primarily a take out place that happens to have some convenient store items up front. Don't let the fact that they serve everything straight out of a rice cooker deter you, the food is great. Most people seem to go for the bibimbap, but I think the bulgogi is the best thing on the menu. I am Korean! And this place rocks. Cheap and delicious, friendly and quick. I've tried the spicy pork, beef bulgogi, and kimbab. All were good. Especially the spicy pork. They give you a thing of salad and kimchi, and the spicy pork is poured on top of the rice. I sometimes fantasize about what I'll get for lunch the next day, and I think about the pork dish often  it's that good. So easy. So authentic. Mostly everything runs out after p so get in there before then to have your fair share of the pick. Yeah, I had two Korean tacos at lunch, and a soda. Very tasty / good variation from the norm (hadn't had it before). I want to go back to try the bibimbap, but then, I kind of want to try the taco again. Oh and, very nice couple running the business, and pretty cheap for lunch. Boom. This is an excellent spot for a quick, tasty, and cheap lunch. The BiBimBap seems even halfway healthy, due to the lovely veggies. The store is rather odd and not much to look at, but give the food a try! Love supporting mom and pop businesses where I can. You would miss this store if you didn't know where to look. It's literally on the corner of New Montgomery and Natoma. I had the bi bim bap. It was good. My co worker got the spicy pork and scarfed the whole thing. For $, I'm stuffed! The Store on the Corner was recommended by a friend for Korean take out. The Tofu stew (with a piece of shrimp) was delicious. It was filling but not heavy and had the right amount of spice. I am taking the fried Pork dish to my boyfriend for dinner tonight. The staff was friendly and attentive, and I arrived by :AM so no line. A nice change from the Ferry Building and Embarcadero restaurants, I plan to return. Lunch was tasty today! Spicy pork came with a helping of kimchee, and a side of salad greens. Very tasty and an excellent value! A family run tiny gem in Soma / financial district. The bi bim bap is awesomely delicious!! Totally nondescript storefront that looks like a Spanish Harlem bodega. . .  But ran by a Korean family with a few rice cookers and some meats.  Solid japchae and bibimbap.  Not life changing, but a nice, simple, quick lunch option in the hood.  Not bad at all. You are forgiven for not noticing the Store on the Corner. After all the area is full of many stores and even more corners  they all tend to blend together after a while. But this store is worth your time. Walk inside and note the convenient ATM, cozy register, racks of drinks and  the kicker  a kitchen in the back serving fast and cheap Korean food. I love coming here for the bibimbap. I'm sure it's not the finest Korean in town, but it's quick and in SoMa for lunch. Staff is friendly and you will only thrown down $ instead of god know what for the fancy sandwich next door. Cash only, if that's a deal breaker for you. I'm getting married to a Korean guy in a couple months and since he cooks up a storm, I typically don't feel compelled to spend money on it elsewhere  but for those work days where I have the craving and no leftovers, Store on the Corner fills the void (aka my stomach) just fine. I always get the bi bim bap (veggies and beef over rice) and while I'm a fat kid at heart that wishes they'd put more meat than veggies, it really is the perfect amount and balance of flavors. Today just for the hell of it I decided to try their Korean taco since that kind of food is all over the place. It wasn't bad but if you prefer a thicker tortilla like I do, you might find yourself needing a fork. Service is always friendly and prices are reasonable. I prefer going here over HRD because at least here I don't think I've ever had to wait longer than  minutes for my food. No frill, cheap korean food to go. If you are craving old school bibimbap or chap chae, then this is perfect. The food is not amazing, but it hits the spot. Now I'll be the first to admit that I've never been to Korea. Not even once (I know, right? Embarrassing. ). In short, I wouldn't know authentic Korean food if it walked up and slapped in the mouth while screaming ""ME! I'M AUTHENTIC KOREAN FOOD!"" I'd probably chalk it up to some intense marketing and move on. But what I do know is deliciousness, and the delicate balance we consumers must play between it and its evil slash unwelcome but wholly necessary twin, frugality. And The Store On the Corner definitely comes close to maximizing that function (can I get a ""derivative"" from the math fans out there? A double edged cheer!). Let's talk about the place. It's actually on a street corner, so bonus for naming honesty, I guess. For the most part, it's a convenience store  and a fairly small one  selling your standard convenience store things. Other reviewers, I'm sure, have dissected their convenience and their offerings. But you're here because you want to know about the food. That's definitely why I was there. In a word, adorable. The food counter is found in the back of the convenience store, run by what appears to be a mom and pop duo (though mom seemed to be doing most of the work [ain't that always the way, moms?])  The pop is super polite and the mom is super efficient; together, they are a voltron of effective service. For around $ (after tax!) you can get a quite good tasting, home made Korean lunch. The line is either non existent or extremely short, so your time investment is also pretty small (unlike a certain other Korean BBQ place *cough*HRD*cough*). In short, if you're nearby and hungerin', The Store On the Corner is worth a shot. Protip: if you want the spicy pork, get there early. Its a good place for a quick meal. For $, you will get a lot of food without having to stand in line which is otherwise the general case around here. It might feel wrong getting food from a convenience store, but don't let that stop you. It might also feel weird that they serve rice directly from the rice cooker, but what difference does that make? I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked into this convenience store. What I found was a pleasant surprise. Try the BiBimBap! I'm only reviewing the food counter in the back of the store. The Spicy Pork tasted like Korean BBQ pork in spicy marinara sauce. Not what I was expecting. I don't know if I was charged more for some reason judging from the other reviews, but this place is not cheap esp. if you are ordering vegetarian. My vegetarian bibimbap was $ they didn't have egg so it was literally veggies and a ton of rice. I'll be going to Bibimbar for my Korean fix! .  for bibimbop which was ok.  There wasnt an egg option for the dis. I ate it outside Yerba buena gardens on rd Ave. Then I went to the local museums.  You've got to ask for kimchee. Excellent Korean food!  I love the bi bim bap. It's affordable and the owners are AMAZINGLY sweet.  They accommodate my being gluten free and are always open about what has soy sauce in it.  I love coming here and will continue to do so as long as i work in SOMA. More than a store. Traditional corner store: Groceries. Household items. Drinks. Cigarettes. Lottery. This corner store: All the above plus Korean food. In the back is where you'll find what seems to be a mom and pop serving homemade bulgogi. Scoop of rice. Scoop of meat. Some sides. Done. Shocked in the best way possible the chicken seemed to be all white meat. Not so shocked I finished what could have been two meals in one. Really good. Meal costs about $ with tax. You can spend your coin the traditional corner store way or the Korean corner store way. In my opinion the choice has never been easier. Giving  stars because of the few options for lunchtime korean downtown, this is the best AND the cheapest! A handful of menu items on the korean side. . . soft tofu stew is homemade authenticity. Better than my mama's. Small store, fresh food at the back, a small line of folks waiting, many speaking korean  which made me feel like trying this place was a good choice.  And it was.  Bibimbap is very good; yes you can get better at various korean restaurants, none of which are in the FiDi.  But in the FiDi  nice veggies, a good chuck of seawood for that salty flavor, decent meat and a nice portion for $.  I haven't tried the soft tofu stew, but I will be back for it. And the older couple, dishing up the food in back, were very nice and clearly a little perplexed to see  people in line.  Apparently, that is a massive crowd for lunch.  Which is super cool. LOVE the Tofu Stew. You must come before pm. They sell out quick! I kept thinking. . . this is like a blue collar version of a bulgogi plate. This is the feeling I got when you roll into a convenience store, and order up a plate of bulgogi, along with jap chae, and rice plus a salad. It's a no nonsense meal with a pleasant price. The owners (i think they are the owners) have a spirited personality and laugh easily. Solid .  stars. Stopped by after my friend suggested to eat some Korean food. After all, I have been craving a meal with rice all week, so I decided to give this place a try. For about $.  for bulgogi, I have to say this place is pretty good. Food is quickly prepared and fresh. If you're looking for some Korean food in Financial District, give this place a shot. Getting unpackaged food at a convenience store is a real gamble. On one hand, you could get a cheap, quick and tasty meal. Alternatively, you could get a grey hot dog, a withered taquito and food poisoning. Luckily for me (and you!), TSOtC offers the former. You feel like you're inside the owner's house, getting your food straight from the rice cookers. The spicy pork is my favorite here, but I don't think you could go wrong with any of the menu items. Everything's cheap, and there's rarely a line at lunch (crucial in the area). Thanks to Yelp, I found Korean food in the financial district (SOMA is close enough!)It really is on the corner but easy to walk by the first time. The entrance is right after Lee's. They have a wide selection of beverages, everything else I can't comment on because I made a beeline to the back of the store for tofu stew. Kimchee, salad, plenty of rice, a to go carton of tofu stew and $ later I had an awesome lunch!Great for those chilly SF days! This is a well stocked convenience store with a wide selection of drinks, chips and chocolate bars.  In the back they make Korean food for lunch at excellent prices. The Japchae Bap was delicious, and a lot of food (and beef) for only six bucks.  The Bi Bim Bop was less awesome but still pretty good and well priced.  They were out of the makings for Kim Bap and smoothies but they sell these as well.  Owners are nice. Upping to  stars after trying the soft tofu (seafood) stew today.  De lish and so much food for $.  For takeout in the area this place can't be beat.  Delicious home cooked meals, you're not going to get that from Working Girls.  What a gem! This may look like a convenience store. You can even poke your head inside, and see all of the usual convenience store accoutrements  soda, candy, newspapers, cigarettes. But then, go to the back and you'll find a little counter whence comes delicious korean food. A little bowl of bi him bop, some bulgogi, whatever. There's never a line of more than two or three people, the food is cheap (and has not increased price in at least the last years), and is quite tasty. Especially when slathered in Sriracha, although maybe that's cheating."
Cafe Francisco|3.5|Coffee & Tea in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|165|-1|3.80392156863|" I've lived down the street for a year and the long lines on weekend mornings always deterred me from giving Cafe Francisco a try. This AM we ordered the Mediterranean Frittata & Le Croissant  $. ea. Hearty portions and delicious. Service was friendly.   Star because the gal couldn't tell me what kind of coffee beans they had? Hopefully they'll know next time I come in : ) We were lucky to find this place when we were in San Francisco. They serve fruit to with most of their dishes.  I had a salmon sandwhich with soup and left satisfied.  It's a great place to stop in for lunch. . . What a gem. Free wifi, friendly staff, the freshest ingredients and the best Greek salad I've ever had. Everything was excellent: salads to sandwiches to breakfasts. The Francisco Bagel and California frittata are great breakfast choices. Once upon a time this was a great place. Really good Greek salad, good breakfast bagel, decent sandwiches. Then about a year or two ago the owner seems to have disengaged so it seems mostly unmanaged. Also, the quality of the ingredients has been declining  for example, said Greek salad use to feature chicken breast. Now it's BK style manufactured chix strip meat parts. Gross. We stopped going there, but the tourists seem to keep them going. Such a bummer. I like supporting the smaller, less corporate folks so this is a nice new find. The menu is inviting and the coffee good.  The European tourist that are there all the time must like it too. StarsB's just can't remind them of home I guess. People that work there are friendly and again, the food looks really good as it comes out. I'll try it soon enough. : ) Very nice place, just off the Embarcadero for the ones who just can't stand all the tourists. Really recommended! Nothing special . Had parmesan chicken sandwich and iced tea after a long walk in fishermans warf. The location is the best part of it. It is in a quiet corner of powell street close to pier . It took so long to get our food. The tables were sticky and wet, and the staff was not good at keeping up with the (few) people they had to deal with. We got a bad cafe ole, and when we asked about how long our food was taking they dismissively pointed to the guy who was taking an eternity making it. Will never come back. My significant other and I went to this cafe and received terrible service at the counter. The young man taking our order was obviously not paying any attention, more interested in twirling his pen and dropping it, than writing anything down. He needed to be told the entire order again when he went to the register to enter it. One of our selections was an iced coffee drink, to which he replied that they were out of ice but it was on it's way. We said that was fine and we would wait since we were eating there. We finished our meal, which was mediocre at best, and no iced mocha. We went to the counter and asked and the guy about the iced mocha and he obviously forgot about the drink. I had seen their co worker bring in the ice more than ten minutes earlier and they had already made multiple iced drinks for customers just arriving. Maybe they were just having a bad day, but it was pretty bad. I love this place. I come here quite often. Food is perfect, staff  is great, location is the best! you can work here, check email, read book, relax or just meetwe friend. I dont think this place has anything to complain. There is great food here, very nice employees, and a great location.  I very much enjoyed my bagel and hot chocolate.  Great place to take the grandchildren on a Sunday morning  their reviews are above.  Hadn't been here for a while, still a relaxed, non pretentious locals place with good drink and food, a hidden gem as other reviews say. Bob, Ronan, Lila Great breakfast. Not a huge selection but what they do, they do great. I love the Francisco bagel. Mediterranean frittata is good too and comes with yummy sourdough toast and sliced grapefruit. Perfect breakfast. Great little local place. This place is by far my favorite place to grab a bite or a drink before work. The hidden gem of the area, tucked away from the riffraff of the fisherman's wharf/pier  crowd, they have a great menu of exciting flavors, ranging from savory breakfast frittatas to rich soups and fresh, flavorful salads. Their soups are by far my favorites, they are constantly changing, and are always my go to no matter the weather or time of day (butternut curry, red pepper Gouda bisque, Mediterranean veggie, Thai chicken basil, I'd go on but now I'm drooling). Highly, HIGHLY recommend stopping by anytime for a sandwich and a coffee or a beer, have a sit and enjoy the great location, friendly staff, and, above all, amazing food! Delicious! Good ambiance. Good prices. Cosy and not pretentious. A bit vintage and seem very typical. Love it Food is good, coffee is meh. Seems to have recently raised the prices. Time: :pm/°F partly sunnyPurpose: Came back from south bay earlier and checking out area. Remembering that this used to be a local hangout back in the days. Ambiance: Your standard neighborhood cafe with mostly locals. Weekends seems more popular when others nearby are packed to the limits. Some mismatched tables/chairs place throughout. Kids will find it boring as no coloring books or play area for them. Place is outdated with not much of any modern but if you come for the food and drinks you will overlook it. You will really need to know the staff here or else you'll get the stink eye treatment. Staff: A lady about mid 's not too helpful when ask for specifics. Seems to like doing things at her pace and time. Cleanliness: Grade B , needs some new chairs some are cut and some have unexplained stains. Eats/Drinks: Fresh fruit salad $.  and cappuccino $. . Can't say it's good or bad fruit was house made cantaloupes needs to ripen up a little more. Cappuccino decent but strong, scolded my tongue, ouch. Products/Services: Coffee, capps, lattes, espressos, juice, chips, egg products, vegetarian friendly, sandwiches, soup/salad, fruit bowls/salad, french toast, bagels, waffles, sides, create your own. Punch Lines: North Beach, schools, library, safeway, TJ's, laundromat, salon, bikeshop, Coit tower, hotels, post office, gym, street parking, muni bus, parks, churches, restaurants, Lombard street, art institute. Tradeoffs: A local place that carries most of the upper north area but at about % cheaper than most. Not too touristy mostly locals. Happy hour drinks are price just right. Final Thoughts: It's one of those places you go on a lazy Sunday afternoon with paper in hand nothing much to do but sit and sip. Perfect for me to hide from friends as all of them are in heavy foot traffic area like cafe treist. Service is just lacking for my daily visit leave it for the weekends you'll be just fine. Coffee is blahFood is goodService is pretty bad most of the time : (Ambiance is great though These guys have been back in action for a while! I meant to update sooner, but, hey, I'm a busy guy. Everything from sandwiches, salads and soups are as excellent as ever. I'm so excited! Another lunch stop to rely on, phew. A hidden gem.  Tucked away from all of the hustle and bustle of the Embarcadero and Fisherman's wharf, I would like to consider this my escape.  When I first relocated to SF from the East Coast (Nashville, to be exact), I resided with a friend of a friend in the brewery converted Condominiums that are located next to Cafe Francisco for a couple of months.  I finally found my own apartment and my life in SF began in Lower Russian Hill (near Ghirardhelli);yet, I'll never forget Cafe Francisco.  My first MOCHA and chocolate croissant experience was here.  M. . . delicious. Plus, this place makes really tasty sandwiches (regular and breakfast).  A couple of years ago I brought my then boyfriend to Cafe Francisco during an urban hike we sat outdoors, drank a beer and we had a discussion about love, college days, and beer. Aw.  Alex, if you ever read this, I still think fondly of that day spent with you. To all single ladies out there, I hope that you build moments like these throughout the city.  SF is made for love!    H. Perfectly simple. No bells and whistles, but you won't be disappointed by the quality or price of anything you get. Great neighborhood and people watching. When you work in the Fisherman's Wharf area it can be hard to find good food at the right price. Love their caprese salad. A local lunchtime favorite among Williams Sonoma employees. Get there before noon. Grab a seat by the window. Great natural light. i love this super neighborhood joint. and i can't believe the FRITATTAs are not mentioned more often. it's SO good. i always think about coming back and getting it. they can be a little slow but its not horrible. this place is great to catch up with friends or to do some work or study. So, I'm probably more like a  star versus a  star.  I love the falafel sandwich and everything is good. I wouldn't say it's great, but overall good. If you live in the area, it's a perfect place to stop before or after grocery shopping. I like Café Capriccio better for hanging out and getting coffee but they don't have a lot of food options. Café Francisco has a lot of food options. I haven't tried enough on the menu to give it a  star, but I'm willing to keep going. It's also nice to sit outside on a nice day. (It's always hard finding places to sit outside with your dog). The service here is unbearably slow. I've been here twice when it wasn't busy and waited almost thirty min for a breakfast sandwich. Definitely not worth the wait. Solid coffee. Simple, good quality cafe food. Straightforward, no nonsense service. IThe casual, unpretentious vibe is awesome. It's perfect for grabbing food on your own while doing some work, or bringing a book or newspaper. If you bring a friend, the menu is varied enough to suit most people (there's salads, sandwiches, egg frittatas etc. ) To the reviewer below who seemed perturbed about them no longer serving breakfast, you don't seem to get it. The service here is just straightforward and simple. There's no ""hidden message"" in the lady telling you they stopped serving breakfast at . I have no problems with this place. Drinks are cheap and pretty strong, and the layout is nice, especially with all the outdoor seating (and on both sides of the outdoor area in front of the cafe). They also do happy hour every day of the week. That is no laughing matter, folks. Pastries and coffee are good, and neithe will break the bank. You can spend a whole day just people watching in this cafe. Love it. Order the San Fran! Grilled chicken, bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato and mayo/Dijon mustard on sourdough. . . absolutely delicious! I love they're Margarita pita sandwich and the coffee cake BUT they really take their time preparing their food which is great and all but when the line is out the door they should really make an effort to not make you wait mins for a Togo order. It's frustrating. It's a Wednesday and its dead here and i've still waited over mins. This is the one thing that would make me stop coming here. . . . Great spot for lunch! We just happened upon it, and we were very happy with our meals! I got the parmesan chicken sandwich, and highly recommend it! i come here when i dont know where else to eat, probably like once a week. . . lots of bad things  i dont like the coffee they use, im always ""too late"" for french toast but they still offer me waffles (which are not good btw). why can you make waffles but not french toast? they charged to pour an americano on ice which is pretty dumb, the girl who i think is the manager has an attitude problem and most of the time is pretty rude even after tipping. seriously not that hard to smile or wait to roll your eyes until i turn around. they also have a fruit fly problem. good things  its cheap! the garden vegetarian sandwich is good. not good enough to make all the bad stuff better. after my last visit i realized im never eating there again. I come here for lunch a few times a month and my favorite thing to get is a half sandwich half salad combo. You can pick from ANY sandwich on the menu which most places won't let you do and it comes with a side salad with greens, tomatos, cucumber, peppers and dressing. All for $ $, great deal!During the week they get pretty busy around lunch time so come early or after lunch. Overall a nice little gem in the neighborhood. Nice little find on a Sunday morning.  Great food, nicely presented. Seems to have a local following.   Service is a bit on the slow side. . . But not an issue on a sunny Sunday Absolute breakfast bliss with a bevy of Bay charm. This cafe rivals any you might come across in the West Village in NYC,  but without the inflated prices and inevitable pretension. I ordered a simple bagel sandwich, and was pleasantly surprised at how it was nearly indistinguishable from my fond memories of consuming bagels on Sundays in Florida and New York. The eggs were scrambled perfectly, fluffy and plentiful. Cafe Francisco is just one of many reasons why I keep coming back to SF. Not much to say.  Very generic bagels and coffee that was pretty mediocre.  I'm sure it is better than the touristy places on the docks, but we were not very impressed with the Cafe. Great prices and tasty food. Super convenient for calling in a lunch order for pick up. The only thing that would make it better  stop over frying the falafel on the Mediterranean plate. This place is a great little gem in the tourist infested area near Pier . I am a student at a school in the area, and this is one of the few places around there that I can go for good food and good coffee, away from the pier. The food is really pretty good I usually get the mediterranean plate but I've also had the veggie sandwich and the spinach salad with bacon. All good. And the coffee is really excellent never needs sugar. Decent place for breakfast or lunch.  Not sure where they get their bread from, but it's really good.  Sandwiches and soups are the best option here.  I've tried the salads, but haven't found one I actually like.  Fritatas are good also; they take a bit longer to make, so don't order one if you're in a rush.  Lattes are OK. I live pretty much above this place, so frequent it quite often for coffee and quick bites. They have a great selection of pastries, bagels and other breakfast items. They also have beer and wine and make some great sandwiches and salads. They tend to get pretty busy, so expect to wait a while for anything hot. I wouldn't get the fruit dish though  both times I have it's been out of season and off. Great for grab and go, but with so many other places in the area it's hard to recommend lunch/dinner items here. We had breakfast a couple of times here and enjoyed all of it.  The yummy mochas, tasty breakfast sandwiches, and a nice SF atmosphere. It's fairly close to Fisherman's Wharf, but seems far away for crowds and noise. Awesome, quiet cafe with super nice people, great sandwiches and menu. love this place. great prices too. This place hit the spot on a sunday morning  great frittadas (egg scrambles with great fresh ingredients) and quality coffee.  One thing I would advise someone doing breakfast here to do is to ask for the frittada to be cooked a minute less  mine would have been a little better had it been taken out of the oven a moment earlier. . great nonetheless!!I was very pleased with the salmon frittada and will definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting SF. Quaint place out of the main tourist hustle down the road. Note you order at counter, no table service (no one will tell you) . Good little spot for breakfast. Just go there for coffee. The food is actually good but their service is straight awful sometimes. If you're super hungry, go to Moe's. Now that Jamie W. and I strap on our Fitbits on weekends, we like to stroll from SoMa to Fisherman's Wharf and back just to see how many thousands of steps we can put on them. For some reason, Jamie always has more steps on his Fitbit which seems cruel and unfair since I walk as much as he does, probably even more because I'm way shorter. When I'm not busy being bitter, we find places new at least to us to park our keesters for a spell. On the way back on Powell, we stopped here since it just seemed inviting before going up that treacherous incline to Washington Square Park. OK, it's not that treacherous. It's not even that much of a hill. We just wanted a Diet Coke and maybe something to snack on before counting our steps again. There's quite a selection of salads and sandwiches served here. Also a lot of tables occupied by people working on their MacBook Airs (or is it MacBooks Air?). We were able to snag a booth and split the $.  Greek Salad, which turned out to be quite a treat with fresh hummus and dolmas added for good measure. There were lots of other fresh ingredients  garbanzo beans, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, olives, cucumber slices, tomato wedges, red onion, basil leaves, and feta cheese of course (see photo). It was an unexpected cornucopia of goodness which tasted healthy and delicious. As we munched, regulars walked in with great frequency to get their caffeine boost. Definitely a neighborhood cafe that I wish was in my neighborhood. FOOD   stars. . . quite a plethora of fresh ingredients in the Greek Salad hereAMBIANCE  .  stars. . . where everybody knows your name. . . except mineSERVICE   stars. . . friendly and attentiveTOTAL   stars. . . a welcome find for casual neighborhood eats Honestly this is probably the best place to go for lunch in our area.  The service is a little slow, but on a nice sunny day it's nice to sit outside, people watch and take it all in. Great food and friendly workers! We were looking for a small place to grab a sandwich, somewhat close to all the action near the piers.  Cafe Francisco was a great find. I went with a club and my girlfriend went with the roast beef.  Neither disappointed.  They were both warm, fresh and delicious.  There is plenty of seating outside, and being away from all the tourists means you can enjoy some peace with your food or drink. Overall this is a great place to grab a quick lunch and next time we're around the area we'll stop by again. Stopped here while passing by a few days ago for a cup of coffee to help battle food coma. Upon ordering, you get a cup and have a choice of four pots of brews to choose from, from strong French roast to something less strong.  I see here it's not just a coffee shop in that they serve sandwiches and maybe a small number of hot food plates. Overall, a very good local coffee place. Awesome! I've walked by this place a few times but it's so unassuming, didn't figure they'd have good food. Gave them a try since the weather's been nice and they have outdoor seating. Had a Belgian waffle (yeah!) with strawberries and scrambled eggs on the side. Along with a coke, came to  bucks. Two blocks away around Washington Square Park, same meal would have easily cost me . The waffle was delicious and the strawberries tasted fresh. The staff was nice but left me alone to sunbathe and read my magazines. Much quieter than the more touristy part of NB too. All in all, a great experience, and I'll be back to check out the salads and sandwichs. OK this place has fine food for a good price. But really I come here for the atmosphere and it doesn't hurt that the food doesn't drive me away. Good looking salads, nice sandwiches. Just a great neighborhood hangout. The music is not obnoxiously loud. They have wifi. Great sunlight. Beer and wine if you like. A great place to hang out. they make a good mocha"
Milan Pizza|3.5|Pizza in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|195|-1|3.08080808081|" Ordered it from home and it was delicious. Super cheat for city prices and took less than an hour to arrive My late night spot for pizza, and I love it. Health score is good (which you can't say for many alternative places around that area). Open till really late, very good prices for absolutely great slices with superb toppings. I don't get the haters, but I also never order from this place, but just walk in. Nice, medium thickness crust pizza with decent toppings. * for the price at less than $ for a big deluxe slice. But would pale in comparison to higher brow pies. For me, a tenderloin cheapskate, its great. The only way it could be better would be if the toppings were a bit thicker. I have never been to a pizza place that refuses to make a cheese pizza. There were no vegetarian options, and all they could do was shrug about it. I don't recommend coming here there are plenty of other places to get food, without the side of attitude. The pizza here is OK. Definitely not the best pizza I've eaten but decent if one is out of options in TL late at night. Delivery took + minutes. I've had the Milan special (salami, pepperoni, sausage, bell peppers and onions). It wasn't bad but nothing to rave about. Pros: late night delivery, online delivery through Yelp, arrived warmCons: too greasy for my taste, some slices had too much dough, not enough cheese, delivery took an hour Like many others have said about Milan Pizza, it's may not be the best pizza in the area, but it definitely hits the spot for after hours eating to after a night on the town. Been here on a couple occasions and they've had some pretty good combo slices.  I've tried their Pepperoni with Jalapenos and their Pepperoni with Mushrooms.  Both were pretty solid slices and are pretty comparable to Nizario's.  Overall, not bad and they're open super late till am when dining options around the city are pretty limited. What do I want after closing down a nearby bar?! That's right! Pizza! After numerous cocktails, a group of us came to Milan. Nothing like a huge slice of pizza to soak up all the alcohol! Since there was a group of us, I was able to try  different slices: Pepperoni Pepperoni & mushrooms Milan special: salami, pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, sausage & onionsMake sure they heat up the slice, since it's better when the cheese is all melty. I really enjoyed the Milan special since it had veggies. Even late at night, I want my vegetables! The Pepperoni & Pepperoni and mushroom were great as well. I love the pizza basics!For a quick slice, Milan does the trick! Our hotel recommended two places for late night pizza and this was supposedly the better one. So I read a bunch of these reviews first and thought I'd take the gamble. . . the house won. This is the parlor of last resort. If any one of the pizza strata (crust, sauce, cheese, toppings) were any further from the norm then this would cease being pizza altogether. I've never had any other pizza in San Francisco, so maybe this is how you guys roll, but I find that thought unlikely indeed. Also, I got this delivered via EAT and they ignored my request to make it well done. Fails all around! Next round's on me! Ordered from the first delivery place that popped up on yelp after me and a couple girlfriends stumbled back to our friends place. Ordering was quick and easy, time estimate for our large pizza was  minutes. When the delivery guy came, he needed my credit card again (had already gave them the card info over the phone) as well as my id, things I didn't bring on my walk down of four flights. Had to go back for them, and upon leaving, the guy asked for tip  my inebriated self had forgotten but looking back, seems schemey to ask a drunk girl but whatever. The pizza was pounced on, but the quality of said pizza was not great. % super thick bread/crust, pizza was very salty and mainly tasted of just oregano. Decent amount of toppings on our Milan special, but I didn't like the flavor of the meats they used. Cost of ~$ was worth it in that situation, but not when sober. Would not order again, but if anyone else were to, check out their website and menu, they have some decent coupons and deals. The guy in the black hat that works here is really funny, the pizza is hella good and make sure to ask for the online coupon large pizza for $. , they don't show it to you up front The guys that work here are great and the pizza is perfect!  If you are looking to have a full belly and be happy from a delightful experience look no further my friend. There are many places to choose from for your pizza needs in this area, but this is THE union square pizza place. If everyone is hungry and you can't decide where to go, then come and stuff yourself with cheesy delicious goodness. You will not be dissapointed! Mediocre pizza. Lukewarm when it got here. Had the pep and sausage pizza, little too hard on the crust for my liking.  If it's cracker thin, hard is fine but you can't have a half an inch crust that hard and enjoy bite after bite.  Toppings were good but can't enjoy it with a sore jaw from chewing. Disclaimer: This is the first review I've ever done, so bear with me. I signed up for a Yelp account just to start reviewing places I think deserve it. And Milan pizza deserves it. I read TONS of reviews about this place that are all over the place and IMO, its some damn good pizza. We went in after a night of low key partying at  Jones. It was the perfect pizza at the time, and I can only imagine its the perfect pizza at all other times as well. It's thick crust is just magnificent and the toppings on my combo slice seemed pretty fresh. They were pretty busy at the time, but we managed to snag a table in the back. It's not the cleanest looking pizza joint on the inside, but it didn't bother me too much  its such a small place and I've seen much worse. I read several reviews that say their delivery guy/process is awful and awfully slow. I'm somewhat excited to try it out and see how it turns out. With tons of negative reviews in that department, you'd think they'd try and make it better. I'm all about customer service so I will update this review when I order for delivery. Good place for a slice late night when you're drunk. I went in my pajamas, flip flops, & no make up. No one cared. Perfect Best good we had in San Francisco! They delivered to the Hilton and it was hot and good. Shove that designer food for a hundred bucks where Taco Bell would be better! Thanks guys! Came here because of the reviews but was thoroughly disappointedmin to get a pizza when we were told min. Instead is solving it they blamed us for not hearing the time for prep correctly.  Then the guy yelled at us for wasting his time. Really amazing pizza and also very good at room temperature in the morning. I couldn't have been happier with the way this pizza tasted and felt in my mouth. I don't know if it was the pizza, but I felt like after I ate it I drifted off into the most peaceful, wonderful sleep. Piece a pizza full. Get it? Morons bring .  star bs. I'm eating this pizza at Clift and people are giving  star envious looks. My mouth says  stars. Girlfriend says  stars. Peace. I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE AFRAID OF THE PIZZA GUY. The delivery took  minutes and the driver was incredibly rude bordering on threatening. When I called to check his ETA (after he called once and drove away saying he'd come back in  minutes), he started yelling at me. I started to wonder if I should even open the door to him. When I called Milan to tell them what was going on, the guy on the phone told me the driver was crabby because he'd been fasting all day for Ramadan. Um SO HAS MY WHOLE FAMILY and none of us are yelling at strangers on the phone. The driver berated me again when he finally came back with my food. As a woman home alone I feel uncomfortable that this guy knows where I live now. What kind of person gets out of their car screaming at a stranger who just asked when you might come back with her pizza? That's not just crabby, that's unbalanced. The driver was awful but the lack of concern from the restaurant was really  disturbing. Your employee is out here abusing your customers and you make excuses for him? Not ok. I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE AFRAID OF THE PIZZA GUY. Honestly one of the worst pizza experiences I've ever had. How could you go wrong with pizza?!? Called to get a large pizza with  toppings delivered to a friends apartment .  miles away and the guy on the phone told me it would take  min to an hour. So an hour goes by and still no pizza. The pizza shows up TWO hours later and it's not even warm! Idk wth the guy was doing but a pizza should not take  hours andd be lukewarm upon arrival. It took so long my friends and I had given up hope on getting a pizza at all! Did the delivery guy stop by a bar or something? Because that was total bs. Never ever ordering pizza from here again.  I'd give no stars if I could. Hands down one of the WORST pizza places I have EVEER dealt with. After ordering pizza for what I was told a   minute wait they came after an hour. When the delivery man called me and said he was downstairs waiting for cash I informed him I already gave my cc info over the phone. By the time I went downstairs to get my food he had left. I called the number back for the pizza guy to inform me they lost my cc number. I was willing to give my cc info again but when u called to confirm they didn't have it the man on the phone was VERY rude and said he never got it. Instead of taking my cc # he told me I was wrong & proceeded to hang up on me. I am a meeting planner and as far as I am concerned I will NEVER recommend themTo any of my clients or anyone I know. Best of luck! Good food but shitty service they were speaking Arabic talking shit and I speak Arabic and absolutely hate when people do that! If you want good food grab and go!! Worst service alive hello, my name is Jorge and i have known this pizza location for several years now,  every time i go the pizza is exactly the same, . . . . delicious, thick . . . . cooked to perfection Oscar is the guy who helps me when not MO, they are both the best attitude and friendly. Its hard not to stop for a slice every time we pass by by. Also we are happy to be taking care of your sidewalk pressure washing and awning cleaning needs :) Best, Jorgejjworkspw. com ok  it was late and i wanted pizza. like most folk i understand after hour pizza is a toss up  a gamble, but you go for it anyway  and hope for the bestwhen the reasonably priced pizza arrived with a cheerful delivery guy, i opened the box to find a handsome looking pizza  crust was just right, golden and charred just a bit  it was hot  and it was crispy! no soggy, bending messy mediocrity, but a flavorful, perfectly fired pizza. i just ordered another. Best pizza around! Open late! Halal! Great customer service. Great people. Awesome awesome delicious pizza. Baked fresh  and have pizza by the slice that's also fresh. Nice clean place. Can't recommend it enough! I was looking for a pizza place downtown that delivered on Sunday and I didn't want Uncle Vito's because their crust is always really soggy. I'm happy to say that the pizza was really good and the crust was delicious! I'm definitely keeping them in mind for next time. If you think Blondie's pizza is good, you'll like this. But Blondies is not good, and neither is this. Doughy flavorless crust, undistinguished though slightly spicy tomato sauce, flavorless lowball quality cheese blend.  stars only because if it were the only thing open after a late night I might conceivably eat it. Great pizza at a little dive restaurant. We are from NY so we know good pizza and this pizza is good! I had the pepperoni and olive slice and it was delicious.  The crust is good and the dough is thick.  Sauce is perfect. Would definitely recommend this pizza to anyone who wants a good slice without the ambiance. This review is on customer service.  Pizza is decent nothing special.  Asked worker named Oscar a question about the pizza to which he insulted me for asking,  then cussed at me in a vulgar manner which was quite embarrasing in front of other customers.   I will never come back and i will never refer customers to this establishment.   st rule of business. . . Never insult your customers!! Great customer service and easy ordering online  they even called to make sure it was good.  min delivery, super cheap $ bill but food quality was surprisingly good. Pizza + poppers + garlic bread + x deserts + tip =  bucks Great Pizza! Get the ranch dipping sauce and walk away without spending too much. Its a small place  if your party is big plan accordingly (+)  no reservation required  show up order and enjoy. Stopped in here for a slice after getting drinks up the street. Their crusts were nice and thick and the toppings were fresh and piled high. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. The restaurant itself is tiny and a bit dingy with limited seating, but overall, this is a great spot to pop in if you're looking for late night post bar nosh in the TL. Haha damn!! Its been months since I been here. . well what can I say. It was piza at  in the morning that I happened to stumble upon while I was walking around drunk in SF.  All I remember is they had tapatio and I got a fat slice of pizza for cheap and it was good! If you think this is good pizza, you 've been seriously missing out. Its a % chance that the pizza has correct proportions (to new york pizza, the best american pizza). Never received my order claimed other customer error. Other customer gave wrong address. Placed order at  called at  told order was out for delivery. Canceled order at . The order was an hour and ten minutes late before eat  canceled it. Two hours from placement of order. Apology from eat  but no phone call from Milan pizza. Even though brother in law was manager tonight. Thanks Delicious homemade crust. Can buy by the slice or order what you wish. Friendly speedy service for this local pizza shop. Would recommend for a casual night out or you can order it and they deliver for free! They were close to the Hilton and I had a pizza craving. They had several trays of pizza out that tempted me. The pepperoni and jalapeño was really good and was my favorite. I also had the pepperoni and pineapple. The toppings and cheese are really good and the slices are huge. The crust is a little thicker than what I prefer and it was pretty hard on the bottom  still good though. The price is right and the staff is friendly. It's a good choice when you pizza and something quick. Good pizza flavor and great late night delivery . . . right to our hotel room door in less than  minutes. I just ordered delivery at around  at night.  I must say the delivery was quick and the food was great.  Excellent pizza. Garlic bread could've looked better.  But overall it was great.  I recommend this pizza place. Best after drinking pizza in the area hands down.  A little hardy and just great if you're in the mood for that. Went there the other night for a few slices. Pizza looked good but the meats didn't have flavor and spice very bland. The worst part was the 'pizza' maker what an attitude. Not a hello, smile or thank you. Then a chick came in and he was her best friend having a great day, etc. . . what a fake. Then another guy came in and back to a crank. Will never visit again. Pizza crust is great!!. i ordered there special and its worth the price!. fast and very affordable!. Been coming here since they first opened up. Seems like they have built a good customer base here. the pizza is allot better than anything local. And by local I mean the tenderloin. Slices are hot and packed with plenty of cheese and toppings every time I stop in. Not an ideal place to sit down and eat. Also sometimes you get beggars in there. I've had them deliver also plenty of times, and the quality of those pizzas does drop down a bit, but it's still good a pizza for the price. This place is still booming and looking forward to it becoming bigger and better Nothing makes me more bummed than walking around to find an alight bite to eat, settling for something else, and having that something else suck hard. I work in Union Square, and had the misfortune of a :p lunch. With not a lot of choices that fall outside of the Tourist Trap  Overrated by Tourists  Fast Food trifecta, I decided to deal with the extra walk to make it over to Kare Ken. Unfortunately, it was a Monday, and I was stuck on the outskirts of the TL with  minutes left on the clock. After deciding the  minute wait for Pharaoh's would be too much to bear, I opted to grab two slices from Milan (one Pepp and Sausage, one Combination). The slices were re heated, chucked in a box, and came out to $ even with a Snapple. The crust is a thicker build at Milan. I am of the school of thought that if you have a thicker crust, you should compensate for having a healthy quantity of toppings, lest one find themselves eating a mediocre open faced sandwich. Milan's, suffice to say, did not have this, and the slightly burnt toppings on the Combination did not help. The bright point of the meal (which I ate on the way back to work), was that a homeless dude asked me for a slice (not cash, just a slice), so at least Milan's brightened his night. All in all, not even as good as Blondie's (the desperation pick's desperation pick), and probably not a place I'll be coming back to (sober, at least). I order a cheese pizza and they never delivered it?? I tried calling back and there phone was busy. I waited  hours for a burned sandwich and some lukewarm mozz sticks. Ordering delivery at am, I would have been easily impressed. Now I'm just annoyed I had to stay awake for some food I'm well aware was disgusting. Just don't do it. They're open. and cheap!Great pizza when you need to soak up some booze at the end of the night.  The mozzarella sticks are so so, what you'd expect from a hole in the wall pizza joint.  I recommend not getting  slices of pie between  people, but what do I know. These guys are awesome. Had a late night craving for pizza and looked them up.  I'm in town on vacation and had them deliver it to my hotel.  Ordered a pepperoni pizza and chicken wings for under $. Only thing I wish was for the pizza to be hotter on delivery but I can't really complain. They are pretty quick on delivery too. Got here in less that  minutes. Went the extra distance to make us satisfied. Outstanding delivery staff, Good pizza, cheap. Ok, I ordered a BBQ chicken, w/garlic and a Lt root beer and when it got here the guy brought the wrong soda.  The box also shifted in transport and the toppings were spilled. But the pizza still smelled awesome, so I paid and then complained to Amine, our delivery man who promptly apologized to me and went back to the restaurant and got us another pizza and another lt Root beer on the house. Outstanding commitment to customer satisfaction. Always delivered promptly hot and fresh, I live across this pizza joint and I definitely consider this a wonderful late night place to grab some pizza! Pizza is always fresh and warm. Guys are very nice and friendly. Also, I am absolutely addicted to their mozzarella sticks. I am drooling thinking about it right now! Definitely check it out if you are looking for fast, cheap food :) I live right around the corner at Tower  and order here pretty much   times a week for these simple reasons:. Their mild chicken wings with ranch are to DIE FOR!! . Their delivery time is beyond fast, last time I ordered, it took them  minutes exactly to get to my door since I hung up the phone. . Their pizza boy Paul is extremely gracious, very engaging, and offers friendly personable customer service. Their pizza is not too overpriced in comparison to the astronomical prices found in Nob Hill, and actually pretty decentThank you Milan Pizza for feeding me on the daily. Hehe Stumbling along the TL looking for a late night bite. . . Suddenly someone yells, ""Pizza!"" . . . and everyone's like hells YEAH!Milan Pizza ain't the best I've had, but it's the BEST thing to eat after a night of drinks cuz after I'm drink, drank, & drunk, I pretty much look for three things when in my search for FOOoOoOoOD!#. Fresh HOT pizza with greasy toppings & salty cheese!#. Thick chewy crust to absorb my night of FUN!#. Cheap eat. . . paid with the last $ in my wallet. CONVENIENCE: * [Located in heart of TL, Approx corner of Geary & Jones St. , a great stumble to sober up and end the night. ]AMBIANCE: * [Small hole in the wall, barely noticeable, stand at bar to devour slice. ]SERVICE: * [Fast & efficient!  Much props to the employees for having to deal with the late nighters. ]PRICE:  $  [$.  for a slice, I think?  I remember I got a bit of change back. ]OVERALL: */* [.  stars rounded up. . . only cuz I wouldn't go out of my way to come back for a slice, unless I'm already in the area. ]Nuff said. [ of  YELP CHALLENGE ] I used the eat  app and was not happy with my order. The sandwich I ordered had beef instead of chicken on it and they didn't even bring the salad I had paid for. Unfortunately, I will not be ordering from here again. I noticed the owner purposely hires and employs undocumented Mexican immigrants for cheap labor. also these workers don't wash their hands prior to making pizza. not very sanitary. I would go to other pizza parlors. Made the mistake of ordering from here a second time. Whoever thinks this is good pizza has no idea what a pizza should taste like. Its too chewy anf bland. The ingredients they use are of inferior quality. Even the sides i order, jalapeno poppers and wings were terrible. Please do yourself a favor and order from somewhere else. Just around the corner from Wilson and Wilson. Pizza is sold by the slice  large slices! Fast and filling for a late night snack after hitting the bars. As easy as one two three. One Milan down in the Mission: yelp. com/biz/milan pizza…Two producers to create this classic: youtube. com/watch?v=zqN…Three stars for a slice of cheese that satisfied the wallet ($. ) and the stomach (generous in size and quite like the doughy crust everyone else complains about). Know your Milans. And know your ABCs: youtube. com/watch?v=M aS… I really wanted to like this place because it's convenient for me, but as other reviewers have said, the crust is too thick and doughy. I ordered a slice of the pesto. I ate it because I was starving after work, but it tasted mediocre at best. Also, FYI, bring cash. There's a  cent charge if you use a credit card for a purchase under $. pizza was good, hours were good, but place was compacted, dirty and needs a good scrub down. Yes, the Pizza is overly ""bready""/doughy/chewy.  This being said, I'm curious to know why the owners don't simply take the bad reviews here and change the recipe?  I ordered a small veggie pizza, it definitely wasn't spit it out on the floor gross, but the crust simply kills any potential. I also ordered the Jalapeno Poppers.  I completely understand the risks of ordering an item like this through delivery, but damn they really messed them up.  They were (surprise) strangely ""bready"", cold and overall not very enjoyable to eat. Waited exactly  minutes.  Altogether I paid around . .  I'd be lying if I said it was worth it. I ordered delivery tonight from here. . . I live one block down on o'farrell so you could walk to my place. I get a call an hour after ordering from some guy Imcan barely understand telling me to come downstairs. Ive got a foot injury which is why I ordered delivery in the first place so this defeated the whole purpose. . . plus Ive never had anyone refuse to deliver food to my apartment. The guy called me again because I wasnt moving fast enough for him so I checked him and told hime he needed to cool his heels. When I got downstairs this guy was pulling my food out of the dirty trunk of his car. I told him Id never had such poor delivery service and he had the nerve to give me attitude. I hope he enjoys eating that pizza. Ive eaten here for years but Ill never spend any money with this business again. Overly doughy, chewey base, very little sauce and gross cheese. Better then nothing in this area, I guess, at  a. m. Someone from this restaurant illegally entered my apartment building to put their advertisements on everyone's doorknob. STAY OUT OF MY BUILDING. IT'S TRESPASSING. This place serves the best pizza I've eaten in my entire life. You can get a specialty huge slice of pizza with a generous amount of toppings for only $. . Highly recommend everyone to eat here at least once. Good pizza. Slow service. . . but friendly Italian pizza man. Great spot to hit late at night after a beer. . . not ideal for optimal health and fitness. . . but for pizza  give it a try before most other options on the streets of San Fran. OK pizza.  HORRIBLE service. We waited  minutes for a pizza because they burned it the first time. Fine. Mistakes happen. At least offer a drink while we wait. When this mediocre pizza finally arrived,  the guy sat it down on the table and could not get away from our table fast enough. It was as if the presence of dissatisfied customers made them uncomfortable so they handled it by ignoring us. The nerve of us. Also, they looked like they might have roaches. Find some where else to eat. Cheaper ingredients? Shame! Pepperoni pizza delivered at midnight to our hotel room.  Good price, very convenient, and tasty pizza that was also good as a cold breakfast the next day. Great small pizza joint.  Large slices for $. . The owners of this pizza joint are smart. Why is that?(a) They are one of the only places open until  a. m. on Fridays and Saturdays. (b) They are located near hostels and several blocks away from bars and clubs(c) And they serve mediocre, doughy, fluffy pizza. Because they can!However, it's better than nothing when you're out late and you're hungry. Waiting for the drawing for the Lottery tickets at the Curran Theater a young male usher told me the pizza across the street is just ok & Milan Pizza is better so after not getting tickets to the BOM I had a quick, cheap dinner at Milan Pizza. They have ready made pizza so if you just want some slices they will heat it up for you.  I got a Slice of Pesto $.  with tax $. .  It's really  small slices, so it's filling.  Credit card minimum is $, so I paid CASH. I ate my  slices which they call  slice at the counter, but there are some tables/chairs in the back. I noticed lots of take out orders & delivery. Really great pizza! Loved it. Got a supreme pizza to go and it was about as good as a pizza can get. Reasonably priced & friendly service too! halloween weekend,  am  my friends and i were hongray!! thank goodness we could count on milan pizza!these owners are smart. i bet they make a lot of good money off drunken food deliveries on the weekends. even better? it's easy to meet the minimum delivery fee (basically you just have to order a medium or large pizza, which corresponds to about   slices). the extra perk is that the pizza is actually something i'd eat sober  it's delicious without swimming in grease/lord knows what else. SUPER HOLE IN THE WALLBUT! If I am coming from a comedy show or any late night and need some garlic pesto in my life I will head over to the TL for some entertainment and damn good pizza! To my tastes, this Palestinian run, family eatery serves, hands down, the best pizza in the Tenderloin/Tendernob area. And while I do consider it very good quality pizza, typically I'd consider four stars fair enough for what you get, but in this case I just gotta bump it up an extra star for excellent, friendly customer service as well as fair prices ($.  for a large cheese slice usually hits the spot for me). As a regular patron I will say that every worker there is honest, positive, hard working and always there to greet you with a smile. Once I forgot my wallet and Mohammad even trusted me to pay them next time  now how often does that happen in this city, especially in the TL? In my experience, almost never. Keep up the great work gentlemen! The most discusting pizza ever! Could not even finish the one slice. Greasy, and ingredients were definitely not fresh. HORRIBLE! I wish i could give zero stars. As another reviewer posted I wish I could give ZERO stars.  DO NOT GO TO THIS PIZZA PLACE.  I ordered two slices, one was fresh out of the oven but was very thick, doughey, oily, and overall just NOT GOOD PIZZA.  What made this place ZERO stars was the nd piece i ordered.  It had been sitting out for who knows how long so they placed it into the over to re heat.  DID nothing and when I got home (had ordered pizza to go) the piece was COLD and cheese was hard.  The was the pizza nasty piping hot, imagine how it tasted as i attempted to eat it cold.  SICK.  Threw both slices away.  Should of known by looking at the pieces through the glass.  If you like thick, oily, flavorless, pizza, go here.  If not, please go somewhere else. I am only visiting San Francisco, but after spending an hour online reading reviews of pizza places I ordered from here. The pizza was great! The delivery was an hour, which was when they said it would be and although a little on the colder side, what can you expect when it probably took  minutes to deliver to me. Overall, liked it alot and was pleased with service. Pizza was okay if anything. I enjoyed the toppings, the problem was that the crust was to chewy and it had more of a loaf taste too it. The mild buffalo wings lacked flavor. Taste was something out of a Chinese restaurant. Will try out the other pizza parlors in the area. Hope is not lost Very average pizza :( and when I say a pizza place is average that is not a good thing. You and I both know this place only has business because it is the only place open at am. They must make an assload since they were fucking packed and I drunkenly threw all my cash on the counter and said I WANT THIS MANY PIZZAS. It's alright if you need something late night and quick. Crust could be better. Late night and hungry for what I was reading was fast delivery. The guy could barely speak or understand what I was saying which became redundant and nerve racking. I hate repeating myself more than  times in an order need I mention about . Never again there are always other options. Then I hang up after not finishing the order and they still have the nerve to deliver. Business must be bad for them. He keeps banging and waiting outside my room for like  minutes. GO AWAY. . . . . . Desperate for a quick buck I was gonna give him a tip for effort but he was off the chain annoying. Some of the best pizza I have ever tasted.  Absolutely delicious and fresh. I'll give this place benefit of the doubt, maybe I ordered the wrong specialty pizza. I live across from this place so I really want to love it hahaOrdered the San Francisco "",  slices. More than enough for  people. $ pickup. Can't beat that! Ok so maybe the pizza was too meaty. . is that even a thing? Yeah I'll give one of their veggie pizzas a try and do an update. The Greek or Mediterranean maybe. There was nothing wrong with it, just underwhelmed. Qualtiy of the ingredients was good. Crust prob average. I can say though that's it's better than Pizza Hut! First, they took an hour and  minutes to deliver after quoting   min (strike ).  Then they delivered the wrong pizza (strike ).  The wings tasted like they came from a frozen tyson bag (strike ).  Horrible.  The pizza was ok itself.  Just not impressed. I totally approve of this place. Best pizza and chicken wings. I love the staff so friendly . I was pleasantly surprised. The BBQ chicken pizza was very good. They also make the best ranch.  I love this place. RECOMMENDED ;) We went here because our hostel was around the corner and had this place listed on the Late Night restaurants board. The staff was nice enough, and we took our pizza to go. It wasn't that great a pizza, something didn't taste right about the cheese, maybe they use a special blend instead of just mozzarella. We were exhausted from exploring the city though and it was better than nothing. If I were in the city again, I would go somewhere else for pizza. No handwashing here.  I wish I could write a more in depth review, but that is all I have to say.  They don't wash the paws before working with your pizza dough.  The pizza was not really great.  It was okay, and next to our hotel. I am a fan of the Mild chicken wings here !! I have ordered a few times and the flavors are always spot on!Minus   stars because the pizza can be a bit dough y but some people like that. the spicy wings are not that good because they are smothered in sauce and taste soggy but the mild ones are super nice and crispy chill place, they let us bring our beer in. get the roast beef sandwich. I eat walk in pizza because i work across the street, I've never tried the delivery, but I can say that the pizza when i get there is always fresh and delicious, its my favorite in the entire Tender Knob region, and the guys are all real friendly (maybe because by now they know my face!) They have coupons on their website that they don't require you to print out to use.  Free delivery too!  We opted for the large pizza,  wings and a  liter for $.  I asked for pesto on the ""San Francisco"" instead of the red sauce it comes with but realized they put it on the veggie ones for a reason.  I couldn't tell there was pesto past the pepperoni, bacon and beef.  It also had just enough feta to be able to list it in the ingredients. Everything was evenly layered on a doughy crust.  The cheese remains the same for the first day then takes on an iridescent, rubber consistency.  This isn't the best leftover pizza. The spicy wings, which were not spicy or very good, tasted like the frozen Tyson wings you find at Safeway but only if they're partially cooked.  Toss those bad boys in the pizza oven please!It's not the best, or the worst  but I would be willing to go here beyond the late night stumble (they're open till  am). Hands down the best slice in the TL. It's one of the better cheap pizza palaces in the area, but it can be a bit shady at times.  For some reason they have a bunch of guys hanging around who are ""working"" but not really doing anything.  One time I called in an order and they totally forgot that I had placed the order. Big slices, friendly guys who work there. Open really late. WOW. Delicious pizza. I had a slice of their mushroom and sausage pizza, and melted. Granted, I had in me a few cocktails thanks to Yelp Drinks and was famished after a busy day of no food, but the taste was pure heaven, clouded judgment or not. Definitely a great place to stop in after a late night carousing around town or simply for a quick fix. Better service and cleanliness could have lended them a better rating, but hey, it's pizza by the slice for goodness' sakes, so that's arguably unimportant anyway. If you're looking for a good slice of pizza in the area, Milan is a solid choice. You'd probably give it   stars if you were drunk. But I was sober, and I'd only come here if I was in the area or looking for a drunken th meal."
The Mayflower Restaurant|3.5|Vietnamese in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|107|-1|3.72222222222|" I came here today for breakfast and yum! I'm glad I went to this mom & pop place! The hostess/waitress is nice! And. . . Their lemon grass chicken and french toast is delicious! I definitely will come here again! Came here ONCE and i am hooked!! I just cant stop thinking bout this place ever since i came here. I sleep dreaming about it and i drool thinking about this place. Just really need to come back here asap before i go crazy lolAnyway let me tell you bout their FRENCH TOAST. It is the best I ever had!! My friend brought me here for my bday and omg it was so good I was so impressed!! This place may not look too fancy or clean, but seriously just keep calm and have their french toast! Pricing is amazingly cheap less than  dollar for  eggs french toast and lemon grass chicken woohoo I am SOLD!! Thank you Corinna for introducing this amazing breakfast place to me! :) Love this place!! It's all about the breakfast! The French toast, pancakes, and pork chops are delicious! And the mayflower omelet is also very good!!  Don't be deceived by this restaurants appearance, just take a chance and check it out! Best place to get grab breakfast on Ocean Avenue, I kid you not. Although a little shabby looking on the outside, I find this place to be a little gem in the neighborhood. I have been here a handful of times with different people, and each and every single one of them have all agreed that the French toast here is amazing. I always get # French toast, lemon grass chicken and  eggs any style. It is only $. , and fills me up every time. I also love the Vietnamese coffee here. I can't vouch for any of the Vietnamese food though, since I haven't tried any. (The french toast is such a must have!) Service is always great here, so I will keep coming back! Very nice waitress, as soon as you sit down they are at your table, great prices and the food is good! I don't usually go to chain restaurants while on vacation, but we had already checked out of the hotel and had spent the day in china town, so we were tired and wanted something that we knew of. food was excellent and the staff was beyond excellent. it was a great ending to a great trip. Very sweet waitresses, small but good. First time here, I'll probably come back when I'm back in town. :) I like the people here, they're quick and friendly. Nice restaurant. Great breakfast for $. My partner and I usually come in for a wonderful breakfast here every once in a while.  We moved closer to the city and miss the wonderful family that works here. A small hole in the wall diner located alone Ingleside. The concept of it being a traditional American breakfast house, as well as serving Vietnamese is pretty cool, if you ask me. Pros: The waitresses are the sweetest people here.  Despite the old and somewhat gloomy interior, there's a strange homey feeling to this place as well.  Menu has variety, but it also stays simple and doesn't have an overcrowded menu.  Close to CCSF, Ingleside Public Library, Wholefoods Market, and Yogurtland.  Walking distance or you can take the K metro muni.  Their french toast is nommies.  Rootbeer float. Some cons: The interior is super old. Gloomy and dimly lit.  The prices for certain things aren't worth the price.  The portions for some dishes are less than what they're worth. Definitely one of the spots to go to if you're in the mood for American or Vietnamese styled breakfast. This place has a very pleasant old school feel to it. Their food is quite good, especially their small Vietnamese portion. Honestly you can have a better omelette elsewhere but that's not the point; this place deserves the good business that it gets because the staff is always very polite. The Mayflower has a niche in their French Toast and we can confirm that. Their Vietnamese chicken noodle soup was delicious as well. Come give this place a try and see how you like it. Surprisingly a really decent breakfast spot wasn't to sure how great it was gonna be it looked a little sketch having just moved into the neighborhood wasn't sure how good was gonna be with a half Vietnamese half American food menu. . It all honesty it was pretty good just an all around simple breakfast cafe spot to hit up if you don't feel like cooking Price & Quality The food here tastes fine, it's their portions that are irritating. I've came here about  times in my life but no more. I ordered eggs with sausage and steak before and it was like a kids meal. Only reason I ever came was on tuesdays where I forgot Pho Ha Tien was closed. The Pho here is ok, but you're better off saving your money. Service The service here is ok. Nothing bad, nothing great. Vibe The place has a nice little set up in terms of its diner vibe but eh it's not my place. Should you go? Unless you're dying to have pho and Pho Ha Tien is closed, no. I am aware that this diner has changed hands in the recent past, but I have been going here for almost  years and haven't noticed any major changes in quality, service or food.  At least one staff member is the same one who served me the first time I went in.  This place is seldom packed, and so I have found it is good for groups.  In addition, since they serve brunch, lunch and Vietnamese food, it is a crowd pleaser.  Everyone can find something they will like.  Best of all, even at the peak of Sunday brunch time, I have never had to wait for a table.  I enjoy that they ask how you would like your bacon cooked.  Their Vietnamese coffee is strong and flavorful like it should be.  The eggs Benedict was surprisingly good.  The pancakes are fluffy and don't taste like a mix.  The Pho and vermicelli are both decent.  Who doesn't want a side of lemongrass chicken with their bacon and eggs.  I highly recommend this place, especially for the price and not having to wait for a table. I had eaten here twice in my life. First time it was pretty decent.  Two month ago, I went there expecting same place. BOY!  Was I in for shock!  It changed hand to some Vietnamese family. I like Vietnamese people, my experience always has been positive. (Inclusive of these people who had taken over reins of Mayflower restaurant). I had one of their breakfasts with eggs fish and rice.  It tasted well. . . hmm. . . . okay, (mediocre). I have to tell you, two hours later when I left, I suddenly became violently ill. I threw up on pavement on Ocean Avenue (near Franciscan Hobbies) Sorry folks at FH, nothing against you!   Plus I felt very weak. I almost was very close to calling for ambulance!  But I managed to get Muni home instead. After half hour of being back home, I suddenly had to literally drop everything and had to make SPRINT to bathroom, this was bowel EMERGENCY!  I had such explosive (non bloody thank goodness!) diarrhoea that wound up being unrelenting and persistent day and night for full week!  That along with intestinal pain, cramping (and noise), bloating and gas. Plus I was malaise and fatigued from / need of toilet.  I was one sorry mess!This was so bad I wound up having one massive unexpected bowel accident at home on kitchen floor (as I went in for replenishing fluids such as orange juice).  This must be one of worst cases (if not worst ever) of food poisoning I ever have had in my life!  Again, I was so close to contacting , but still somehow resisted (for fear of embarrassment and high cost of ambulance ride) I finally  to my total amazement  make full (?) recovery. NEVER, NEVER. NEVER shall I EVER eat at Mayflower ever again!  They may be nice owner, but my God!  They most certainly do NOT know how to keep clean place and you are guaranteed to get severe case of food poisoning!If I were responsible for giving them health score, it would be flat ZERO! . . . Or 'F '!Spare your intestinal tract, please AVOID Mayflower restaurant at all cost!  Wow! I'm generally a pretty generous person with the yelp stars. . . but these people will get no love from me. Not cool that on their door, and on yelp it says they're open till : but when we walked in, we were told that they were closed. It was :. Their neon sign still lit up ""open"" and people in there were still eating too. So much for all the quarters we put in the meter. Oh well, it's OK, the place was super dark. . . darker than a dive bar and we wouldn't have been able to read the menu anyway.  And I wouldn't call it ""old school"". The place is just plain dingy. Mom and pops neighborhood gem? Hrmm. . . they treated us just like the way they do at Delfina. BoWe won't be back. Solid breakfast food in a very divey old school looking spot. Has that old school diner feel to it. Not good for dates though, lol  then again Ocean Ave in general isn't really a datesy spot. My BF used to work here about  years ago and claims the breakfast food is really good. I had my doubts but after taking a bite, I converted. Pretty cheap and hearty portions!Omelette  is huge and full of fillings. Pho  SKIP IT. Maybe their other Viet items are better??I'd like to return for more of the breakfast items that the BF and everyone else raves about! This spot is a little gem!This is what you call your local mom n pops breakfast joint run by some lovely Vietnamese ladies. I don't know what they do to their french toast but it is one of the best! Crispy and soft. . . perfect texture. I have yet to try their pho but I usually come for their french toast with lemongrass which is also delicious. The ladies are super friendly and it is usually filled up with regulars. They make an effort to remember what is your usual order too!Parking is a plenty, if not found on Ocean there is usually parking off on the side street. They have recently repaired the broken seats in the booths I believe, so they polished the place up a bit. Can't wait to visit again!"
Altena Restaurant|4.0|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|39|-1|4.0|" The tv was on way too loud. The red salsa in the salsa bar was good and hot. The burritos are big, but not very tasty. Food is good, service needs help.  This is for the cashier lady:When people enter your restaurant, smile and say hello. When people order food and pay for it, be grateful for their business and say thank you.  Don't just throw their order on the table and walk away.  Place it nicely and say here you go, enjoy!Maybe this is your first time in a customer service position, but good service goes a long way in retaining customers.  Conversely, bad service will quickly turn customers away. This place is solid. After reading that La Taqueria was voted ""best burrito in the country,"" I had my doubts, and after seeing the lines, I thought I'd pass on that. I had been there before and couldn't remember it being that memorable (and remember it being pricier than most). So, I was in search of trying a new taqueria that I've never been to. There's got to be more hidden gems, and I think Altena is one of them. I got a super burrito al pastor (no beans), my go to order, and it was really flavorful. I wish it was just a bit juicier, but that's just splitting hairs. The price is alright; it was about $, so I've had cheaper, but there's definitely pricier ones (ahem. . La Taqueria). It was big and tasty and hit the spot. There are two salsa bar carts, side by side, but only one had items in it. There was a salsa verde, salsa roja, and the marinated veggies. I think the salsa bar was a bit lacking, and the chips weren't the best, but they were free! It was quick and speedy, but lacked some of the fun ambiance and decor in a usual Mission taqueria. There is easy parking, as it's located right next to the Safeway parking lot, so it's convenient to park there for a few minutes. While I still think I prefer to scope out new taquerias, I wouldn't hesitate to come here again, but I also don't think it would be my go to spot. Went to alteno today got the chili verde and the chicken fajitas. Armando the cook is excellent. Food was amazing! New favorite spot in the city! Plates are huge and prices are good! Highly recommend la alteno! The Altena Mexican Restaurant is perfect choice to enjoy a fast service and good quality Mexican food on the go, or inside the premises. The variety of dishes available makes it difficult, but not impossible to find the right combination of the selection of meats to accompany a plate of rice, beans and other condiments to satisfy your hunger. It is family oriented with plenty of room for everyone.  The staff is friendly and always concentrating on excellent and speedy service. I highly recommend it to everyone to try it at least once, you may thank me later. Pretty good!  Nice salsa bar with good variation on flavors; not different colors of the same thing. Al pastor taco very flavorful.  Carnitas very juicy; no crunchy bits, which I like, but this was good anyway. Great portions!  Good value. I LOVE ALTENA!Their burritos and tacos (which is always what I personally order) are delicious.  DELICIOUS.  When you add ""super"" to them, they're SUPER DELICIOUS. And, you can eat the tacos with your hands as they prep them correctly.  Burritos are also wrapped properly.  NO MESS. My only real complaint isn't the fault of the restaurant, but rather, the neighborhood.  Every time my partner and I come here to eat, some homeless person from off the street usually walks in up to our table to ask for a handout.  That's annoying. (yeah, yeah, I know.  They're homeless.  But sometimes I just want to enjoy my meal without trying to save the world from itself) best mexican food in sf! Best Al Pastor I've had in San Francisco. Friendly service, cheap, and fast. Avoided this restaurant for years due to its location right by the Safeway parking lot. Not any longer. . . I go for the Chile Verde burrito or plate. It's not high end cuisine, but I've never been disappointed with the quality or serving of my food. A regular and good burrito place. Should I venture further off into the menu, I'll update and let you know what I experience. Staff is always pleasant with me; my smiles get returned. This is my go to Mexican Restaurant in Bernal Heights. Good food, decent service, good price. The carnitas here is some of the best in the city, crunch with lots of flavor. The lengua, and cabeza are also tasty, and a regular burrito is less than $. Try their smoked chipolte salsa as well, lots of flavor without being to hot. The burritos are great, the enchilada plates are filling, the guacamole is fantastic, and the chips are thick and crunchy!  The food is always reliable, and the price is great.  Parking is easy at the Safeway parking lot.  It's a great local neighborhood place.  Love it! Solid Mexican food at a good price. I had a couple of carne asada tacos here and the flavor is on point. Nice portions as well. if I'm ever in the Bernal Heights area, I will definitely give this place another try. . . ."
Great Saigon Restaurant|3.5|Vietnamese in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|69|-1|3.62711864407|" Wow, this place serves HUGE portions! But am I complaining? No, sirree!I ordered the beef pho, which didn't come with as much meat as I had hoped, especially for that big a portion of pho, but oh well. My friend had the vegetarian vermicelli noodle bowl, which was also huge, and she was very happy with it. My other friend also ordered a beef pho, and she was the only one who was somehow able to finish it. She was on a mission. It was raining on the day we came in, so they gave us nice and warm cups of tea once we were seated. Our pho was so hot though that we had to ask for some cups of ice water midway through our meals. On another note, since it was raining that day, they had a few buckets at the front door where customers could place their umbrellas so that they wouldn't leave puddles at the tables. So nice and thoughtful!By the time we were ready for the check, we were all stuffed and two of us still had leftovers to take home. Leftover pho is never really that good though, so if you can, try and finish so you don't have to take any home because the noodles get really soggy by the time you reheat it to eat at home. Anyways, once we got our check, we noticed the numbers looked a little off and a bit too high, so we politely asked for a confirmation for the total and it seems they made a mistake, so they came back with a cash reimbursement since we were paying by card. I was going to take off a star for this, but the whole thing was handled nicely and quickly, and plus I loved the big portions, so five stars!I will be back so that I can get a vermicelli noodle bowl for myself! :) I always get their vermicelli bowls or rice plates when I am here! I always order it with BBQ chicken or with BBQ pork. Their chicken and pork are extremely flavorful and it's the best part of the bowl or plate!I'm not the biggest fan of their imperial rolls that comes with the vermicelli bowls and that's because I don't like imperial rolls in general. But my coworkers said the rolls are good! I haven't tried their pho yet but a bunch of my coworkers who have, said their vermicelli bowls taste way better than their pho! That tells you that they specialize in vermicelli bowls!Their portions are always HUGE!! So be pepare to eat! I really like this location. Really. I've been coming for a couple of years now and have tried a variety of things, however this time I had a really bad cold and needed soup. O M G!We here in SF know that soups I. e. Chicken Soup, Pho, Beef etc. is generally good and always comes in decent sized bowls. GO HERE! The bowl (regular size portion mind you) was huge. And piping hot. w/crisp basil and noodle pepper deliciousness on the side. Eating, er drinking rather, comfortness when your under the weather makes one feel so good. I went home and slept. . . like a baby. Its never crowded and quite clean. Good job folks, I'm a regular now! There are many good Vietnamese restaurants in the heart of Chinatown. I have passed by here many times and never had an opportunity to dine here. But after my first visit, coming here was indeed a big mistake. For lunch, I ordered my usual, bun cha gio thit nuong for $. . And additional $. , I also added a Sunnyside up egg. The pieces of pork were too tough to eat and difficult to chew. The egg rolls were skinny and tiny like a bullet. And the bowl has a smell of dishwashing soap. You can easily tell my bowl was not satisfying. My dish: yelp. com/biz_photos/grea…For a business in Chinatown, the restaurant is clean. And the hustling ladies were very nice. But the meal needs some correction on my questionable future visit. I had the pho tai. It was ok. There's no hot pepper oil & they're cheeky with the cilantro & green onions. They also use red onions instead of white. This may be nothing to most ppl but I'm kind of a pho addict  and thought you should know. I wouldn't go again. WATCH OUT! GOT FOOD POISONING AFTER HAVING LUNCH AT THIS PLACE YESTERDAY //! SYMPTOMS INCLUDING: DIARRHEA, VOMITTING, HEADACHE AND STOMACH CRAMPS!  Now here is the detailed version. I'm using my husband's yelp account to post this review since I don't have one. Yesterday I went to this place for lunch and ordered a ""BBQ Pork, Beef and Chicken Rice"" (三色饭). The food took a while to prepare and when i was eating it, it tasted fine. But after finished I went back to my office, it was around :pm. About :pm, I started feeling a headache, nausea, stomach cramps and I had to go to restroom. The symptoms developed so fast that I started having diarrhea! And of course after about another  hour or so I PUKED ALL THE FOOD! I'VE NEVER FELT SO BAD IN MY WHOLE LIFE! That's how bad food made you feel! And the worst part is I was still at work! I felt so bad that I couldn't continue working. Luckily my boss was nice and bought Pepto for me and told me I can leave early. I will never go back to this place again! It made me feel sick on thinking of that what I've been eating at this place since this April I started working in the neighborhood  blocks away! I will file a complaint with SF Department of Public Health to do a thorough inspection of this place so that people won't get sick because of the bad food served here! Small mom and pop spot recommended to me by a friend for great pho. I got # the satay beef. Veggies are fresh, flavor is good and has nice spice. I am disappointed in the imperial rolls, too greasy and too much batter and served very hot. Portions are good sized and the price is very reasonable for what you get. Inside is clean and the overall quality is high. I will definitely come back. Really sucks. I don't even know how they have stayed open! Worst Vietnamese restaurant ever! And they charged me $ for extra blood in my Bun Bo Hue, which was the worst I have ever had btw. Thai tea was watered down, nothing good! Went here for lunch yesterday and we were able to be seated quickly.  My mom ordered the crab and pork noodle soup. . . but she couldn't find any crab (not ordering that again). I ordered chicken and mixed veggies rice plate  pretty good! May I add. .  tge place was very tight and small, not ideal to go with + people. Very welcoming and attentive staff. Ordered vermicelli rice noodles with BBQ pork and imperial rolls. Big portion but the BBQ pork and rolls were smaller than I thought. Very good though! They give way too big of portions. Noodles for days. It's a little overwhelming. This place is decent priced and it takes card!Only problem I have with them is their soup isn't very consistent. Sometimes it's got way too much star anise, other times it's not as flavorful. It's kind of a toss up. $.  lemongrass pork vermicelli, less than  min wait. Very small shopb about  tables? set pretty close together. Staff was very nice. Clean restaurant. Nice decor as well. Honestly have to say they made the dish really well. The pork was marinated well and the meat wasn't burnt. Fish sauce tasted like it had a BIT of sriracha in it. When I opened my takeout box, I was like WOW! Two things: . huge full box. . very little meat. If they didn't skimp on the meat, I would have given them  stars. Sorry but I like my meat. For $, better be a mound and not a small handful! I gave this place  stars because I found hair in my food and I kindly told them about it. She took my plate and then brought it right out that she took the hair out. I didnt make a big deal because the food was good. The pork chop was real good. Also, get their fresh lemon drink. Great Food!  Had a great bowl of Pho. Loved the imperial rolls. Prices were great and service very quick. I was well pleased I came here for lunch the other day per co workers suggestion.  I ordered the chicken pho and I have to say the pho had a ""lightness"" to it that I enjoyed very much compared to the majority of other places where I ordered this.  I also really liked the type of noodles they served.  It was very thin, like the vermicelli rice noodle we would get at a Chinese restaurant but still taste like the regular pho.  Very interesting, I thought. Likely will return.  At the very least I will like to see what there the soup for their beef pho is like. Food was overpriced and mediocre. On the bright side, food comes very quickly and the restaurant looks pretty clean. All I have to say is. . crab. noodle. soup. OMG, SO GOOD! It doesn't have crab chunks, so don't be fooled. It does have pork, and my oh my will it fill you up even on your hungriest days. About $ with tax, and the lunch crowd is always poppin in this place. The waitresses are super friendly, but super busy. I've also tried a few other dishes, and they were very delicious as well. I'd say this is your best bet if you'd like to try Vietnamese food, or just want a good bowl of pho. Highly recommend this place. P. S. Bathrooms are well kept, so you don't have to grin and bear it. Great on a cold day. The Vietnamese pancake is bomb! Slightly sticky tables, and pho is going to be a bit oily, but the broth is really good. It's a little more expensive here compared to other Vietnamese restaurants.  I've eaten at over  Vietnamese restaurants and this place was definitely below average. Just to clarify, for me, Vietnamese food is just whatevers.  So I never have high expectations.  I usually want something soupy, quick, and affordable.  But this place. . . it was not even close to mediocre. When they say it's a beef noodle soup on the menu, make sure you ask what else is in it!  Mine was spicy beef noodle soup and it came with pork feet and pork blood too. . . . . . . . . The noodles are bad here.  I had like  TINY pieces of beef in a huge bowl.  I stared at it for  minutes, I waved over the waitress and I was like, what's this?  Why is there no meat?  Well of course with their broken English, they didn't know what I was talking about.  Or maybe they were playing dumb.  Anyway, pho with no meat?  I was ready to walk out. The second time I came I had the shredded chicken soup.  Broth was good.  Noodles were better this time.  But again, I got just  small pieces of shredded chicken meat.  My meal was really just noodles and soup.   small pieces of chicken doesn't even fill half of my mouth if I stuff all of them in at once. . . . . I'm SO DISAPPOINTED.  Not coming back. O speaking of broken English. .  I asked for more napkins and they gave me pepper.  I asked for a piece of scratch paper to scribble some things down (gesturing with pen in hand) and they brought me more pepper. . . Haha. Good, cheap Vietnamese near FiDi, Chinatown, and North Beach. Portions are good size and the meals are cheap and tasty. Pho is legit. Clay pots are legit and the combo plates are pretty good too. Most meals are under $. . Cheap and tasty. What more can one ask?  My old standby in the area is the House of Nanking, but I was on an extreme budget so I was browsing for something that cost next to nothing. Well, I found it with their hot and crunchy BBQ chicken Vietnamese sandwich for only $. !  Can't tell you about anything else on the menu, but if everything else is as good as the sandwich. This place is a find! I was walking with a friend around dinnertime in sf on Kearny street and I was looking for a good place to eat. Since fellow yelpers seemed to agree that this was a good place, and I was craving phò, I decided to go to this restaurant. We were looking at the menu options, which were posted on the front of the restaurant, and the lady(the owner) asked us if we would like to try some Vietnamese food. The food:I decided to order the empirical rolls for an appetizer. They were okay. Not great. They tasted dry and not very fresh. The sauce was good but the rolls themselves seemed very overcooked and not very fresh. For the entrée I got the sautéed beef noodle soup. Great choice! It made up for the rather dry and tasteless rolls. The beef was delicious and so were the noodles. It had some tomatoes which were alright. The rest of the vegetables were tasty. It had a little bit of a spicy kick but nothing compared to some foods I've had in the past. The service:The lady was really polite and helpful. I had to ask for more water, but overall the service was pretty good. Facilities:Seemed to be well kept and clean. The bathroom is really small and the sink seems to be designed for a very small person. I could barely seem to wash my hands in it. Never in my life have I seen such a small sink. I would come here again for the phò! For no apparent reason at all, I didn't feel like eating today. It's completely out of character considering I would normally fantasize about trying something new for lunch, especially after having a dull breakfast of cereal or yogurt. But you gotta eat, so what do you do? Play 'food volley' with your co worker who's in the same funk. After  minutes of food suggestions back and forth, Vietnamese food struck a chord with both of us. (you can tell work is a huge priority for us) =)Enter Great Saigon, a new place that we both haven't gone to yet and it is close to the office, next to the Quickly I frequently visit. The restaurant has good reviews on Yelp so why not? Beef pho was on my co worker's mind but I couldn't get past the clay pot rice (so authentically Vietnamese. . . NOT), it draws me in like a moth to a flame. I had a spoon of the pho broth and it was very good, not too salty and very flavorful. My clay pot rice shows up and looks and sounds terrific. (if you want neighboring tables to stare at you, order the clay pot rice and people eating their silent bowls of noodle soup and vermicelli bowls will stop and marvel at your clay pot rice sizzling and steaming in front of you) The clay pot is loaded with crunchy burnt rice, chicken, shrimp, Chinese sausage, onions and mushrooms. A craving well satisfied. Of course, this dish can't compare to the original creation in China, but walking  minutes to this restaurant beats a  hour flight back to the motherland. Sorry, I couldn't get a photo of the Beef Pho, my co worker pho' blocked me; pretty pho'd up if you ask me. I made her buy her own Quickly drink. =P Unfortunately greatly disappointed in the place, I'm Vietnamese and the food here is definitely not Vietnamese. Pho has too many Chinese spices and even curry taste, taste like Indian Chinese soup. The cha gio( spring roll) are the size of a toothpick, more rice wrap than filling. I would not recommend the place, go down the street to the Vietnamese restaurant, it look a bit sketchy but more authentic than here. I will be back again and again to this Pho house. The Pho broth has more cinnamon than I am used to but that is part of the charm of Vietnamese food. Although the recipes have a base set of core ingredients  Vietnamese cooks add their own special flair to make the dish their own. If you ever visit Vietnam on your travels if you get Pho from Hanoi or Hue or Saigon they will all taste slightly different but all will be delicious. The fresh spring rolls were huge and delicious. I will be back again and again whenever I stay in downtown SFO. I'm there every week with my co workers. Love the E Sup! (The special beef. ) The portion is huge and delicious. I don't really remember how the other items taste because it has been a while since I got anything but the special beef  number . My parents and friends come in from abroad and this is one of the places I bring them every time. I think prices have gone up since some of the reviews on this place. I got a claypot because I had been craving one for awhile. My friend got a pho, which was quite a generous portion. The claypot I got was very flavorful, but it was deceivingly small compared to what I was thinking in my head, and the rice is not served in the bowl either, which is what I had been hoping for. They give you steamed rice on the side of the claypot. The meat and onions in the claypot were really good, just the amount of saltiness that you want to eat a bite of rice, so that you can continue to eat more goodness. But, I was disappointed with the amount of other vegetables in the pot. It was essentially just meat and onions, lots of onions. I wish there had been something else to break up the monotony of meat, because there are only so many onions that I can eat. But, for meat lovers, this may be the spot for you! bbq chicken with imperial roll and rice noodle taste really good. I just wish the imperial rolls are larger, but for the price it may be too much to ask. Came here with a girl friend yesterday after work for a casual dinner.  I got the bbq beef with grilled shrimp over vermecelli and she got the bbq pork with imperial rolls over vermecelli.  Both amazing!  The food is fresh, non greasy, and has great taste!  Will definitely recommend and be back again! Their pho is delicious if you are looking for hot noodle soup with meat  especially on cold days when the fog comes withering in!I ordered up their beef balls with rare steak in rice noodle soup and it simply hit the spot while also fulfilling my pho craving!Their imperial rolls can be improved.  It was not the usual meaty packed rolls that I like, but these egg rolls were rather thin.  I didn't care for it at all.  However, do try or order it if you are craving for egg rolls!They only take cash.  The restaurant is small and cozy with friendly servers. Good food at reasonable prices.  For some reason this place isn't as busy (yet) as very similar Vietnamese places nearby, which is fine with me.  The service has been good everytime I've eaten here and the food is good.  The combo plates are just right with a good mix of food but the pho is probably the best deal.  The ""Special Pho"" is the typical everything beef but without the tripe that so many other places load up on  this is how I prefer it. Give this place a try. seriously good lunch spot. the food here is delicious and the prices are very reasonable.  for a large lunch portion, you get a good sample of food with their combo plates.  their bun rieu is very good, they don't skimp on the noodlesmy fav is combo c, a little bit of everything under $sai's is closer to work, but it's worth the walk to great saigon just for those two items i mentioned above.  service is ok, but since they aren't outwardly rude and they are always swamped, i try not to hold that against themlooking forward to my next noodle fix :) love this place.  so many options, good quality and inexpensive, quick friendly service. I would recommend # satay beef pho (a bit spicy), any of the clay pots, veggie rolls, mongolian beef, i don't really like vermicilli bowls but their vermicilli bowl with half chicken/shrimp is delicious. Love this place.  The portions are very generous and the staff is extremely friendly.  They are one of the few Asian restaurants that take card and not exclusively cash.  Prices are very cheap  less than $ per person.  I would recommend the crispy imperial rolls, the beef pho and their chicken and vegetable rice dish.  After sampling several Vietnamese pho restaurants around the area (My Canh, Vietnam, etc. ), I would say the pho broth here is more on the salty side.  I noticed grounded black pepper in their broth  which I personally love because it gives an extra kick.  However, this subtle nuance is something to take note of. Conclusion: for how inexpensive this place is, there's no excuse not to give it a try Hmn. . Let the boyfriend go order Chinese tonight when we checked into our hotel.  Oops. . He picked Vietnamese. A place that makes excellent Pho. But the combo fried rice was not even fried. Just steamed rice with bay shrimp, cheap chicken and beef, and some veggies. Totally bland. So was the small portion of Mongolian beef. But hey the dog liked it. . LUNCH ONLY Quick serviceGood pricesHUGE portions (it's only one size for pho)Broth was very good, chicken was very juicyGood, quick lunch spot! We stumbled across this place while wandering around Chinatown. The food was amazing, and the service was great, and even better for the prices. This restaurant is owned and operated by Chinese, so they might not understand you if you bust out your Vietnamese. Bottom Line: Good vietnamese cuisine smack in the middle of town for reasonable prices. After passing Quickly's not far from here, my friend and I decided to come here since it had been a while since we've had vietnamese food. For SF, I thought this was surprisingly cheap. My meal came out to be under  dollars (seems like a rarity here). I had the House Special Beef Noodle Soup (first one on the menu when you look for Pho). For being a guy in Indiana without Pho for the longest time, I was pretty satisfied with the Pho I had here, especially when it doesn't really put a dent in the wallet. Would come here again. I often get take out from this place for lunch. It's a convenient location and their spring rolls (both shrimp and vegetarian) are soo good. I tried their chicken pho last week and was sadly unimpressed. The broth was pretty bland. Sometimes it takes a while to get my order (even when it's just an order of spring rolls) but it does seem like they are always busy during lunch. I was walking by here on my lunch break and was drawn in by how packed the restaurant was in comparison to its neighbors.  I ordered a # clay pot. I wasn't very impressed with it and was only going to give the place  stars but the service was excellent.  I even left my headphones inside and they found me outside to return them.  The soup on my neighbors bowl looked amazing so I'll be back next week to try it. Overall: quick and good service, average food at cheap prices. This place is right across the street from my work, which makes it easily accessible. Take out takes about  minutes. Note: It is packed around :pm. I went there for the first time today and ordered the curry beef stew pho. The broth tasted good, but the meat was not my thing. I'm a texture person and the meat was mostly fat and looked veiny and odd. The container they put the food in to go was way too small to eat out of. I ended up spilling all over the place. I would eat here again, but I would try maybe the chicken instead. Or even one of the vermicelli plates. Until next time. . . . . We stumbled across this place while wandering around Chinatown. The food was amazing, and the service was great, and even better for the prices. I'm only in town for a week, but I plan on returning at least once more during this trip. Just had dinner here tonight. Nothing really wowed me. I was disappointed with over all overall meal. I ordered the # (imperial rolls, # (combo soup) and a iced coffee. The rolls are smaller here than in other places I've been to. And there was not enough lettuce to wrap my rolls. There is not enough water with the condensed milk. The coffee was too strong to enjoy so I watered it downed with the funky tap ice water. The soup portion was huge but it lacked in spice/flavor. There was salt but it lacked the richness great pho has. Also, the jalopeno pepper were not cut in small pieces. I took a huge bite of the peper and torched my tongue. It did satisfy my search for comfort from the  degree weather. I did not pack wisely for this trip to Sf and walked here from union square with t shirt and jeans. They charged too much money. They gave too much noodles on my lemon grass chicken vermicelli there was a lot of sauce at the bottom of my plate. And when we ordered a side of fried chicken, they only gave us chicken wings! They charged .  for every refill. The water they served had a weird taste to it. I don't think I'll come here again. EXCELLENT. I've lived in North Beach for + years, there are  restaurants I go to consistently and this is one of them. I used to drive all the way over to the Sunset or Daly City for good Vietnamese soup, and this place is even better than those. It's not high class, but it's good food, good prices, and authentic. Best part: you can be proud not to be part of House of Nanking herd next door. If there is anything great about saigon, you definitely won't find it there. Ordered chicken salad, the guy with prison tattoos took my order and soon I had it in my possession. The chicken meat tasted awful, just old boiled meat from like rib cage or something similar. Trip to bathroom later, just avoid it. Not worth the risk I came here twice this week for lunch and loved the Vietnamese Clay Pot rice but wasn't that impressed with the seafood noodle soup.  The clay pot was flavorful and good portions for a good price, but the noodle soup had cheap ingredients and not much flavor.  Get's really busy during lunch and the service could take some time.  Overall I would recommend for an affordable lunch. I  come here at least one to two times a week for lunch. All of the dishes I have tried have always been delicious and worth it. The pricing of their dishes is very cheap to fair. I feel the quality here is way above Sai's. I would definitely recommend coming here if you are in the area. for $.  i highly recommend the clay pot. If the line at Sai's is crazy long, it might be worth it to walk a couple of blocks up  where you might find a good alternative. Great Saigon Restaurant holds its own against other lunchtime Vietnamese joints. You get big portions here for your money. Big bowls of soul warming noodles and broth are what I've had here and I enjoyed every slurp. The beef pho (yelp. com/biz_photos/kIp…) holds up against other famous luminaries. If you want to switch it up a little, the satay beef noodle soup (yelp. com/biz_photos/kIp…) adds a little spice and crunch  a nice variation from the usual clear pho broths.   Lunch at Great Saigon Restaurant is a good choice considering you get pretty good vietnamese food, and a lot of it, for a couple of dollars less than other places. Worth the extra walk from the Fidi plus I've never been in a lunchtime line here before and they take cards. the food is so great and yummy the price is very cheap and a lot of food too , and the people work there very friendly , i go eat there almost everyday the best restaurant ever it just like my house . The best Pho I've had outside of Ho Chi Minh City! And, I eat a lot of pho. Servers are fast and friendly and attentive. Crispy imperial rolls were very good too. Man, now I feel bad for not getting any sort of bbq'd meat option here.  But, I had #, the special beef noodle soup pho bowl.  $.  for a rather large bowl of noodles, meat, meat with chewy stuff, and meatballs.  The broth was. . . SUPER hot.  I practically burned my tongue from it, but after a little bit, I re tasted the broth, and maybe. . . just maybe it was because my tongue taste buds were gone from my burn or their pho broth just lacks. . flavor.  I didn't taste any super cinnamon taste like what someone else said, nor did I taste super much salt.  Just kinda. . watered down pho like.  Average.  I was sad there wasn't any tripe in the bowl.  But yeah, average pho. They do give tea here though!  In a nice mug, and they walk around with a tea pot refilling it like it were ice water.  Wish I knew beforehand that they did that, cause I was kinda conserving on my tea drinking.  Nice place, clean, sorta average pho, and probably better bbq stuff. Oh! and I did spy beef satay noodle soup on their menu! Mm. .  stars!The food is good, lots of variety like bbq ch. The waitresses are nice (they're chinese; at least, the one's I've encountered don't speak Viet). The place is clean and modern like, even though the store is a bit small. Usually when I come here, it's empty. I just dicovered this gem directly across the street from my office.  Upon lunch at and from there two days in a row I declared I want to get lunch at/from there every day.  So many choices done right, so affordable, meat and seafood grilled to perfection.  How was this under my nose for so long and I'm just dicovering it?!  Thank goodness I did! This place is really good. They're BBQ chicken is really delicious and its pretty cheap for lunch. Small hole in the wall viet restaurant right outside of China Town. Had the beef pho which was pretty darn satisfying. Hooked up quantity and the beef was perfectly grilled and very, very tasty. Definitely some of the best beef I've ever had with any pho. Only complaint is the broth was a little bland. Great prices, very clean, and very, VERY yummy! I think this place is fairly new, so it wasn't too busy. But our waitress, Nancy, was so wonderful and nice, and really took care of us. Definitely recommending to my friends and family!"
Taqueria Mana|3.5|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|181|-1|3.61333333333|" I ordered No.   Regular Quesadilla with beef. It's come with rice, bean, lettuce, Salsa and sour cream. I really LIKE it! Love their Salsa with sour cream very much. :D I have to give them  stars! They are the only reasonably priced mexican restaurant in the downtown area. Our office orders lunches every week. This time we chose Taqueria Mana. They actually delivered to our office on time and the gentleman who delivered helped me with reading out everyone's orders. They got everything correct and my flautas were pretty damn good.  Our office is not an easy crowd to please with people having special allergies or food preferences. I'm glad I got to order from them. And I'm glad everything turned out right. So thank you Taqueria Mana for making my job just a little bit easier. I tried this Taqueria because I had a certificate through Restaurant. com. It never expires. The person at the register declined to accept it, saying they no longer utilize the restaurant. com service, since .  I got this certificate in July of .  ""We no longer accept those, Boss""Not wanting to cause a scene, I ordered my burrito. It tasted OK, but was very dry.  I would not come back. The guacamole was not of a great quality or taste, and everything else was dry. The meat was well seasoned, and tasted pretty good, but it can't be saved amongst the dry burrito. Boss, I will not be back. I discovered this place via a PayPal deal.  I have to say, at first I was skeptical, the place looks like a hole in the wall right next to the Stockton tunnel.  But the food is actually really good!  The thing that stood out the most was that they put a lot of meat in their burritos, so you get your money's worth.  The burritos are also a good size. I live very close to Taqueria Mana, and I like that they do online ordering, so I picked up a taco salad this afternoon. I wasn't very happy with the chicken; it was pretty bland. The guac wasn't great either. Incredibly cheap. It's in an odd location, and the inside was (like others have described as) unflattering. The man working was friendly though! I will probably give this place one more chance in the future. Quite possibly the worst pork burrito I've ever eaten. The meat was literally unchewable, had to keep spitting it out. Got a few bites in and threw the full thing away. Maybe I just got unlucky, but I can't say I'm eager to ever try that place again. I get the lunch special baby burrito once a week, shredded beef no rice extra beans.  Great customer service! i had an awesome experience here! friendly workers, and AMAZING carnitas! the burrito was bursting with flavor. imho, they're on the same page as burritos in the Mission. i recommend this joint! This might be the worst Mexican food I've ever had. The only reason I tried it was because of the convenience and it was available for online ordering pick up. So the food I ordered: cheese enchilada plate, shrimp plate, carne asada taco, shredded beef super nachos  and chips & salsa. The enchilada sauce was bland like straight from a can, shrimp had no flavor and was over cooked, rice was dry like from days before, nachos didn't have enough chips for the price, and the chips were stale. Overall bad food I general, not coming back. The carne asada super burrito is the best I've had in this area! They are super fast and friendly too, a lunchtime favorite in our office! Good selection of food with American options. Chicken sandwich was yummy and mini tacos were okay. Menu on yelp was very helpful, because it covered the specifics decently. Wall menu had no details. Guy behind counter was giggly. . . He got my order right, so it's cool. Closed sundays. Right below the Bush overpass so you can take the stairs down. Close to liquor stores and bars. This place is awesome!  When I'm not in the mood from a BLT from the liquor & deli nextdoor, I usually come to Taqueria Mana on my lunch break.  The food is always delicious (I've had their tacos and sopas) and you never leave hungry!  The prices are more than reasonable and the staff is always cheerful and friendly.  The salsa they provide on the tables is also incredibly delicious. Note: The noise level is usually quiet, but average with the world cup going on! (: Terrible delivery experience! Ordered a large lunch order for work at  and food took  HOURS to arrive even though the seamless confirmation email said it would only take   min. They also appeared to charge my credit card multiple times and even automatically charged a tip for themselves! Burritos arrived cold. Didn't even come with chips/salsa. They ran out of the Snapples we ordered too. Awful customer service and manager said ""do you still want the food?"" after we had already waited an hour and they hadn't even started making the order. No one from the restaurant called to say it was going to be late. Since the order was for an office event, everyone was hungry and the food came well after the lunch hour. Zero stars. Negative stars! I ordered the carne asada burrito from seamless. com for my lunch order at work. Was the grease seeping through the foil to my desk? Yes Was it delicious? YesI got the OJ on a whim as a 'healthy' chaser, it's fresh squeezed, win! I am conflicted about this place.  Crispy tacos here are excellent: flavorful and tasty. The machaca likewise is great.  The burritos, unfortunately, lack meat and are mostly rice and beans.  After bringing them home for the family a number of times we've concluded this was no fluke and decided to go elsewhere for burritos. When we lived nearby, we ate Taqueria Mana at least twice a week. Quick, good price. If you get chicken, make sure you ask for the grilled chicken. Massive plates of nachos, gigantic burritos. Wish the chips were made in house  my only complaint. This place was pretty good, I got the chicken nachos w/ everything and was very pleased and satisfied. This is more of a .  ratingThey're pretty good but I've had better, I am definitely a fan and will return The guy Screwed up my order. I requested a BLT sandwich and  chicken flautas. I only got  flauta. He tried to get us to order drinks, but walgreen's has $ oz sodas. Therez also a liquor store  stores dwnIve ben here x b. Look for the women workers, more polite and gets the orders correct. Would have bn  stars but if u cant get the order, itz not deservin I've trie the grilled chicken and their carne asada but nothing comes even close to their el pastor. Their tacos are perfect and the baby burrito is perfect as well without making you feel like you ate a brick. They don't sell any beer which is awful but there's a lquor store  feet away : ) I had never been here but I ordered food from Taqueria Mana through Grub Hub. The food arrived earlier than expected, was tasty, the portions generous, and the price right. The mini tacos were delicious and so was the wet burrito. Five stars for fast Mexican food. Found this place on Yelp and saw how close it was to where I work, I thought id give it a shot. After a short .  minutes of walking, I walked up to this restaurant (very easy to miss if you are driving) and stepped inside. I was greeted to a few tables, chairs, colorful decor and friendly staff. I had ordered my food online and paid in advance, the online ordering system is very well organized and user friendly! The staff had my food waiting so after picking it up I walked back to my office and it took me all but  minutes to down the burrito! This place has some really good Mexican food and it def. will be a to go spot for me when I am craving some Mexican food! If you are in the union square/financial district area and want some bomb Mexican food, def. give this place a visit! Amazing chicken tacos fresh and delicious. One of the best pepper hit sauces I've tasted. Not too hit, but a ton of spice and taste. Service is super friendly and food comes out quickly. My burrito was barely filled with anything, / of it was just a tortilla. It was very dry and the carnitas were just  massive chunk that was hard to bite. It was obviously microwaved and not actually cooked. It's a great and cheap place. I like the food there. It's super clean and CHEAP. Good is food. Definitely should try their MANA BURGER! Dropped by for a late night snack after Tunnel Top. Being super buzzed, the baby burritos were the perfect size for one person and the mini tacos and fries were great for sharing with the group. Food was . / but they get a bump for being friendly and quick with filling/affordable portions. Most of the menu starts around $  and costs a little more for add ons, which is pretty good for downtown. Why can't I give this place zero stars?!  We called for a delivery order *the day before* for our :pm staff meeting.  At :, we called and they said sorry for being late, they were really busy.  At :, the meeting was over and still no food.  We called and they apologized, saying that they will start on our order right away.  WTF?!? Absolutely unacceptable!!  Who does that?  Just let us know you're incompetent to fulfill our  burrito order and we'll go somewhere else.  Never again. . . Came here on a rainy night because it was close to our hotel. Really nice people and surprisingly yummy. # super burrito w/carne asade. Worth the walk in the rain! I had the Torta here. It was pretty chewy. I'm not sure if I just ordered the wrong item on their long and extensive list of choices, but it was okay. The meat was pretty chewy and it was diffcult to swallow. I got fries with the torta, but it didn't think it was enough. I suggest serving food in smaller plates if they want to give less fries, because on a bigger plate, you really notice that stuff. My Coworker liked it, and he said he'd come back if he was in the area. Fat tacos. Fat burritos. Simply delicious carne asada everything girl YES!The freshly squeezed orange juice tastes just like when my grandma used to squeeze oranges for OJ for me. It's a dope spot right underneath Bush St, on Stockton outside of Union Square. I've eaten there and have taken out of towners here between   times and never had a complaint. Came here for lunch, since it was recommended by a doorman of a hotel nearby. Super burrito was about ~$, and came packed with toppings. I'd guess that it was in in diameter, which comes out to ~. in in radius. The complaint that I have is that it was thick enough that eating the burrito I had different strata of the burrito. (i. e. on the left was cheese, on the right was the meat. . . etc)My meal was very quick to prepare. They do take credit cards. They don't exactly have a large grill, so meat is pre cooked and kept warm. Tortillas are heated and stuff is added. Guacamole was great, should've asked for more. This is the best Mexican food in the district and the people who work there are so friendly. They have a rather extensive menu and the food is reasonably priced. My favorite dish is the steak ranchero plate. Speedy service and quality food, you can't beat that! I got a burrito and it was delicious!  The meat was well flavored and fresh.  Having just moved up from SoCal and expecting Mexican food to not be as good up here (especially in the financial district), I was pleasantly surprised.  The only downside is that their lack of carne asada fries on the menu. :) I work around the corner and have started to frequent this place. I've loved everything I've ordered and they work fairly fast. Veggie Breakfast Burrito  REAL VEGGIES Pressed OJ mixed with Carrot Juice  cheaper than the other places you can get fresh pressed juice around here and big cup, great value basicallyChicken Taco Salad  A lot of food if youre hungryVeggie Quesadilla  Once again, real veggies like sautéed mushrooms, peppers, onions. . . its great Hmm. Coming from Southern California this was a disappointment.  Carnitas was dry, avo was brown, and food lacked flavor. Hot sauce was bomb to say the least. A little restaurant near the tunnel.  Best suited for takeout, though there are a few tables there.  Fish burrito was really great.  A bit pricey, though, at close to $ with tax. Visiting California for business and wanted Mexican. Found this on GPS and looked at reviews. Was a little worried at stars but tried it anyways. I got nachos they were excellent and friend got quesadilla they were both amazing. Best taqueria food in the Financial District. If you work here, then this is all you need to know. No, it isn't as good as the Mission. No, it isn't as convenient as Chipotle. No, they don't have the best salsa/chips/etc. Yes, they have milkshakes and hamburgers on the menu. Yes, this is your best option for Mexican. This is a great place for good Mexican food at great value.   I've had a few items from this spot and they have all been solid.   The sopes are very good. . . . and I too enjoy the chicken caldo.   The food is fresh and has great flavor. This place is great!  I had the ""Super vegetarian nachos"" with black beans and it hit the spot.  Very fast and friendly service.  It is definitely in a random location and has a hole in the wall vibe, particularly from the outside.  Try it out anyway!  I will be back for more. Had them deliver food to our office in SoMa last week and it was spot on. Prices were great and everyone enjoyed the food. I was craving Pozole, so I ended up getting that, but wasn't too impressed with it. I must try their chimichangas next time. Also, I love their online ordering, but you can't substitute or personalize the orders. Inexpensive, close, delivered in / hour (through Eat). . . oh, and the food was unbelievably delicious. The Chili Relleno is a star  barely breaded, 'cuz it's got nothing to hide  deep, dark green chili with tender flesh, and just enough seeds for heat. I may have an inappropriate dream about it. Hire a new delivery boy,  hours to find a door bell is not acceptable! This place is right around from the office, so it's one of my go to's. Food is always good, staff is friendly, and I LOVE their salsa! In the mood for Mexican? That wont cost much? This is your place! Taste good! Fast & local! Last night in SF and I wanted Mexican.  Compared to a lot of places around union Square i didn't want to spend much but want to munch down.  This place hit the spot!! The food was more nutritional and healthy then other greasy Mexican Joints.  What I ordered:Super Quesadilla$. Flour tortilla, cheese, meat, sour cream, and guacamole. Served with rice, beans, sour cream, lettuce, and salsa.  Meat Choices: Boiled Chicken, Barbacoa (Shredded Beef), Carne Asada (Beef), Lengua (Beef Tongue), Grilled Chicken, Carnitas (Pork), Carne Molida (Ground Beef), Chorizo (Mexican Pork Sausage), Chile Verde (Spicy Pork), Pastor (Marinated Pork)The Quesadilla was hot and served fresh! There was more food on my plate than I can handle and best of all it had healthy substitutes! So yummy! I must admit it is in a random spot but I bet you will enjoy as much as I did! I am from LA so I appreciate some god authentic Mexican food. It has been surprisingly hard to find in SF but I'm so happy I discover this place. I usualy get the carnitas burrito which is delicious and I've also tried the nachos, also really good. Its right under the stockton tunnel near sutter so if you're around union square its really easy to get to. Yum On the bright side, this place is super cheap. And the people are nice, friendly and helpful. Everything pretty much goes downhill from there. I had the big burrito (# on the menu) with carne asada. The meat tasted like it was day old, or maybe worse. It was super dry and nearly rock hard. Not good at all. The rest of the burrito was passable, but the rice and beans had obviously been sitting around for quite a while. The enchilada sauce was okay, but not overly flavorful. The ""salsa"" on the tables had a good kick to it, but absolutely no flavor. It reminded me of an Asian pepper sauce, more than a salsa. The restaurant is kinda dirty and run down and just not all the comfortable. I was really bummed out that THIS was my last meal on this trip to San Francisco. Oh well. . . lesson learned. FINALLY a good Mexican joint. It's right before (or after) the Stockton tunnel depending on which direction you're walking. Food is pretty good, the cashier guys are super nice, and the service is quick. Seriously, what more do you really need?If you work in the area, you can also order online (or just call them too). Big win. Definitely gonna make this my go to Mexican spot for lunch I live in the Mission but work right next to this place and I kinda love it. It's a little greasy, so don't mind the fat and calories.  It's worth it. Also their chocolate shakes with cinnamon are pretty much my favorite thing ever.  So great. ** STARS** relative to:Mexican taqueriasI had the super burrito with carne asada and wasn't impressed. That's too bad because I was expecting a good burrito. The burrito was decent but didn't have me wanting to come back to try other things. The rice in my burrito was not warm, like it had been sitting out for a while, and the texture was gummy and clumpy. The meat was greasy and wasn't of great quality. All in all, I was disappointed with my burrito for $. , and I would go elsewhere to get my burrito fix when I'm in downtown. Breakfast review only here!  The breakfast burrito at Mana barely had egg in it so I started off a bit disappointed.  Then the potatoes were also a bit hard and the burrito overall was a bit dry so I wasn't too impressed with it here.  Hopefully they can improve, but alas, it's not a good option for the breakfast burrito IMHO. . . I don't know what I ordered but the picture on the wall looked good. So, I just said I'll have that. Well, ""that"" was really good. There was so much of it that I couldn't finiish it. Yeah, I'll be a repeat customer. Couldn't muster up the energy to leave the house tonight, and I was craving some Mexican food. I searched Mexican on Seamless, and found Taqueria Mana with the best reviews. We ordered a Shrimp Quesadilla and a Steak Ranchero, Coke and a Mango Kerns for $. I wouldn't say it was pricey, but for the quality of the food, I would say it was definitely overpriced. This was subpar mexican food. I've had better TexMex parading as Mexican fare. Everything was flavorless, the rice was overcooked, but underdone (I don't even know how you can accomplish that). The steak was tough and gristly and drowning in tomato paste. Shrimp quesadillas were soggy and the shrimp overcooked. Everything came in paper take out boxes, which were totally soggy and structural unsound by the time they arrived at the house. And a thing about the delivery: the average delivery time is estimated to be between  and  minutes,  yet our food arrived over an hour later, just shy of  minutes. And to top it off, they subbed peach Kerns instead, and didn't even warn me. Needless to say, my little man was disappointed. Cold, flavorless, and unsatisfying. If you have no idea what mexican food is supposed to taste like (mr. New York who gave this place  stars), then you will be pleased with the cheap eats. If you want real mexican food, stop being a pussy and get your ass up and go to the Mission. You'll be sorry you didn't. I was. *grumble* I LOVE THIS PLACE! I've been here once every   weeks for the past  months. I came here when I did a no carbs diet (ordered the fajitas without rice + tortillas), when I stopped caring (Super Burrito with everything and marinated pork), when I decided to cut my portions down (Baby Burrito), and when I decided to try Pescetarianism (Shrimp Burrito). A lot of diet changes in a few months, but Taqueria Mana has always tasted good no matter what I restricted (not restricted) myself from eating. One bowl of Menudo + a can of coke +  small tacos = about $. I got  small carne asada tacos which had a lot of flavor and was good especially with a squirt of lime on top! And the menudo was good, too. The size for the menudo was decent for about $. There's really not much to say. I paid, I got my food piping hot, and that was that. :D Trying this place for the first time, their super burrito is AMAZING.  Best burrito I've had in a long long time, maybe even best in the Bay. Everything me and my coworkers have ordered from here is really good. That says a lot since we have some picky eaters in my office. A simple bean, rice and meat burrito tastes amazing! Not only is the food amazing but the customer service is top notch! These guys made a mistake on my order and corrected it with a smile and exceeded my expectations in terms of correcting their mistake. I've been here many times and there will be many more times! Thanks! Love these guys.  Super tacos and quesadillas are great.  Prices are great too, $ for a super taco.  What a deal!  Perfect for a working gal's lunch.  Everyone is SUPER nice and remembers me when I come in.   My co workers and I all go there all the time.  Oh, and the chicken soup hits the spot like no other, with huge chunks of chicken, not too salty, lots of cilantro, and some nice zing from the lime wedges they give you. Total hole in the wall, but solid home made food for cheap and nice, friendly staff. Oh, and the random stuff on the TV makes the short wait kinda fun. How can a meal that was cooked  minutes ago be cold? I ordered  grilled chicken tacos, when I brought it to my office it was lukewarm. All of their ingredience are ""precooked"", so nothing is grilled to order. They just melt the cheese on the solf tace shell on the grill. I am so glad that ""chipotle"" just opened up. Eventhough it's a chain restaurant, it is way better. . . This is super tasty hole in the wall cheap burrito place near Union Square. I highly recommend Taqueria Mana. . . look for the specials which are impressive deals. Beware of this restaurant! Unfortunately, I received food poisoning from this restaurant on Monday night.  I ordered their chicken burrito. Not only was I severely sick to my stomach for the next  hours, the delivery was  minutes late AND when I called about my delivery, no one spoke any English besides telling me ""Call back  minutes"". Do not order from here. Wow, big portions for the price! I got a wet burrito, so full of carne asada, that it lasted me  lunches. Also got a side of chips, all for a little over $. Not bad. The location is just a bit hidden; you have to take the stairs to get below the pedestrian bridge. this place is close to my work and home, so i come pretty often. not the best mexican food, but pretty good, their salsa is very good too, i usually either get lamb or carne asadathe prices are super cheap. . . decent size burrito $, street style tacos $ In San Fran for work, needed a quick meal as I had just arrived at hotel.  Yelped up casual Mexican near my hotel and found this place.  Steak burrito was excellent, all ingredients pretty high quality.  Could see this as a regular lunch spot for me if I worked in the area.  NYC  particularly Manhattan, lacks solid Mexican food, so was especially enjoyable. I am hooked on PASTOR CALIFORNIA FRIES. I don't think it's on the menu. It's straight up stoner munchie food and yes it's high in anything that will pack those fat on your booty but just sit down and let me tell you about it: Juicy, spicy, pork al pastor salsa guacamole sour cream cheese beanson top of fries. Fatty talk! But it's so good. . . This is my second time here. The first time I ordered a Chimichanga and I was not tasting anything. . . Is it really supposed to taste like nothing? My taste bud did not like it at all!I came here again thinking my first visit, it could of been the chef making the food was bad, so I ordered a mojado burrito to give this restaurant another try. So a couple things wrong with food order that I ordered to go. Mojado ""WET"" burrito means you shouldn't use a paper to go box that does not have wax finishing so your sauce does not make the box soggy. When I was eating my burrito, I got a good dose of fiber from eating the soggy box. . . OR you could of put foil in the box so it doesnt soak up the sauce. So the food. . . Nothing to really rave about. I was quite sad because this place could of been better. YUM! I tried to this place for lunch while waiting to check into my room. The food was very good although, I think I picked the wrong beans to put on my taco (refried). The young guy at the register was very sweet, patient and nice. The service was fast and I can tell that this is a family run business. The lady making the food seems to really put effort into every dish. This shows and comes through in the flavor and taste of the food. This place is great for a quick bite and definitely hits the spot. It also isn't a bank breaker. I took off one star for the location and noise coming from outside of the restaurant. Other than that, I will definitely be back during my next San Fran stay! Was it the best breakfast burrito ever?  Well, it came mighty close. After I finished up my physical at  Shudder Street I was starving and needed food and caffeine stat.  I headed into Taqueria Mana and chose a breakfast burrito with ham.  the other choices were chorizo, bacon or veggie.  The burrito was stuffed with chunks of tasty, salty ham, tons of fried potatoes and nice fluffy eggs.  My only regret is that I didn't ask them to add salsa to the inside of the burrito, which is the way I like it. $.   a pretty good deal for a really good burrito! I have been there just the  time.    Nice Peeps,  Good prices,  aa short  block walk from my building.   I ordered a Steak regular Burrito, spicy.    Pretty Darned tasty! Delicious burrito. Very juicy, packed with gauc. Coming back for sure! Fresh & Flavorful. Taqueria in my backyard? Why not. And the second you order your meals, is the second they start up the grill to rustle it up.  Chorizzo and Queso meal w/ black beans, cilantro, and rice Carne Asada Plate  Beef steak with grilled pepper, onions, mushrooms Fresh Orange JuiceAnd PS? The fresh OJ felt like it was literally, picked from the back and squeezed before my berry own eyes. it was delisioso! Surprisingly good, for being in a touristy spot downtown. A little expensive for what it is though. I've had dried out, unpleasantly crunchy carnitas here before but the barbacoa has always been great. Way better than I was expecting. I had the carne asada super burrito, and it was delicious.  The key to a great burrito is that every bite has to have a good mix of flavor and ingredients.   Every bite had that perfect mix of black beans, rice, meat, sour cream, guac, and whatever else was in there.  The price was about right, and totally worth it.  I will be coming back here soon for more. A microwave? Really? You have signs bragging Fresh Authentic Mexican Food and then pop my meal in a microwave before handing it to me??Despite that, the taste was there. The food is good but a $ dinner place shouldn't be thrown in a microwave. Delicious veggie super burrito and a veggie taco that was the size of my face for $? I aint mad at it. It's literally a hole. in a wall. the man and woman behind the counter were super nice and accomodating, and the food was pretty damn good! its two blocks from my office so here's to hoping i can contain myself :) Shockingly good!The Beef Quesadilla is a winner for me, though the best part are the re fried beans. I'm guessing there's a ton of lard and salt. Nothing healthy can taste that good!Normally I do not like Mexican food, and I've unwillingly dined at many, many, many a taqueria. This place deserves my return visit."
JT Restaurant and Catering|4.5|Filipino in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|13|-1|4.30769230769|" my go to place whenever I need my filipino food fix which is almost once every week. Auntie Tess is awesome and very nice.  I usually get the kare kare, adobo, dinuguan tinola and sinigang.  If I'm lucky, I get to have veggies too. Majority of the dishes are on point I like my chicken adobo differently but hers is pretty close to how I like.  the dinuguan is one of the best ones Ive had. I specially love her bibingka malagkit. . . my grandma used to call it latik.  it's  the best one Ive hard besides my grandmas. highly recommended. This place serves a lot of the Filipino community in the neighborhood feels just like home for a lot of the residents and seniors that are daily customers. Mama Tess is the best her home style cooking gets a lot of attention food portions are really good for the price. They are also good for catering for party's and events. This place was just awarded for best small business in all the districts by the city if San Francisco congratulations Mama Tess ( Tess Diaz Guzman) for all your hard work and generosity. I your in the area don't hesitate to stop in and try some of her home style Filipino dishes and desserts. Random hole in the wall and a little tough to find, but the adobo, sinigang, and kaldereta are truly amazing and totally make up for having to walk back down Mission Street to a crosswalk. And Tess is a sweetie! If you're in SoMa and looking for Filipino food, definitely stop by. You won't be disappointed. Just remember to bring cash, as they don't take credit cards. delicious caldereta! This place really is a hidden gem. Authentic, delicious Filipino food cooked by one fantastically nice mother, tucked away in a random office mall suite on a block with few other things worth stopping for. Portions are generous, and everything was great. I got the beef stew and beef chunks, while my friend got the lumpia and chicken adobo. The chicken adobo really stood out in flavor, I would definitely get that again. Price is very reasonable, cash only. And I always love pointing out when places have no wait because that's such a rarity for decent weekday lunch in the city. No wait!! And the seating area feels like a tropical cafeteria wonderland. Tess is really nice.  When I go there to pick up food, it feels like I'm talking to a filipino version of my mom. Lots and LOTS of food for  bucks, I really like the ground beef thing, not sure what it's called but it's ground beef with carrots and peas in a gravy like sauce.  So good.  The longanisa is great too, too bad it gives you the longanisa burps.  Good thing I do all my work over the phone so no one has to smell it but me. Great place for lunch on days I want to stuff my self silly My co worker and I have been talking about going to JT's as it's right around the block from work so we finally made it out last Friday.  JT's is located inside this building called the Mint Plaza.  Walking in, it felt like your typical ""Turo Turo"" style resto, where you point at the item that you want.  But at the same time, they sold some dry goods and yeah, it felt like a living room in there with the TV, entertainment center, etc.  Any non Filipino who walks in here would say, ""WTF"" whereas with us being Filipino were like, ""This feels like my Auntie's house!""They offered a nice variety of hot food, about ten items to choose from.  They have their everyday offerings such as Chicken Adobo, Pork Adobo, Pancit and such but they also have their daily specials, which was Kare Kare, Pork Sinigang and something else.  I did the two item combo and had the Chicken Adobo and Kare Kare, my co worker also got the Kare Kare but got Lumpia Shanghai as her second item.  Tess, the ""T"" in ""JT"" helped us out and was super friendly, she said just to eat first and pay later.  Before I forget to mention, Tess piles on the rice, she apparently knows her clientele and was so hospitable the entire time we were there, not just to us, but to all of her customers that came in. We sat down and dove into our food.  The Kare Kare was pretty good!  There was generous amounts of oxtail and meat, and the sauce was nice and creamy.  My Chicken Adobo was also good, everyone has their own recipe for Adobo and although it didn't taste like what my Dad cooks or what I cook, it was on spot.  Evenly flavored, not too salty, I can't complain!  When everything was said and done, two  items combos and two sodas came out to $. , not bad at all. Overall, you'll get some legit, homemade Filipino offerings here and it'll fix your lunch time craving. I love Ate Tess & her authentic Pinoy cooking. She makes you feel at home. Food tastes great and at a very reasonable price! Love this place! As someone who works in the TL and needs a little escape from the craziness for lunch time JT restaurant is perfect. The owner is extremely friendly and the atmosphere is like being in someones home. The food is simple but good and inexpensive. . . along with the low key environment it is a perfect lunchtime hideaway. My co worker just showed me this place and I have been working in the neighborhood for  years and passed by it many times. . . . place has a homey feeling with colorful tables and tons of plants all around, you get the feeling that you are eating at your mom's kitchen. One side with rice is $ and two sides with rice are $. . Home cooked pork, beef and veggies that are supper tasty. The woman at the counter is super sweet and friendly. Please, support this local business. local. sfgate. com/b… Decent sized place tucked away in a small strip mall with fast food style service. You walk up to the counter and there is a variety of dishes with the option of either a  or  item combination with rice. I believe it's $ for one item and $ for two items which is a great deal in my opinion, especially compared to the ridiculous prices of other places in the area. The lady at the counter is a sweetheart. I was deciding between two entrees for a  item combo and she offered to scoop a little of my second choice in the box so I could try it. The chicken and pork adobo are delicious and full of flavor. I will definitely be back to try more. Contrary to the first review and in fairness, J T restaurant and Catering, this is not the former New Filipinas Restaurant which was owned and operated by another entity.    J T  Restaurant and Catering is now   under a totally new  owners, husband and wife team Juan and Tess, thus the letter J T stands for.   Food is presented fast food style or in Filipino,  'Turo turo ( all dishes are cooked fresh daily in the morning and afrernoons) with no short order dishes on demand unless requested in advance. J T  Restaurant and catering offers an array of authentic Filipino cuisine,  the way it is prepared in  the  Tagalog region of the islands. The cost of a combo meal is  fairly and easonably priced for the amount of food that is being served compared to most  competitors.  They also cater food for banquets and special occasion as well as office lunches. . In fairness to the establishment in reference to  the comment  made  for the         'adobo 'dish was not fairly discribed . Traditionally, the skin is cooked to add flavor to the stewed dish. , all chicken parts are usually used.  The customer may have gone at a time when certain parts were left at the time. Adobo is among the most popular among Filipino fares next  to 'Lumpia;  There are various iterations on how the dish is prepared based on what region of the islands one hails from. All dishes are prepared based on recipes from the  Manila and Northern  Southern Tagalog regions of Luzon ( The main island of the Philippine archipelago. Aside from lunch and dinner fares,  other Filipino delicacies for  'merienda' (A (afternoon snacks) such as Bibingka (Sticky Rice cake baked in caramelized sugar qith coconut milk)  Turon, ( Fried bananas in egg roll wrapper and caramelized with brown sugar) and 'Palabok' a  noodle dish with achuete sauce(, an alternative to the traditional noddle dish 'Pancit' )and of course l vegetable lumpia and Lumpiang Shanghai (cocktail sized pork lumpia with sweet and sour sauce dip). Each day two specialty measl are offered aside from the regular dishes such offered such as adobo ( Pork stewed in vinegar,soy sauce and a lot of garlic), sinigang ( pork with tamarind base flavor) fried marinated milk fish, and other standard dish popular among Filipinos. Located next to the S F Chronicle building to the left in a little mall strip. On th and MIssion walking distance from the Westfield Shopping Center.  I am a regular customer and have nothing but the satisfaction of having a taste of  'Mom's home cooked Filipino Food. I recommend you try it while shopping or visting the SOMA area. I thought I was going to New Filipinas but was surprised to find something in it's place.  Still Filipino food and still being run by someone named Tess makes me think they just changed names.  What I got was definitely not worth $ (the lunch combo is usually $.  but she didn't bother giving me all my change).  The Chicken Adobo was all dark meat; a bunch of broken, boiled chicken legs with the slimy skin still on.  The sauce was like a watered down, bland brown gravy.  Thankfully, lumpia can never be too bad."
Los Guanacos|4.0|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|33|-1|4.0| Very delicious expect to wait  minutes handmade! best tip order in advance and get there on time there is only one lady making them fresh per table so they will take a while but worth waiting for. Especially when you have more the two people with you.  You each would order two of them each.  Best every time. Always come here when my girlfriend gets her nails done at Molly's. So it's me and my  year old love the pupusas and the ensalda drink. The customer service is nice and restaurant is always clean. I lwould recommend the zucchini pupusas, yuca frita, and horchata. I love this place. I always order the pupusas over the phone but yesterday I decide to dine in with my wife and son. It took the waitress about  minutes to bring menus and another  minutes to take our order. Then my wife notice that the waitress was helping put the order to go right after she had handed cash without washing her hand. After about   minutes we got our food. The pupusas were decent, not as good as before. But my wife stake with onions was terrible. it smell like the meat was starting to go bad and it taste weird. I know that the economy is hitting everyone equally but some of this place cut too many corners and it's a shame because I'll never go back to Los Guanacos. If you happen to read this, please wash your hand after you have touch money and for haven sake throw away bad meat. You can get in a lot of trouble serving bad meat. I did not said anything because the place was starting to get busy. But you just loose another customer. Stopped here for lunch while visting friends. We needed a place within walking distance, and Los Guanacos came up on yelp. Staff was was very friendly and accommodating to the pair of not quite  year olds with us. We got the jalapeno, zucchini, and the bean papusas, and all three were delicious! The quesadillas were quite good. If you love gooey cheese, this place is for you! The guac was fresh and yummy too. Decor is nothing fancy, but it's the food that counts.
Palacio Latino|4.0|Latin American in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|24|-1|4.3| Im so sad this place closed . If anyone find out where the open up again let me know. Great restaurant for authentic Guatemalan and Central American cuisine. The staff are super friendly. My Guatemalan boyfriend likes the food here and he's a chef. Old school, humble eatery catering to guatemaltecos and such. I ordered the much lauded sopa de gallina. They braise the hen leg to extract flavor then roast it. Felt like a crisp morning in Xela. Nothing extraordinary but simple and satisfying. Next time I'll come in more hungover for maximum enjoyment. I love the Guatemalan options on the menu. The Taquitos Chapines are amazing, if you like Latino food that is not spicy then you should try it. Wanted to try the Chiles Rellenos  but they said they ran out of it so had the House fajita which wasn't bad, not the best but it was nice to try it. Its a good place. Even the speciality is all Latin food the greatest is all from Guatemala. The best thing there is the staff. If you go there, Evelyn can help you to find a really good taste from Latin food. Enjoy and take care of the chilli. I think I need to come back to this place. Why? Read on. I had the atol de elote and loved it. Never had such a great tasting atol since the last time I was in Guatemala. It was so good it tasted just how my aunt in Guatemala makes it. Oh the memories. . . . . anywho. . I loved it so much I was determined to make it at home since I live far from el palacio Latino (sad story). I went home, I searched a recipe online and everything, from a legit Guatemalan recipe blog mind you. End results? You don't wanna know. . let's just say I need come back to el palacio Latino ;) Atole de Alote, the corn soup/drink is awesome especially on a cold winters day or evening, I have been coming here for over  years. The owners and employees are very respectful. They have pupusas, tamales, and various other variety of Guatemalan food. We go to San Francisco specifically for there food. I had the rellonitos tonight and they were perfect. Sheer hospitality: that's what these kind folks offer to their customers. I organized a meeting for  people here yesterday, and not a moment was lost in making sure my group got seated quickly and comfortably, with tables specially arranged off the cuff. Several factors could have made it more difficult, including the rainy weather, the date happening to be Easter Sunday by chance, and many other locations nearby being closed in result  all of which could have made reserving  seats a hassle. Quite the contrary here! There was a gracious man outside, umbrella in hand, amicably ushering in people from the wet atmosphere on Mission Street's exteriors. Good signs from the get go!Most of us ordered at least a small dish, but our primary goal was to discuss business matters over light food. I remember ordering their Longanizas (Guatemalan pork sausages), which were served over a bunch of lettuce and tomatoes, with rice and beans, plus a horchata beverage. It did exactly what I was hoping for  filled me up without getting over stuffed, and the consumption process did not itself consume the business meeting, which was quite the success!Also, if you're wise with the menu, your individual meal can be under $!Got a tad loud by the end, but with so many people enjoying the holiday with eventual live music, how can one not continue to smile? : ) I never tried this corn soup before, it was sweet and creamy! I loved it! Absolutely a must try, there was a long line for and for good reason. I chased that delicious soup with a sugar cookie and it was a experience  must have  in the mission. Jaslene what is my server and she was extremely nice : ) My friend and I discovered this place a few years ago. We were so in love the first time, we vowed to go back again and again. The burritos are pretty damn good. I always get the vegetarian burrito for $. . The sauce totally makes it. And I like how they melt the cheese right into the tortilla. Yum. But they also have a wide variety of guatemalan dishes too. Make sure you save room and grab a cup of one their hot drinks to go at the end of your meal. The rice one is my favorite, but the corn one is delicious too. You really can't go wrong either way. And if you're like my friend, you can opt to get a gigantor container of one to take home. . . or both. Oh, and the horchata is so good, you could drink  like  or  glasses. It's the kind of drink that's so tasty, you just want a constant flow of it into your mouth the entire time you're sitting there.
