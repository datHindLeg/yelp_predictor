These are SQL scripts for my own purposes (used to debug scraping process), linked here for convenience.

Some SQL scripts to load data into Microsoft Sql Server. Opening csv files for this project will
not work in Excel and tarditional csv software, as they limit the characters per cell.

Download Microsoft Sql Server, run the make_table.sql script, and then run import_csv.script.
You will need to change the directory path for import_csv.script.

If you are looking to just view tabular data and don't need the whole review_text string enumerated,
just use PANDAS.
