Some SQL scripts to load data into Microsoft Sql Server. Opening csv files for this project will
not work in Excel and tarditional csv software, as they limit the characters per cell.

Download Microsoft Sql Server, run the make_table.sql script, and then run import_csv.script.
You will need to change the directory path for import_csv.script.

You might want to just try loading the csv in PANDAS. I don't think they have cell limits. That 
would be easier.
