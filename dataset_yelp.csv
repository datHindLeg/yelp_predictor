Chico’s Pizza 0|3.5|Pizza in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|192|0|3.3548387096774195|" Delivery guys are THE nicest I've had in the entire city. Food is good, prices are cheap, delivery is fairly quick. the wings, is on point! addicting!!!! Delicious, fast, and friendly. Pizza, salad, and garlic bread were all wonderful. The perfect alternative to room service! I thought Fat Slice in Berkeley or Nazarrios in the Castro was good, but OMG if you want a fresh pizza by the slice, without paying an arm and a leg for it (combo slice $3.50), come here. The slices are thick and nicely topped. Yum This place is literally the worst. I ordered a sandwich and a side of cheesy bread and they gave me an estimate of 45 minute wait time. After an hour passed, I called to see if my order would be here soon and the guy on the phone said the driver was a couple of minutes away.After another 15 minutes passed I called again and he said the driver was down stairs. 10 minutes later, the doorbell rang and the driver was there with my food. I open it up, and SHOCK, my food is cold and stale. I take a bite of the sandwich to see if its any better than the bread which you can see right off the bat is disgusting and it was just as bad.I call the restaurant and ask them to refund the food, and he says he can only refund it if it is untouched.I was shocked! I had just waited TWICE as long as they had told me, and then they brought me ice cold and stale food and refused to refund it since I had tried it.DO NOT EAT HERE!!! Delivery was a little shady... Guy in unmarked SUV. But what else do you expect when you order a pizza at midnight? Pizza itself wasn't bad... But not something we would eat sober.... Nonetheless a medium veggie pizza was $16.86 - that includes free delivery. Chico!!! Late night pizza up in the TL! It was pretty good taste wise but it's just a normal pizza. Quality is on the low end but decent food. Don't be out too late and just deliver man. We stayed at a Hotel and had delivery from this place. They delivered in 30 minutes as promised right to our hotel room. The pizza was average and crust had cardboard texture. I won't recommend based about the crust. $4 for a slice of cheese and a can of coke. You really can't beat that when you're craving something greasy and quick. A drunk homeless guy came in and bothered me while I ate asking for money, so I probably won't come back to sit down, but I'll definitely order something for delivery. This used to be one of my favorite pizza spots. They knew my address and everything. Tonight I called for a pizza. One hour later I called again, but no one picked up. Then I called 5 more times to try to reach someone 20 minutes later. Finally, someone picked up and told me my order wasn't taken. Pretty terrible service if they can't take orders into account. Never depend on their service. That's all I say. This place is terrible. Food is not even ""just okay"" and the service is phenomenally dumpy. Add an hour to the estimated delivery time too. I heard they had a serious rat problem too, and the owner cant read well. Uhmm, nothing much. I only ordered from this place because first We were very hungry, pizza place near home and it was a deal of 2 pizzas plus coke for twenty something dollars. We ordered and the phone guy said that would take 40 minutes to one hour delivery. Okay, past 1:10 and I think they forgot to make the order, so I talked to the phone guy and he said pay only $20, the pizza will be deliver in 20minutes. Okay, the pepperoni pizza is okay, very cheesy (good), little pepperoni and thick crust (don't like). I loved the great pizza and delicious buffalo wings !!!!! I was at work and ordered for delivery. Delivery person very good service and over the phone they where very helpful thank you Chicos !!!! Next time I think of pizza at work will think of Chicos Pizza was really good every time I order from them i order a small veggie pizza and it be great an there open late! Pizza which was so awesome to have and very perfect to think that this is one of the busy pizza servicing place. It was friendly experience at this loction for some great and awesome setting as well.The charge is fair and very great here.Would you like to be the place but I will be here. They were on time, pizza was still warm and delicious. Hand tossed pizza that reminds me of my favorite pizza place from my hometown.  Have a few pizza places in my neighborhood, but found my new go-to :) seriously?? an hour and a half for delivery? 45 min late??? and rude on the phone!! never again. Had a late night craving and this place hit the spot. Cheap and tasty! Delivered at estimated time and delivery person was in and out. This is my go to pizza spot whenever I'm wanting some. They also have fast delivery, great service and very reasonable prices. When every other locally owned pizza place is over charging you because you're in San Francisco, make sure to get Chico's. You won't find better pizza at their great prices. Definitely recommend. Awesome pizza.  Awesome price.  Well rounded deal. Don't let the neighborhood scare you away. Rather than contribute, I normally only consume information on Yelp. But, I had to brush the dust off my keyboard for this place. I was in San Francisco for the MacIT conference, and ate Chico's 3 times. The service was wonderful, the delivery guys were quick and friendly, and the Pizza was Awesome. Thick crust, lots of cheese, and they don't hold back on toppings.I walked by the storefront one night on the way to a conference event, and it is in a very sketchy area of the city. Do yourself a favor and get it delivered. Found them on Eat24, this is now my ""regular"" place for pizza. Good portions and fresh ingredients... no fake Italian sausage.  Their prices is the best part!  I'm a satisfied customer.  Thank you! I hate walking here but their pizza is so good and the walk from my bfs house isn't far. Anyway, their pizza. Loooooove it. So good so cheesy!!! I love how the bread-sauce-cheese ratio is so balanced. My bf said they had a price increase but so we don't go as much but when we do, it's so worth it. ""Perfect drunk food"" is a phrase we often use for Chico's slices.Hot slices, large toppings, cheap prices - one of the best simple slice joints in my hometown. We ordered online and they have taken an hour and a half. We still havent received our food. I called in a half an hour ago and they said it would be 10 to 15 minutes. I would NOT recommend this restaurant. I really enjoyed this pizza. Good flavor. Good chew to the crust. Good smell. And the price was right. Great jorb. For what it is Chico's is great. They make a great simple pizza, if you want bone marrow I think you should look elsewhere but if you want a basic pizza with sausage and pepperoni this is the spot. The neighborhood isn't great, call in your order if you want a whole pizza this is not the place you want to stand around at for 20 minutes. And be ready for random people on the street to ask you for a slice on your walk home or car. The pizza is what I am used to from the midwest, not fancy but good. Lots of cheese and toppings and a low amount of sauce compared to most pizza places in SF. The crust/dough isn't to die for but it's decent. Overall this is a superb late night pizza to go place. Three stars because the pizza is good. But it takes forever! I live a littleOver 4 blocks away and it's been over 80 minutes. That is ridiculous. Crust is very good. Wings are pretty good but stick to the foil too much. Definite room to improve on delivery times.Edit. 1 star. I called to ask where the pizza was and they didn't seem to care. ZERO STARS!!!!!!!!!!! Terrible service! Over an HOUR late. Pizza was cold and I refused it. Driver was so angry. He called my cell and left a message filled with profanity. I will continue to tell me friends about the terrible ETA and customer service. Don't get me wrong, the little slice of crackdown that Chico's located in is and has been my home for sometime. Chico's though..it tastes like the cheese is plastic based. Enough said. Go to tulan. This place kinda grew on me.Had a friend back in '08 who introduced me to Chico's. At first for some reason, wasn't very impressed. It was okay the first time I tried it but nothing special.Tonight I just ordered an extra large pepperoni for my roommate and I,and gotta say it's really hitting the spot. Got here very fast...The dough tastes kinda odd/interesting at first(kinda soggy yet crispy? lol) but it's not bad combining  it with the consistancy of the sauce they use which is actually pretty good. The quality tastes kinda like Cybelle's but maybe a little better. Not the best I've ever had but definitely good for those  late night munchies. Excellent fast delivery(although personally I wouldn't ever go there..6th street not my favorite part of town)..I would order from here again."|4|86|0|Routine Inspection|This inspection has no violations.|GOOD: no inspection needed
Chico’s Pizza 1|3.5|Pizza in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|192|1|4.0|" Do you remember the end of ""The Blair Witch Project"" when the pushy girl keeps screaming and follows Mike downstairs. Then we see Mike standing in the corner, and she drops her camera and it keeps rolling. Remember that classic freak-out scene? I think that would be a typical evening at Chico's Pizza, only nobody would pay attention since you're more than likely to hear somebody screaming on that adventuresome block of 6th Street anyway. I guess I must be Mike in this allegory since I took my life into my own hands, walked briskly from Mission and decided to get a $5 slice of anything. I pointed at the Pepperoni Pizza (photo: bit.ly/1bdF0Ow) and smiled nervously, even though the staff here is amazingly cordial.What I thought was semi-amusing is that I didn't ask for it to go, but they packaged it up in a box anyway figuring I wanted to get the hell out of Dodge. No, I like to live on the edge and decided to eat it at the empty counter toward the back wall. That was me standing in the corner. Did the Blair Witch possess me and make me wait to be murdered? Not really. The pizza was searingly hot and pretty good really. Thin crust, plenty of pepperoni and cheese. Four-star good? Well, I wouldn't go that far, a tad greasy for my faux-epicurean taste, but kudos to the server who gave me an extra half-slice (photo: bit.ly/15VeFAI). But of course, that meant I had to stand in the corner that much longer. Will this movie never end? (cue for a high-pitched movie scream) Oh wait, was that me?FOOD - 3 stars...generous slices, kinda greasy but you can't beat the priceAMBIANCE - 1.5 stars...you're kidding, right?SERVICE - 4 stars...courageously great attitudes from the staffTOTAL - 3 stars...run, Ed, run! It's a small spot without much room, but it's worth a visit.They sell by the slice (which really appeals to me since that's the Jersey way) or by the pie, so you can get dinner to go or just have a snack while walking down the street.The fellow behind the counter was friendly and the service was quick.  I had the combination pizza and really enjoyed it.  Being from the Northeast, I tend to prefer thin crust so I can fold my slice in half, but this slightly thicker crust was tasty.  The fellow described it as Chicago Style, but I would put it closer to a Chicago / New York fusion.If you're walking down the street and need a bite to eat, I suggest stopping in for a slice. Facts are: I'm lazy. I work late at night. Same with the boyfriend. So we have often settled for mediocre late-night delivery places because we get home after 2am, and if there's nothing in the fridge, what else can you do?But Chico's! I'm not sure when exactly they started appearing on my options for Eat24, but it has changed our lives. We are happier, kinder to each other, better-looking, and our libidos are out of control!... I mean -- this place is magic.The pizza is excellent. Their sandwiches are delicious and piled HIGH with everything you want (particularly the Big Daddy sandwich - omnomnom). They have Snapple. They are incredibly obliging about special requests. Sometimes they run out of the Snapple you asked for, but what does Fernando (the most wonderful delivery guy EVER) do? He apologizes for the lack of, say, Peach Snapple, and presents you with a *BAG* of ice cold drinks to choose from. Actually, I assumed he was ""Chico"" himself until I asked his name last night, just because his customer service is outstanding and he truly seems to appreciate our patronage in a way that you generally only get from an owner or manager.Love this place. Fast delivery very good sandwiches (( pizza yummy )) I love this place (: Ordered the Calif Pizza, great but would have been 5 stars if they had remembered the mushrooms I ordered on the pizza. Salads were fresh and tasty. We got delivery and the order showed up on time which is great.   But everythinh was room temperature and they forgot all the extras. Major bummer. You only have one chance to make a first impression. I ate there the best cheeseburger in SF i'd love to go back there again..very nice stuff and very clean kitchen which is not usual for Tenderloin area... These guys are awesomely fast for delivery.  Even their basic cheese pizza does it for me.  Very well priced, friendly and very accommodating. Definitely, suggest for a busy parents with 2 crazed children seeking pizza.  They are my kid's favs. I grew up in the neighborhood so this was the only pizza place around. For a $3 slice of pizza it's really not that bad! Not too thin, not too much sauce, and just enough cheese. I love their sandwiches though! And they open until 2am on weekends for the drunkies. The only reason why I gave them 4 stars is because there's a lot of crack heads and bums in the area, but that's nothing new on sixth street! After I left Mezzanine around 1ish, everybody was kind of marching down the alley like Zombies... turn the corner and march down 6th the street past Monarch and people are going into Chico's, so I'm like, yeah, I'll go. It's 24/7, which is great... because I. WAS. HUNGRY!!!!!!!!!  I was pissed off because 3 guys walking in before me and one of them was one of those indecisive mofos that sits there going ""uuuuuhhhhh... ummm..."" for like 10 minutes. So his friends ordered real quick. This gave me time to decide want I wanted: Pepperoni, and the Supreme one with bell peppers sausage, pepperoni, and all that. So Now I'm hungry and even this guy's friends are like ""Come one man just decide...."" and the two guys behind the counter are like ""Just decide.... please we have other customers waiting..."" So finally it was my turn and I ordered and I got the pizza slices (which are huge by the way), and a Snapple.I like the fact all the drinks are in the fridge and they are ICE COLD.  It came out to a little under $10, so the young man said, I' going to add the $23 cents to make it an even $10. At first I was ""Huh?"", but then I was like whatever... plus I understand and most places have limits anyways... and businesses get charged for every card transaction so...whatever.  If that bothers you, pay cash. :) But I brought $4 with me on this whole trip, lol. The pizza was hot and I could've even stayed to eat and watch tv on a booth but I just decided to take my food and enjoy it in my room across the street. :)It came in a cute little pizza box and when I got back to my room and sat on the bed and ate that pizza, and drank that ice cold Snapple I was in heaven. The cheese was very gooey and good. It is not the healthiest... I mean it is pizza! But it really hit the spot, so thank you Chico's pizza. And... why are people complaining about the neighborhood. I'm getting tired of it on every page that belongs to a SOMA business. Ok... the Tenderloin is close by; there are homeless people in every state in every city. They never bother me or even beg. Get over yourselves please... They added extra mozzarella cheese on my slice of pepperoni :DThe only con is that the bathroom is yucky because Chico's seems to be an establishment oft visited by homeless folk. LOVE LOVE LOVE! I've been in SF for a year now, and have continuously been unimpressed with the pizza I've tried. That has just changed! Chico's Pizza has fantastic crust, they overload their pizza with tons of fresh cheese and delicious toppings (finally, a place that doesn't skimp) and the guys who work there are super friendly! I wish I had known about this place sooner. Don't judge this establishment on it's location. It's not that bad, and once you've tasted that slice of heaven, you'll know it was so worth it :) This is the best pizza place in the soma that i have ordered from. These guys are fast. I ordered online and they had my pizza here in less then 20 mins from 2 blocks away. They have much better pricing then most other places. All the different types of pizza cost the same no matter which one you order. Adding toppings cost extra like normal. The pizza is good and hot. I have ordered from other places that the pizza didn't taste good. I used to order from SF Pizza. SF Pizza was 1 block away and took almost an hour. Chicos is 2 blocks away and took under 20 mins.  Highly recommended. I haven't been inside but i do order take out. It's nice to see the history Chico's has with the community posted on their walls (yes, including the surveillance camera photo of Jay Leno! LOL) . Whether your eating it for lunch, dinner, or a highly focused sober session; This is the place to be! to all the people complaining about ambience: it's at 6th and mission. what did you expect? gary danko?the pizza here is AMAZING. they're open late, so i like to stop there on my way back from a night out. they have the best veggie slice in sf. veggie is my faaaavorite, and they do it well. the crust is great, and they have all the stuff i like on it. they're one of the few places that has figured out how to put fresh tomatoes on a pizza without making it soggy.i've never had delivery, but i've heard that this is one of the few places that will deliver to treasure island, which is convenient if you live out there.the only thing is...yeah, it's at 6th and mission. there are some interesting characters there. i only go after dark if i'm with people, or able to park right out front. but there's nothing the restaurant can do about the people on the street. The absolute BEST BBQ Chicken Pizza ever!!! It's not on the menu, it's a hidden treasure, so just ask for it!!!!"|4|87|3|Routine| Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 8/14/2014 ] Moderate risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 8/14/2014 ] Unclean hands or improper use of gloves  [ date violation corrected: 10/1/2013 ]|GOOD: no inspection needed
Chico’s Pizza 2|3.5|Pizza in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|192|2|3.1666666666666665| With a living social deal, 3 slices are $10. The crust was crisp and the service was fast. In a sketchy area though its worth a try. Stopped in on Saturday November 10th, 2012 before the Red Bull event. Ordered the $5 slice and drink combo. The pesto slice was a cheese slice that was already made - and then had the toppings added to it when you ordered and then recooked in the oven before being served.As I attempted to eat the slice - one of the most disgusting homeless people I have ever seen in my life with no shoes on entered the facility and stood next to me. I nearly threw up - and walked out unable to finish the 1/2 of slice that was left. Overall, this might have been one of the worse slices of pizza I have ever ate in my life and I doubt I will ever be back. The best pizza in SOMA - i just get cheese & pineapple, but the crust is phe-nom nom nom-enal. & a large single topping for just $10 AND free delivery?! Chico has got my back - thanks Cheeks! Ordered an XL cheese from Eat24 at 11:30PM on a Monday night.  Arrived at 12:40AM.  Literally**the worst**pizza I have ever eaten.  the cheese inspired product masquerading as dairy is this dry, salty, unmelted (unmeltable?) substance, which retains the outlines of each and every shredded piece.  I seriously question whether there is any real food, anything that once came in a package with nutrition facts on it, anywhere in this absolute f*cking sacrilege of a pizza.  Half-eaten Chuckie Cheese pizza left on a toddler spit-covered table for four hours would be cuisine up against this nonsense.  The wet tasteless in-flight circular sodium nugget, served  on an off-season red eye TWA flight to Orlando just before the company went belly up, would be a marked improvement.  I would rather get hepatitis than eat this sh*t again.  Am I getting through to you?  Chico's, you should be so, so ashamed of yourself.  Whoever made this should be fired and dragged by an angry mob to Times Square for a public execution./spitsoh, and it was cold. HANDS DOWN, BEST PIZZA BY THE SLICE IN SF!!!  I have been a fan of this place for over 10 years even back when they were located on Mission street.  I believe that they might have changed owners since then but the quality of the pizza remains the same.  I always order the Vegetarian with grilled chicken stripes.  They never skimp on the chicken and they slice is so massive that one slice is always enough.  A slice of pizza with a drink is less than $5.  Yes, the location is in a very sketchy neighborhood,  so I never come alone.   However, every time I bring someone new to this place, they are always impress with the pizza. I don't know why I have waited do long to write a review for Chico's Pizza but here it is.The food itself is fantastic to say the least. The pizza is nicely priced and the size is very fair. The toppings are great. You get big chunks of veggies and sausage, and the cheese runneth over... it's perfect! They also have some side options like chicken, bread and salad with some desert options but I rarely get anything other than the pizza. As soon as you walk through the door the pies are on display for all to see and smell and I love it! The only reason this place gets such an okay score from me is because of the location. It is in the tenderloin district and in the middle of several back alleys and single occupancy rooms. You see all types there! Even though the service is great, the people are friendly I wouldn't linger at this establishment because I have been going here for about 5 years and it never fails, I can never get done with my slice before someone comes and asks me for change.But i digress, don't let that stop you from eating some awesome pizza|4|87|3|Routine| Unauthorized or unsafe use of time as a public health control measure  [ date violation corrected: 10/1/2013 ] Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 10/1/2013 ] Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities  [ date violation corrected: 12/28/2012 ]|GOOD: no inspection needed
Chico’s Pizza 3|3.5|Pizza in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|192|3|3.5968992248062017|" This pizza was awesome ate there 3 times in three nights. Dudes were awesome good prices and slices were so big had to cut into half. Got pizza delivered to our hotel for a quick bite before we all headed out to the clubs. The pizza here is okay. Not the best, but not the worst. The thickness of the pizza was good and it was crispy. We got the cheese, supreme and pesto chicken. I liked the cheese the most, because it had a good consistency of cheese to sauce. Overall, the pizza was decent. I'd order from here again. The regular pizza was too doughey/sweet for my tastes. Sauce had potential, but needed more. Kind of like Papa Johns. Nice delivery guy - a real booster of the organization. Really want to try the thin crust next time. Have faith it will be improved. Good prices, decent pizza.Not a huge fan of the dough they use here. In my experience, the crust has always had a good crunch on the outside and was really soft and airy on the inside. However, i'm choosing to use 'airy' to also describe the fact that the crust actually tastes like air. Not much flavor at all. The stuff on the top was yummy, though.The 6th Street Crackheads™ don't really help raise the rating for this place, either. chico special and pesto special are both pretty good. the neighborhood definitely really sucks and takes it down a star. =/ I used to live in the scary residential motel right next door, and I ate here every day. I have since lived in Sacramento, Los Angeles, Humboldt, Shasta, and Ventura Counties, and I still crave Chico's! That makes Chico's the tastiest and best deal on pizza in the state! Chico's Special: a LARGE combination pizza style for just $3.00 Fresh, delicious, and cheap pizza -- just the kind you search for in these hole-in-walls! Staff is very friendly as they are working late hours. Plus: free ranch, can't argue with that. Although the pizza was decent by the slice, I am not recommending you ever come here. This is 6th Street and this place was swarming with crackheads at 2:30 a.m. This place is so real, you should really stay away. After leaving a downtown club and parking on 6th Street, we headed back to the car when our french guests were hungry.  I really didn't want to go in, but we did. There was a line, but all you need to do to get service is act like a fool. They shuffled two customers through the line before us, so we let them go. This guy was short .50, so we took care of that too. He walks outside and two seconds later is back in and done with his pizza. One of my friends made the remark that he must have been hungry. That's when he mentions that he had not eaten in days and shared the slice with two other guys. My friend felt bad for him and gave him $5 for another slice and a drink. After we left, my friends were left with the feeling that we left ""New Jack City"".  I was pretty embarrassed to have brought them here, but they wanted to go. The pizza just aint worth the effort, unless you enjoy the entertainment. The pizza was tasty and had a perfect crispy crust.  Also, a large is HUGE and much cheaper than other pizza places. Perfect for late night delivery... although one star off for coming a whole hour later... I live like 8 blocks away! - 2.5 Stars - Tip - Leave your valuables at home and bring cash.  Chico's was a block from the hotel and my friend and I wanted to put some heavy food in the stomach before a concert at the Warfield and a night of excessive drinking.  $3 pepperoni slice - Neither NY or Chicago style, more of a Costco-esque crust with decent flavor and texture.  The pizza itself was okay, possibly warranting three stars.  However, I probably would not return, as much because of the shady ass people lurking around this establishment.  6th and Mission is intense. This pizza is just so tasty and fresh off the grill. I ordered the veggie and it was amazing! Chico's is my favorite pizza in SF. If you are willing to brave 6'th street and the clientele that it brings, you will not be sorry for trying Chico's. Staff is friendly and recognizes me every time. Slices come out fast and hot, with the crust just the slightest bit doughy. Great prices. I'm basing this review on a turkey sandwich, which all things in life should be measured by anyway.Turkey sandwich was really good. It's warm and toasted, had layers and layers of turkey, and doused in flavorful sauce. Plus, it was only $5. Worth it.I've had pizza from here before, too, and was thoroughly satisfied from it. I'm not a pizza connoisseur, so I can't say it was the best or worst pizza out there, but it was definitely good and didn't dissuade me from returning to get more. I can't really describe how the pizza tasted (guess it wasn't memorable), so my 4/5 is pretty much about the turkey sandwich. I called up for delivery, and was impressed how quickly the pizza arrived. I was even more impressed with the pizza! My new favorite delivery place. Note to self: Next time, don't eat an entire med. pizza all by yourself! For me, the standard at which all other pizza is measured.  Keep it simple and go with their sausage pizza.  I still remember my first bite of their pizza 10+ years ago and it still tastes just as good every time.  A San Francisco institution and I hope it never changes. Sixth and Mission is not really a place you should consider as a late night destination (unless your late night plans involve crack and street hookers). If you do end up in the area though (mistakes happen) and you want hot, cheap, greasy pizza, Chico's is there for you. The staff is nice, they stay open late, and the slices are big enough that I can get stuffed off just two of them. Is it stellar pizza? No. Will your arteries thank you? No. Is it still a great value at a low cost? Hell yes! Even though Chico's can still be enjoyed sober, all of the above make it quintessential drunk food. Let's face it, if you can stomach making the walk to Chico's, you'll probably enjoy stomaching some of their pizza. First time ordering today - did it online - pretty easy. But that's when the ease stopped.I ordered mild wings, a large pizza and a 2 liter of diet coke.Food came cold. Wings were very hot (spice)Pizza was OK - not great, but OK (after heating it up in the microwave) Wings were NOT GOOD.The diet coke was was actually a regular pepsi when it arrived. I told the delivery guy that and his response was SORRY. Called the store and let them know that they should fix the website to show pepsi instead of coke - person I spoke to clearly could care less...Won't be back.... Friend Janis took me here and I've been hook ever since. I make a point to come out here when Im in the city. The big plus is that I dont eat pork so the pepperoni is actually beef.. So that the kicker!.. We ordered a large simple pizza with mushrooms and olives and I believe it cost around $15 even with delivery. So it was cheap and it was good for being cheap. The pizza was not too greasy and clean-tasting. I liked the oregano and garlic flavors. It was also filling so it was a value for the money. Tried a slice of  their supreme pizza today. Yum.$3.50 for loads of toppings on a thick, huge slice. Definitely not New York Style but not Chicago either. Just thick, rib-stickin' pizza.The pizzas were all under lamps and they toasted it up in the oven when I ordered. It still tasted fresh to me.It's in a crap area so I wouldn't recommend going there after dark but if you find yourself in the area under sunlight it's a great alternative to braving the neighboring shady convenience stores. I am not usually a very picky or overly critical person for pizza, but I have to draw the line with Chico's.I spent today probably 45 minutes going through Yelp trying to decide on a good tasty pizza joint around the soma/mission street area for super bowl sunday.  I concluded on Chico's as the reviews were decent and nothing popped out to say they were a low class pizza spot.  Boy was I ever wrong.The pizza dough was horribly dense and soggy, completely taking over the taste of the rest of the pizza.  And the cheese was absolutely disgusting, I'm pretty sure it was some sort of nasty processed cheese.  I mean when I took bites of a slice the cheese didn't even get stringy like normal pizza does it just broke off in clumps.  Sick.Never in my 30 years of eating pizza have I actually thrown a whole pizza away in the trash after one slice.  This was disgusting and I would of had a better experience at Domino's or Pizza Hut.Beware of Chico's Pizza! We had a get together at my friend's place down in SOMA and it was 12 in the morning. Lucky us we had Chico's to save us.We had a Extra Large Pizza and it fed 8 hungry drunk people.WIN! Chico's pizza is not terrible but the clientele is. (You may count me in that number if you desire) It's a decent, yeasty crust with very passable sauce and (to my knowledge) real Mozzarella. I stop by sometimes because of all the restaurants in the  area, save Tu Lan, Chico's is consistent, neighborly (and if they can be that they have my respect) and they serve it up fast and hot.If you can stomach sixth street, you can stomach Chico's. Great food, very bad at quoting a delivery time.  My 30 min quote was 1 1/2 hrs.  I had to call several times to find out where my food was. Meat calzones are good. Was my favorite neighborhood pizza spot. Wow haha I ordered a calzone and a two liter coke easy order right what would you expect 45mins to an hour delivery? Wrong! How about two hours! Though the food was good the delivery was just unacceptable. Great pizza. As others have mentioned, this joint is in the middle of the ghetto and these guys deserve a medal of honor just for the trash and bull they put up with on a daily basis. But aside from that. the pizza is very good, good sauce n good taste. Yum. I used to be excited about this place, now..... meh?The last three times I ordered for delivery here, there have been problems.1) I asked for a large combo with no onions and there were onions on it.2) See number one.3) Last night I ordered a large 1/2 cheese 1/2 pepperoni and mushroom, three pieces of cheesecake, a 2 liter root beer, and a caesar salad. They said it would be 45-60 min. an hour and twenty minutes later, I called. ""Be there in 5-10 min"" I get in reply. Another 20 minutes later, I am litterally picking up my phone to cancel the order and it starts to ring with the pizza. About an hour late and no courtesey call. I had to hunt them down to get information. No discount or ""sorry"" even.Screw this, I'm calling a different pizza place.Oh yeah, and if you walk in, watch out for the crack-heads! YIPES! Pizza tasted good. Crust had a nice crispy bottom and a not too doughy top. I would've preferred more sauce. Garlic bread was surprisingly pretty good! Fluffy bread, crisp crust. More garlic flavor would've been preferred.The grease was overpowering though and hurt my stomach later. Hence, 2 stars. Saturday night is usually a busy night, this I understand, however my brief experience this weekend was far more frustrating than it could have been. I called Chico's from Yerba Buena island and asked for a delivery to which they replied, ""Please call back at 8pm."". That was all they had to say.  So, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and called back at 8pm, 2 hours later. Thankfully the friends I was with had some snacks.  The same Chico's employee answered the phone, somehow immediately recognized my number and told me they were not delivering to the island any longer that night.  I guess that was all he had to tell me so he hung up. I've heard that their calzones are great, just not on Saturday nights when you're on the island.  They could have been pleasant about their busy night, but just didn't care. Is this the last place in SF with a $2 cheese slice? Nothing fancy going on here, just some old Joe Montana posters and cheap pizza. Bonus points for having a customer bathroom so you don't have to witness the bum sex going on in the alleys. Can't beat it for pizza! I never cared for a classy pizza joint... pizza's the food of the proletariat! and what better place for it than in a shit ass crack ghetto surrounded by (street) hookers, addicts, dealers, and the mentally ill? Word. Best cheese ever.trans firendly- yeeeeeea? the employees were great!  the clientelle and neighborhood no, not at all. there are some ts street hookers around too. keep your fucking guard up mija. Wow. My choices for a quick, cheap lunch were: Chico's Pizza and some sandwich place that purportedly caused one of it's customers to have a mid-meal seizure. I went with the veggie pizza because mystery veggies strike me as far less threatening than mystery meats. It was thick, bready, and had been sitting there for who knows how long.  The guy behind the counter was nice enough to heat it up before giving it to me, but it was still pretty awful. It pretty much lived up to my expectations. I KNEW KNEW KNEW that a greasy pizza (greazza) was likely not to be up to the standards of a serious pizza snob. But hey, I wanted to be one of the boys, it was my first lunch out on the job, and I was nervous.  Cut me some slack.Next time I'll sample the seizure sando. Great prices, huge slices, and the garlic bread is amazing. Best of all you get to experience the 6th street crazies while you wait. I have been coming to Chico's for the better part of 3 years and I am still in love with their pizza. The first time I had my Chico's cherry popped I ordered 2 slices of pizza thinking I could easily demolish them both. Boy was I mistaken.I always order their combo pizza. Thick, chewy crust that has the perfect crunch to it, packed with toppings perfectly made. The only other pizzeria that stands a chance is Amicis... but when you factor in price and service Chico's reigns supreme.Chico's Pizza resides in a somewhat sketch neighborhood on 6th street between Mission and Howard. Prepare to be asked for change and cigarettes constantly. Some people use this street as their personal toilet, beware. To me, dodging pee puddles and crack fiends only makes my pizza taste better. 5 stars! Alright, as a recent newcomer to Sixth Street, I'm ok with Chico's.It's nothing special mind you, pizza wise - it's pretty ok pizza, but nothing at all special.  It's middle of the road, 2 1/2 star pizza.   It's quick, it's clean and it's cheap.  But the guys are really nice - the service is always pretty good and they do it with a smile and politeness.  Considering the crowd they deal with day to day, they probably deserve all three stars just for the service. Without a question, best pizza by the slice in San Francisco.  Pepperoni.  It tastes different when you get it delivered.  Not in a bad way.  Just different. Chicos has a thin slice, when bitten, crunches gently beneath a thick but delicate layer of cheese. The slices are huge but by far manageable. The flavor of their sauce, exceptional; zesty. Almost a 5 star pizza but nonetheless perfect. The place is in a rough area of soma, nom with caution and stuff. I didn't think it was possible for me to hate pizza until I ate here. Really, really gross.(Too bad Split Pea Seduction across the street was closed. That place is bomb!) Best inexpensive delivery Pizza in downtown SF Sketchy neighborhood aside, I had probably the worst slice of pizza ever in SF at Chico's! The crust was oily like it was fried and the dough on parts of the slice was not cooked all the way. Who wants to eat raw pizza dough? Gross. i dunno wtf other ppl are talkin about. acidic sauce, or too thick crust or some shit.CHICOS is LEGIT. Chico's is the Blondie's of the SOMA. This place is bomb and their calzones are to DIE FOR.ppl comin here at 1 am and complaining about RANDOM ASS SHIT dunno wtf they're talkin about. you don't fault this place for it's location, you're supposed to give it ALL THE MORE cred. at least they stay OPEN as late as they do round here, which says they put up with a lot of mad crazy bullshit just so you can have a late night slice. now THAT'S dedication and service. this place brings it hard AND the service is boss. i love cheeseboard in Berkeley (arizmendi if ur in SF or o-town), blondie's, nizario's, and escape from new york.they heat up every slice when you order it so it's nice, hot, and crispy. they also cut every slice into two pieces so you don't have to maneuver a giant slice.come here if you want some REAL pizza. CAN'T BELIEVE they're at 3.5 stars. THAT'S a fuckin travesty and proves that ppl are lame.If you want some legit slices or calzones, come here. otherwise, go to ur lame-ass extreme pizza and get some shit that's lame as fuck. peace out.edit: i wrote this while mad shwasted. my bad. still... 5 stars!! Lively clientele provide inadvertent entertainment for those waiting for their cheese slices.  Cheese slices can be had in exchange for $2.50.  This is a thickish slice and par for the area.  See Alley C.'s review for an excellent description of the area. So Chico's gets one star just for being open late, in a city where there ain't sh** to eat after midnight. Another star for the buckets of character-building opportunities you may encounter on your way there as you navigate the crack-cocaine and piss-riddled phenomenon that is 6th street. The third star is for the pesto-laden slices of pizza that I always order from Chico's. The fourth star is for the simple friendliness of the staff. For all the freaks and motherf*****s that they must surely deal with, those guys are pretty damn nice. Sure, it ain't fine-dining, but it don't get much better at three in the morning after a night of swillin' beer. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but the pizza here is like the place looks: drab and unexceptional. It tastes like the pizza you get at a corner store or bowling alley that has been sitting under the heat lamp for a little too long. It's edible and cheap, but you get what you pay for. Chicos. Hit or Miss kinda of place. If you order pesto, make sure to mention that you want Just pesto sauce and cheese . Not over old cheese and red sauce. yuck. But if you order right and you get them on the right night, them they are really really good. Yeah the area sucks so unless you want to witness a crack deal, give some change or watch a drug bust just have them deliver. Decent Pizza.  At 9:30pm the slices were generally fresh.  Service was quick and friendly.  Pizza crust & toppings decent.  Sauce & cheese could be better.  Not bad & fresh, I would return if I am in the area. I absolutely love their service and their pizza NEVER disappoints me, my favorite (I order this on a regular basis, they know me by this order) Medium Meat Lovers with Jalapenos & Pineapple and a side of ranch dressing.. Chico's pizza is like the closest pizza joint near my place, so i've been a couple of times.  I like their pizza... despite finding a hair in it one time.I also like how it's not thin crust (because i've never been a fan of thin crust), and when you order by the slice, your pizza is nice a crunchy instead of soft & soggy like a lot of places. Chico's is a great spot for a quick slice.  The employees are really cool and friendly.  The area is one of the worst parts of town, but they don't let that get to them.  They simply cater to your needs and give a great slice of pizza.  The Pepperoni and Vegetarian are great.  Even better is the crust, nice and toasty and thick.  The slices are of generous size and barely fit in the box.  The turkey sandwich is great as well.  If you're in the area for whatever reason (buying stolen goods, cracks, etc.) stop at Chico's for a bite. ""I work for the FBI"" announced a well-fed young lady wearing a not-so-well-chosen outfit as she stumbled into this establishment after me, earlier this evening. As she searched for her badge to validate her claim, the gentleman behind the counter asked me what I'd have. A slice of pepperoni and sausage, please. And that's what I'd recommend to you, too, if (a) it looks as fresh out-tha-oven as this slice's pie did, and (b) if you are planning, as I was, to consume alcohol shortly thereafter, and (c) you haven't eaten anything since lunch. The other pies reminded me of those that we ate for free every other Thursday for lunch in middle school; fresh out-tha-microwave. The cheese was just showing that slight curdle that happens when demand drops off  after lunch and hasn't yet picked up again before dinner (and the pie has seen the hours that have passed, in between). ""I'm a Pimp"" said the former FBI agent, who, failing to produce her badge, earlier, had attempted a second take... and a second take of pie is only recommended if you are really tying one on. Otherwise, this is good for pre- (or even post-) bar visit, and not a regular patronage. This place is great if you're drunk... not so great if you're sober.  I mean, it's okay, but not something I would go out of my way to order.The tomato sauce is particularly acidic and the miniscule amount of cheese they use means sausage pieces were flying all over the box on our delivery order.  Chico's uses a medium-thickness crust.  It's definitely something you want to eat while it's hot, because it turns into rubber once it's cold.The buffalo wings are more like BBQ wings than anything else... not really sure how to make heads or tails of them.  Very meh, though.$30 for a large 5 topping pizza and an order of buffalo wings (10 wings).  Free delivery. * 3.5 stars * Definitely good pizza by the slice here. Not remarkable, but good. I think of fat veggies practically falling off a juicy big slice. Fair prices, smaller inside but you can sit (at the window on a stool too)... just don't loiter around outside for long [especially at night] because you're likely to get harassed by who knows who. Basically if I was hungry & in the area again I'd definitely swing by. Good stuff. Chico's is good quality, medium crust pizza, at a good value.  Our order was complicated but was fullfilled 100% accurately.  Delivery was quick - we're only a block away though - and our delivery guy was friendly. Definitely recommended for med-crust, by the slice pizza. Why would you ever go to any food establishment off of 6th and mission?? Because the pizza is damn good, you know the kind that's great for hangovers? Also, it's cheap.But not a lot of seats. Chico's Pizza is a fine establishment in the South of Market district (SOMA) of San Francisco. I admit that I only order from them via delivery but I have entered the place at least once or twice.The first time was when they still had the arcades. I remember losing all of my quarters from Street Fighter. The employees are nice and they're really committed to giving their customers a quality pizza. One slice and I was hooked.A second time was when they moved to a much cleaner place, albeit, smaller than the last one. It was also not too far from where they originally where. I mean, literally, they were like a crosswalk away from each other. The pizza is still fresh and delicious.Now, ordering from them is simple. They have a website up and you can pretty much pick out what you like and make a list of what you want to order. Just give them a call and they'll prepare it for you just the way you like it. I've tried their pizzas and calzones and I never get tired of it. But you must try their wings! That's the kicker of this review. I enjoy their hot wings and they don't kid about that stuff. It's seriously THAT good.I must have ordered from them at least a dozen times within the past two years. I believe that they keep track of their phone orders so that it could be quicker to process. The employees are friendly and courteous. It also helps that their delivery time is right on the spot, sometimes maybe even earlier.Pros:* Variety of pizza selections and other menu items (calzones, salad, sandwiches)* HOT WINGS* Friendly employees* Convenient pricesCons:* Might be a difficulty for those not nearby Downtown* Small place to eat and chillSo if you're looking for a quick bite to eat, try this place out. You won't be disappointed. I've never actually eaten at Chico's, but the delivery has always been fast,  very friendly and accurate (it always seems like my orders are half of this, light on that etc., but they always get it right). The pizza is great, especially for the price. I have never stepped foot inside this place.  I have only ever ordered from them on the phone, and then they deliever to me.  First time I ordered from them, I think i foudn them on google, or the yellow pages.  It was my intention to order pizza in my area until i found a good one.  I had ordered from some other places before and they weren't that good, but when i ordered from Chico's... THAT WAS IT!their pizza is AWESOME and so is their dough!  And its by FAR better than Blondies pizza, not to mention cheaper!  With free delivery, Awesome pizza, and cheap prices in downtown san francisco, what more do you want?  this is THE place!  get some! The location is pretty ghetto considering it is nearby a porn shop but at my own convenience, their pizza slices are filling, pretty good, and not too pricey at all! The staff is friendly, quick, and on top of everything! Great place to go for a quick and affordable eat while on your lunch! Chico's is a very generous establishment.  My mouth was watering as soon as I saw the thickness of the slices.  The taste was great.  Some of the best pizza in the area. Pretty great pizza.  The two times I've gone there, got my slices off of pizzas straight out of the oven-- very fresh :)  I am a fan of the traditional and savory, so my fav as of right now the pepperoni~I have never had to wait in, and the pizza man is very nice, --always offers the fresh pizzas instead of trying to get rid of the ones that have been sitting out-- big plus! At first, I thought the pizzas were cut a little funny just because there was always a large slice, and then a sliver of a slice~ but now that I think of it, I kinda like it because it's less of a maneuver to eat a huge slice of pizza! This place officially gets my 5-star rating because they deliver to Treasure Island at all times, any $ amount for the order.I love their thin crust, and one day, while feeling particularly hungry, I topped one with pepperoni, sausage, bell peppers and mushrooms.  DELICIOUS.Even though the poor delivery man got lost, my pizza was still hot when he finally made it out to Treasure Island.  They're extremely, extremely nice there, so of course I tipped them extra.Congratulations, Chico's - you officially are my new go-to pizza delivery. Yep, that's right--5 stars.  Most people would deduct a star for location, but I'm adding a star since a place that handily beats Blondie's for taste & texture, prices & portions, crispiness & chewiness, all while managing to stay in business at 6th & Mission--well, they deserve a little extra credit.  Besides, it's not like you're going to eat it here, are you?  Just stuff a couple (boxed) slices in your Chrome bag and pedal on up to Yerba Buena gardens.  Then you can bask in sweet-smelling sunshine (and the satisfaction of having braved the darkest depths of SOMA in the name of almighty pizza). I live around the corner from Chico's, so it's a cool place to go if I'm craving fast pizza.  The slices are big and they warm it in the oven after you get there.  You can also order online, but i think it might be more expensive. Workers are friendly, they always spark up conversation while i wait for my pizza. The location sucks, but if you're in the neighborhood craving pretty good pizza, go for it. A little disappointed after last night. A Wednesday night! I order around 10ish for my late night grub with me and my boy. I've been painting and running all day and pizza sounded soooo good. I ordered my usual and was told 20-45 minutes... one hour goes by and I call asking where my pizza is. The guy was nice and said it'd be 6 mins and apologized.. 14 mins later my pizza came, but they gave me the wrong drinks. WTF. It was around 11:45 once we got our food and I had been fattying-it out on a bag of potato chips while waiting.. an attractive scene I'm sure for the boy.Blergh. I'll give you one more chance... after that if not satisfied we are officially fighting. nothing better than being hassled by a crack addict and the owner coming around to forcefully remove them... If that's not great customer service, i don't know what is.The pizza and service is always great and the prices are cheap...  Sure, I've had better pizza, but if you're on Sixth and are starving, it gets no better.  Living only a block away doesn't hurt either. Nothing ends a night like ending a night eating Chicos. Served up so hot at whatever am in the morning, your drunk self will burn your mouth over a hot slice. But relish the fact that it was Chicos fault.I remember the first time I had Chicos, one of the bouncers at the bar next door asked if I wanted pizza. I was like *OK* thinking he was kidding. 10 mins later a small peperoni pizza popped up in front of me! THEY DELIVER TO A BAR!? (oh,lol, they are next door? HAHA)When I go out with my friend Danielle, its always ""Chicos, Chicos!!!"" at some point when someone asks ""where to now""This place doesn't have the same magic during the day, but its a whole lot of MAGIC at night As a true fan of Pizza, I would have to say you have gotta love Pizza to truely enjoy this place! I have wondered all over the city and tried endless corner pizza places, but Nothing and I mean NOTHING compares to the satisfaction you have from just eating one slice! There pizza has a thick crusted New York Style with lots of toppings. They might not be located in the best neighbor hood, but that should not stop you from enjoy this savoy Pizza Joint! I frequent the place at least twice a week and the owner and employees know me by name. As a compete side note, this pizza even reheats extremely well! So dont be shy and grab yourself a whole pie!  I highly recommend grabbing the Chico's Special Slice if you like meat and green peppers! I live a block away and I've been here twice in the last week, oddly they nights seem to coincide with other activities the precede the pizza visit. I was expecting really bad pizza, but was pleasantly surprised, it was pretty darn good. It was $3 a slice and that constituted a lot of pizza, not a bad deal. The pizza, both times, was definitely heavy on the dough (confirming the comments of ""more bread than pizza), but it wasn't that extreme, the toppings were good and plenty. In the end, I LOVE the crust and it worked out fine for me. Yes the place is in the heart of 6th street, but it should be 1 or 2 reasons you are there: (1) you live in the area, or (2) you're drunk. If the former, you should be used to 6th street, so get over it. If it's the latter, you're drunk, you shouldn't really care and you'll be fine, get over. If I'm gonna order in pizza, it'll be more designer-ish pizza, and if I'm gonna travel for it, I'm going to Haight to feast on Fat Slice. All in all, can't complain with it being a block away. Slice of Pizza at 2:30 after a night of shots, laughs and a good time.. Good for pizza on the later night but I wouldn't opt for it during the day. Okay, so in my opinion my reviews are always spot-on because they cater to the layman.  Yes, of 'layman's terms'.  I don't give a FUCK if the delivery takes over an hour, nope, don't give a shit if the service is bad.  Just give me my food - my kingdom for some good food!Chico's is ... interesting.  I call and talk to the same dude with a crazysexycool accent, and he almost always tells me to ""okajy, hold on one sjecond...one sjecond.""  Ah, I will always treasure these fleeting exchanges.My order arrives usually over an hour after the promised time, but I DO live on The Island (ScarJo, where are you?) so I don't complain.  The service is pretty friendly and last time they recognized my roommate (awkward).On to the food.  My faves are the salad which is pretty typical, but they have Ken's brand thousand island dressing.  The salami sandwich is awesome!  The meat is so that it curls up at the ends and is crispy, and the dressing on there is rad, and they pile it on.Embarrassing, yes, but I have no clue what the actual pizza tastes like, but according to roommates, it's not bad. Straight up set in the heart of 6th street. No parking, just wait in your car and hope no one tries to knock on your window and ask for some change while you hope the person who's picking up the pizza is hurrying up. Not that I feel in total danger, but when there's cops all around and all this traffic trying to get on Market St, it's hard to not panic for someone tells you to get out the red zone. Is it worth it? Not really. The pizza dough is too thick and the toppings with the cheese don't really measure up to how thick the dough is. More bread than pizza, if you ask me. It's open late, so that's good. The pizza changed, it used to be thinner and they used to give you huge ole slices. No more of that. So...first let me say that my preference would never be Chico's. I like NY style thin crust pizza, this is not that. So it starts off very low in my book. I actually live two blocks away and would rather go up the street to Mythic, sometimes. I hear you can order thin crust to be delivered but not in the shop to go. Sauce is cool, service is great, open late too (that's my only reason for having eaten there several times). If you like NY pizza no dice, go somewhere else. Tasty, big slices, in a sketchy part of town.  Nice staff.  I would definitely go back! This little hole in the wall pizza place is surprisingly good for a by the slice place. My pizza was loaded but I wasn't...I went there BEFORE going to clubsix so I was completely sober. Pizza was hot, filling, not too greasy, didn't cost too much dough and the service was friendly. There's not much room to dine in and the area is a bit sketchy as others have said, but I'm basing my review on the place itself and not the surrounding area. It wouldn't replace a sit down, dine-in pizza place, but it's still pretty decent in my opinion. More like a three and a half star. Better than mythic down the street. Being one of the few people who have eaten this pizza sober I can say, with some objectivity, that it kinda sucks. I don't really understand all the good reviews its getting. Of course, its pizza, so its still kind of good, but compared to other pizzas, its not so good. If you are drunk, and its 2 am, of course its good. Its like Wolfgang fucking Puck jacked your face with a mouthgasm of salty cheese ecstasy. But try it sober. Or don't...thats the point of my review I guess. Its right by my house and every time I see it I get faked out... Like, ""oh sweet, a slice of pizza"" then I remember its Chico's, not Arinell's or Serrano's or even Mythic. Hell, even Cable car is better.The crust is way too thick. Why so thick? The pepperoni tastes like freeze dried rubber. Its full of skeezy scuzzy shady people and shit, lets face it, its on 6th st. (I live there, so talking shit on 6th is my right). I would sooner call Pronto's for delivery than eat Chico's again. Sorry Chico's, and sorry drinkers of the 6th street area, but no. I disagree. This was surprisingly good pizza; don't be fooled by their location.  For $3.50, you can get a big slice of pizza that's tasty, fast and filling.  I was going to a show at the Mezzanine and needed to grab a bite to eat before the show and this place hit the spot.  The owner was nice, the place was clean and I would definitely go back if I was in the area. Best pizza in the ghetto. But watch your back when you're leaving. Walking back to BART from watching a Presidential Debate in the area, I needed something to settle my queasy stomach and pizza sounded like just the thing. Given the neighborhood and the evening hour, I was skeptical about stopping anywhere, but Chico's was brightly lit, friendly-looking, and had a couple awards posted in the window. Stepping inside, it was a different world. This place is a classic little pizza shop--the kitchen takes up over half the space, leaving only a few counter seats. An overhead TV shows sports, while the pizza guys quickly and efficiently sling pies in and out of the industrial ovens. Several different pizzas by the slice are available, or you can order from the extensive and reasonably-priced menu.The pizza itself was excellent and the garlic bread was fairly good. I'll have to swing back through for lunch sometime soon. I hope to see you there! i was surprised to see so many 4 and 5 start reviews, but was also happy to see them becasue i thought i was crazy. Even though Chico's is on the worst block in SF... they have some of the biggest, tastiest slices in SF. if you want a great slice... check it out. Really, really good med crust, cheesy, crispy, and yummy pizza. Especially when you're really tanked. $3.50 for a HUGE hot slice of pepperoni and meatball!!  PLUS they deliver!  What more can you ask for?!  They also have a few stools for you to people watch and a unisex bathroom.  The only complaint I have is that it's in the shady side of town with all types of interesting characters.  But you know what, I used to live in Seattle so I should just shut up right now.... chicos is pretty damn delicious and you get a good sized piece of pie for the price.the only seating room is a few stools in front of bars, but at least you can rest your legs while you munch.all the pizza condiments (pepper, parmesan, garlic...) are chained to the wall. i suppose chicos got sick of crackheads bolting out the door with their container of cheese or something.oh, and theres a tv. if you like sports and good, cheap pizza go to chicos. Chico's makes good dependable pizza, the prices are decent, and they get your pie to you steamin' hot. However, were it for the pizza alone I might give them three stars.You see, the gem of the menu is the fantabulous Chico's Calzone. OMG good. Some pals and I had one delivered to a bar -- a random guy sitting next to us watched us eat for a while, then gave me ten bucks for one little section. That's sayin' something. Pile on the provided chopped garlic and it's chow city.At a former startup we had lunches delivered on Wednesdays. The office manager would pick something, which would then meet with a broad range of acceptance from the mutinous employees. Then, she discovered Chico's and their wonderful calzones. After that, every Wednesday was Chico's day. It got a little old after a couple of months but anyway it's good pie. The best pizza in SOMA.  Always deliver crisp and hot pizza, with decent toppings, on time and the hotwings are pretty good too.  And we don't have to walk through crack-alley with a steaming pizza box 'cause they deliver. Everyday, nearly, for lunch. It's so good, convenient, and cheap. I can't pass it up and it's worth being the butt of a few jokes at work. The staff is friendly and respectful. Lunch and entertainment, the window show is always worth a good thirty minutes... It is 6th St after all. San Francisco has got some great pizza joints. There's nothing better than pizza by the slice when you're in the middle of an all-night binge. Chico's might just be the best pizza by the slice, in San Francisco. Unfortunately, no one knows this because it's on 6th street. On 6th, you just don't know what may happen to you. There are ""street vendors"" aplenty, so while on your way to and from Chico's, walk with authority, don't make eye contact, and be aware of your surroundings. Chico is a pretty cool family man type guy, so it's too bad he has to put up with the 6th street riff-raff everday. I love Chico's! They've been in the 'hood since forever-ever. Great family that runs the joint, they got generations running the place. Affordable, fast, and the best part...it's on 6th Street. For alot of you choads who come to the city and party hard but are always quick to badmouth 6th Street, EAT A FAT ONE! It's the 'hood man. People from all walks of life live & breathe this neighborhood. If you don't like it, don't come here!That's why WE love Chico's!P.S. Hani's the man! You'll see some pretty random people here...bums and what not hahah but that is what makes this place so great...and of course the pizza. It was so big! I couldn't even finish it! The people that come here are so friendly! Good place to go after the club. I have to give them some love because DAMG got a little drunk and A vomited all over the place...and the guys working here were so nice about it. The pizza was pretty good, too. I don't remember much from that night (like how we got from the club to this pizza place), but I remember the wonderful pizza. It really hit the spot after a night of drinking and dancing.I don't think A had such fond memories, though. She didn't get a chance to have any of the pizza. Batman and Robin (our bf's) came to our rescue, and that was the end of another fun-filled DAMG night. If you find yourself on 6th at 2am, it's worth stopping by. They make a fat slice from what I remember - perfect for soaking up whatever you got drunk on. Consistently the best pizza that delivers to T.I. (Treasure Island). They have great sauce.  Order extra sauce, but their sausage has the consistency of rubber.  But they are also consistently late with their deliveries -- sometimes by more than one hour after the stated delivery time when they're driving to T.I. (Also, don't bother trying to order right before they close, because they won't bother.) Chico's is awesome - it's there for you - open relatively late, and has wonderful window watching if you eat inside.The cops seem to go there somewhat regularly too if you are sketched by Sixth Street, but then why would you even be there.  The perfect spot for a pre-emptive salve against a hangover if you've been to Arrow (or Matador now I guess), Anu, Club Six or whatever Pow! is now called... not the fanciest place but good pizza and watching the bums kina give you something to do and the liquor store down the street has tall cans for $1.25 so you can wash your pizza down. big slices at a moderate price $3.00 and up Decent unmemorable pizza...not AMAZING (cause I've lived in NY and Chicago and I've tasted amazing pizza).  The slice is big tho and will fill you up, if that is all you require in life.  Area sucks as evidenced by a revolving door of drug addicts and bums. You all know that I love pizza... and that's odd because I'm not a huge fan of most cheeses.... but good pizza is still one of my favorite things to eat... ok. Chicos Pizza is a hidden jewel in a sea of pee-pee, crap and dilapidation. I'm talking about the surrounding area (which is slowly changing... for the better... kind of) and the ""dining room"". I would suggest you order online and sample one of the pies. You will NOT be disappointed. I used to be a fan of goathill... they just got bumped down a notch. if you still have an appetite after making your way up (or down) 6th street, a hot slice of chico's pizza is delicious.  the service is pretty friendly, the crust is crunchy on the outside but thick and fluffy on the inside, the toppings are fresh, and the sauce is flavorful.  the slices are big (they usually cut them in half for you), and best of all they come in a little box so you can keep the cooties out as you make your way back up (or down) 6th.  chico's also makes giant, fresh calzones that look terrific.  please, patronize chico's -- we need thriving, non liquor-driven business on 6th street! For $4.50 exactly I got 1 huge slice of pizza that the guy cut in half for me (without asking...it was that big) and a Snapple. Could it get any better than this?Aside from the fact that I had to pass by piss stained sidewalks and bums whistling at me, I will totally come down here on my lunch break if I am having a hankerin' for some pizza. I'd give 3.5 if I could.By now you know that I'm a pizza snob and I think the only decent pizza in the city is Arinell.With that caveat, I will say that our company switched its monthly lunch order to Chico's from Amici's, and the pizza is far, far better.The Chico's ""calezone"" is quite tasty, though it looks nothing like what anyone in NY would call a calezone.  It looks more like a stromboli to me.The area is sketchy, so unless you're drunk and lost (as noted in other reviews) stick to take out - they deliver! I am so lucky this marvelous place is near my house.  No matter what time of day or night I always find entertainment from the customers and street dwellers of the neighborhood.  People never fail to blow my mind with the shit they say.  This place is like a comedy club.P.S.  I have gone to this place sober and the pizza is still good. Better option than Taqueria Cancun when you're drunk looking for food on 6th Street. Great salads & pizza.  I'd give it a ""5"" if it weren't for the location in the hood on 6th St.  The prices are some of the best in the City.  The staff is very, very cool also.  Feel free to pick-up some liquor on the corner, and check out any of the SOMA dance places & bars that are nearby.  When some poor person (rich jerks don't come here) hits you up for cash just say ""I don't have any money on me, but if you want you can have a hit on my crack pipe.""  Or say ""give me a million dollars"" or say ""grease my palm"" or just shake your head sideways or say ""look it's 5.0 the cops are coming"" or say ""I only give $ to my friends"" or NEG them right back or best thing to say is prove your a human being by saying ""hi.""6th St. is like a Circus. Pizza thick and relatively cheap for SF. Get delivery only tho, the block (and surrounding blocks) that is on are about as unsavory as you can get (6th st is SF's skid row). I mean, I am from NYC and I was looking over my shoulder. This is all unless you are some sort of hipster thinking it's cool to put urself in in an enviroment where ppl in arms length could easily reach out and give you some of the diseases that they are dying from. Props to the owner for having enuf balls to have a business it such a shitty area.Some ppl mentioned it is clean, as compared to what? Market St? decent pizza.  when you're jonsing for something to eat on the late night creep while partying on 6th street, chico's is your place. We got some delivery from this place. Not worth it. Even though I prefer thin crust pizza, and their crust is too thick and ""bready"" for me, I still like it.  The price is also very good.  We order from them once a week or so from work, and they are reliable and friendly.  They have coupons with special offers, and good specialty pizzas like Chico's Special (salami, pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, sausage, and onions) and Pesto Special (pesto sauce, olives, mushrooms, garlic, and mozzarella cheese). On a monthly basis and about three weeks into the new month, I face these horrific episodic vampiric-like hunger for pizza.  And I am not speaking of the thin anorexic-crusted scantily dairy-clad versions of this Italian favorite.  I'm speaking fondly of the thick Chicago style, robust and Pavarotti powered with a crisp and crunchy crust, prim on the outside, but busty and loud on the inside with a slightly sweet and fluffy consistency in the bread.  The toppings here are large and not handed out with the Capitalist-anal-conservatism in mind.  Quite the opposite.I usually order the combination, which comes loaded with pepperoni, thick clusters of Italian sausage, mushrooms, red onions, green peppers, and black olives.  This large slice comes with the easily affordable price of $3.00.  I usually then sprinkle red chili pepper flakes and a lot of Parmesan cheese.  My boyfriend has tried their Hawaiian slice and it was a gooey but lovely mess of melting cheese, thick slices of Canadian bacon and the entire savory piece rounded by the sweet chunks of pineapple.The counter staff have been the same persons for the past several months and each time, service has been quick and friendly.  I always ask for a knife and fork since these pieces are too thick and bulky for the Victorian priss in me to not open my mouth like a basking shark walking down the street the Off Market theater, but then again, not much needs to be shaped by table side courtesies since I walk by an Adult video store on 6th and the Thai massage parlor on Mission.Questionable neighborhood once the light fades, so if you can make it there before 7:00, grab your cheap but tasty slice by the crust.  I'm definitely making my runs there as my boyfriend does his recording session every Sunday. You must go here during the day to be safe,unless your a cop. On weekends its open til 3am.Awesome HUGE slices of pizza. If you like a thick doughy slice ,this is your joint.(No pun intended, considering the location) Nothing too fancy, good grubs. Just watch yourself when you leave. Get in, get out. Despite the lingering drug addicts and the occasional siren going by my meal here was quite plesant.  Rephrase - the pizza was fuckin delicious.  I'm still not sure if it's worth the trouble over parking, or sidestepping bums who are sleeping in their own filth in my Kenneth Cole's but, I'd take my chances again just to taste another slice of  that ""California"" specialty pizza. Just a block away from Club 6, this will quench your late night munchies. I went  here last night after a night of getting all Ultimate Warrior on the dance floor at Club 6.  We ordered a medium San Fransisco, which consists of Pepperoni, bacon, sausage, olives and feta cheese.  And if this pizza is any indication of how their pizza is, then I would highly recommend this place. The pizza crust  was very fluffy and not dry like I was eating French bread straight out of the oven.  Rather than disposing of it like I do with other pizza crusts from other pizza places (*cough* Little Caesar's *cough*), I had to eat the whole thing. The blend of the ingredients is a good look if you like those ingredients. The prices of a slices range from $2.00 for cheese and $3.00 for the other ones. The prices or a whole pizza seems the same as in any other pizza place. The owner of the place seems pretty amicable even if the place closes late night and the location is in a place rampant with crackheads. That would be my only complaint is that there are too many homeless crackheads on 6th street, which might make your dining experience a hesitant one. But that's SF's homeless problem for ya... In general, if you got the munchies and you just left the Mezzanine or Club 6, this late night eatery will definitely quench your appetite. Nothing beats Chico's!!......at 4am when you are drunk off your ass. It's quite an adventure trekking two blocks up 6th to this place from a friend's apartment. On the way up, you see homeless people sleeping in every nook and cranny to stay warm and people doing lines off cocaine off garbage cans in the alleyway. You grab a couple huge slices that can be split into two for the ladies or you can even take one of the whole XL pies on display. The crust is is awesome, right balance of cruch and chewyness. The service is awesome and usually not too crowded, even though its the only place open nearby. Sal is the man, always risking his life by working this late, he'll hook you up. Last night, I walked right in and took one of the XL pepperoni's to go, turned out to be $22, but it fed 10 people with 2 more slices left for breakfast the next day! As I carried it back, we ran into the same compendium (matty, i learned) of people, except add to that, 2 cars on the street honking at us yelling, ""Where's the pizza?!?"" Chico's should pay me a referral fee. As I turned into the alleyway, I see two guys hittin a bong and they offered me a hit, to which i politely declined. Before entering the apartment, I was startled by a raccoon rummaging around the litter on the street. Man, this was almost like a Harold and Kumar adventure. I should have taken a hit..... For a pizza place, Chico's does it right. I live a half block away, but it's mere coincidence that it also happens to be my favorite pizza place. The slices are huge and very inexpensive. You can get a loaded veggie pizza with fresh made veggies if you ask, but I prefer the combo with pepperoni and sausage. It's probably got enough calories in it to feed a developing nation for a week, but we all get to have one or two guilt foods, right?Their wings are a little bleh, but I notice that all wings in SF are more or less marinated for too long which make them soggy and squishy. I guess if west coasters like their Buffalo wings soggy then that's just how its got to be. I still order these every now and then though :) Can't help it.If you find yourself on 6th street while clubbing at Anu or Six, and can deal with the neighborhood minglers , then def check this place out for a slice. 2 stars for being the OG pizza place on 6th street, brave enough to stay open until all hours of night and....ummm....carrying gatorade...Thats about it. No reason to go here now that Mythic opened up - unless you really want gatorade... I am not eating the pizza here just because if I am here on this block, I am clearly only buying drugs. Why anyone would ever eat anything that was made on this block is beyond me.You should go, and you should go right now. Head for The Sun. Keep it over your shoulder and begone with you. On your bike. Scoot!The pizza here reminds me of that movie Threesome, which is bad enough. In it Stephen Baldwin's character is mumbling like he has just been lobotomized about how ""sex is like pizza, even when it's bad it's still pretty good"". Then why is it Steve when I eat this pizza I'm like, ""Hey, this feels pretty good!"" and then afterwards I'm all, ""Now I'm just lonelier than before I ate the pizza."". Which is a good thing after all because thinking about crazy-ass Stephen Baldwin just put me off of my feed for reals. Oh sweet jesus what a find this was. At my former place of employment we were buried deep in the bowels of Hayes Valley.  Now don't get me wrong, I love this location, but the food selection is kinda of slim there. After suffering uncountable gastro-intestinal tragedies from the $10 hamburgers at Flippers or realizing that living for 2 years off of food bought from the corner store, one tends to turn to delivery for their at work dining options. So one day I wander in to work and find a Chico's menu sitting on the door. I ignore it. I don't know who Chico is, but I'm betting he can't make pizza for shit. Weeks later a co-worker finds the same menu that someone had brought inside and orders up a pizza. Two hours later the pizza arrives. I'm starving by this time so when I taste the luke-warm pizza it doesn't really surprise me that it's good. I had been eating paper 20 minutes earlier to try to leech some vitamins out of it and that tasted great too. We order again a few days later. Or maybe it was the next day. We like pizza a lot and we're don't care about our health. Anyways. This time it shows up in about an hour but it's still hot. This is when I realize that this pizza is just like I like my women - never showing up on time, comes for under $20 and is covered in warm cheese. After ordering from this place tons of times I realized that I only ever see one guy delivering the food. So I ask him about it and it turns out that they only have one delivery person. Yes, one. So that explains the taking for fucking ever to get there thing. Good, cheap pizza delivery. Sometimes it takes a while to get there but I have yet to find better delivery in the area. They make some good grubbin' pizza here.  It's no place to fight over whether it's authentic *insert city/country* pizza.  You just get yourself some Chico's when you want a good pizza that doesn't need a home other than your belly.  I love their website too. Two hours after ordering, my pizza hasn't arrived. When I called 45 minutes ago, they assured me it was on its way. Now they're not answering their phone at all. Good luck. Drunkenness and Proximity make this a regular favorite...Damn, this seems to be a theme in my reviews - oh well...The true test of a good pizza joint is that you go back and order a pie when you're sober - I definitely recommend Chico's...Good pizza and fast delivery. Sober or drunk, this place hits the spot for under $5.00.  Their slices are so big that they cut them in half...kind of like a buy one get one free deal.  Nothing like a 6th street pizza joint that has to fasten their pepper shakers to the wall so that no one steals 'em. Chico and the Man? No Chico is the man! I live near 25th and Valencia and it's beyond me how this spot will deliver to my house (cross street 25) on average 15 to 20 minutes faster than Deja vu (16th) or Serrano's (22nd). I am not from NYC so I have no ""questionable"" loyalties to some pizza ideal but I do know what I like and I like Chico's. They make a great pie. Before you dump oregano, parm, or red pepper flakes on that slice, taste it. You won't need them. The real draw is the calzone. It's huge (Medium size pizza box huge), served up with a heaping helping of chopped garlic! For pizza, this neighborhood is a crap shoot but if you like moderate thick crust, good amounts of sauce, cheese and toppings, this place is just about as good as it gets around here. It's also a good place to watch the crackheads march by, or stand in front of you, or come in and ask you for change. The deal though is something like a slice (which is huge) and a soda for $3.50. Best pizza delivered out to Treasure Island. It takes a while, but is usually worth the wait, and they deliver till almost 2 in the morning. Can't beat that!This pizza is genuinely tasty. Nice thick crusty pizza with good sauce. The staff is always friendly and seem to genuinely appreciate the business. We always come here prior to or after going to the Mezzanine or Arrow.  Last time after getting way too tanked at the Mezzanine we went here for a little sobering up food before the long trek home only to find that they were closed!  No other sobering salvation in sight.  We stand in front of the place looking dismayed, desparate & drunk.  The owner (Chico?) and workers inside saw us looking sad and pitiful & decided to re-open just for us to get some slices!  THERE IS A GOD!The quickly prepare us 6 sliced of pepperoni & we tip them genoursly for their troubles.  They hand over the little white boxes of doughy goodness & our eyes light up like 5 year olds on christmas day.  I quickly begin to doctor up my slice with all the fixins.  Paremesean, red chilli, salt, pepper.  I see the jar of oregano & think, what the heck, just a dash!  And when I tip the jar, the cap fell off & my pizza was quickly buried under a mountain of oregano!  My friends & the guys that worked there saw it & everyone began to laugh hysterically.  It was pretty funny, I guess, If you werent me.  But the guys were nice enough to give me anotehr one.  & I still ate the oregano slice too.  it's was like a weed covered pizza, but good nontheless. This place is great. Not my style of pizza - crust is too thick.  6th Street isn't THAT bad.  Adds to the excitement. This place has THE best pizza for delivery (and I am guessing by the slice as well).  We order in at my work at least once a week,  and it never fails to be piping hot and delicious.  Try the pesto - it is AMAZING.  They lose one star for the occasionally long delivery time.  BUT the delivery guy pretty much makes up for it:  he is always super sweet and chatty. So I know 6th street can be scary to some, but since those crackheads don't bite, you might want to troop through the beauty that is 6th and Mission for Chico's. If you know you're going, call ahead and your slice will be waiting. The calzone's are to die for, and all the guys that work there are great. Any slice is good, but you can;t beat a good slice of plain cheese. Pimps? yes.Police? yes. Pizza? Eventually.  Once you wade through the sketchiness of the 6th and Mission hood, you will come across a tiny little pizza shop.  Chico's pizza, one of the only honest businesses in the area, serves it up right, and Chico, the owner is pretty cool.  My only area of dissatisfaction is not knowing how long those pies have been sitting under the heat lamp.  Whatever the case, my slice of combo was still pretty good. It's a bit of a hike from the office, and you could get shot, but that's the chance you have to take to get some good pizza in this city. I'd like to thank Chico for making my day infinitely better with his wheels of deliciousness. The restaurant is kind of in shambles with dust covered shirts, unfinished walls where you can see the duct work and a crappy old pizza box tacked to the wall autographed by Jay Leno. The hawaiin slice was delicious with thick crust and good sauce. Want some good 'za? Bring yo' gat. No reviews? Chico is the MAN... Excellent pizza here, and don't let the ambience of the block scare you away- excellent the way he makes a pizza crust something of real substance, not like those flat pancakes at Dominos & Round Table, and it's not the most expensive place either. I'll take a slice of cheese with mushroom &  bell peppers any day...[newsflash update, 8/23/05- dumptruck smashes into video arcade  just  2-3 doors up the block- fortunately, Chico's has been spared any damage!...)"|4|86|5|Routine| Improper storage use or identification of toxic substances  [ date violation corrected: 12/28/2012 ] Inadequate food safety knowledge or lack of certified food safety manager  [ date violation corrected: 12/28/2012 ] Moderate risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 12/28/2012 ] Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 12/28/2012 ] Low risk vermin infestation  [ date violation corrected: 12/28/2012 ]|GOOD: no inspection needed
State Bird Provisions 0|4.5|Tapas/Small Plates in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|1051|0|4.363636363636363|" unfortunately, this place did not live up to the hype.  the food was good, not exceptional.  i did enjoy the granita and the olive oil ice cream sandwiches, but that's about it. Stellar, Absolutely love it. Every Dim Sum we had was amazing, and the main courses that we had were great as well. The people working there including the head chef were extremely friendly and create a very homely atmosphere. It doesn't feel like a upper class restaurant, but the food is better than any in my opinion. My wife was coming into the city and we decided that lets see if we can get in State Bird, abide it was Monday night, the host, extremely friendly and helpful, let us know that they will have a table for us in an hour and half, we went around 6:00. so we walk around Japan Town for a while and then went back and were seated at the Chef's table, Best seats in the house, promptly at 7:30.Best things about the Chef's table is everything comes out right in front of you, and you can decide if you want it by the time they come around to you. Now about the Food, every bite consists of awesomeness, We order Cumin Lamb(a must have), Kimchi Yuba(good, not great), corn Shortstack pancake(good) for entree, had the the herbal tisane tea (highly recommend), and got Beehive Mousse (Good), and Granita(just Ok, won't order it again)Dimsum: dumpling in the broth, the best broth i have ever had, we got 2 first and then wanted like a dozen more, you have to get this dim sum. Duck liver mousse - i don't even like duck liver and this was great, Halibut - Great taste and perfectly cooked. This has become my #1 restaurant right now, will be coming back if i can ever get a reservation or will try my luck at walking in early on weekdays. . We were too full by the time the seafood cart came around, but they looked so good, i would definitely wait for it. I will be coming back here soon. A restaurant that truly lives up to its hype.  Fantastic meal, dining experience,  and a few gifts from the chef.  A great concept pulled together perfectly. I love eating in SF, it makes my travel life easier to deal with. This was a reservation which was epic to secure, getting 8 or 9 people into state bird for a tasting menu was a challenge. Thankfully everything aligned and when we showed up they gave us this awesome menu with loads of items on it. We weren't sure if we were supposed to choose but soon learned that they were bringing the whole thing. I will actually post the menu since I took a picture of it. Needless to say it was an epic meal, including awesome beer and wine. There were so many good items, I can say nothing was bad at all. We even ordered more dessert since it was so great.The service was excellent on top of the food. The place could be decorated a bit better, but I wasn't paying attention to anything else :) Stand-out meal in SF.   The chefs were too cute to handle, and the entire experience was wonderful.  We approached the logistics of getting a table straightforwardly:  the restaurant opens at 5:30pm, we arrived 45 minutes before and were about 20th in line.  A few people seemed to take the tactic of waiting on line as we did, and then putting their names down for a reservation later that evening.  We weren't sure if that was by choice, or if we were one of the last for the first round of seatings.We were immensely lucky to have been seated at the bar, with a direct view of the chefs in action.  This is not only extremely entertaining, but offered a real benefit in viewing the dishes as they were made, before they were offered to the seated patrons.  Sometimes the chefs leaned over after completing a dish and offered them to us first.The real challenge here is not over-ordering, or saying ""a thousand times yes!"" to the first dozen dishes that are presented to you.  There is a regular menu, and every day they create and pass around new plates dim-sum style.  My suggestion would be to order 2-3 items that you absolutely must have from the regular menu, then try the ones that are passed around.  If you have not reached satisfaction after a few rounds, then you can always order from the regular menu as you go.  We ordered the CA State Bird with provisions off their regular menu which is a small, delicately fried quail (California's state bird, without much irony).  It was flavorful and juicy, everything you'd want in fried quail (or any poultry), and it was with great restraint and to our benefit that we ordered the smaller portion. One of my favorite dishes was a brothy concoction with a variety of mushrooms and herbs.  Sashimi bites served on thick, crispy seaweed was a favorite of ours.  My friend was visibly upset when, just moments after declaring defeat and readiness for dessert, we were presented with pork belly.  My dear friend is incapable of saying no to pork belly, and I cannot disagree with her.  It was a good decision, even though the dish sat there for a good 15 minutes while we mustered up the courage and stomach space to enjoy it.  Lack of restraint brings us to our dessert course, where yes, I insisted that we get both the black sesame ice cream sandwiches (with the peanut milk shot) and the olive oil cake.  No regrets here.  The ice cream sandwiches are somewhat of a marvel - if you like a traditional sundae I would skip this. This is far more ""modern"" if taste and texture, which is neither a good nor bad thing.  I like sesame and enjoyed the unique texture of the ""cookie"" part of the sandwich, it was light and almost meringue-like in texture.  Think chewy macaron.  The olive oil cake was a far more airy and light, with delightful rhubarb accompaniments.  I didn't love all the dishes here - some of the seafood was less memorable and the steak tartare, the peacock of the dishes with the impressive red endive leaf, was not extremely flavorful.This was one of the most fun I've had at a meal, and I will be back for my next SF visit. Absolutely breathtaking meal, all the hype surrounding this place is well deserved. The food is whimsical, the service is sensational and unsuspecting(food comes from the cooks at points), and the atmosphere is warming yet elegant. What we ate:Sweet Corn Pancakes State Bird with ProvisionsPorcini & Duck Fried RiceRed Trout Bacon Curry with SweetbreadsSalmon CollarRice porridge with guancialeDeconstructed shrimp louie Pork Belly with plumsPotato croquettes with beef tongueYeasted butter cakeOlive Oil ice cream sandwichFrom start to finish I was blown away, the Trout was the best piece of fish I ever had.  The crispy skin mixed with the sweet mandarins and nutty hazelnuts was so perfectly balanced I was at a loss for words. The duck fried rice was equally impressive, my favorite part was the porcini aioli they topped it with. The beef tongue was also super playful, put me right inside a classic jewish deli. Everything was perfect, I've never had such an amazing meal. Every element of every dish is well thought out and you can see the hard work that's put into every morsel. Its truly a one of kind restaurant and I recommended every foodie to make a visit. Wow.  Super talented chef.  Very creative. We loved most of the food except the desserts. Honestly, for $100 plus per head, this was a disappointing experience.  We were forced into doing the tasting menu because we had a group of 6 people, therefore, while we absolutely adored some dishes and were basically fighting over the last morsels, others were barely touched because they were a little too experimental for our tastes. If we had been able to order for ourselves we would have been better able to order appropriate amount of some of the amazing dishes that we did truly enjoy.  Thus, some in our party were still a bit hungry when we left. Second, we felt like we were consistently being rushed through our meal, even though we had to wait 5 months for our 5:30pm reservation on a Saturday.  There was no time between courses to sip our wine or chat before the next set of dishes were brought out. Would maybe come back for the state bird, but definitely not the tasting menu. I am a big fan of the atmosphere and set-up of State Bird, and I'm ever grateful for the restaurant saving up to 50% of its space for walk-ins like myself.What you can expect:- Mouth-watering small plates with works of art floating around, literally trying to seduce you. - Knowledgeable servers who take time to explain each dish and its special qualities - A semi-open kitchen, where you can sit and admire young, energetic chefs cooking up a storm- A very patient and helpful hostess who will do her best to accommodate you, even if you haven't made reservations months in advance.I say - well worth the wait, and the price. For me, the green garlic bread was a must-try, and the state bird didn't disappoint either! Diary Of A Crazed FanMay 2014:  Heard the hype about State Bird Provisions, ignored it.June 1, 2014:  Suddently decided that I had to eat at SBP NO MATTER WHAT IT TOOKJune 2, 2014:  Took a napJune 3, 2014:  Read the Yelp reviews and discovered that they reserve over half of the tables for walk-ins.  Are you kidding me?June 4, 2014:  Took another, longer napJune 5, 2014:  Called friend in L.A. (""Pepper"") to ask if she wanted to wait around in line for an hour to eat food at hot, trendy restaurant in SF.  Pepper agreed enthusiasicallyJune 5, 2014:  Contemplated my life.  Query whether slacker friends are enabling me.June 6, 2014:  Took a nap but woke up halfway through to eat browniesJune 19, 2014:  Prepared for SBP dinner by working out, then taking a nap.June 20, 2014:  TODAY IS THE DAY!  SBP opens at 5:30.4:15 PM:  Arrive at State Bird Proviions.  There's no sign but we see a line of people who look like they would wait in line for overhyped food.  Get in line behind 2 other parties who are already waiting in line.  4:18 PM:  Get bored.  Chat with other people who are waiting in life, who are all CHEFS.  Good sign.  Watch the chefs inside work,  get more hungry.  Drool.4:20 PM:  Observe our new friends, in line ahead of us, going across the street to get beer.  Damn they are smart!  Follow suit, ordering Pepper to purchase beers.  Pepper buys bottled beer.  We didn't have a bottle opener.  Bad Pepper!  return to store, use bottle opener.  Enjoy the juxtaposition of drinking beer out of paper bags while waiting to eat at fancy/schmancy Michelin-starred restaurant.  4:50 PM:  Notice that a LONG line has formed behind us.  Drunkenly befriend everyone in line. 5:00 PM:  Notice that there are nervous, older, conservatively dressed people milling about near entrance to restaurant.  Suspect that they are trying to CUT IN LINE.  Share suspicions with entire line, thus creating angry mob.  Only to realize that the older nervous people are responsible individuals who made reservations, not the zany walk-in crowd in line.  Feel sheepish.  Drink more beer.5:30 PM:  Game time!  Got a seat at Chef's Table, watched them prepare food.HOLY CRAP THIS FOOD IS AMAZING! Seriously, this food is really delicious, the concept is innovative, the service is very attentive and warm, and it was generally a fun experience.  I would choose to eat here rather than at Michael Mina or Gary Danko because it's different, relaxed, fun and I like the concept.see you in line!P.S.  Pepper and I were idiots and didn't get dessert (full from our 11 courses).  Bad move. The food here was pretty good.  We had a pretty diverse sampling of different dishes.  I like the format a lot. Literally, ""as good as it gets!""My fiancee and I arrived early for our 5:30 reservation. Luckily, he called to find out that people who have reservations do not need to stand in that ridiculous line to get in. Once we were in, the magic starts.We got the nectarine and the spiced cherry soda. The nectarine was better. The corn pancakes were to die for, esp w/ the tasty Mt. Tam cheese on top. The state bird w/ provisions was good, but not good enough for us to order 1 full bird. Only 1/2 a bird next time. There was a smoked trout and chips dish on the seafood cart that was absolutely divine. And a salmon ceviche dish that was so tasty. We started to realize the dim sum serving style was great but we were overordering!I'm glad we got to try everything we wanted to. There were definitely some dishes I wouldn't get again. But that's not because they were bad. It's because I'll save my stomach for the other spectacular dishes. The service was also great and very attentive!The only negative thing is that we had to literally wait on the internet 2 mins before midnight to make reservations. I'm glad we were able to snatch up a reservation! Totally worth it! I had to wake up at 3:55am 2 months in advance to get a table on Friday night at 7:30pm. MY LORD. So as you can imagine, I had high expectations. Our party of 2 arrived a few minutes before 7:30 and we were promptly seated. Let the show begin. What we ordered:Duck liver mouse with almond biscuitsPork spare ribsSpicy dungeness crab, kimchi yuba and smoked eggHamachi on nori crostiniQuailChawanmushiOystersChips with dip (avocado puree of some sort)Sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino and ricotta pancakesQuinoa and tabbouleh saladChocolate ice cream sandwichBlood orange and mint granita with honey creme fraiche The most notable ones were the hamachi, quail, pancakes, quinoa salad, and the deserts These are a MUST TRY! The rest were just OK. I was a bit disapointed because I was expecting each dish to be mind blowingly awesome, but they weren't. As for the dishes that we really enjoyed, they were delisssshhhh. Both innovative and packed flavors. Service was spot on and really helpful, especially for us first timers. I'd recommend coming here at least once to try! Whether it be by reservation or walk in. It's an affordable way to try a michelin star restaurant as well! It was so good. PERIODDim Sum style American food...why didn't I think of that concept! We ordered almost everything on the menu, and everything was cooked to perfection. We sat at the bar right in front of the kitchen (highly recommended because I'm a visual eater...meaning everything I see, I want to eat) We asked the chefs/waiters: ""what's this, what's that"" and they were all happy to inform us. They were super attentive too. We had the duck liver mousse with almond biscuit. you had me at  duck liver. The garlic bread with burrata is ridiculous and a MUST. The ahi & halibut tartare was really good too, I love the fried Nori chips.I'd definitely come back again and again! Woohoo! I have finally had my much anticipated inaugural State Bird Provisions meal, and it did not disappoint!Review from a vegetarian dining at this restaurant:- The hearts of palm, avocado, and nectarine salad was a party of flavors in a single bowl. There was crunchy, creamy, sweet, salty, and tangy, and yet it all worked beautifully together. Definitely my favorite dish of the evening.- The sweet corn and tomato salad was simple, light, and refreshing. Loved by both carnivores and herbivores alike.- If you're looking for something a little heavier, the corn pancakes are a good option. I thought they were tasty, but not spectacular.- The garlic bread + burrata is a must-have here. It's a tad salty, so you need a good glass of water with it, but the creamy burrata complements the crunchy garlic bread very well.- DESSERTS! Definitely save room for these. Those ice cream sandwiches are so perfect for the end of the meal, and we also got to try their new menu item which was a butter cake with tomatoes and peaches. Very unique flavors. Worth a taste.Note for the non-vegetarians: Although I didn't try it, it was generally agreed upon at my table that the pork belly and plum salad was amazing. Think of every line you have stood in for whatever reason.  I'll argue that whatever you waited for was not as rewarding as waiting in line here.  Willpower is required. If you can't say no to good food you will roll out of there a few pounds heavier.   State Bird has redefined Michelin star service for the better.  Aprons have replaced ties and conversation is the new explantion.I heard Ryan Gosling showed up a few weeks ago.  That's the least exciting thing about this place. The kind of place you don't want to like because of the fact you can't get a reservation, plus the hype.  That being said, this was one of the best dining experiences I've had in the city.  From the host greeting you at the front door, the friendly, unpretentious server explaining the format to the dim sum cart servers.  I loved it.  I think that the dim sum part was the best....athough the fried quail and burrata garlic bread was so tasty, it was the dim sum that won us over.  bone marrow, the steak tartar.  the DESSERT...the ice cream sandwich.  i wish i could go back tomorrow!  want to take my husband there but we'll see if i can get a rez again.  again, the host (a new guy) really set the tone.  he was so personable.  give that guy a raise:) An excellent and exceptional culinary experience. Hands down the most creative yet delectable fare I've ever had. Complexity of flavors and texture all come together beautifully and skillfully arranged on the plate. Love the concept as well; selections of starters and ""mains"" on the menu, but also about a dozen other dishes passed around dim sum style by cart or tray. The fare is outstanding and you should come with a sense of adventure, while knowing nothing other than delicious food will be served to you.  I have been here twice and I'm looking forward to experiencing it again the next time I'm in the city. Food: My mouth is watering, just thinking of it again. It's an East meets West tapas restaurant, where they serve food like yam cha or dim sum, on carts. But there was an option for a tasting menu, which I was guess were for larger groups that were harder to access by cart. It was my friend's party, 8 people. So we got the tasting menu rather than choosing from the cart. Everything that was on the tasting menu was excellant. I'll load up photos at the end of the review. A couple of my friends have been here before and highly recommended the seaweed crackers, which was included in the menu and I was so happy. I usually don't eat fish, but if there are a scattered few pieces I'll definitely eat it, especially for this price point. All 1-8 course I found delicious, but as it got progressively more Asian (I'm Asian, I tend to not eat a lot of Chinese food when I'm out with friends, just because that's all my parents love to eat when we go out together) I wasn't as excited, but they were delicious too. Service: Excellant, our server was attentive and personable. We were a group where only two of us were drinking some sort of extra beverage, and only 1 was alcoholic. But he consistently visited our table and filled our waters, they were never empty. At the start of the meal, he made sure to ask if there were any dietary restrictions, I, oh horrible genes, have a shellfish and peanut allergy. Luckily when I sat down I took  a look at the menu and it looked like there was only 1 conflict, the clam & potato okonomiyaki. And he proceeded to do the same after I had informed him. The person who had planned our dinner had put down his card to hold the table, and when our waiter dropped off the bill, and we had paid our friend. I had to make sure we weren't skipping out on the bill, because my friend had not signed any slip and I didn't see an authorized copy. So we asked our waiter to clarify so we weren't just jumping out on our bill, even if they had his card on hold. Which our server politely went to check on. So the hold card is not charged when you are reserving a party, once you receive the bill you have a choice of paying in cash or using the hold card or another card if you prefer. Do not walk in,  unless you have time to wait and are lucky. It's a 2 hour limit per table. I had overhead from the hostess that it was a 2 month reservation book at this point.Ambiance: The friend, who's dinner this was for, didn't enjoy the pop of color that some of the paintings had, thought it was out of place. It was pretty loud, we had to speak loudly across the table and it was hard to hear what my friends were saying. We were in a small alcove so all the body heat was bouncing around. Probably why we were drinking so much water. A guy who was inline with me for the restroom from San Diego had commented that he felt like he was always in someone's way in restaurants in SF. Which was the case at SBP, you'll have to side step and excuse your way around. We had a reservation at 6, and we got seared right away when we arrived. Love the way that it is dim sum style where they bring around different dishes as well as the menu you can order from. Wait staff super awesome and informative, can flag down anyone and they would help you. On to the food: Really like the pancakes - we tried the corn and duck ones and they were both amazing, probably out favorite dishes of the night.The garlic bread with barrata cheese was so good we got another one at the end of the meal. We also got the steak and salmon tartares. The steak tartare was good but pretty standard. The salmon tartare was about the same except the roasted quinoa was a really nice touch.The Kimchi yuba was interesting but not sure if I'm crazy about the combination. The cumin squid and lamb was good, very strong cumin flavors and left us wanting some rice to go with such an Asian inspired dish.We got the poppy cake and ice cream sandwiches for dessert and they were AMAZING! Best part of the meal!Things that were just meh - The hen dumpling broth was a bit too salty, the green beans with bay shrimp was not memorable at all, lacking flavors. The state bird was fried quail that was just too dry. Overall an amazing experience and will def come back if I can get a reservation again but will likely stick with what I know I liked.o Everything we tried was fantastic. Crispy pork belly and plums, air-dried beef and garlic chips, roasted bone marrow and panna cotta for dessert...plus so much else that went around, dim sum style, that we just couldn't try. Pete, Jesse and John were all great. -Go at least a 1-1.5 hrs early and be prepared to stand outside until they open. -Arrive with a complete party. -If the line is past the hat store, it may be too late. -Make a reservation IF you can! Best meal experience of my life. From the food to the enthusiastic servers, state bird is unrivaled! so good! too good! What can I say that hasn't been written already? Not much.Great spot. Unassuming. Inventive. My recent dinner only confirms the wisdom of the great sage, Peter Griffin, who even as a mere cartoon character knew that ""The Bird is the Word"". Through a computer reservation glitch and a friendly reservation agent, I was able to secure a reservation at SBP. We arrived early to explore Japan Town and by the time dinner rolled around there were about 60 people in line trying to get a table. The answer to your next question is, yes, it is that good. The concept of a cart and passed trays of food options combined with a small menu of standards is brilliant and is executed flawlessly. Nearly everything we tried was unique and well flavored with creative combinations of ingredients. Winners were any dish with duck and the pancakes. The only weak link was a green bean concoction that didn't really pop. For the quality of food and the interesting concept, prices were very reasonable so snag a res and head on down. What a fun spot to eat! We were lucky enough to get a reservation and it was well worth the wait.The staff is so warm and a joy. Every dish has a creative spin and really is such fun to order, eat, and to see what else will come out of the kitchen. I love how the restaurant has a very low key vibe but takes its service and food very seriously. Unfortunately, there was no Ryan Gosling sighting while we dined here.  We went here for my friend's birthday with a group of 16.  The prix fixe menu was awesome because we got to try EVERYTHING that was on the menu that night.  Stuffed full of greatness.  I would go every month if it wasn't impossible to get seated.  Well worth the wait! fun, different and tasty! another thing that added to my great experience was the staff. its gets 5 stars for 1. great, innovative food (not to mention dim sum style- love it), 2. excellent service, 3. parking wasnt THAT bad, 4. CLEAN and aesthetically pleasing, 5. the ambiance (loved that the kitchen was part of the dining experience). my fave would have to be dessert and that says a lot because im not quite the dessert person. be sure to get the ice cream sandwiches and the poppy seed cake- it wasnt too sweet and everything was perfectly balanced. As far as the savory portion goes- im not sure what to rank because they were all just too good. ENJOY Good luck waiting in line for an hour or two to put your name down, only to wait another 2 hours for your reservation time OR trying to get reservation online, if that, are about 2 months out. Unless of course, your Ryan Gosling, then which certainly, you'll be seated without a wait.Aside from the ridiculous test of your patience, the food is definitely worth trying! The state bird - quail - was sooo delicious, I know to get the bigger serving next time! The burrata bread - Wow, I was hesitate to send $4 on what looked like a cheese and bread roll (I mean, it's what it is) but of all dishes, I can't get this off my mind!!!!The Dim Sum style carts are a nice touch. Everything is nicely plated and all-in-all was a great experience. You get to see your food prior to ordering and the waiters are helpful in describing the goodness. TIP #1: You're unlikely to snag a reservation. Get in line around 4:30PM--as long as you're not past the hat shop next door, you're golden!TIP #2: Beer and wine only, but there's a huge selection.Worth the wait. That's really all you need to know because as you're standing in line, shivering as the fog rolls in, you will, inevitably, question your sanity and doubt the awesome reputation of State Bird Provisions. Just know that it's worth the wait. Every few minutes while dining at State Bird is another chance at a culinary excursion. The plates are as delicious as they look. The waiters will happily explain a dish, give their recommendations, and take requests for more. It's quite a hustle and bustle, as waiters push their carts and hawk their wares, but the large space and high, generous skylights make the experience communal and grand. It's exciting, and everyone around you is just as excited as you are!Give everything that piques your interest a try, and be sure to save room for dessert! This place is worth the hype. The tapas style food is reasonable priced yet still sophisticated. The only dish our table really didn't like was the duck liver moose with almond biscuits. The biscuits were so so sweet the really didn't go together. My favorite was the State Bird Provision and the Poppy Seed Cake.  Everything we ordered off the menu was fantastic. The servers come around VERY frequently with other dishes offered. It felt like a Brazilian steak house that is constantly bringing meat to the table. We were joking that we wished we could put the stop sign out because it was becoming over whelming. Overall dinner was a great experience, good ambiance and relaxed atmosphere. There's not much I can say about State Bird Provisions that hasn't been said by foodies that are way more eloquent than me. The only thing I can add is: This is the best Michelin Starred restaurant for the buck, period. Food is great, service is good, ordering bits and pieces of everything so you can sample the entire menu = AMAZEBALLS. Definitely worth the visit, and the wait, to get onto the walk-in wait list. I have heard a lot about this place and finally got a chance to try thanks to my friend who booked this place 60 days in advance. The food was tasty, but what State Bird really stood out was their creativity and service. Our waiter was awesome along with every single staff we encountered at the restaurant that night. They serve their food dim sum style (you can order al la carte also); some come in the little dim sum carts and some come in a tray. The dim sum style is great for sharing so everyone gets to try more variety of food. The 3 of us ate 17 dishes including dessert and none of them were disappointing, although some were definitely better than the others. If you eat like a bird or simply cannot consume everything they offer, then definitely try their porcini & duck fried rice, guinea hen dumpling, state bird with provisions, beef tongue and guanciale chawanmushi, and the panna cotta and poppy seed cake for desserts. Ate here last night. I now want to eat here every night. We sat at the left end of the Chef's Counter, which are by far the best seats in the house. Everything coming out of the kitchen gets offered to you first. This is a blessing and a curse. The blessing part was, of course, the food. You get to watch everything get prepared meticulously. You get to smell everything as it comes off of the line. And you get the entire kitchen telling you exactly what to eat and why. The curse part was trying to will my stomach to digest food faster so I could, in turn, stuff my face with more delicious things. We had to stop after trying 18 dishes. I think I could've done 20, but I also think I might've ruptured something by then, so I quit while I was (mostly) ahead.It's basically a culinary orgasm, over and over with each new dish. Pickled this, fermented that, added into this other thing you may have had before, but never prepared like this. Yes, it's near impossible to get a table here. But you should try. It's worth every ounce of effort. This place is amazing, and unlike many places of its caliber -- actually lives up to its hype (at least in this yelper's opinion!).  As many have mentioned, the wait is infamous -- particularly on a Friday or Saturday.  I got to SBP at 5 p.m. (they open at 530 p.m.) and there was already a line out the door, leaving our table of 3 an opening at 11 p.m. (their last seating).However, the staff are clearly well-versed in getting everyone situated for a SBP reservation and handled everything very smoothly.  Once there, the food did not disappoint.  Just as food is served dim sum style, the composition of the food itself is clearly a fusion of different cuisines and ingredients.  My personal favorites were the guinea hen dumpling, the pork belly with plum, steak tartare, tofu and pork cheek (there's a fancier name but I forget it now), and CA state bird with provisions.The bill was extremely reasonable as well, and with two glasses of wine plus a round of dessert, it came out to be ~$160 for three people (including tax and tip). Definitely a staple on the often crowded and hyped San Francisco food scene, and one I look forward to going back to time and time again (esp. as they source seasonal fruits and vegetables and have rotating menus based on it), even if it does end up being at 11 p.m. :) A very worthy 3 months wait.  We feast on this new American dim sum style with nothing to disappoint. Ben, our server was awesome,  he knew just what to recommend to us.  But everyone is very friendly from the hostest to the entire wait staff.  Great vibe, fun and electic ambience.   It would probably be fun to sit at the counter and watch how food is prep.  Perhaps next time!Amazing food.  We venture out and tried 15 differences dishes, all were great but my favorite are: whole state bird, the duck livermouse,  the bone marrow,  the cast iron quail eggs, the duck pancake,  chip and dip, and off course Kushi oysters.  For deserts both the poppy seed cake and the icecream sandwich was delicious.We also order a bottle of Palazzone Therra, a Santa Ynez Valley Cab blend that paired quite well with all our foods.  For the non alcoholic drinker the Cherry Soda is also a great choice. And the best part is the price is right!Well done State Bird! Well done chef! We will be back as soon as I can get ourself back on the reservation,  sorry I don't do line ;) although I heard that's the best way to get in. One of the hardest places to get a table in the city but so worth it every time we go. How can so many dishes be so darn tasty! I'm mystified in the best way. Ingredient combinations that should not work do. Last night we went got my birthday with a group of 8 so we sat at one of the large tables. The serving style is different with a set menu and everything brought family style. It's a bit overwhelming but we soldiered through the four courses. The highlights of the appetizers were the trout chip and dip and the poke-style halibut on a black sesame chip. Both seriously addictive. The second round top dish is the duck fried rice. And you can't forget the burrata in garlic bread. Heaven. We were getting stuffed by round three. This is when my fave state bird, the fried quail appears!  Yum. Red trout was also delicious. For dessert, the hands down best was the finger ice cream sandwich with lemon verbena chocolate crunch. The service is great. Even with the crazy popularity, they manage to stay friendly and attentive. This place is worth the effort and justifies the hype. Loved this American dim sum expierence, I didn't make a reservation just waited in line when they opened. I would suggest doing that if you are in the neighborhood. Prices weren't as bad as I thought it would've been. We were full paid 86 bucks for 2 people including drinks. And we tried most of the items brought to us. Would definitely come back! Meh.. We gave up a reservation at Gary Danko's to eat here because a friend's friend was raving about it. Queued up at 4pm, which I didn't really mind. There were already around 6 parties before us. It was nice that you could peek into the window to see what the kitchen staff were up to. Was cold in the queue (1 month ago) but there's a Starbucks 100 ft down the road which you can pop into to thaw / get a hot drink. I honestly thought the food was only ok, not great. We got quite a lot of the ""dim sum pushcart"" options, plus others on the paper menu. Not going to go into the details of exactly what was great and what wasn't, but overall, I thought it was only ok. Can't get over the fact that we could have eaten at Gary D instead. Of course, they are at different price points, but... Wahh. I was seriously hoping that I would be able to give this place a 5 star rating, but unfortunately, that would require for me to break the Golden Rule of Yelp. Thou shall not lie on Yelp. While the food probably would've earned them a solid 3 stars, the service sucked ass. Let's start with the wait. My dear friends got there at 5pm to line up for a spot. Of course, we made the rookie mistake of having a large party of 6. Now, I wasn't there to witness this, but from what I heard, my friends were told to step aside while the hostess tried to figure out our situation for 6. Meanwhile, the people behind us got on the list ahead of us. No biggie about that though, we eventually got on the list even if it meant dinner at 9:45.At 8:40, I decided that I simply couldn't wait any longer. Here's where the State Bird Provisions staff failed to impress. The hostess was unwilling to accommodate. When we told her that we would go from 6 people to 5, she gave us a really hard time. Telling us that a table was ready for us, even though this was the first we've heard of this and we didn't receive the promised text. To avoid any issues, I decided to stay for dinner. It literally took less than a minute to let her know that it will be 6 after all, but apparently that wasn't quick enough, because we've lost our chance at the table. Funny though, we stood by the door and no one was taken back to be seated at the table that was ready. Then the hostess unpleasantly asked us if we would be open to splitting up because we would have a better chance to getting a table sooner. Otherwise, we would have a table for 6 at 9:45. We said sure, we're open to splitting up, but if we're waiting till the end, we'd like to sit together. It was a celebratory dinner for my friend who's back in town from med school after all!We were seated roughly at 10:05, making us the very last group to be seated. No apologies for seating us 20 minutes later the initial 9:45 timeline. In fact, the hostess acted like she was doing us a favor by seating us at all. If we were 20 minutes late, we certainly would've lost our table. But you know, this is our time vs. State Bird Provisions time. By the look of things, they have no consideration for their customer's time at all. On top of that, she split up our group. She had the nerve to say ""This is what we were talking about, remember?"" NO. We don't remember. Don't try to play us like this is what you've been telling us this whole time. It just seems like she would rather split us up and not let us sit at the large table because that would mean we would have to wait a bit longer and all of the staff would have to stay later. I'm pretty sure that all of us couldn't have misheard. I can honestly say that my interaction with the hostess was one of the most unpleasant experience I've had with anyone in the service industry. She had a fake smile on her face when she talked to you and would literally scowl when you walked away. #thoushallnotlieonyelpHow about the food? I'm not even going to go into detail about that because my experience was so terrible. Let's just say that the food is their saving grace, but certainly not good enough to redeem them from the horrible service. The flavoring wasn't so unique for my Asian palate. In fact, my tastes buds recognized most of the flavors - although admittedly, I'm used to them in a different form and consistency.I'm likely never going to be back again. I have had the privilege of eating here twice now, and I can't wait until I get another opportunity to come back. Their tartares are absolutely worth ordering (forget your squeamishness over raw food and just trust me on this), as well as their ice cream sandwich dessert (whatever the flavor -- just do it, but ESPECIALLY if chocolate's involved).The highlight of the meal definitely had to be the salmon tartare (sadly not pictured), the ""constructable"" with the halibut tartare (those of you who love the nori seaweed cracker dish of old, this is it's newest incarnation and it's to die for), and the ""shortstack"" with the smoked duck. I'm pretty sure I cried when I bit into that food. I'm so sad that they took the smoked trout, egg and potato porridge off the menu!! State Bird, please bring it back (and keep these other ""commandables"" on there too) and I promise you I will gorge myself and die happy.For three people, sharing ~10 dishes and 2 of us ordering drinks, the total was roughly $120-130 (I don't remember exactly; I was sort of in a food coma). Not too shabby! Thank goodness getting reservations here are next to impossible -- I don't think my waistline could take that kind of abuse regularly! Sometimes you find a hidden gem and you're one of the first Yelp reviewers. Or sometimes you just pile onto the existing accolades for a well-deserving food haven. When my friend offered to share a reservation her friend could not use, I approached with a healthy dose of skepticism. No place could merit this much hype, right? And do I really need hen inside my dumpling or duck & porcini mushrooms on my fried rice? Turns out, yes, YES I do. Everything we tried, from the oysters to the fried rice to the 'chip and dip' salmon tartare was sublime. No, it was F-ing delicious! The partly dim-sum style of service means the food comes fast with lots of chances to try stuff that may not appeal on a menu description. We had a tiny bit of room for dessert and the mini choco crepes perfectly closed the meal (even though we were still staring at what we didn't try on passing trays). And, for a place with so much hype and people making 5am reservations three months out, the bill was surprisingly decent -- around $90 including 2 glasses of sparkling wine. I will be back -- just gotta find someone else who has a friend giving up a highly sought after reservation. Thanks Kimberly and whomever you are, Angela Yi. I was excited to try State Bird as I was driving and humming ""bird is the word"" song on Family Guy on REPEAT.I had a hard time finding the restaurant. The entrance is discreet but I'll let you guys figure it out.Dim sum style, I enjoyed everything that we ordered - the oysters, duck liver mousse, hen dumpling, steak tartare, ca state bird provisions, porcini and duck fried rice, smoked trout-avocado chip and dip, king salmon tartare with bone marrow, and lemon verbena chocolate crunch ice cream sandwich.recommend:stmoked trout-avocado chip and dip with compliments well with king salmon tartare and the lemon verbena chocolate crunch ice cream sandwich.avoid:duck liver mousse - it was AIGHT, and steak tartare. lets just say, i had a queasy stomach the next morning. how did i determine the steak tartare contributed to the queasiness? my gf and i ate everything we ordered but the steak tartare since she does not eat beef - so there you go! overall, service was fantastic and attentive, and the food MINUS the steak tartare was excellent. I'm going to keep this short since it's not like this delightful place needs any additional accolades.  Here are my tips:1) If you're going to forgo waking up at 5am to make a resi online, then arrive EARLY (I'm talking 4pm) to get in to the first seating at 5:30. I know it sounds crazy, that's because it is. And I can't event believe i'm saying this but--IT'S WORTH IT.2) Bread rolls with burrata. Words would not do this godly creation justice--but it's perfection. order it now.3) Pork belly4) They allow you to order a ""half dessert"" it's amazing. So now you can order half of everything.5) You will leave FULL because of the dim sum ""eyes-are-bigger-than-my-stomach-syndrome.""6) I felt that for everything we got (including an $80 bottle of wine) the bill was surprisingly lower than I would have been willing to pay for such a delicious meal.I want to go back again and again and again. (and i'll get smart and order at least 3 of those bread/burrata things) My second time at State Bird (post-renovations) was a much more pleasant experience! Our waiter was very friendly and was on top of his A game - he checked up on our table often and was a pleasure to interact with throughout the night. The food that we ordered off the menu was delicious (the trout and the smoked duck pancakes - wow!) and came quickly. The ice cream dessert was out of this world, and was again my favorite dessert. But my favorite dish remains the deconstructed seaweed cracker (formerly the nori seaweed cracker). We ordered a large ($22) amongst the three of us and I was in heaven with every single bite. I LOVE State Bird! It's a good thing that reservations are hard to come by or I would gain so much weight and be so poor from eating here all the time. :) the best part is the wines by the glass. not sure the food is as spectacular, maybe we ordered the wrong things. some dishes just seemed like they were trying to hard to be 'inventive' by throwing random bits of food together. the concept is fun, and sorta shakes up your traditional approach to ordering/dining. it does make for a v large bill at the end, tho. Good but does not meet the hype. The one amazing dish is the ice cream sandwich dessert. It's unreal. I know, doesn't sound like it, but just try it. If you want a spectacular dinner, go down the street to SPQR and prepare to have your mind blown. I love the food. But the entrees aren't really entrees. Just order two of everything to get a normal sized dish. Its expensive but cash money lifestyle you hurr me. James Beard Award for Best New Restaurant 2013One Michelin StarMade Reservations On LineI've been wanting to try this place out and I'm glad I was able to get a reservation.  It's your American Style Dim Sum type place.  Staff comes out to your table with trays/cart of different dishes.  We arrived about half an hour before our reservation.  To my surprise, we got seated right away.  The night started off really SLOW.  We sat at our table for about 5 minutes before getting acknowledged.  Then, we waited for another 15 minutes for the first tray to arrive and another 15-20 minutes after that.  Thank goodness for our server, who noticed and got things moving along by having staff come to us first.  Great service to him!The food was really TASTEFUL.  I had lots of favorites that night and was amazed as to how much flavor those little dishes had.  My taste buds were awaken that night!  I wish I had room to try desserts, but my husband and I kept trying everything they brought us.  My favorite that night was the Guinea Hen Dumpling w/Aromatic Broth, it was so good!  My least favorite was the Duck Liver Mousse.  The biscuit was good, but the mousse, just not my thing.  Here is a list of what we had (missing a few since I have more pictures than what I have listed, lol).My Favorites! -CA State Bird w/ Provisions (Fried Quail) this was perfect! -Guinea Hen Dumpling w/Aromatic Broth (savor and taste every bite, it's so good, my mouth watered every time they walked passed our table) -Spicy Steak Tartare (this was spicy but really good!)-Smoked Trout-Avocado 'Chip & Dip' (yummy!)-Pork Belly Plum Salad (OMG so good!! all I needed was rice)-Raw Oyster w/Spicy Kohlrabi Kraut & Sesame-Garlic Bread w/BurrataWe also had these dishes, which was okay, but my husband loved.-Duck & Fontina Croquettes-Guanciale Chawanmushi-Duck Liver Mousse w/Almond Biscuit Good food, but I would call it mind lowing. Def worth a try. Dumplings, oysters and custard were really really yummy. Very disappointed though with steak tartare . Dessert was great! As for the derive - superb! And helpful with the wine list! Food's ok but nothing memorable.  A bit of a feeding frenzy as trays keep appearing and you keep saying ""yes"" hoping each new thing will be the magical concoction you were expecting but I was almost always disappointed. The oysters were weird. The hen dumplings bland. The pork belly with plums boring, the ice cream sandwich just plain silly.  Good wine selection however to make you forget it all.  Before coming I stopped at Palmers for happy hour and had their meatballs and that was the best thing I had last night. This place is freakin' amazing.I have to admit, after hearing all the hype, I was expecting something to be a little bit off. Maybe the service would be a bit pretentious. Maybe it would be good, but not worth the price. Nope - everything was on point. Service was gracious and professional. Atmosphere was also great, you don't sit on top of other parties and you don't feel like you're being rushed. The food was amazing. I loved so many of the dishes that I can't pick a favorite.  And, the price was right for the quality of the food and the experience.I went with three of my girlfriends and we all agreed that this was one of the best meals we have ever had. If you have the opportunity to eat here - go. HYPEEEEEEE........I hate it when I get tricked into hype. The only cool thing about this place is that they serve food Dim Sum style. You can choose foods that you want or pass on to the next cart. But that's like all Chinese Dim Sum restaurants. Was the food mind blowing? No.They were different, yes, but did not mesh well together. No need for reservations, get there a little earlier to line up and you're most likely to get a seat. We visited early Spring without a reservation through their online reservation system. In hindsight, I should've asked the concierge service on my Amex to book it.If you fail at getting a reservation the old fashioned way like I did, don't fret as they accept walk-ins. The trick is arriving early before they open: we arrived at 4:30 pm on a weekday and they open for walk-ins at 5:15 pm. i.e. you're waiting in line outside so prepare for colorful pan handing and bring a book. Food: AmazingStaff and Service: AmazingReservation process: Does it exist? If you can come early and don't mind waiting in line, this will likely be the best way to get seatedSee if you can be seated at the bar by the kitchen area - the chef(s) will engage you and you can see whats coming next on the dim sum style menu. I give it 3.5 stars but rounded up because of the yummy ice cream sandwich and tartar. I have had my eye on this place for over a year and I just thought it was impossible to ever come here because you cant call for reservations and doing it online is impossible unless a spot magically appears on a weekday night. It says there are not reservation for months ahead so that seemed pointless. My sister had gone one time and waited an hour for the open seating and it worked so I tried that as well. Just like Orenchis status, I got in line at 4:30pm on Sunday, an hour before opening and stood in line. Our group was probably the 7th party so we had to be seated. That hour is pretty miserable since it is cold but I guess you can watch them make the food. Origin SF is right across which I hear is the next poppin club. You wouldnt even know that it is State Bird because there is no sign. I wonder how Ryan Gosling found this place haha. I wonder which godly seat he sat in when that photo circulated among my friends. The doors opened and I am not sure if the huge line behind me was able to all be seated. If not, it would suck because the second wave would have to wait until someone from the first wave finished, which would be 90 minutes later. I say if you miss the first boat or you know you wont make the first round, save yourself some time and come around 7 or so because by then there were a few empty seats. I am not sure if those would be used for reservations or for walk-ins but there was no line outside when I left at 7:30pm. So at 5:30pm we were seated at a booth and it actually looked a lot more modest looking than I expected. I was imagining some fine dining but it felt quite hipster SF in there. It is dim sum style so people come around with trays and a cart. You can also order from the menu which we did as well. The waiters are attentive and nice but it is sorta hard to catch their eye when you want one of their dishes. The items definitely started to add up and each of the six ended up paying $40 including tax and tip. We got the following from the dim sum items:1) Beef strips- we ordered two of these and only one was necessary. Tasted good but nothing crazy.2) Mushroom ravioli- One order comes with one ravioli so we cut two into four pieces each. I dont think the tiny size allowed me to really appreciate what I was eating. I would pass. 3) Oysters- there was some ginger type thing on top that none of us liked so we just ate the oyster. It was fresh but it was $3 for a tiny one. Dont think the size/taste justified the price. 4) Tar Tar with some type of fish- I thought this was good because the quinoa was crunchy and added great taste and texture. I recommend. 5) Mushroom porridge- Not my fave. 6) Garlic bread with burrata- Not my fave. The burrata was just way too much. 7) Fried pork belly- this is just fried fat with some pork. It is like what you would get at a Chinese restaurant. 8) Salmon- The presentation was nice since it was a long strip of salmon but it tasted average. From the menu:1) Fried Quail- this is what the restaurant is named after and I couldnt really taste the quail since the fried breading was just too much. Unfortunately not my fave. You can do half orders since each order comes with four so we did 1.5 orders.2) Duck Fried Rice- This was one of the better dishes since the duck was flavorful but you can probably get this at another Chinese restaurant. 3) Halibut tartar- this was my favorite savory dish. The seaweed was the perfect holder of the tartar and it was so crunchy good. I loved mixing it with the fish and the avocado! Great dish and I highly recommend it. 4) Poppy seed cake- this dessert comes with little cubes of this cake that has a denser texture than a regular cake. It was good but by far my most favorite item was the ice cream sandwich. 5) Ice cream sandwich- I LOVEDDD this. You can do half orders as well but we just did one order that came with four pieces. The sandwich part is like rice crispies which is something I have never had before. It was a great texture. It was vanilla ice cream with chocolate chunk pieces within the ice cream. Ahhh it was heavenly and I loved it!I have had tapa places and I feel like because of the appearance of exclusivity, it has been a little overhyped. Some dishes were a hit but others will make you feel confused on whether you are judging the dish correctly.**TIPS**1) Come 45min-1 hour before opening so you can snag a spot in the first round. If you know you cant make it, just try at 7pm hopefully.2) Go with a group so you can try different things. If you only go with one person, you can try to eat everything since the dishes are small but you wont finish it all and you wont be able to try as much. I think a good size group is 4-6 if you dont mind splitting multiple little dishes. It will add up though.3) You musttt get the Halibut tartar and the ice cream sandwich. I would throw in the duck fried rice for funsi I like eating weird food as much as the next guy. But when you go over the top, you just lose me.Pointing at SBP.First off, getting a reservation (via the traditional sense) is near impossible. In other words, it's impossible. But if you have a credit card that has a concierge service, go that route as they will make it happen. Don't get me wrong, I liked the food here. But it just didn't blow me away. I did like the fact that eating here is also a learning experience. Color me stupid, but I had no idea there was seafood in kimchee. The service is 5 star and the staff right on top of things. My take, if you are just DYNG to go here, I'd say go for it. But if you are just looking for a nice meal out without having to think about what you're about to consume, then just head elsewhere. I really would give SBP 3 1/2 stars, and I am in no mood for rounding up. The Bold Italic recently featured a study claiming it's harder to land a reservation at State Bird than to get admitted to Stanford. Does any restaurant, no matter how good, deserve this much hype?I was lucky enough to have an insomniac friend who happened to be awake at 5am so she could book us a dinner date 3 months in advance.But I was skeptical at first. Any restaurant that tries to churn out ""East-West fusion cuisine"" for high-end prices leaves me with low expectations. Even more so once I stepped foot inside, and spotted the playful (almost childish) decor. I was definitely expecting something a little more fancy.But as soon as I started my meal, everything all started to come together and make sense. Cute waiters were carting around little dishes -- just as they would at any real dim sum restaurant -- and you could just order at your leisure. And I have to say that the Asian-inspired (yet still distinctly Western-flavored) dishes were TASTY. Say what you will, but State Bird is incredibly creative and fun. Every bite I took was filled with unique bold flavors and layers of texture.My friends and I shared the following:- duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - garlic bread with burrata- tombo tuna-avocado and seaweed cracker (by far one of our faves)- State Bird (we had to! of course it lived up to its name)OMG and so much more that I can't even find online. Definitely don't skimp on the Chinese-style pancakes -- again, I almost didn't get this as I couldn't imagine it would taste good, but I was pleasantly surprised. I've since learned that you can't go wrong with anything here, so order whatever appeals to you.State Bird is the kind of restaurant that makes you proud to live in San Francisco. Keep up the good work, SB! so many great things about this place! however, minus one star for the terrible allergic reaction i suffered hours later (i've never been allergic to anything in my life...until now lol. and i can't even pinpoint to what it could have been since we ordered 10+ plates). but honestly, i'd say that the food/ experience was worth the $150 copay to the ER... i probably will never go back to state bird though =(.. haha!do yourself a favor, set your alarm at midnight to make a reservation 2 months from now. The line looked ridiculous and i felt like i was hot shit being let in first right when they opened. my most favorite plates: 1) crispy pork belly. sooooo yummy and all of the ingredients really did mesh well together. (plum, vinaigrette sauce, bronze fennel) 2) bone marrow- there was a ton of shit in this plate...i couldn't tell you what exactly, but it was perfect with the sea salt. everyone says the ca state bird with provisions is the best, but honestly i thought it was overhyped. it was tasty, but not the highlight of my meal. just tasted like a different type of fried chicken. the waiters/waitresses deserve 5 stars. they were extremely attentive and knew every detail about each dish. we ordered about 11-12 dishes that were split between 2, the bill came out to around $110. not bad considering i was pretty full and i have a heavy appetite. i'd like to say that i'd come back, but i fear the itchiness and rashes. would recommend it to anyone anyday though! I was so lucky to score seats to such a highly rated restaurant! Reservations are done months in advance (thanks to my boyfriend's brother) and it makes the whole seating process a lot quicker. Without reservations, you would have to wait outside as if you were at Disneyland waiting to ride Splash Mountain. A section of their seating is reserved for walk-ins, and as long as you line up at least an hour before they open (yes, there is already a small line outside by 3:30pm... and they open at 5:30pm), you can get seats. Also, this isn't the place for large groups. I don't recommend you to bring your kids neither. I would say parties of 4 at max. Better yet, go with 2. Perfect date setting.The décor is extremely plain but yet also nice at the same time. Maybe its because of the lighting? But the walls are just one of those plain walls with holes that you can place hooks on them  (sorry for the lack of vocab). The place is pretty spacious, despite a packed house, with servers running around with trays or carts of small dishes. The servers would come around and explain everything in the dish, giving you a few moments to decide before moving on. They also list a price on a little stand so you can definitely decide if you want to take the dish or not. The quality of the food was phenomenal, and everything was really delicious. Pricing was more on the expensive side. I mean it is good food but the portion was small, but then enough to share. There are 12 items that are served around by the servers, and the rest are on the menus. We didn't get all 12 dishes though. Where to begin with the food? It's tough, as everything was good! Let's start with what I really liked.-- Raw oysters with spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesame: I love the fact that it was not too large like Boiling Crabs. Sounds crazy right? But I enjoy eating smaller size because it lets you enjoy more of other flavors rather than a chunk of blob. The flavors mixed so well together where you can't taste the fishiness. They were fresh as well. -- Steak tartar with jimmy nardello ranch - Really delicious and I didn't realized that I was eating raw beef because I thought it was tuna or something, until my boyfriend told me. The entire dish was well put together.-- Salmon tartar with pickled turnips - A better choice for tartar over the steak version if you don't want to eat raw beef. This tasted a lot lighter and this time you can tell that it is seafood, not beef haha.I guess its more on the normal side of eating something raw.--Ca State Bird: This tasted soooooo good! The cheese and onions went so well together with this and I just gobbled the whole thing down. The smell was great and the taste was even better! My boyfriend's mom keeps putting onions on my bird but turns out it was cheese and I felt so fat after eating it lol-- Corn & quinoa 'tabouleh' -A really fresh dish that looked super healthy. The flavor and satisfaction was all there for me. I can eat quinoa every day!-- Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - (not my favorite, but it is my boyfriend's brother) I only like the biscuit because the duck liver was too overpowering for me. This was one of our first dishes, and we were left wanting more after finishing every last bit of it (well they boys wanted more of everything.. I just wanted the biscuits)-- Roasted bone marrow with mushrooms & pink peppercorn: For people who like bone marrow, this is for you. The flavor was a little too rich for me but still tasteful. The size was just right for 3-4 people to share, unless you really like bone marrows and you want the whole thing to yourself...feel free.--Garlic Bread With Burrata: I'm sorry, but this was the only meal that was gonna bleh to me. It tasted way too cheesy and garlicy for me that I totally lost my taste. I only took one bite and I was done.Dessert-- Birdseed bittersweet chocolate crunch, caramel cloud cream, blueberries - A great end to an excellent meal! The chocolate crunch was really light. I wanted more after each bite. The biscuit was so deliciously moist and soft. The cloud cream was so fluffy and cold. I love how it was served on a random piece of wood.-- Green tea granita with ginger-vanilla tapioca & roasted strawberries- It has an icy/ slushie taste, which was really nice as well. Nothing too special about this but it was very light and refreshing.For the amount of food we ordered, we could have easily paid a lot more than what was on our bill. Our bill came out to be a little under $200 for 4 people. The food was really enjoyable and quite memorable. Dining at State Bird Provisions is an experience, and it definitely lives up to all the high reviews. I just reserved another time for me and my brother! We followed Yelper's advice and arrived a bit before they opened to get our name on the walk in wait list. The couples before us receive the last 7:30 slot, therefore, we got the 8:30 slot. Damn.  I wanted to dine here for a long time, so I felt that it was justified waiting three hours to eat. First question that popped into my head, after dining here, was it worth the wait? Nah. Second question would be, was it delicious? It was indeed.I love the restaurant's concept but hated the stool eating area. My boyfriend and I complained that our back hurt after eating there. I am guessing it's due to the seating arrangement. However, sitting on these damn stools afforded us an awesome view of the kitchen, the very tiny kitchen. They explained their dining procedures; it is very much like dim sum eating. I love this concept because we were able to taste a vast array of food items without having to order a full order. We did order some menu items, which was the bone marrow, the oat covered sweetbreads, and quail eggs. HOLY MOLY! I enjoyed all three. The sweetbreads were freaking delicious. I never eaten sweetbreads before but I have heard that if prepared well, they are great! They prepared it amazingly and the broth added a nice flavorful touch to the crunch of the meat. The quail egg yolks added such a nice coat of flavor on your tongue. The eggs flavored well with all the ingredients in the dish. Finally, the bone marrow was the best one I have ever eaten. The bone was heavy with marrow and the red peppercorns added such a nice flavor. The mushrooms in the marrow added a meaty texture that married well with the oily meaty marrow. All the dim sum type things we ordered were okay. I cannot even recall the five items anymore. They were not as remarkable as the meals we ordered. I remember one of them being oysters, I have had better oysters elsewhere. Oh, one thing I do recall is their garlic bread. Get that. That was crunchy, soft, garlicky heaven in my mouth. The desserts? Get the milk shots. It was like peanut butter milk; it was absolutely refreshing and delicious. We ordered the dark chocolate crepes. That was a nice finish to the evening. It was sweet but not overly sweet. The pistachios, strawberries, crepes, and sauce all worked well together. It had all sorts of textures that were extremely pleasing to taste buds. State Bird Provisions is making a huge fuss.  I didn't want to believe the hype, but i my predispositions were pleasantly overturned upon dining here.  The standalone menu offers a variety of tapas that you can pair with their extensive (in both price and breadth) wine list.  Excellent service and delivery.  Really like the ambiance of the open air kitchen where you can see all the magic happen.  Alongside the standalone tapas, chefs will swing by your dining area with freshly prepared daily specials, much like a contemporary dimsum.  The cuisine here can be classified best as fusion.  The flavors offer a melting pot of influences that really demonstrate the chef's knowledge of local and international flavors.While all dishes were fantastic, here is what was particularly memorable:-  Raw Oyster with Spicy Kohlrabi Kraut and Sesame-  Duck Liver Mousse with Almond Biscuits-  Tuna TarTar & Seaweed Crackers-  Pork Belly Plum Salad-  Sourdough, Sauerkraut and Percorino Pancake-  Bone Marrow Roasted with Trumpet MushroomsPROTIP:  Do what you can do score a reservation.  I was wowed by the value put out by SBP.  Bold flavors, and even bolder pricing.  The michelin star here is completely warranted.  I'm excited to see them push the culinary envelope in the coming years. Truly an amazing dining experience. If you live in SF and you haven't eaten here yet, just go already!When we were there, the menu was very heavy on seafood. We had chips with roe and creme fraiche, trout tartare, uni pancake, crab kimchee soba (absolutely fantastic), beef riblettes, and french bread with burrata.Zero complaints, zero issues. Can't wait to eat here again. The most amazing Chinese concept of dim sum turned modern American!  My favorite items were the ceviche style halibut with the fried seaweed, bone marrow, state bird, duck croquet and ice cream sandwich!The fried seaweed was a perfect salty crunch and scooper for the Ceviche halibut was refreshing and light.Bone Marrow- melt in your mouth! I scooped every morsel out!Duck croquet-fontina cheese and shredded duck with almost a hoisin style sauce.  Felt like a roast duck enrobed in cheese!Ice cream sandwich- similar to a French macaron shell with lemon verbena and chocolate morsels inside. Topped with a plum and chocolate sauce!  Yummmm!!I just ate there last night and I'm already having residual palate needs for the statebird and halibut this evening!  *SighHence the daunting line-I will be back!!! Like a culinary playground for your mouth!  So many textures and favors that you don't get bored. However I felt there were so many heavy tasty bites that I found myself looking for something refreshing to reawaken my palate. Very cool concept. The food overall was pretty good and it was nice to try so many dishes! The portions are so small that even if you don't like it then it only a bite or two :). Go in a group of four so you can try more stuff. I've never waited in line for so long before but it's worth the wait! Eating here is an experience! I love that they serve dim sum style and everyone is super friendly. Their entire menu is so unique and creative that you just want to eat everything that comes around, but don't worry the portions are perfect so that you can try a lot of the small plates that serve you just enough to satisfy you. Also, don't forget to look over the menu that you can order additional items from! I know that making reservations for State Bird online is almost like a lottery, or registering for classes that you're in dire need of, but I hope that doesn't discourage you from ever trying this place! Parking is also fairly easy around the restaurant. If you have to, you can easily use the Japan center garage that's just across the street, but street parkings should become free around the time you come for dinner! Wow. FAN.TAS.TIC. This is absolutely one of my favorite meals I've ever had.  Good luck getting in...but totally worth the time and money.  The food was beyond words! There are no words in all the world's languages to describe how phenomenally, exquisitely and sublimely delightful this place's food is. It is, by far, the best meal I've ever had. It's also the most expensive meal I've ever had, but it's just so mind-blowingly amazing I would've gladly paid double.The pork belly and plum salad, paired with a 1979 bottle of cab (yes, the year's correct), danced along my taste buds like a culinary ballet, melding and meshing to create an earth-shattering mouthgasm like none other.Oh, the kimchi was also amazing, as was the smoked salmon tartare. To top it all off, the dessert shot tasted like a liquid Reese's pieces.I took pics, but refrained from posting them. Pictures simply do not do this food justice. It'd be an affront to the food to even entertain the crazy thought that a mere picture could capture the divine essence of these epicurean masterpieces (impeccably presented as they were).Simply put, you need to experience this for yourself. Whether you book a reservation months in advance, or walk in and brace the four hour wait, I can assure you it's worth every minute of the wait, and every last, solitary cent.Will definitely be returning. Amazing dimsum-style fusion restaurant. Just say yes to every dish they offer you and you can't go wrong. Possibly the best place I've ever eaten. So good. Amazing. We got in line at 4:30 p.m. on a Monday to get a reservation. Worth it. Got a reservation for 9 p.m. Worth it. The hostess is possibly the sweetest person ever. Even got a selfie with her. Once 9 p.m. arrived, we were seated and immediately greeted. Place a few orders, and then the food started coming around. What a fun, crazy experience. I have never experience anything like it. Different waiters begin bringing around different dishes to purchase as they are created. So fun. Have a drink or two, and you will have the greatest time of your life and try a lot of amazing food. The pheasant was great, and wow, the BONE MARROW (OMG!!!) so good. We laughed, ate great food, drank awesome wine, and made some great memories with new and old friends. Loved it. Worth the wait. Totally. Wow. FAN.TAS.TIC. This is absolutely one of my favorite meals I've ever had. Here we go...THE WAITNo reservations available online. We arrived at 4:30pm on a Friday - ended up being  around the 12th party in line. Got seated once the doors opened - there were only 2 of us. A group immediately behind me in line had 6 people, and I saw them sit down after we were done eating which means they might have waited 2 more hours AFTER the place opened. Crazy. SEATINGIt was larger than I expected inside. I had read that sitting at the counter was the best seat so that will be my goal next time - plus then you can see all the dishes and know that you've seen everything. My friend kept wondering if more food was going to come around and what she was possibly missing out on. Anyway, we were seated at a booth in the back. Very comfy and great view of the whole place. We also had no problems getting to see each dish. Nothing ran out by the time it got to us, or if it did, it came around again later. No need to worry - they will feed you!THE FOOD! THE FOOD!Where do I begin??? Getting in on the first seating is great because you are starving (after waiting in line) and everything comes out super fast and the flow of food is great. But you also get super excited and want to order EVERYTHING. (Warning: Pace yourself! It's okay to say no to a dish - chances are good that it will come by again later or you can ask your server to bring you some if you decide you want it later.) You can also order off a menu. Here's what we had, and I don't remember the names, so I'll just describe. Mind you, everything here is worthy of being alongside the best tasting menus in SF in my opinion, but I'm rating in comparison to the other dishes that night:-Beet salad-type dish (3 stars): This was the first thing that came by and I was just so excited and hungry that I ordered it, but it wasn't too memorable. -Duck mousse w lil dough balls (4.5 stars)-Croquette with duck & fromage (5 stars) -Pork belly w nectarine (4.5 stars)-State bird w provisions (5 stars) - Got the half, but recommend the whole. But I don't think I got the best part as we split it and it tasted a bit gamey to me.-Pancakes: sourdough & sauerkraut (3.5 stars) - My friend LOVED it; I liked but not love.-Dumpling in lemongrass broth (5 stars) - Flavor explosion-Oysters (4 stars) - I'm not a huge oyster person but these were great, not too fishy tasting either-Trout & avocado mousse w chips (4.5 stars) - We were torn between the trout & salmon. Both looked & sounded amazing.-Garlic bread w bur rata (5 stars) - OMG. Love.-Dessert: Berry tart deconstructed (4 stars) -Dessert: Ice cream sandwich (3.5 stars) - Ice cream was great, not sure I liked the combo with the rosemary cookie thing; might've preferred to eat them separately-Dessert: Green tea granita (2 stars) - Odd taste combo; not a fan-Dessert: Chocolate cake (2 stars) - We didn't actually order this, but they gave to us by mistake; not really chocolate-y, seed part was not my preference, and just another oddball.Overall, desserts were a slight let down, but also because the savory dishes were so ridiculously fantastic. We didn't order a few things because we were getting full but I wish we also got the quail eggs and bone marrow. Next time!SERVICEExcellent! We had the nicest server and he was helpful in guiding us along and suggested half orders here and there as we wanted to try EVERYTHING but weren't sure if we had enough stomach space! Very attentive and stopped by to check on us enough to be considerate and not overbearing. THE DAMAGEBill came out to about $120 for two of us, which included 2 glasses of wine. SO WORTH IT! In the end, was I full? YES, comfortably full. But we still thought about eating more because it was all so good but we stopped short of painfully full. I felt like I'd be hungry again in another hour, but actually I wasn't hungry at all the rest of the evening and we ate at 5:30pm. Overall, I loved my experience here. It lived up to the hype and more. As we were walking out, I really wanted to leave our name to come back later that night to do it all over again. I've always wanted to try State Bird Provision but didn't have any luck with the online reservation system. On Sunday afternoon, I decided to try my luck and wait in line for a table. Arrived at around 4:50pm, and I could already see 30+ people standing in line. It wasn't until 5:50pm when I finally got to the front of the line, and was told that the next seating will be at 9:45pm. After waiting in line for an hour, I was just happy to get a table. How do you spend 4 hours waiting? Well, you can catch a movie at Sundance kabuki theater, walk around Japantown, enjoy some live music at Yoshi's.Finally 9:45pm rolls around and the restaurant is still packed with guests. We waited again until 10:20pm before we could get seated. At this point I'm starving, and could eat an entire village. We tried the following dishes:1. CA state bird with provisions (whole)Very tender and delicious. I gobbled the entire bird as I was starving. Highly recommend ordering this.2. Duck liver mousse with almond biscuitReminds me of foie gras, but less solid in texture. Delicious.3. Raw oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut and sesameWe were told the oysters were from virginia. Not sure why they wouldn't just use Bay Area oysters. The oysters were just OK, nothing spectacular4. Duck & fontina croquettesIt was hard to taste the duck, it's just like eating regular croquette.5. Garlic bread with burrataWas disappointed with this one. Taste like dough-y cheese puffs. 6. Pork belly plum saladMy favorite dish of the night. Tender, crispy and moist pork belly in a fusion of amazing flavors. This is one dish you must try!7. Roasted bone marrow with mushroom & pink peppercornIt's good but a bit too salty for me. The odd thing is they give you a tiny plate of salt in case you want to add more salt 8. Cumin lamb with squid,snap peas, Thai basil & datesThe squid was tender and delicious. The lamb is tender and flavorful. Love this dish.Overall, the dishes were creative and delicious. There were exceptional dishes like the pork belly, duck mousse, and fried quail. However, the rest of the dishes taste too salty (and fatty) for my taste.Would I wait another 5.5 hours for SBP again? Probably not. First off - if you don't have reservations, make sure you are there at least 1 hr before the restaurant opens. You will not regret it. As a group of three we got two seats + 1 standing space by the kitchen. It was the best spot near the kitchen and incredible food that came pouring out. The unadvertised tapas were as amazing as the ones printed on the menu. The duck liver mousse with tiny corn breads were delicious. Actually everything was awesome...you can't go wrong. So this is what tapas mean, very small plates.  No need to try the wonton, please skip, not worth $3.00 for one wonton.  Use that money to get dessert.  This dining experience requires your taste buds.  Beef tongue tasted like pastrami.  Garlic bread with burrata (mozzarella and cream), a little heavy.  It reminds me of a bread puff.  Didn't taste any garlic.  Pork Belly (Crunchy on the outside and cooked perfectly) was my friend's favorite.  They had bone marrow and it was a good size bone marrow.    My favorite was the asparagus with whatever cream sauce (tasted like reduced blue cheese?) and shavings of cheese.  We had the root veggie tapas.  There were quite a few dishes with figs, but I've forgotten which dish came with them.  The thing with these food is that you should have the menu in front as a cheat sheet of what you are eating.  We loved our waiter, Ben, who was patient to explain every little dish that came by our table.  My friend wanted to acknowledge Ben.  I have to say the wait staff really makes the dining experience fun.  In this case, I felt like we were in a test kitchen being the taste testers.  We should hand in our evaluations and raise our number paddle like Dancing with the Stars!  10!  The Blue Bottle Coffee ice cream sandwich with macarons cookies was a 10!  The lamb dish was a bit salty.  The blueberry/strawberry meringue tart was my friend's favorite dessert.   Having dinner at 9 pm was not our first choice and leaving full and satisfied at 10:30 p.m. made me more alert.  I had to wake up at 4 am to make this reservation 2 months ago.  Was it worth it?  YES.  Once we got there, we didn't have to wait long to be seated.  The place had no door signs, so look for the portholes.  They had remodeled and I am so glad that they opened up their dining area with bench chairs.  Their last seating is at 10:00 p.m. and definitely, there were plenty of seats for those who want to come late.  The bill came and we didn't feel ""robbed.""  I felt like we got our money's worth and I didn't have to stand in line or drive 2 hours to Napa.  The atmostphere was very relaxing and we can actually hear each other talk.  The chef bid us good night as we walked to exit, so all is well. Sunday evening. Arrived at 5:00pm for the 5:30pm opening. Long line. Was able to score a 7:15 pm seating for our group of three. Returned after beers and snacks at nearby Japantown establishment. Seated immediately at the chef's counter with a great view into the kitchen. Love that. Service was, over all, attentive considering the packed house and full waiting area nearby. I won't go into the dishes since so many Yelpers have done that. What I like about SBP is the experimental feel to every dish. Since they cost between $8 and $15 for a a sharable plate, it's not as though you're out a lot of money if any one of them just doesn't work out well. And that described three or four of the 12 or so dishes we enjoyed. Nothing was bad and some were outstanding. SBP is a cool concept. I'll be back and soon. No surprises, it is really Bomb.comCasual, unassuming and very good, unique dishes. I would love to go back. We lucked out and got a reservation a month in advance for a Friday at 5:30pm.The line for walk ins when they opened at 5:30 was very long. No line at 8pm - wonder if the wait is shorter for a late dinner. I suggest trying that.Our favorite dishes were BY FAR:State bird with provisions (friend quail) - get a whole not a halfPork belly dishBuratta garlic breadcoffee ice cream ice sandwichEverything is good - we loved it all and loved being able to try different things. The staff are warm and friendly and there are a lot of them around, keeping things moving.Wines by the bottle are on the expensive side but food is not expensive - great date place. Note: There is no sign on the door, so keep a lookout for the address and/or a fancy silver door next to a window where you can see chefs cooking.After waiting forever to get a reservation at State Bird Provisions, I was finally able to dine here (then promptly sat on writing my review for half a year). The food at State Bird is definitely unique, and I loved a lot of their complex combinations of flavors and textures. However, there were also a few dishes that I didn't enjoy. Reservations are highly recommended, unless you don't mind coming early (before they open) to wait in line for the tables reserved for walk-in guests. If you have a reservation, you get to bypass the line and walk straight through the doors to check in with the hostess, who then seats you promptly. They have a menu of dishes you can order, and also servers who push a cart or walk around with trays of other dishes that change daily. We tried:-Raw Oyster (w/Pickled Kohlrabi, Togarashi Oil, $3/ea, yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): This was good, but not amazing. The oysters were fresh, but I didn't love this and probably wouldn't order it again.-Duck Liver Mousse w/Almond Biscuits ($6, yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): I loved the chewy almond biscuits more than the duck liver mousse, and would order this dish again just for the biscuits. Highly recommended!-Guinea Hen Dumpling (w/Aromatic Broth, $3, yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): Just ok- the dumpling skin was thin, and the broth was flavorful, but not amazing.-Garlic Bread w/Burrata ($8, yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): Yum! The burrata was delicious, and I liked the texture of the garlic bread.-Hamachi w/Avocado Sauce on Nori Cracker ($9, yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): Ok- I loved the freshness of the hamachi pieces, but it was awkward trying to balance the pieces of fish on this large cracker.-Mushroom Risotto (yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): Ok, but really heavy. This dish had good flavor, but really fills you up.-Crispy Pork Belly, Grapes, Jalapenos, Vietnamese Herb Vinaigrette (yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): Yum! The pork belly was really tender, and I liked the flavors of this dish.-Glazed Pork Spare Ribs ($20, yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): Just ok- I had higher expectations for the ribs. The sauce was sticky and on the sweet side, and the ribs were tender, but I probably wouldn't get them again.-CA State Bird w/Provisions ($16, yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): A must order- this is the most amazing dish on their menu, and I would definitely come back to have this again! The quail is perfectly crispy and super flavorful.-Lobster Salad (yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): Yuck, this was my least favorite dish, and I didn't like it at all. Skip!-Sourdough, Sauerkraut, Pecorino, Ricotta Pancake ($8, yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): Pretty good, and you get a huge portion for the price. I thought this dish was interesting, and would recommend trying it, but it really fills you up.-Buckwheat Bao, Coconut Cream, Carrot Jam, Maple Pecans ($8, yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): Eh, disappointing. The bao looked really pretty, but it was hollow inside and very bland. Also, I didn't like the coconut cream/carrot jam combo- skip!-Eggnog Ice Cream Sandwich, Almond Macaron, Cocoa-Sherry Coulis ($8, yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): AMAZING. I wish they sold this ice cream sandwich in stores, because it was so delicious, and this is coming from someone who isn't an egg nog fan. This is a must order if/when it comes back on the menu!-Bittersweet Chocolate Ganache Tart, Brown Sugar-Oat Crust, Olive Oil ($8, yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): Just ok, but I don't think any dessert could live up to the eggnog ice cream sandwich. General Manager Ryan Anderson has called my criticism inappropriate because I don't think the staff should count money in front of the guests, or to not offer the full menu because you want to close, or have the kitchen staff walk by the table with sanitizer buckets that smell like chlorine while you finish dinner. Gee, Mr Ryan Anderson; Who is inappropriate? You claim to be General Manager yet you don't manage your staff. Why is it appropriate to pay the same money when only a portion of the menu is offered, the kitchen staff ruins your dinner with chlorine, and you get to watch the staff count all the tips in front of you?So Mr. Ryan Anderson, sorry for calling out the faults of your Michelin rated restaurant, but if they saw what I saw you would have got slammed. I don't know why you couldn't have let well enough alone. I gave you four stars to be nice, but after your passive aggressive response using an owners account (Nicole K.). I have to tell the truth about an overrated restaurant. WOW!  Yes, I still am in hearts with SBP.  I was on the wait list for a table of 6 and I was able to get in - I was beyond excited.  It was $60pp and we got almost everything on the menu.  Great deal & great food.  I highly recommend going with others so you can try more.  Bravo! 4 STARS for the creativity of their restaurant. Call me crazy, but I was one of those people who woke up at 4AM just to make a reservation. The reservation date (May) was 60 days from when I booked it (back in March), so I decided to take this advantage to take my parents here for an early Mother's Day dinner. Was it worth it? DEFINITELY.State Bird Provisions offers tapas style food served on dim sum carts and trays. Loved this concept because I thought it was pretty creative and different. There's a small menu that lists pancakes, commandables, and desserts. There are also other dishes offered on their rotating dim sum trays and carts. I'm not going to go deep into the details of the food we tried, but just the gist of it.---Rabbit Pâté: Kinda reminded me of the duck liver mousse, which I preferred more than the rabbit. It had this interesting taste that I wasn't too big of a fan of. :(Duck and Pea Croquette: Just OK. Not my cup of tea.. :(Duck Ham-Maitake, Pecan Pancake with Kumquat Mustard: Originally, I thought it was just going to be a regular pancake but with duck. I was wrong. It was actually pretty unique and tasty! There were so many bursting flavors. All the ingredients just meshed well together! The duck wasn't too fatty nor gamey. Garlic Bread with Burrata Cheese: Garlic bread was just OK, didn't really taste the garlic in it.. But loved the burrata cheese! Big portion of the cheese.Beef Tongue and Potato Dumpling: Beef tongue was OK, but really liked the potato dumpling! Chewy on the inside, but crispy and fried on the outside.Duck Liver Mousse with Almond Biscuits: Really enjoyed the duck liver mousse. Smooth and flavorful. The almond biscuit complemented it very well.Egg Custard with Sambal and Green Onions: Pretty interesting and tasty. It was like a soup but with egg custard in it. Really liked the kick to it. CA State Bird (Whole): State Bird = Quail. Just OK, had a little bit of crisp to it. Roti of Curry Rabbit: JUST OK. Not too memorable. Presentation was eh...Crispy Pork Belly: I love pork belly and I liked how it wasn't too fatty nor oily. Had that crisp to it. Hamachi on a Nori Chip: YUMMY! Hamachi was very fresh and the nori chip was very crispy. It was not too heavy.CA Black & White Bao, Saffron Custard, Golden Raisins, Pistachios: The bao was just a regular bao.. Nothing too special.. However, I did really enjoyed the custard meshed with the raisins and pistachios. Chocolate 'Ice Cream' Sandwich, Smoked Meringue, Spicy Cocoa Nibs, Strawberries: Sad, we missed when they were serving black sesame or the poppy seed ice cream sandwich a few weeks ago. :( This dessert was a bit too sweet for my liking and a bit too normal. :(---Overall, I do not regret waking up at 4AM to make this reservation. Definitely worth the experience. Service was excellent and the staff were pretty friendly and accommodating. The total bill was about $150 for 3 people, which was not bad at all, especially since we got to try out so many different types of dishes. Plus, my parents both enjoyed it since it's something different from the usual. If you do plan on giving State Bird Provisions a visit, I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend getting reservations IN ADVANCE!!! :) This past Saturday, we lucked into a friend of a friend giving away their 7pm reservation for State Bird. We snapped up the reservation without hesitation, and man am I glad we did. As far as SF eateries go, this experience is easily in my all-time top three.Our waiter recommended ordering at least three items off the menu and filling in the rest of the meal with dim sum... an approach that I highly recommend. Everything was delicious and memorable, but my highlights were the pork belly with pluots (two of my favorite foods, magically meeting in one exquisite dish), the guinea hen dumpling, and the hearts of palm salad.As for the non-food elements, the waiters and waitresses worked as a cohesive unit and were all knowledgeable and quirky. The decor was understated on the exterior (which made it a little difficult to locate), and was charmingly modest and unique on the interior. It's refreshing when a place lives up to the culinary hype without being pretentious. State Bird, you make the Quail proud. I have long been a huge fan of State Bird Provisions, but my dining experience last night was so disappointing.Most dishes that were passed around never made it to our table, so there were a lot of things we couldn't try.  Our server was so preoccupied that we barely got any attention to request any dishes.  All the other staff remarkably seemed to dodge any eye contact whatsoever. The oysters were mediocre, the chips and dip were so-so, the quinoa salad tasted like it came from whole foods, the duck liver mousse was just okay this time (very, very gamey), the guinea hen dumpling was insanely salty and chewy, and there were probably a couple more that I'm forgetting.The anchovy pancake was the best thing of the night, but it wasn't that great and it took a half hour to come out.The sweetbreads were disgusting.  They tasted like fryer oil and breading, and were unpleasantly chewy rather than tender and creamy.The hearts of palm salad was so salty it was inedible.  We had to send it back, but that took 10 minutes because we couldn't get anyone's attention.  Really mediocre meal and bad service.  State Birds, I'm pretty disappointed, and I'm not sure I want to come back. This place is a fun experience! Even the wait wasn't too bad as they took our number and texted when a table was ready. I really enjoyed the use of ingredients in a different way, like tofu skins as pasta. The duck mousse with little muffins were also very tasty. I will definitely return to try some other dishes the next time I am in town. What? No more canned beer here? Well, that's cool because the food is still excellent, albeit the very difficult reservation. Dim-sum concept will please everyone but sometimes they get a tad aggressive with the delivery. Still, better to have a duplicate dish than spontaneous table fight over a spoonful of tantalizing, umami-packed goodness!Every time I've come here over the last few years the menu has always changed. The best suggestion: go with your gut... any dish no matter how unique--think pancake w/powdered sauerkraut--is going to be outstanding. Only real question is when to stop?A restaurant is most divine and sacred during it's first incarnation. Case in point, Slanted Door and even Bar Crudo. Even with the recent remodel, the vibe at State Bird has been kept close to its core. I am thankful for that. I was lucky enough to have a friend who had scored reservations back in October, and was able to get in on a Saturday night. We had a table of 6 and therefore there is a set menu, where we got to try almost everything in the menu. The meal was served in four courses and everything was not only delicious but very inventive. I also heard they got their Michelin star recently, so I'd go sooner rather than later! You will not be disappointed. Yep, this place is the real deal.  Since eating there last week, I've been scouring my calendar for the next available date to get back.I could waste your time by using the rest of this post describing each dish we had, but why bother?  Just go.  Try everything.  You won't be disappointed. 14TH MICHELIN STAR EXPERIENCE: BEST VALUE OF ANY ONE MICHELIN STAR RESTAURANTI've been to several one Michelin Star restaurants. I've never been to a two Michelin Stars restaurant. Before heading to a two Michelin Stars restaurant I wanted to go at least one more one Michelin Star restaurant. (Even if I do go to a 2 Michelin Stars restaurants I will go to a one Michelin Star restaurant if it's worth it.). There are two (2) one Michelin Star restaurants I wanted to try before ""graduating"" to two Michelin Stars: State Bird Provisions or Gary Danko.Last Thursday I decided to go to State Bird Provisions because last year it won the James Beard Award for Best New Restaurant. With all the provisions, which are items that are served in a dim sum style-service, provided there are so many items to choose from whether they were from the menu or the provisions. First I had to be strict and picky. Since California's state bird is quail from the menu I ordered the State Bird and the half dozen quail eggs. For the provisions I had a wait and see approach; I didn't want to get the first few items that were served to me. If the items where what I had before then I wouldn't choose them in fear that I might get too full too early. Also each provision item cost an average of $9 if you're not carefully the cost can add up too quickly. The first two provisions that I passed were steak tartare and tuna tartare. I passed them because they were too ordinary. I've had steak tartare in the past however I regret not having the salmon tartare because I never had it before. The other provision I item I regret passing was the grill asparagus Caesar-style. If I was going to eat vegetables the grill asparagus would have been the dish. The first provision item I ate had Chinese influence - the guinea hen dumpling. It had the texture of a won ton soup. Then the first item from the menu was the State Bird. Though small with its heavily breading it resembled fried chicken. Yet despite a small dish the quail was very favorable. Instead of ordering a whole quail I only ordered half a quail; I regret not ordering the whole quail. The next provision item I ate was beef tongue pastrami, a clever dish of taking beef tongue and cooking it like pastrami. The fried potato was a great compliment for the beef tongue. One of my ""kryptonites"" at restaurants is bread. My third provision item was garlic bread, which was deep fried, topped with burrata. This item is so bad for your heart but tastes so good. I can never see garlic bread in the same matter again. Just like Anthony Bourdain, he and I have the same weakness when it comes to a specific item. My other ""kryptonite"" is pork. The two provision pork dishes I had were ribs glazed in their own juices and pork belly salad. Growing up I was used to ribs glazed with barbecue sauce, but having ribs glazed in its own juices enhances the flavor of the ribs unlike barbecue sauce where it tends to hide the flavor of the ribs. Since I passed on the grill asparagus I felt the pork belly salad would add some vegetable to my dinner. LOL. The remaining provision item I had was almond biscuit with duck mousse. The duck mousse was smooth and rich. It had a texture that was similar to foie gras. The half dozen quail eggs were the final main item from the menu. The texture of the quail eggs was similar to gazpacho. This dish was very refreshing. For dessert I choose between the ice cream bar and CA black and white bao with saffron custard. I choose the latter. Even though it was nice I regret not taking the advice of my server who recommended the ice cream bar.In the past when I went to ate at 1 Michelin Star restaurant I would have to worry about how much I would spend. There's a Business Insider link (businessinsider.com/chea…) that lists affordable one Michelin Star restaurants in the Bay Area. For those restaurants I would order items that would result in a bill that would be under or match the suggested meal price on that link. The problem was that I felt suffocated because I was worrying more about the price instead of the meal. At State Bird Provisions I felt liberated as I didn't have to worry about overpaying because the provisions cost an average of $9. That means you can enjoy your meal without splurging. For nine items I paid $85 a hell of a value. And most of all I was stuffed. Being stuffed at a Michelin Star restaurant for under $100 - priceless. It was delicious, efficient and fun. My favorite is the green tea granita with tapioca pearls. Everything was super YUMMY! !! It was like American style ""dim sum"" the staffs were friendly!! Must try the spicy kimchi, pork belly, duck liver moose. And the ice cream sandwich! ! The waiting line wasn't long. But it was definitely nice that we had a reservation.  Will definitely be back soon! This is a fun place to hang out with friends, at least three or more, but not a place for fine dining. Their dishes are similar to an un-orchestrated firework, a chaotic combination of everything that tickles your taste buds, plenty of cilantro, mint leaves, garlics, and vinaigrette. With all these ingredients to dress up pork bellies, bone marrow, and other fine selection of meats, you have to be a nincompoop to mess it up.I said it's a fun place to dine because you get to order their many samples and share them among your friends. Much like Chinese dim sum, each dish is different from the next, that keeps the conversation alive on the table. But unlike Chinese dim sum, all entries in SBP are new inventions and we customers are like Guinea pigs, that's how I feel. This place cost twice as much as fine Chinese dim sum, I guess the extra money goes to the service, the cleanliness of their kitchen and toilet, which are notoriously poor in any Chinese eatery. My dad raves about this place. Is it worth the fanfare and absurd 2 hour plus wait outside? To a certain extent it is. I think the long wait may boost the entire experience and for some, over bake expectations. Go with a small group of hungry friends and you should have a good time.The interior has this kind of hip whimsy that you'd be more likely to find in Oakland. You can see chefs running a kitchen in the front yet I think the real entertaining chaos is reserved for the back kitchen. The space dining area is only large enough to keep that exclusive feel.Food service is a la dim sum style. Food runners will carry food trays to eat table for diners to either accept or decline. The diversity of food and wait time is on par of most dim sum spots. The excitement of the food runners and energy of the patrons gives State Bird a lively atmosphere.The food is a little hard to explain. All I can really say is that it's contemporary-fun California cuisine. I imagine this is food that chefs would feed other chefs. The food is whimsical and fun. It may sound and look somewhat strange but it's all about the flavors and textures. You will definitely not see any of these dishes coming out of most restaurants. I felt like I was eating the first or second draft of a food dish, but it still was unique and tasty.____Is it novelty or is it genuinely delicious? It's both. So.  We were in San Francisco for 2 days and asked the concierge of the hotel we were staying in about State Bird as we had read about it on a food magazine that I had bought in London.  ""Most popular restaurant in the whole of the USA"" we were told.  ""just won a James Beard award"".  Well we are from London so no idea what that really means but we thought as it was a Sunday night we would give it a go as a walk in.After we found it, we got through the door into a packed little lobby.  On chatting to a few people in the queue, they asked us how many months ago we had booked or whether we had started queuing at 4pm that afternoon.  General laughter when we explained what we were trying to do.  We rocked up at 8.30pm with our daughter.  Anyway, to cut a long story short, 10 minutes later we were sitting at the counter in the kitchen.  Best seats in the house if you like food.  Just proves its always worth being nice to the hosts.So after a great chat with the sous chef who was working the station directly in front of us we understood how it all worked and had a bit of the background.Our take on the food was this:Fried bread and burrata.  Really not very good if you are from Europe and can tte hold of Burrata.  This was a Californian product that the chef readily admitted it was not real burrata.  So all in all rather odd and not very tasty.But that was the only duff dish that we had.  The quail was good but we really enjoyed the pork belly , the salmon tartare and the pancakes ( which were outstanding - we tried 3 types).  All in all I think between three of us we tried 18 things, so we made a pretty good dent in the menu.I have to say the service was outstanding.  Sitting at the kitchen meant we got to have a really interesting chat with the kitchen team, all of whom were absolutely charming and very happy to chat whilst cooking.So, in summary, a really interesting concept that had a fun buzz about it and delivers good to very good food.  We are very happy we went. This place changed my life and how I view the eating experience. It was like being a little kid again and your parents taking you out to eat for the first time! The style is so new and refreshing...the service is unbeatable, it's as if you're distant cousins back in town and they want you to have the best meal of your life! The food needs to be experienced, words can't give the smells and flavors justice. I only hope I get to eat here again. Thank you state bird. This spot was good...but I don't think its worth the hype. Will I come back and eat, yes. Will I wake up at 4AM to magically get a reservation? No. Sleep is precious.I came with a few friends, after our friend got her boyfriend to wake up at 4AM to get the reservation. On a Friday. At 7:30. Needless to say, it took more than 1 night of getting up to get this reservation. I bask in the prize without having to pay in. Sweet.We had a ton of different things. Of which there's no way I'll remember them all now. What I do remember:Almond thing with Pate: Yum. I love pate. =)State Bird: Interesting, but not super impressive.Bone Marrow: Was really good, but bone marrow tends to be pretty awesome. This wasn't the BEST I've had, but pretty decent.Salmon (raw) with fried quinoa: was really good. The quinoa added great texture to the dish. Garlic bread: I had this at LaCocina,and it was pretty good then too. Love that cheese!Pork things: something fried. Pork. It was soo good. Seriously. Dumpling/won ton: it was aite, but not really amazing. But the broth was pretty solid.Chocolate cake thing (dessert): pretty good.Grapefruit slush thing (dessert): Pretty good.Overall, the food is really good for what it is. However, the wait and the overhype makes me push it to a 4 instead of 5. Because although their service was awesome and food was pretty solid, the over hype killed it. I'm sorry. Its one of those times that popularity works against you. At least...you still have Ryan Gossling... 5-stars period, enough said. Ok but for those who don't know me I'm a carnivorous foodie and this place was EXCITING, inventive and edgy! We'll be back, no questions asked. We tried pretty much every dish that came our way as well as a few things from the menu (including all of the desserts)... And I loved everything! So rare for that to happen! Flavorful, well-prepared, creative, beautiful dishes.  The duck liver mousse, halibut on seaweed, duck-fontina rillettes, ricotta pancakes, burrata garlic bread, state bird, pork belly, and bao w/ saffron mousse were perhaps standouts, but get whatever looks good to you! You won't be disappointed.Also, friendly & professional service.  I just wish that  my sparkling wines had been in a flute rather than a regular wine glass, but not a dealbreaker. Great restaurant! Delicious food and the staff here is awesome! I love talking to them and vibing over the food since they love it as much as all of us! 4.5 Stars.Enough has been said about SBP:  It is dam good. Go early. Order most everything. Most common word used in this establishment: YES .Now that I have that off of my chest. I am so impressed by Stuart Brioza, his vision, his crew, their humbleness in the face of huge success. They treat the customer so well and are so nice this made a huge impact on me. Yeah Ryan gosling ate here and so do a ton of well to dos......but everyone is treated with love and respect here.My hat is also off to Stuart for not going nopa soma fidi or what have you...but doing something in a neighborhood that could really use it. Yeah panda express, sushi boom II, and Poppeye's doesnt really help the area..imho. It could have been rent considerations.I appreciate that Stuart came by the table raving about his anchovies and taking the time to explain where they get them, what they do to them etc. BTW...I have never had anchovies like this....they were amazing. The man is a genius.Ah the details. This place aint cheap: Four people was roughly $260 (this is without tip so add another 20%) and that is with me bringing a bottle of wine! But you pay for what you get and what you get is handcrafted, unique, beautiful quality food, in an amazing atmosphere.Okay my tips to you:If you want to get in without a reservation get there at 4:35 ( I know it is crazy but it is what it is). If you are 14 or less in line you will get in no problem. I love that they only reserve half the tables....this is what I mean about treating everyone right.If you can get in before the close ( not everyone wants to eat at 5:30???_) say 10 minutes to 10 they will offer you the same show...all the carts and all the food....again treating the customer right.They are expanding to next door so that should take some of the pressure off reservations.Thanks Stuart and crew, Chuck, and Anne...it was ahmazing!!!Definitely worth eating here!!! I was lucky enough to be invited by a friend who scored a reservation to State Bird.  I wasn't really sure what to expect since I've heard lots of praise, but also lots of claims of overly-hyped food.  So, I tried to go into this dining experience with an unbiased palate, and I honestly thoroughly enjoyed my meal.  I didn't feel it was over-priced.  Between 4 friends we probably tried 10-12 dishes and each had a glass of wine (or two in my case), and the bill came out around $70/person after tax and tip.  The things that stuck out for me were the duck liver mousse (so, so good) and the smoked trout and avocado chip & dip. Love the dim-sum style service - instant gratification when the food is ready as soon as you see it!  The only bummer was I heard Ryan Gosling was there last night, and I missed it ;). Absolutely amazing. After getting lost trying to find the entrance cause of a huge line in front of the Fillmore we found this food paradise.  Most award winning restaurants have a snooty unwelcoming environment this however was the complete opposite. Stepping in you could tell this place was different and you can smell all the amazing food from outside. We had just got paid so me and my girlfriend wanted to buy everything so we did. We had 15 different courses and a majority of which were outstanding. The pork belly, quail egg, state bird, dumpling, and all of  the deserts were out  of this world good.   PS Don't leave without trying the pork belly it has so many different complementing flavors in one bite. WOW. This place is seriously incredible and well worth the hype. I've been looking forward to the meal since I made reservations at 4am 60 days in advance. It definitely did not disappoint. The dishes our group of 4 ordered were (in order of preference):State bird (quail) with provisionsHamachi avocado on seaweed crackerPork belly blood orange saladSmoked trout avocado chip n dipSalmon tartareGarlic bread with burrataRoti of curry rabbitStone-ground oat-crusted sweetbreadsPlus the chocolate ice cream sandwich for dessert. My only regret is not ordering double portions of the quail and hamachi (pretty small portions). I seriously can't wait to go back. What an amazing idea! What a great little place. Ok, if there was a 4.5 stars, I would give it only because of their reservation rules (5 people max) and we actually had to get someone to wait in line for us for 2 hours to get a table and then when we were there at 8pm (our reservation time), they made us wait for 10 minutes. But, that's fine. I will give it 5 stars anyway because the food, service and ambiance more than made up for the hitches up front. Love the concept of dim sum style tapas. We got so so many things between the four of us. Off the menu, we ordered the outstanding black cod pancakes and quail eggs and the delicious but not extraordinary kimchi noodles and the state bird. Off the carts, we got many things I probably can't remember but the mushroom porridge, some veggie medley with goat cheese, oysters, rabbit terrine, the fantastic duck moose with almond biscuits, garlic burrata bread, smoked salmon, some quinoa medley. Everything was very very good, some things outstanding. The only disappointing dish was also the most expensive dish ($12) - the pork ribs. We also got every dessert on the menu and while the almond milk and blood orange granita weren't my favorites, I loved the CA black & white bao and ice cream sandwich the best. The service was prompt, friendly and very pleasant. Our server even ran 2 blocks after we had left to return my scarf that I left in our booth. Very nice guy!All in all, great experience. Highly recommended. Two months ago, I woke up at 4am to make my reservation online. Boy, am I glad I did! It felt awesome to walk to the front of the line and get seated right away. I normally don't mind waiting in line, but to find out that the people at the front of the line were not guaranteed a table, and also that their seating window was anywhere between 7pm-10:30pm, made me grateful I set my alarm for 3:58am lol.Here's what we had:Mushroom farro spezzato with whipped ricotta- Delish!! What a great start. Highly recommended.Snap Peas with homemade sambal chili- I don't like snap peas, but M loves them. I liked the homemade sambal, but M didn't. At least I tried! If you are a fan of snap peas, you'll like this dish. Salmon tartare with cucumber- I like cucumber but M does not, so I had it all to myself. He did, however, enjoy the crispy quinoa on top. It was too crispy for me. See a trend here? lol. I wouldn't order again. Garlic Bread w/burata- Yum! I liked the saltiness of the bread. It wasn't as garlicky as I had hoped but it was still good. Loved the cheese. I'd get this again, but maybe later towards the end because it's very filling.Fried Pork Belly- The first two pieces were great. Loved the sauce. The other two pieces we had were practically all fat. We couldn't finish it. Not sure if I'd get it again because I felt a little gross afterwards. Stone-ground oat-crusted sweetbreads with favas & ramps- My favorite of the night. The breading on the sweet breads was very crispy and I loved the vinaigrette that came with it. I didn't care much for the fava bean puree, so of course, M loved it. HahaCA state bird with provisions- There isn't much meat on the state bird, but the meat I did get was good. I'm glad we only got half an order, because we were getting full by the time we got it. Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - What a terrible way to end the meal. I really wanted to love this one, but we both agreed it was nothing special. The almond biscuit was very buttery, but that was it. It wasn't great. The mousse had a consistency like butter, but unsalted. It didn't add anything to the biscuit. There was a long period of time between the first carts/trays of food and the second, so we decided to get the check. We had poor timing, because they brought out more food after we got our check. Perhaps this is done on purpose to get people out. Haha jk.We'll be back to try other things like the bone marrow. I'm glad we ventured out to the city to try this place. Make reservations! I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. We were walk-ins and got a table at 9:30pm despite lining up at 5pm (it was a Sunday though). Regardless, it's totally worth it and I'd do it again. We were seated at the ""chef's table"", right across from the cooking station, and I sat where all the dishes were being passed from the kitchen to the servers. This is a great spot to be at... you got to see everything as they came off the line, piping hot, and we even got to chat with the restauranteur Stuart Brioza quite a bit, as well as the line chefs. The food is impeccably prepared and it's awesome to watch them do it. Everything was delicious. A standout dish for me was the almond cakes + liver. The place has a great casual atmosphere, unpretentious and comfortable. They could fit a few more seats in here, but it's nice that it doesn't feel crowded. It's probably the best value Michelin star restaurant I have ever been to.  For the quality of food and service it's actually quite a steal. Can't wait to go back. I decided to get State Bird Provisions another try to see if they live up to the hype and still think they fall far from the one Michelin star that they've earned.  First off, from a service perspective, I can't remember the last time I've had service as bad.  Even in my $6 hole-in-the-wall ethnic joint, I will at least get attentive service.  To start with, I had a 7pm reservation.  We were probably a few minutes late, but no matter, the table wasn't ready.  Wasn't ready until after 7:30.  What's the point of having of a reservation?  And walk-ins that literally just waltzed in got seated before us.  Seriously?!  I understand that some restaurants keep certain seats for walk-ins but I think they need to figure out how to be more accommodating for customers that had pre-planned and made a reservation.  While waiting in crowded front area for a half hour, we were offered a drink menu, but never actually to order a drink.  Then when we sat down, we were essentially ignored.  No offer for drink orders.  Good thing the food comes around to you or we would've never gotten any food.  Finally, I managed to flag someone down to order drinks.  I asked about a 2011 Cab Franc, wondering if it was too young to drink.  He said, oh, I can absolutely recommend a 1979 something by the bottle.  Are you kidding me?  2011 is a little young, so you jump back 30 years and probably charge me over $300 for the bottle.  I wish I had gotten this server's name because he was just ridiculous.  The food is fine.  It's not fantastic and definitely does not make up for the service glitches. It was good but not worth the wait and money. I have been to much better restaurants with much more unique things but everyone should try it at least once. I definitely would have to go if I had a guest in town that really wanted to try it otherwise there are so many other places. It truly is OVERRATED!!! Believe the hype!The food is superb. And for a place this worshipped, it is surprisingly unpretentious. Be sure to get the Stare Bird with provisions -- definitely one of the most consistently delicious dishes. An amazing dining experience in every way. Unique. Fabulous service. Delicious food. A must for anyone up for a little adventure! Delicious tapas were fed us, for the first time in this restaurnts. Good location and pretty awesome customer service. They are so inventive and outstanding friendly with the us.There was no late getting foods.Prce is affordable here.I highly praise their hard work.I will be trying. Friends told me there has been a lot of fuss about this place. My first SF review or restaurant review for that matter. I'm bored atm so here goes. Obviously I had to try so I'd have something to write home about. ""Dear New York....""Did a walk in and got blessed with the Walk-in Karma. Hostess is WAY COOL. Anyway... some dishes were good, not freakazoid OmFGGGggggg but good, cool. Like, I enjoyed it going down my throat and I smiled. or Like when you get a compliment for wearing something that you weren't even trying with. I'll take it! Some dishes were... hmm... trying too hard? Mixing up all these flavors that if I were a judge on Top Chef I'd wince and ask, ""why did you do that?""We got a lot of dishes. They all started to bleed into one another. I have a favorite from the night:Curried Scallop & AvocadoWith Crunchy QuinoaI expected more for the buttermilk quail. I'm a southern girl at heart so I know my fried chicken (or [insert bird]) and the batter was not that tasty.I know some ppl will say oh well the dishes change daily so maybe it was an off night. No, I pretty much think overall it's going to be the same range of ""goodness"", or else what you're telling me is this place is inconsistent? Value-- overpriced for what you get. I've had better for cheaper. I wasn't fulfilled. Just don't get your hopes up. OR of course, maybe I just have bad taste in food.I wouldn't go back but I did very much enjoy:1) atmosphere- so ""cool"" to feel as if I apparently made it to an Oscar's party.2) all the sexy tattoos on the waiters' arms. 3) concept- dim sum without the chicken feetTip: Don't sweat it if you haven't gone here. Tip 2: Guys, maybe you should bring dates here. They'll be impressed I'm sure either way-- that you got an rsvp, or your creativity in picking a restaurant with a cool concept, or because you footed the bill! =) Get it!!! I went with a large group of people (I have no idea how they got that reservation).  The service and food was great.  Modern, well done food that should be the standard for SF restaurants.  it is much better than most similarly priced restaurants. Very tasty, and surprisingly, not that expensive! The dim sum concept makes for a great, memorable night. The best thing is how happy the chefs seem to be working there. The dim sum style of service makes the kitchen less hectic, so the chefs were actually very friendly and chatting with us while they cooked. Head over at 5 to put your name on the list, then go around the corner to Fat Angel for a few drinks. Would I make a bot to hack a reservation, though? No. When we left around 9:30 on a Monday, there were actually open seats at the bar. I think that I had really high expectations of this place.With all of the hype and a 60 day wait for your reservation, what do you expect but high expectations.  4 stars for service.  It was very efficient, had a generally good balance of professional and casual, but some times a bit too casual by some staff given the vibe and higher end feel that the place is portraying.There were two exceptional dishes, most were excellent, and a couple were just average.  If you see the smoked trout quinoa, get it right away.  Don't wait for the server, pick it up and put one, two, maybe three servings of it on your table.  The dishes and dining experience were definitely fun and creative.  I will definitely be back again. I hear getting a reservation is a nightmare. Good thing I didn't have to deal with that as a friend did it for me.The concept is great.American style dimsum.The prices are excellent for the quality of food too.The layout is exciting and fun.The consistency of flavor of the food is sometimes lacking as some dishes tasted the same as if I made it at home.. with the exception of presentation.Overall, I was very pleased with the dishes, I just wished I wouldn't catch a glimpse of disappointment in the faces of the person (chef) bringing the food around when I decline... Amazing meal! We reserved a large group table 2 months in advance. The anticipation was great but the payoff delivered. At the large table, a set tasting menu is served rather than the dim sum style offerings. This is to prevent constant interruption by staff. Instead, the table is delivered every dish on the menu, served family style. It came to about 15 courses all in all. Epic. The restaurant itself is pleasant looking but a bit spartan. Nothing lavish. The focus is on the food. The service is very professional and friendly. I was impressed that the waitress knew quite a bit about the wine I brought. Sadly, the bottle was damaged so we ordered off the very reasonably priced wine/beer menu! Icing on the cake: $100 per person inclusive of all. Wow. A grand experience I hope will be repeated. Don't shoot me, but this place is definitely not all that and a bag of fries. I cannot comprehend the hype that's gone into this place, to warrant a reservation months in advance or the only other option, waiting in line an hour before the restaurant opens in hopes to either get seated or get a reservation for many hours later. We did the latter and got right in at 5:30pm, thankfully! We had: -Chowan mushi-Beausoleil oysters-Steak tartare with rice chip-Garlic bread with burrata -Sourdough sauerkraut pancake with ricotta-State bird with provisions (quail)-Chocolate icecream sandwich with cacao -nibs and apricotMany of the items, like the chowan mushi and the oysters had a very Korean taste to it, and you'd think a Korean herself would welcome this but I don't know if I was all 'bout it. The garlic bread was sadly underwhelming and not very garlicky, in my opinion.  My favorites were the pancakes with ricotta and the state bird with provisions, but the bird was so very tiny. The ice cream sandwich redeemed a lot of the meal.I'd say everyone should try it once to say they've gone, but you'll see what I mean. Sat at the bar.  Every dish we had were well prepared and creative!  Definitely a great value per michelin star ratio!  Before drinks the food bill before tips and tax was about $40 a person.  Had multiple conversation with the young chefs,  all willing to share their tricks.  My favorite dish is still the hamachi on top of a very crispy seaweed.  Just to die for.  Only down side is it is still almost impossible to make a reservation.  But I will be back next time to walk ins. Thought it might be hype, but no! Really amazing and tasty menu. We tried a variety of dishes during a dinner party for 8. Standouts included: oysters (didn't think I liked them), hamachi, pork belly (really), quail eggs, and state bird - of course. Memorable dinner. No wonder the line's always 50+ ppl deep! When the hype is this high (over the top), & you've waited 6 weeks for this reservation, all expectations invariably go through the roof.  It's inevitable.  It's just not possible to meet these unrealistic expectations.  I walked into State Bird basically expecting my panties to drop.  They didn't.  But that certainly doesn't mean that SB failed or that I was unhappy.  There's a couple things I really enjoyed, but I can't say that my heart was stolen...yet.The oysters: Straight up, oysters are not my thing.  This was my date's pick.  They were ok, but that's just me, & not a reflection of the restaurant.The duck liver mousse w almond biscuits: The smooth as silk mousse juxtaposed w the almond biscuits; very nice & different.  Just so good.  If you usually do a pate, order it.The garlic bread (affectionately known as ""sex bread"") w burrata: I anticipated to be blown the eff away w this, because if it's called ""sex bread,"" it better be mind blowing, right?  Well...if this is sex bread, then you're just not having good sex.  It was VERY good, yes.  Sexual?  No.  I love burrata, so it was a must order.  And the burrata was well done.  A staple dish for sure.The State Bird: I basically expected the heavens to part & God to come down to my table & shake my hand when I bit into this dish. Did that happen?  Of course not.  But, I love fried bird.  So it was a win with me.  Nicely seasoned, crispy on the outside, tender inside.  Didn't bowl me over, but it was tasty & I will order it again.My date, on the other hand, was very dissatisfied w this dish.The ice cream sandwich: Ok, come on.  It's an ice cream sandwich, albeit deconstructed.  What's not to love?  Again, my date did not appreciate this at all.  But, in retrospect, I'm starting to wonder if he's not a little cray cray.All in all, I feel I need to dine here a couple more times, to try more dishes, before I make any proclamations.  Like State Bird & I are dating, & this was only our first date.  I said yes to a second.  The ingenuity of the dishes, the dim sum style service, & even the hype make it worth a visit for sure.  I'm looking forward to date #2. Fantastic food, fantastic experience. I went alone on a Saturday night at 6pm. I had to wait an hour for a seat and they were able to squeeze me in for an hour between reservations. The food was creative, interesting, and delicious. The service was excellent. I've eaten here twice now and each time, I had a completely delicious and positive experience.  The staff is awesome. So friendly and helpful with any dietary restrictions (I am hopelessly lactose intolerant!).  There are so many choices and each dish is absolutely perfectly executed, seasoned, and presented. I dont remember all the things I ate...there was a pork belly thing, some interesting and tasty ceviche, several salad type dishes...there was so much! But what I do remember is that with every bite, I was totally happy. Went on a thurs night, got there shortly before 4:30 and was second in line. Probably could have walked in at 5:30 and still gotten a table for 2 on this particular night. Although it was fun to watch the sous chefs prep for the evenings dishes during the wait. LOVED the pancakes (sourdough, sauerkraut, ricotta and pecorino) and trout with mandarin oranges and hazelnut brown butter, mint and cilantro. Must get the trout! Both are on the menu rather than the dim sum dishes. The flavors were unexpected yet the combinations were so spot on and exciting. Sooo good. Still dreaming of the trout.We also had the duck mousse and almond cakes.. So delicious! The trout mousse and avocado with homemade chips- creamy, salty, deep --wish I could make this for a dinner party. Duck and fontina croquette and quinoa salad were interesting and yummy but not mind blowing. I was a little disappointed with the garlic bread and burrata and the Vietnamese pork belly salad-- both a little excessive with the balance of salt and fat. The chawanmushi with guanciale was disappointing because I love the delicate egg and mushroom flavor of a traditional chawanmushi and who doesn't love guanciale? But together, you totally lose out on the delicate umami and are overwhelmed with the guanciale and a spicy sauce. Maybe nix the sauce and do a guanciale dust instead? The portions are a little large for 2 ppl-- if you only want a taste of each plate in order to try more dishes. We were stuffed! Would love to come again with a group of 4 or 6. Tried to make a reservation before but they were so booked for a few months. Then one day, we finally got a chance to eat there.  We had State bird, Tuna Avocado Seaweed cracker, Spicy Dungeness crab with Kimuchi Yuba, Hamachi on Nori cracker and more. I thought all dishes are very creative and awesome. Staff were friendly. It was a happy night. Thank you! Thank you Darling for a good meal and good time! 3.5 STARSI've been trolling State Bird's reservation page almost daily for close to a year.  Yes, every time I went on my tablet, cell, computer, etc, it would open up to the State Bird reservation page.  Other than the occasional same day reservation for 9:30p that would pop up around 7p AFTER I already ate dinner, I've had no luck!  Imagine my surprise when I found an abundant amount of reservations after they moved to Open Table.  Now, you probably know what happened with that.  If not, you should read this article: insidescoopsf.sfgate.com….  I was one of the lucky ones and got my reservation reinstated after some back and forth with Open Table and State Bird.Roasted bone marrow with mushrooms and pink peppercorn: My favorite dish of the night! Plenty of marrow and mushrooms. Perfectly roasted!CA state bird with provisions: This was perfectly fried and crispy on the outside while still nice and moist on the inside. Sooo good!Duck liver mousse with almond biscuits: Yum! I love liver and this one didn't disappoint. Nice and creamy with that delectable liver flavor.Grilled asparagus, preserved lemon-green garlic aioli: I love asparagus and this was grilled nicely.Garlic bread with burrata: I love garlic bread and I love burrata. I just wished that the bread could have been a little more garlicky. Couldn't really taste it with all the burrata on top.Raw oysters with spicy kohlrabi kraut and sesame: Oysters were overpowered by the spicy kohlrabi kraut and sesame. I wanted to enjoy some of the sweet oceany taste of the oysters. Pork belly blood orange salad: The pork belly was cooked to the point where it crumbled in my mouth. If not for that I would have enjoyed this dish.Guinea hen dumpling in aromatic broth: Overwhelming taste of fish sauce in the broth.Steak tartare caesar lettuce cups: Caesar dressing was a little overpowering. The steak flavor didn't really come through. I would have actually preferred this with tuna.Wild king salmon tartare with fermented turnips: My least favorite dish. The salmon tartare was chopped to a point where the texture was just mushy.Unfortunately this is what happens when a place is hyped up. I'm expecting the place to be amazing! Especially when it's so hard to get a reservation. I adored the bone marrow, state bird and duck liver, but everything else was just okay or seemed to have a combination of ingredients that didn't quite mesh, so 3 stars for the food. Since our server was so sweet, I bumped it up to 3.5. I love this place. We went here on the off-chance they had a table available on a Monday and we got the perch by the door. That might have deterBest things about State Bird:- amazing service, great staff- awesome tapas/dim sum style of eating- delicious ingredients- beautifully presented dishes- so much choice and surprises!We loved pretty much all the dishes off-menu. The menu is great but I'd recommend choosing the daily dishes. We enjoyed the state bird, confit duck leg and pancake with sturgeon from the menu - all were faultless but we preffered the oysters, dumplings in broth, hamachi rice cake and octopus that were brought out to us. Next time I'm definitely trying the steak tartare and saving more space for dessert! I made it to State Bird Provisions....FINALLY!  With all the ""hype"" about this place, I went in with very low expectations.Reservations are suggested and need to be made months in advance.  It took me a while to get reservations here as I was trying during the day.  Turns out you need to make reservations at 4:00 a.m. in order to score a spot!  As I was standing in line waiting for the doors to open, I felt like a kid standing in line at Disneyland anxious to get on a ride.  But in this case, I was anxious and excited to get in and finally dine at this establishment.  The second you walk through the door, you are immediately  greeted by the friendly staff members.  The selling point is the ""dim sum"" concept, but in this case, it's not Chinese food that's being carted or carried around.  The vibe was fun.We ordered: Pork spare ribs glazed in it's own juices ($12) - Amazing!  For the price, you get, four generously portioned pieces and very tasty. Pork fell off the bones and would have probably gotten another if we didn't have so much to try already . The pork was very tender and perfectly seasoned.  This was our favorite dish of the night! (***)Duck and fontina cheese croquette ($4)  - 2 pieces per order and was pretty tasty.Guinea hen w/ cumin dumpling - 1 piece per order and ""A"" enjoyed this. The lemon flavor was refreshing and made it different from what he's used to. I, however, wasn't a fan as the cumin was overwhelming.Salmon tartare - ""A"" thought this dish was just OK.  Although nothing unique, I found it quite refreshing with the cucumbers.  (**)Hamachi crudo on seaweed cracker- This came on a big piece of seaweed with hamachi pieces on top. One of our favorites as it was tasty as well. (***)Roti of curry rabbit, lentils, & mushrooms  - I couldn't taste the curry, but the rabbit was tender and not dry.  Large portion and was ok, wish it had more flavor (*)Roasted bone marrow with mushrooms and pink peppercorn - ""A's"" usually not a fan of bone marrow so I have no idea why he decided to try this lol. He was pretty full by the time it arrived,  but it wasn't bad.Fried pork belly - One of ""A's"" other favorites.  I thought it was a bit too fatty, but it was tasty.  It reminded me of the salt and pepper pork chops you get at Chinese restaurants.  (**)Garlic bread with burrata cheese- Our least favorite dish.  We didn't taste any garlic and assumed it would be crunchy but it was like eating a donut with a glop of cheese on top. (*)Oyster - I thought this was just OK (*)CA state bird with provisions ($9 half order) - Fried buttermilk battered quail with a sautéed onion sauce. Although this is their specialty, I thought it was just okay.SBP Hibiscus Ginger Lime Soda - It was okay..kind of had a medicinal taste.Chocolate ""ice cream"" sandwich, smoked meringue, spicy cocoa nib, apricot ($8) - delicious.  I liked the chewiness of the brownie.  ***Must try**Really good*MehOverall, we enjoyed our dining experience.  Some dishes were a hit and some were a miss, but that's expected.  I wouldn't mind coming back to try some of the dishes I didn't get to try. It was good, however nothing I had blew me away. Fortunately they reinstated my opentable reso snafu, service was solid. The concept is smart, the offerings were non varietal. Highlight was the bone marrow dish from the menu. Wine and beer offerings are limited as well. For me, it was a nice place to try once but I doubt I would go back.They are not short of customers so they will still do well. So the problem with me is that this place was SUPER HYPED up. It seemed like everyone wanted to go so when I finally got to, I expected a lot. My favorite was the State bird (fried quail) off the usual menu and the small almond biscuits with duck liver mousse. The garlic toast with burrata was meh. I mean its bread and cheese. I also enjoyed the rabbit and cheese croquettes and I'm not a fan of rabbit. Good lighting so you can see what all you're getting into. I don't know what they could do about it unfortunately but they gotta lot of beards and bobs walking around with food and we did find a hair treat. My friend who discovered the surprise was unsettled but not one to fuss, despite the ickiness of the situation. Overall its a cute idea and if it ever calms down I may consider going back. Very lucky to have dined here indeed! Was here with a party of 7 so we got the Prix Fix treatment-Made the reservation 2 months in advance. Very daring flavor combinations, that really worked- Wish the portions were bigger as the flavors and textures were delicious, but also casual without any trace of pretense. The wine list in my opinion could have had more depth in California wines, but we managed to find a couple of gems to compliment our food well. It lives up to the hype. On the negative side, the experience was wasted on the 11 & 13 year olds we had with us, as they probably tried 25% of the dishes, as the other 75% were too ""Scary""......not ""tween or kid friendly, so you'll need that babysitter or play date. Was also very ""spendy"", but not more so than comparable establishments in this rare altitude of Gastronomic ambition. Amazing!! Just have to get in! Its not all hype, this place knows how to make some serious grub. Excellent variety and fantastic service. You really can't go wrong here, everything that comes out of the kitchen is amazing. Go hungry and DO NOT go with picky eaters. This restaurant is best experienced with around 4 people who eat and appreciate everything.  Go with friends who don't mind exploring the entire menu! No restaurant has ever brought me closer to tears... because it was so good. On a glorious Saturday in the city, I decided to drag my boyfriend to stand in line @ 4:45 to get into what I thought was a ""hyped up"" restaurant. Boy, was that 45 minutes wait worth every single second.  While we stood in the cold, the guys inside brought us out some warm, creamy, thick hot chocolate. Once the line started moving, we ended up getting a table at 7:30pm so we walked down the street to kill some time at the Hookah bar. For people without a reservation, I'd highly recommend just going to wait (think about all those times you've waited at other crappy restaurants because they were busy). 7:30 comes and we're seated immediately. First thought: holy crap these people are SO FRIENDLY!!! We got seated at the bar area and the chef in front of us was super nice and helpful. By the end of the night, we know where he's from, where he went to school, what to order, and the history of the restaurant. At that point, it's like dinner and entertainment! Needless to say, the food lives up to ALL the hype. Favorites were the pork belly and the crab kim chee. The ice cream sandwich dessert was ridiculously amazing, as well as the dessert shots (sort of like a thick milky peanut butter shot). The state bird, which everyone must try, was so incredibly flavorful due to those delicious glazed onions! At some point about 9 dishes deep, note there were only 2 of us, I realized how full I was. The food was so good, I literally contemplated hanging around until I became hungry again! I needed to make room to try everything, right? Please, if you live in SF and consider your self a true SF'er, you MUST TRY THIS RESTAURANT. You will have no regrets! Finally, finally, made it to State Bird! However, it took arriving at 4:45pm to wait for the doors to open at 5:30pm and let us in line take the tables reserved for walk-ins.The vibe was fun, everyone anxious to finally dine at this Fillmore highlight - guests around us in line and inside were buzzing with excitement. The true gem of the place is the chance to do dim sum unlike anywhere else. This is not Chinese food being carted around but unique twists of American dishes.The food is all good, nothing I found to be spectacular but food was solid and tasty. My favorite was off the menu - the sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino, and ricotta pancakes. Sadly, the renowned CA state bird with provision dish was way underwhelming. I recommend ordering the pancakes and then having fun with the dim sum that comes around. End the meal with whatever flavor ice cream sandwiches are being featured. We got luck with sesame ice cream sandwiches and they were delicious. I was only in SF for a day, and my culinary mission focused mainly on scoring a seat at State Bird on a Saturday night (ambitious, I know). I walked in at 7PM, and they told me that there would be a seat ready for me at 10:30PM -- for which I was totally willing to wait, and I got a call at around 10:15PM telling me that a spot was opening up. I hustled on over, and they seated me at the counter by the chefs. The experience was worth the wait, and the $63 bill (no drinks).When dining solo, it's hard for waitstaff to gauge whether they need to give you space or constant attention, and the friendly people of State Bird managed to strike a good balance. They give you a menu with the ""permanent"" items, and, as mentioned, everything else comes by dim-sum style on carts and trays for you to ogle.I started off with the State Bird with Provisions ($9 for half portion), because, duh. This crispy little quail died for a good cause -- the batter was terrific and aromatic, and the provisions of onions in broth with cheese shavings were a nice accompaniment, though perhaps a little soupy for the crispy fowl. The Corned Beef Tongue ($6) came by and I couldn't pass it up. Served alongside tiny potato dumplings and a green garlic emulsion sauce, this dish had great chew and savory flavor. The tongue was tender, and not rubbery, and was fairly generously portioned - good for sharing. I liked the sauce, though I wish it had been a tad more spicy.I picked the Pork Belly with Blood Orange Salad and Jalapenos ($10) off a tray, and this was definitely one of my favorite dishes of the evening. The pork belly was cut into a few large cubes, adorned with a tangy, citrusy dressing, and sprinkled with lots of herbs and slivers of blood orange. I love fatty flavors, and I enjoyed the tender and crispy parts of the pork belly, complemented well by the sour dressing and spicy peppers. A cart came to me, laden with lots of savory options, and I opted for an Oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut and sesame/chili oil ($3). Normally, I'm a big fan of the unadorned bivalve, but these looked really delicious, and the crunch of the kraut played well with the fresh, briny oyster. A solid pick, and obviously not shareable.The thing I'd been hunting for came my way - Duck Liver Mousse with Almond Financiers ($6) - and I snapped up that little dish immediately. I'm a big foie gras fan, and while their rendition of the liver wasn't the best I've ever had, it was certainly served in a novel way with the sweet, spongy little almond biscuits. This seems like an ideal dish to share, since you do get a good number of biscuits and not everyone can put back that much rich liver.Just when I thought I couldn't take it anymore, a tray showed up bearing tiny cups of Chawanmushi topped with guanciale ($5) - this was described to me as Japanese egg custard. I liked this ok, but it's not normally a dish I'd order; it just looked so cute and I was at my fullness point! The egg custard was tender and flavorful, topped with a brothy sauce and two pieces of pork cheek. Probably the least memorable of the dishes I had, but still good.I thought maybe I'd leave without ordering dessert because I was full to the point of pain, but then I thought, ""Oh, what the hell,"" and ordered two half portions of dessert ($4 each) - the Strawberry Granita with creme fraiche-honey mousse and dates, and the Kyoto Rye Crepes with chocolate-banana jam, bananas, and candied kumquats. The kitchen, apparently sensing that I was up for a challenge, gifted me with a shot of their Peanut Muscovado milk ($2). I think, of all the items on the menu, the desserts seemed most like an afterthought. They were solid and fairly inventive, but not spectacular and surprising like some of the savory options. The granita was nicely textured and went well with the mousse (it was described to me as a riff on strawberries and cream), but the dates were misplaced in this dish -- their blander flavor and chewy texture didn't quite mesh with the granita/mousse. The rye crepes were a little sodden and bland, though I did VERY much like the chocolate-banana jam... again, the kumquat accompaniment seemed misplaced. Finally, the peanut buttery-sugary-creamy milk was a big shot of diabetes, but still very tasty! It was sort of the coup de grace of my whole meal, since it encapsulated the excess and whimsy of everything I'd just eaten.The waitstaff are patient, kind, attentive, and eager to tell you what they're toting on their many trays and carts - I appreciated this as a solo diner. The ambiance is pretty casual, which I liked, and has sort of the nouveau-hipster-trendy look of a lot of restaurants in its genre. The musical selection really stayed in the background, which can be great or sad depending on your viewpoint; it didn't distract from the food, but didn't really set a mood. And, finally, I LOVED the art in the bathroom -- witty illustrations of a ""French Onion Coup"" and another food pun. Where else are you gonna find delicious food served with so much love and energy from the FOH and BOH. I enjoyed every moment of it! With the exception of those seated at the rear of the restaurant, everyone is virtually seated at a chef's table with chef Stewart standing a few feet from you, orchestrating his band, expediting his take on, ""New Californian"" cuisine.After a stroll around Japantown and the Filthymo' along with an hour and a half long wait outside their unmarked restaurant me and the lady embarked on the yummy culinary journey chef Stewart was gonna take us on. While we had no reservations we were among the first in a line that looked as though some Jordans were about to be re-released. We were seated on the little sidebar situated on the left side of the line where you get this really awesome view of the interaction between chef Stewart and his crew. We watch as a cart comes around with food, and being in close proximity to the kitchen we get first dibs! Fu*k yeah.. So you have the option to order off the cart or the menu, a la dim sum style. I start to get all food nerd dumb with excitement like some kid at a Gamestop as I try to match the pictures I've seen on Yelp to the treys and carts passing me by.Nearly everything I scarfed down was pretty bomb. Clean, flavorful and balanced. Wasn't too impressed by the State Bird though. I suppose I didn't like the broth taking all that nice bit of crunch from what already is a tiny bird. Having dined a few days earlier at some of Wine Country's gems, this here once jaded culinary worker ended it by proclaiming State Bird without a doubt the one of the best and most unique dining experiences I've ever experienced in my life. That sashimi seaweed cracker thing, the shisho leaves drink, the seemingly mundane sourdough pancake, and that tres leche were all just mind blowing. I'm talmbout Ho Lee S#!+ good.Working in a professional kitchen it was such as breath of fresh air to hear the very knowledgeable head server Emily (who was also main bartender of the night) explain to us that they rotate positions to cross-train each other in order to ultimately appreciate each other's position. While this maybe nothing new to certain industries, however for mine is fairly unheard of considering I'm used to working in kitchens with a more a structured, traditional, highly militarized approach where you pretty much put your head down, shut your trap and go to work. As opposed to State Bird's seemingly more open-minded, democratic approach to cooking. To hear that during family meals they are all working together trying to conceptualize new ideas instead of some stuffy head chef who won't take no for an answer and to see their GM, Mr. Anderson come up to you and take his time to see how you're doing while he's out there bussin' azz while bussin' tables you quickly realize that they truly are passionate about what they do. You have some cats that just talk about their ""love"" of the craft then you have the crew at State Bird Provisions whose actions speak louder. It's all beautiful. Poetry in motion. To simply gauge SBP by it's food without taking into account its service, business concept and execution from the bottom up would be an extreme disservice to as the restaurant truly reflects the Bay Area's ever changing, evolving, open and diverse way of living. Chefs Stewart and Nicole make for the best one two combo if I've ever seen one.I left amazed, excited and inspired once again. Crazy good food. Every bite is like a party in your mouth. Worth every minute of waiting in line. State Bird-Okay, like, Statebird sucks!  I hate to say it, but the hype is like ridiculous I can't understand what it's all about, living in the neighborhood.  I would not recommend this location, unless you could easily get in just to try a couple of things.At the same time, the hostess was an absolute sweetheart, and our server was knowledgeable, friendly, and exceptional with respect to, the finer points.  The real disappointment was the food...The Bird... It sucked, tasteless, boney..lame.  Major let down!  The pate, any-bar USA, the oysters...blah, and ice cream sandwich, (how could it suck?) it did!Gonna go back for kicks, way down the road, I'm sure. I think most of the other reviews already tells you everything you need to know. But I'll review some of the best things that helped me. So here goes:Reservations online are impossible and waiting sucks so you have a few options for same day seating:1. Hire someone on task rabbit to wait for you (or hire them to stand in line and then  make a reservation for you later in the day such as a 8pm.)2. Pay your unemployed friend a six pack and tell him to wait for you.3. Get there 60 mins or (75 minutes to be safe) before they open and wait for open seating.  I was #5 inline.   It seemed that most people behind me (about 20) also got in. It's like Chinese Dim Sum but with American food. Yes that's exactly what it is like!1. Just like Chinese Dim Sum don't get suckered into getting the things that you don't like or doesn't look good. 2. If it's not popular it'll come back to your table much faster than the good stuff.3. Toward the end of your meal you can request to see the complete menu and possibly order anything you haven't tried.4. Prices vary greatly from $2 -$14 per dish but don't focus too much on the price, it'll ruin your dinner. 5. Try lots of different items, as many as you can afford or eat.  (we tried almost all of them)1/3 awesome1/3 good/great1/3 okay/not goodI think if we were a little more discerning we would not have ordered the dishes that we thought looked okay, and in fact were just okay/not good.  But lesson learned, next time we'll be more picky.  But then again that's part of the fun. Dilemma!Overall food was great and they had some really interesting items.  Very creative and mostly delicious.  And since it's always changing you'll probably never get the same thing twice. Lastly, the service was great!!! 5 Stars all the way.  And for a nice restaurant I think that service is very important.  Why spend all that money for good food only to leave with a bad taste from the service?So figure out a way to get in, you won't regret it. Came here a week ago after many failed attempts(hard to get in). Was worth the wait and didn't disappoint!! Do yourself a favor: come hungry and do it dim sum style. We were gonna order off the menu, but kept getting distracted by the multiple trays of food coming by, which was not a bad thing at all: it was f*^king awesome!!! We opted to go that route instead. It forced us to be adventurous but also the anticipation of what else might come our way was exceptionally fun!! Will attempt to come back... It's so called the best new restaurant in the US and it's hard to book. But I don't think the taser worth the waiting time, the food is good, and the way they present is creative. But for me it's more like a overpriced, dim-sum style restaurant. But people in the restaurant are all very funny and cool After a short back and forth the folks at State Bird chose to honor my cancelled reservation. The food was as amazing as expected and the customer service before and during my meal was also on excellent. I'm extremely happy they did the right thing and will be sure to return. Love the concept: a blend of hustlin' dim sum with quality tapas. I think its one of those must try places and go with a lot of people so you can try all the dishes!  My gf took me here for a belated meal and between the two of us, I couldn't stomach anymore of the food going around.  SO MUCH MORE TO TRY!  If you can't get reservations which seems nearly impossible nowadays, I would try to get in line at around 4:45 and go with at least 4 more.  The more people, the more food to get your taste buds tingling! Solid 4.0 stars if not 4.25 stars.I had heard about SBP from a friend and did my research on it too once my boyfriend and I had booked our trip to SF. Affordable Michelin rated food???? I had to make it a mission of mine to go while I was in SF! And having done just so, we had concluded that our asses had to be in line for this restaurant at least 45 mins before actual opening time - to be safe of course. Fast forward to the trip...When it came to the day we had actually scheduled time to go to SBP, public transportation was against us and we didn't get there until 5:35 (five minutes after opening) - damn that 38 bus route!!! The end of the line when we got there was four storefronts down from SBP's door!!!!! Every so often a lady would come out from the restaurant and inform us roughly what times we were looking at depending on where we were on line. On her third visit, she had estimated where the cut off was for that night's seating - four to six people behind us!!! That chick was money man - spot on with the estimates!! By the time we got to the podium, the hostess said it would be close to 10:45pm ( 15 minutes before their closing time) for a table for 3: me, my boyfriend and a friend. So we took it, obviously. Having been in similar scenarios before, we knew that the time they gave us was conservative, so we has decided to just grab drinks in the area just before. Then, at 9:55pm we get the text message from the hostess -- our table is ready early! BOOM!Atlast, we were seated, and within minutes time, the cart of food is at our table! We had practically ordered everything on the cart and more from the written menu like was were drunk hungry - which we kind of were - AND had ordered a bottle of wine for the table too.All in all we must have tried 10 - 13 dishes, including dessert. The everything was great, some more memorable than others. The sourdough pancakes, the pork belly, the braised short rib, the huge buratta on that fried garlic doughy goodness - were all amazing!!! The desserts - not so much. Is it worth the wait? Yes.Did it live up to the hype? Yes.Would I come back? Definitely. This place would get 5 stars if it were easier to get a reservation. The food and overall doing experience are fantastic when you get in, but we had to wait in line from 5-5:30 to be told to come back at 9:45. Next time we'll see a movie while we wait rather than bar hop ;) We enjoyed the dim sum experience and our server was a gracious host. Really loved this place. Very unique and eclectic. Will definitely go back. Great food! Great fun! My husband and I decided to see what the hype was all about on a recent trip to SF. We arrived 4:30 to line up for the 5:30 opening on a Wednesday night. We got two great seats at the raw bar where we could watch the food being prepared. Loved the small plates concept as we always enjoy sampling many different nite wherever we eat. We ordered only two items from the menu - a yummy duck-ham maitake pancake and a delicious crab kimchi yuba with smoked egg dish. The rest we chose from the trays/carts of food brought around dim-sum style. Dishes were very tasty, bright, creative, fun! Almost everything was outstanding except the pork belly which was crispy - I prefer falling apart pork belly. The duck liver mousse was decent but didn't compare to other dishes. Some favorites include raw oyster, guinea hen dumpling, a wild mushroom dish, and hamachi-avocado on a nori cracker. For dessert, the ""ice cream sandwich,"" olive oil cake and granita were fabulous! They were happy to let us have half orders of dessert so we could sample more!Well worth the wait! Love this place! unique, fun, tasty, amazing, diverse, cultured,... read the rest of the reviews i'm just rating it so i can tell people i went here. 5 stars! I am one picky eater and I was able to find lots of items that I really really enjoyed. Crab was absolutely Delish! Nice and spicy! I don't think I would wait 4 hours in line to eat here like some people did. Just try to make a reservation like a normal person. ...it's good..it ain't wait outside for 4 hours good ya feel me?! Came on Sat. Restaurant opens at 5:30pm. 45 mins before it opened, I counted 50 people waiting in line. Prob only 30 people can get a walk in table. Before it opened, prob 70 people waited in line. It was windy and cold in sf. It's an interesting experience. But it's not worthy. Only 3 stars to me. Food is innovative but doesn't taste good. Fried pork belly with jalapeños and citrus - prob second best dish to me tonight. The citrus and jalepenos flavors come out nicely. Garlic break with barrata - interesting texture for both. The bread tastes different and chewy but no garlic flavor and only pepper. Hen dumpling - waited forever for this. The broth is different and very salty. I would not pay $3 for this one piece. Chocolate ice cream sandwich - super hard and the brownies are too chewy. Hamachi, avocado and seaweed cracker - the best dish of the day. Nicely decorated. Mushroom risotto porridge - it's nice and mild but it's worthy of $8. Duck mousse almond biscuit - no almond flavors but the duck mousse is unique. However they don't come well together. Spicy drunkenness crab kimchi yuba - just kimchi stir fried with a tiny piece of crab and mostly yuba (fu zhu) which is curb bean sheet. $13. Super pricy and not that good. I was there last night...I'm not sure...I can't figure out why this place has 4.5*. Usually a place with 4.5* in SF is at least 4* to me. I think there is a conspiracy! Here is my take:-Somebody started this restaurant and gave it a weird name. I hear someone says: ""we are going to State Bird Provisions"" tonight. And I'm like thinking in my head what is that? Would I look stupid if I ask? I just Google it later...probably some bird watching place. -The restaurant found a few people, who told a few other people, who then told a few more people, that this place is ""amazing""...It's ""must go"". So somehow everybody already thinks this place is amazing before going there.-Then I can't make a reservation...so I walk there and wait around 3 hours for a table. I go to Dosa for some GREAT appetizer and few drinks and laugh, waiting for the bigger part of the night. So you already think it's a big deal.-I put in the address in my iPhone and ""you have arrived at your destination"" but um...there is no sign on the door! ooo! An element of mystery! This must be good. I already know I'm coming back here. I mean...at least have a picture of a bird or something on the door. -I am finally sitting at my table wondering what is this all about. They come around with carts, dim sum style (very cool concept actually...the only special thing about this place). -I'm starving...and everything is coming to us fast in little tiny plates...and they are ""infused"" with this name-u-never-heard-before or ""garnished"" with that-other-name-u-never-heard before. And oh, of course some trendy ingredient, like ""Quinoa"", that I have almost every day at home. Sh*t! Must be good. But it's just so mediocre. Like nothing special about it in the end.-I am not satisfied with the cart stuff and I am still trying to find the awe-inspiring factor. So I pick up the menu to order a ""real"" Tapa or meal that is more than half-a-bite. It comes...same deal...not special at all...still half a bite...like I think I accidentally swallowed it before I tasted it.-Still not giving up! Maybe the desert. I don't know...Just OK I guess.-I asked for the check...couldn't wait to get home to my jar of peanut butter.There must be another star hidden somewhere...but I couldn't find it. Maybe I'll go back again looking for it. We have been unable to dine there due to the ""reservation nightmare"" that continues.  A friend endured the wait outside and found the dishes ultimately offered to be good but not worth the long wait and ceremony to get in.  We may try later when the shine has worn off. We were waiting for soooooo long to get in.  Heard a lot about the food.  And..... Were disappointed:/( The location is not ideal.  No parking.  Doesn't feel really safe.  Ambiance.  We felt like we were seating in Office Depot, and something was not finished. Service. As soon as we set down (there were many if us) and ordered drinks, they started dropping food in our table so fast that we thought they need table for someone else, want us to eat fast and leave. Food.  The food was definately different from anything we tried before.  Bone marrow was delitious! Interesting couple of dishes.  But too many thing mixed in one.  I couldn't remember what I ate.  Price. Very reasonable.  There are many more great restaurants in a city that you can get in much sooner and spend pleasurable time, and have great food. My rating is for the food and the experience.  It was great - really enjoyed the unique experience of ""American dimsum.""Side Note:A lot of people are rating this establishment 1 Star because of the OpenTable nightmare. It's understandable but most people don't realize how complicated switching systems can be - especially for popular businesses. I worked in service for Virgin America and the switch over to Sabre was not seamless. Unless someone works in service or tech, they might not understand. Hope they'll give this place another shot because they're missing out!Continuing...I tried a variety of things but failed to take pictures of them because I was busy eating and eying everything that passed by. I did manage to take one of the desserts which captured almost one of each; they ran out of one of them (sad face).They had this reverse xiaolongbao dish - a dumpling in a small bowl in broth - sooo good!Their nonalcoholic drinks were refreshing. They have a muddled shiso leaf drink that could be compared to a virgin mojito; their guava soda is based on an in-house guava syrup - ask them about it!The servers were nice and knowledgeable. One of them introduced me to a new French wine that was great on the palette with all my food. I'll have to come again to see if it's consistently awesome but I had a great time. Thanks State Bird Provisions for great food and awesome service!FYI - this place is pretty well lit. Not sure if you care but just saying. [visited March 2014] We had been trying to get a reservation for what seems like a year. Then, we managed to finally get a reservation on line and we were delighted! We were so excited! We changed our schedules so that we could make it there at the appointed time. Then, after a couple of days, we received an email from them saying that it was all a mistake, the didn't really mean to give us a reservation. But they have this new reservation system they ""are thrilled about as it incorporates many new features that will improve our guests' experiences."" Well it sure didn't improve our experience. These people are clueless and way too full of themselves. I wish I could give them zero stars. Delicious and creative dishes presents an unparalleled experience at very reasonable prices. A new frontier forged by new American ideas, tapas, and dimsum logistics. Hipster genius. Kudos to Michelin to give SBP a star.Came here with 3 other friends. Started lining up at 5pm (30 minutes before opening) and barely got a table at 9:30pm. We went to get a drink at The Alembic and returned around 9:30pm to be seated. Excited!Ordered a few dishes off the menu and more from the carts:- Pork belly: I have had many kinds of pork belly. This was nothing new but still quite good. It's slow cooked and fried again to have the soft-in, crisp-out contrast. A bit sweetness takes the fatty edge off.- Salmon tartar with furikake: cured cucumber with tasty pink salmon tartar. Furikake seems to be home made too. The creamy salmon and crunchy furikake makes an awesome combination. Lightly cured cucumber is nice too.- Smoked trout with avocado mousse: Oh smokiness + ocean + earthy avocado mousse. The highlight of the night for me.- Black cod pancake: good filler. The fish did taste very fatty so I almost forgot it's cod. - Bone marrow: I'm not a huge fan of bone marrow, but it was not bad. Very oily and filling though. The pepper corn and herbs gave the marrow a good kick.- State bird: breaded and deep fried quail. The origin of SBP. Tender & Juicy. Delish & must have.- SBP soda - Shiso yuzu: Out of all the fried and fatty dishes that we ordered, this soda was a life savor. Refreshing combination of shiso and yuzu is just perfect.Will come back again to try more creations. I was very interested in the asparagus, too. Please keep up the awesome work SBP. Customer service fail....This is Ryan Anderson, General Manager of State Bird Provisions, writing to explain a particularly unfortunate and unexpected situation that occurred for online reservations facilitated Tuesday (3/25) and Wednesday (3/26). We have just completed the transition to OpenTable as our new reservations system, a change that we are thrilled about as it incorporates many new features that will improve our guests' experiences. We are a small restaurant with the great fortune of being quite busy, so part of this move involved migrating thousands of existing reservations to the new system -- a big undertaking that we took very seriously. Nonetheless, in that move, some reservations were inadvertently opened to the web that did not in fact represent available tables. Now, much to our chagrin, we've had to cancel your reservation because we quite simply don't have the space to honor that spot along with our existing reservations and walk-in guests. We truly apologize for the great inconvenience -- and any disappointment -- this caused. We are in the business of serving people and making people happy, so it's a huge letdown for us to have to say no this time around. We would be delighted to have you join us again in the future; please don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions about how to do that. Your understanding is sincerely appreciated, and we so look forward to sharing our food, atmosphere, and hospitality with you on one of those other nights very soon. This place ended up being a 3.5 star place for me. I love the dimsum style eating, but the food wasn't as good as I had expected.I wanted to see how this place matched up with Rich Table.First wave: Raw oysters with spicy kohlrabi kraut and sesame (oh, so fresh), hamachi-avocado on a seaweed cracker (tasted really good), sourdough, saurkraut, pecorino and ricotta (maybe my favorite), steak tartare lettuce wraps (pass), duck & sottocenere croquettes (very light for something fried), and duck liver mousse with almond biscuit (I've had better pate). The first three were the best of the round.The second wave included: garlic bread with burrata (nothing special), hearts of palm with avocado, pomelo and tahini-chili oil (forgettable), pork belly grape salad (very good pork belly), spicy dungeness crab kimchi yuba with smoked egg (definitely would get again!), and quail eggs on a cast iron skillet with apple, sunchokes and mt. tam [?] (this was uniquely awesome).Next round was the famed CA state bird wit provisions (not as good as what it should be), grilled asparagus with walnuts and pecorino (skip), red trout with mandarins and hazelnut brown butter (I enjoyed this one a lot), and grilled beef and brussel sprouts with umeboshi and bonito (everyone loved it...I thought it was ok).For dessert we had spiced cocoa nib 'ice cream' sandwiches (decent), black pepper pecans wit plum fudge (earthy), and guava tres leches with chevre creme fraiche, rhubarb and pistachio (easily my favorite). We also added on a couple other dishes.The meal was good and fun, but not as good as it's hyped up to be. The savior was the cute waitress, Penelope (majestic name), who was super knowledgeable about the menu and was super nice. She easily bumped my review up to 4 stars! Short review: we scored a Rez (hard to do!). Some of the best food of my life. Innovative ""dim sum"" approach plus a standard menu. Everything they bring surprises. I think it doesn't matter what you order: everything is so wild and good you re bound to be pleased. This surely is foodie heaven. Staff was amazing. Wow, reality lived up to the hype which is a rarity.  Not sure how I scored reservation either two days before our four person birthday dinner for my wife.  It might be due to their transition to Opentable recently and there are less bots taking up all the reservation.  Anyways, here is a tip if there is a line in front after they open at 5:30pm.  If you got reservation, just walk in to the front and tell them you have a reservation.  We waited for ten minutes and then realized that the line we were in was the walk-in line.On to the food.  Pork Riblets was so good that we had to get seconds.  We also tried the fried pork belly in some kind of citrus dressing with dill, cilantro and grapefruit.  The dressing balanced out the fat and richness of the pork belly perfectly.  Flavors on top of flavors on top of flavors.  We also ordered their grilled steak from their menu but while it was good, was not as good at the riblets or pork belly.My favorite dish of the night was their salmon tartare(?) on top of cucumbers sprinkled with some sort of crunchy benito or seaweed flakes.  Anyways, try it if you like sushi, you won't regret it.  Also had their raw halibut on top of seaweed with avocado and other things.  All in all, a great dinner for our first trip to State Bird.  I will definately come back here again. My foodie in crime who loves to try amazing food suggested we come here.We don't like to settle for ordinary food that satisfies you easily when we are together.Heads up is that you should make a reservation of 2 months in advance if you want to secure a table.Customer service:We came as walk ins and the hostess, Oozy (sorry if I spelled your name wrong) was the sweetest with her great smile and personality. She tried her best into accommodating us with a reservation of 9:45 if there was a cancelation. We waited for 3-4 hours in hopes to get a table. And I guess luck was on our side because we were seated and from there we began our exploration of amazing flavors. Atmosphere:The atmosphere was very nice, although it was very detail and decorated, it gave you a sense of at home dinning. With the bright open kitchen to the slightly dimmer and very easy going dinning tables. It's very cute because it's served in a ""dimsum"" style where they come around in a cart of tray and introducing these new food to you. And we just wanted to try everything. We just kept saying yes to everything that came our way.Braised Pork:The braised pork was amazing. I thought they used parmesan to season it however only to be surprised that there was no cheese. The pork belly itself was braised in a way where the fat has wrapped around the pork forming this cheesy seasoning on top.Salmon tartare with cucumber and crunchy quinoa:The salmon tartar with cucumber and quinowa was amazing. It was a heavenly match where the salmon was soft and it melts in your mouth while the quinowa was crunchy and gave you a sense of explosion. To top it was the fresh cucumber that made the whole sensation come with a light freshness.Black forest black sesame ice cream sandwich:It was a perfect match for each other. The sesame sandwich base has a sesame taste that isn't overpowering your tastebuds while being a bit salted. It was a perfect match with the ice cream because the ice cream's sweetness balanced out the saltiness of the sesame sandwich so you can't taste it.Roasted bone marrow with chanterelles & pink peppercorn:For myself I wasn't exactly impressed with this dish because I think it's just not really my flavor, however my friend loved it. The dish was really well made though, the bone marrow came out perfectly fine and the texture was amazing because it just melts right when it gets into you mouth. Dungeness crab with kimchi and tofu skin:This was a dish that I personally loved. It was recommended by one of the nice servers. I personally love the mix because the tofu skin and crab meat was soft along with a crunchy bit of kimchi and it's creamy spice sauce.Sourdough, Sauerkraut, Pecorino & Ricotta Pancakes:We think it was okay, it was definitely good but maybe a little heavy on the cheese taste. It felt a bit like I was eating a mozzarella cheese ball but it was fried to be a good crunch.Quil Egg:This was good, but not my cup of egg. Maybe it was the mushroom in it that overpowered it a little. It had a slight herbal taste to it also. Smoked trout, potato porridge, poached egg, nori:This was delicious.CA State Bird With Provisions:Hamachi-avocado & seaweed cracker:Raw Oysters with Spicy Kohlrabi Kraut & Sesame:We literally gained an extra 50 pounds last night and waking up still full. We will definitely come back with reservation next time in hopes to try what we haven't yet. SBP is like the hot guy whose photos you drool all over online, but when you finally land a date and meet up in person, you find out that he's a half foot shorter than you. Is he still hot? Certainly, but not everything you were hoping for. After all the struggle of obtaining a reservation, waiting for 2 months after the reservation was made, and hearing recommendations from several different people for this place, I was completely ready to fall head over heels in love. Did I discover the new love of my culinary life? Sadly no (Frances still holds my heart), but SBP is still a solid choice. I had several hits through the course of my meal here, but also experienced just as many misses. Eating here gave me a good understanding of why tasting menus and prix fixe menus are set up the way they are.  The chef is certainly not shy about flavor. Unlike most upscale places with their complex but subtle flavors, the food here is rich and packs quite a flavorful punch. This was enjoyable for the first few dishes, but after several fat filled dishes in a row, it started to become a little too much. I now understand why many restaurants will offer a palate cleanser in between courses and opt for more subtle flavors. I'm sure everyone reading through these reviews has caught on to the dim sum format so I won't elaborate on that. The price: The cart food is a little cheaper than the menu food. They range from $3-$10 each. Menu food runs $8-$20. The bill at the end for night for 2 people was $114.30 before tip and we got to sample 13 different dishes for that price. This is definitely on the more affordable side of Michelin dining. I wasn't blown away as I was hoping, but I'd be willing to give it another try in the future. Hits for the night: Salmon Tartare, pork belly, hen dumpling in savory broth, duck liver mousse with almond biscuits, and the ice cream sandwich.  Ok items: Hamachi on a nori chip, bone marrow (the bread was delicious though), peanut milk, oyster, state bird with provisions (tasted like a small fried chicken).Misses: Garlic bread with burrata (I know yelpers loved this, but I just didn't get it. Tasted no garlic at all. Just tasted like black pepper flavored bread), egg with mushroom and bacon in a shot sized cup, rye crepes (a deconstructed crepe with a sauce that was just too sweet). Oh my goodness! I am so glad I was able to dine at this restaurant last week (on a whim too)! I was trying to get reservations here (by refreshing their website over the past month), but nothing was available for the night that I was going to be in SF. Sooo...I decided to try the ""walk-in"" method on a Monday evening around 6:15 pm. I arrived, checked in with the hostess and she actually said that they will have an opening at 8:45 pm!SCORE!!!Instead of dining at House of Prime Rib that evening, my friend and I decided to wait for our reservation at 8:45 pm since it's so rare to be able to secure a spot at this restaurant! WHAT A GREAT DECISION WE MADE. :) We hung out in the neighborhood for 2.5 hours or so until our reservation time. Good thing there was lots to catch up on since I was visiting for the week. hahaWhen it was our time to check-in, we went to the restaurant and waited for about 15 more minutes as the folks (who were sitting at the bar where we were going to be seated) were wrapping up their meal and paying their bill. We finally got seated at the 2 bar seats to the very right of the restaurant and nearest the door (there were only 2 bar seats facing the restaurant windows). This location is great in our opinion because all the dim sum items get made right in front of you and you get first dibs on the dim sum cart! WOOT. :) It can get a bit loud since you're sitting near the door/people are coming in and out of the restaurant. All that aside though - our bar location was great. It was just 2 of us dining anyways.Given that it was our first time there, we ordered items from the dim sum cart + items from the menu itself. Here's what we ate:CA state bird with provisions - this is the must-get staple dish, since this item was pretty much named after the restaurant itself. everyone gets it; you can find it on the menu instead of the dim sum cart. it's quail!duck liver mousse - the little buns that come with are so dainty and deliciouswild salmon tartarewild mushroom farrow - flavorful; i should have gotten one just for myself hahaoyster w/ sesame - fresh!hamachi crunch - the crunch makes it divine!red troutblack sesame ice cream (dessert) - SO GOODtres leches (dessert) with rhubarb jam - SO GOODIn all, we spent only $90 (this includes tip too) for 2 people and felt fulfilled. It was such a great meal - just enough quantity and quality!  THANKFUL that we were able to do walk-in on a busy night and eat to our tummies delight! Had a wonderful experience here. There was probably a hundred people in line when we arrived and the host came out and called everyone in with reservations... And away we went. The restaurant was nice, bright and had an open kitchen - which I love. We were seated in the middle of the room which allowed for great views all around. There is a set menu as we'll as items that are brought around ""dim sum"" style on carts. There was such an amazing vibe in the room - both the guests and the staff.  And I would be remiss to not mention that there wasn't a member of the waitstaff that I didn't think was incredible. Okay - food. Let me do my best to remember. Off the standard menu went with the ginger scallion pancake, state bird with provisions, and the Dungeness crab with kimchi. Let me pause here - the crab and kimchee was awesome. I loved everything about it and pretty much licked the bowl.Off the carts ordered duck mousse with almond biscuits, oyster with sesame and Sriracha hoisin type sauce, nori crisp with hamachi, smoked salmon terrine with avocado,  pork belly with citrus, duck and cheese croquettes, Guinea hen dumpling with lemon oil, and beef tongue. For dessert we had some peppermint tea and the peanut milk. I can't even stress how much I loved the meal. Need to go again to try different dishes. We were so full we had to start saying no. Best dishes were the crab, dumpling, and nori crisp. I would pass on the pork belly (just a little tired of it I guess). LOVED my meal here--will definitely be back just for the hamachi nori chip (see below!)Schpeel about how this place works: Fine dining dimsum style. They have people pushing around carts with the food on them and a little price tag attached, very cute. They also have a menu you can order from (i.e. savory pancakes, meats). Boyfriend and I ordered 2 mains from the menu and around 13 dimsum dishes for a total of ~$150, and were stuffed by the end. SBP says the menu changes frequently, but both the main menu and daily dimsum items look more or less the same to me.Food (4/5)The food was very up and down--there were a few dishes that we did not care for at all BUT there was one dish that made the entire meal worth it--the hamachi nori chip. It is literally to die for. It's a thick, crispy nori chip with small pieces of hamachi sashimi sitting on top with dabs of avocado, black garlic aioli, and radishes. Literally one of the best dishes I have had in awhile. But that being said, the rest of the dishes were only okay. We did not care for the duck pancake, cumin lamb, duck liver mousse/almond biscuits, or the garlic bread at all. We did like the lobster salad, yogurt caviar, oysters, guinea hen dumplings, and the state bird a lot. The dessert was just okay.Ambience (5/5)Love the vibes here. Very trendy and lax. We had a really fun time dining here.Service (5/5)The people here are so so nice. The table that we were supposed to be waiting for took forever. The hostess kept apologizing profusely and did everything she could to make our wait more bearable--she eventually worked some magic to help us get another table. She was a sweetheart!ONLY COMPLAINT: The reservation system! Literally impossible to get a reservation (opens online at 4am daily and gets booked within seconds) but the good news is there is always a good chunk of tables saved for walk-in. But the line does start forming early, so definitely get there by 4:30pm (they open at 5:30pm). If you are in line before the hat shop door...chances are you will get in on the first seating. If you don't get in on the first seating though, they will take your name down and give you a time to return (usually around 7:00pm). They also bring you treats while you wait in line outside!Overall, will definitely be back because it's a great dining experience and the hamachi nori chip is amazing. Yes, it's worth the hype. Had a 7:30 reservation and showed up at 7:15, and were sat right down at our table. The first server who came to our table explained how things work, and said we would meet all of the other servers that night, and he was right. We ordered salmon tartare and oysters from the cart, and lots of other things that were being passed around on trays.  Just tell anybody who passes by that you need another drink, and they will get it for you.   The servers were very friendly and helpful, and the food combinations were creative and outstanding.  The food on the trays is so enticing, don't forget to take a look at the menu! Their signature dish, deep fried quail, was really really good.  We were torn between two desserts, so they brought us a half order of each. GuavaTres Leches cake and their ice cream sandwich.  If, by some miracle, you can get a table at this place. Definitely go. This was not my original #600.  It would have landed four or five spots later chronologically, but this jumps the line with good reason.  Having a busy week after a grueling business trip, my Yelp skills were rusty (translation: I was exhausted!) so forgive my lack of details.A blow by blow is too difficult given the number of dishes and the time constraints of the meal, so here's my summary:Signature dishes1) Sourdough pancakes (yelp.com/user_local_phot…) - After devouring one, understood why it is a signature.  If you're a bread person, you'll like this.2) State Bird (yelp.com/user_local_phot…) - Think mini fried chicken (it's quail though) with pickled onions.  Can't get more deliciously crispy than this.Highlights3)  Pork belly - Melted in my mouth and softened my guilt with a grape leaf salad.  Forgot to click my camera on this one.4)  Crab dip & salsa with homemade chips (yelp.com/user_local_phot…) - Remember that Lays chip commercial, betcha can't just eat one?  That's how addictive these are and with crab dip that had a perfect texture, not too creamy.5)  Black sesame ice cream sandwich (yelp.com/user_local_phot…) - A fellow diner commented that the cookie reminded her of sesame cookies from Taiwan.  Did somebody say 'ice cream'?6). Peanut shot (yelp.com/user_local_phot…) - Think mini peanut milk shake.PlusWith the number of offered dishes, it's amazing how they are able to present such a variety of flavors without being repetitious, unique in their own way.  They are also innovators in giving you choices between the set menu items and the 'dim sum' style served foods that are offered as the servers walk the room.MinusDue to the crowds and long line, a diner may feel obligated to somewhat rush his/her meal as a courtesy to both the waiting customers and the restaurant.  If you are looking for a leisure dinner with conversation, this probably is not a good choice.  We were in and out of the restaurant in about 90 minutes, amazing considering that we had about sixteen courses not counting desserts.You may wonder why the change in the review format.  I couldn't remember the descriptions and names of every item that we ate.  Age is catching up with me... what's your name again?!Overall, the experience was five solid stars.  From our gracious hosts (inside connections), the special perks (complimentary glass of bubbly and meeting the chef), the service (courteous and efficient... plus a familiar face from another Michelin restaurant up north), and the food, amazing varying flavor profiles!  Just wished that I could remember more about it.  Will I be back?  You can bet on it, but hopefully when my mind is in a better state. This restaurant is seriously as good as it gets. After finally scoring a reservation online, we finally had a late Monday night dinner at this hot spot! Oh the menu options to choose from.  From duck pancakes to bone marrow there's a wide variety of items to choose from. Plus you don't even have to order from the menu. You can just wait for the servers to come around with plates/carts of goodies. I think we had about 10 of the 17 dishes they offered ""dim-sum style"". You have no idea what they'll be serving so you'll be guessing what could be next (which I find fun!) Affordable, quality, and complex, intricate ingredients. The menu can vary, but seriously there's really are no bad choices on the menu.Here is what we tried (literally I would recommend them all).  From the Main MenuCA State bird with provisionsDuck ham-maitake pecan pancake with cumquat mustard (soooo good)roasted bone marrow with mushrooms & pink peppercornFrom the Dim Sum ""carts""Duck CroqueteRaw Glacier Bay OystersGuinea Hen DumplingGriled aspargusartichoke, quinoa & chickpea ""tabouleh"" (my partner raved about this one!) garlic bread with bur rata ( a must have)wild mushroom farro spezzatosteak tartare 'caesar' lettuce cupssmoked trout & avocado chip & dip hamachi-avocado & seaweed cracker (quite delicious I must say)pork belly blood orange salad (MUST MUST MUST!) They ran out of the pork riblets so that was the only bummer of the night. For desserts, we had the black sugar-black sesame 'ice cream sandwich, apricot ginger sauce. Sooooo nice touch to cleanse my pallet!For drinks, I got a nonalcoholic soda.  I got the Lemon Meyer Guava! Oh it was the perfect sweet drink to top off a great ight of eating. Definitely a must try for food-enthusiast! you surely won't be disappointed. I will be back for seconds, or thirds. What can I say that hasnt been already written? . . . Everything was amazing. You should go if you can.Biggest surprise though was the onion ""jam"" that comes with the fried quail:bonappetit.com/test-kitc…I cooked it at home and it was almost identical. Great item to cook at home with poultry and impress your guests. After wanting to try this place for more than a year, I finally got the chance last night.  A few tips: go with at least three other friends so you can try as many dishes as possible, line up (starts at the door and wraps to the window so you can watch the chefs preparing the food) around 3:30-4pm on weekends if you don't have a reservation (55% of the tables are for walk-ins) and there's no sign on the door or building!  If you're within the first group of 20 or so, you'll get a seat, otherwise, they'll give you a time so you can walk around and not have to wait in line.Our favorites:Homemade potato chips with roe and creme fraiche: only complaint is it only comes with around 6 chips!Hamachi on a crispy nori chip: We ordered two of these... so good.  Tastes like hamachi poke.Duck liver mousse with almond biscuits: so rich and tasty.  Be sure to ask for extra biscuits at no charge.  You'll need them for the extra mousse.Mendocino sea urchin, ginger-scallion pancake with soy-lime sauce: a little like a Korean seafood pancake with a fresh urchin on top.Tofu custard with bacon: better as a dessertQuinoa porridge with wild mushrooms and ginger: like Chinese rice porridge, but with tons more flavor. Guinea hen dumpling: Steamed dumpling with lots of flavor.  Love the mushroomy broth.Braised Pork Belly: excellent sauce, perfectly cooked skinGood, but just above average:CA state bird with provisions: their specialty.  It's a fried quail with a lemony, leeky sauce on the bottom.  Pricey and less meat than two chicken wings.Garlic Bread with Burrata: like a Chinese fried donut at the dim sum restaurants, but with a glop of cheese.Grilled beef & broccoli with umeboshi and bonitoGuava tres leches: tres leches with a side of guava jelly and whipped cream.Oysters with chili oil, sesame seeds: $2 each.  It was good, but I might be spoiled with the Hog Wash at Hog Islabd Oyster Depot.Skip:Grilled beef broccoli with umeboshi and bonito: Good, but a little tough and pricey for 8 cuts of steak.   Might want to order the bone marrow instead.Pork spare ribs: a little burnt, average flavorCorkage is $25 for a 750ml bottle, $50 for a 1.5L bottle. a tad overpriced, but good food all around.  salmon tartar was the highlight.i would give it 4 stars, but while i was eating some of the beet salad, i crunched down on a thick piece of hard plastic the size of a match and immediately spit it out.  i let the server know, and was hoping to at least get the dish replaced or taken off the tab, but nothing.  left a bad taste in my mouth, literally. This meal was everything I had hoped for - top notch, unpretentious, friendly service, and impeccable food.  There was an abundance of exquisite food I could eat even though I don't eat meat or fowl.  I wanted to try everything but unfortunately my appetite didn't cooperate.  Cannot wait to return!  It's an incredible value for the experience. Came here at 4:30pm or so on a Monday and waited in line for an hour. It was fun to see the chefs in the window trying various dishes of the day. Without a sign on the front door, I felt totally ""underground"" and cool. We made friends with others in line and took dish recommendations.I would highly recommend a seat at the bar as you're in the center of the activity and can witness them cooking up a storm. It is like dim sum or new American tapas, with waiters whizzing around with various dishes. Definitely be in an adventurous mindset when you go there!My main complaint (to echo some of the previous comments) is that it is VERY SALTY and fairly over-priced. But there were definitely some highlights such as the quail eggs, the duck liver mousse i.e. adult cupcakes :), various mushroom dishes, and a delectable wine menu -- highly recommend their viognier.For dessert, we polished off the cornbread (mild) and a layered ice cream dessert that was out of this world. Overall a really positive experience! My friend and I high-fived on the way out .... success! :) Award winning.- ""Best new restaurant."" - James Beard Foundation- ""Restaurant of the year."" - Bon Appétit Magazine- ""One star."" - Michelin GuidesProbably had the burrata garlic bread or the hen dumpling. Maybe it was the sourdough pancake topped with sauerkraut. Perhaps the quail eggs with apple and sunchokes.Then again it might have been the bone marrow topped with chanterelles and peppercorn. Or duck liver mousse with tiny almond biscuits. Might be the trout quinoa.Perhaps they went straight for dessert and the shot of peanut milk while saving room for a cocoa nib ice cream sandwich and plum fudge.In fact the only dish of the night that was remotely disappointing was the signature fried quail. Lots of skin but minimal meat. More room for everything else.Even with a bottle of wine the damage was less than $60 per person. Such a small price to pay for the delicious creative brilliance demonstrated in almost every dish.Enthusiasm of our server could not have been faked. Now see why she seemed so happy to work here. Space is alive and bursting with energy. And amazing food.Allow me to add five stars to their well earned lengthy list of awards. Gastronomic adventure of mass proportions. The food was beyond my wildest imagination: flavors, textures and all of it. Food levitation. The cooks interacted with guests at the bar table and the carts brought out gems! The wine was paired just fine. I'm glad I was here on a week day and I plan to go back. This place is hard to fine with lack of outside signage - but it's a foodie heaven, with food-porn magicians when you're on the inside. Worth a visit for any foodie.. My second times here, I gave 5 stars for service and 3 stars for food.Food is OK, nothing that special. We live a few blocks away from State Bird and have been dining there since before it got the ""Best restaurant in America"" and reservations were so hard to get. But all the hype aside, it really is as good as everyone says it is. The small plates is perfect for those of us foodies who want to order the left side of the menu...because at State Bird...you can! Small plates mean variety. The casual hipster dim sum vibe is welcoming and not pretentious at all. You will feel so comfortable here. And the wait staff is knowledgable, friendly, and well....who could ask for anything more. You can check out some awesome photos we took of the various dishes we ordered on our food website at the link below. The menu changes all the time, so these same dishes will probably not be available when you go, but it will give you a sense of what you're in for. Enjoy!eatsporkjew.com/restaura… I don't get it. Did we all go to the same restaurant?!Flavors were eh.. mostly just SALTY. I only liked one dish, I can only describe it as an egg custard (savory) with mushroom in a little sake shot glass with bacon on top. I would also have to recommend the dessert, peanut milk shots.. YUMMY!! Other than that, eh. I found everything to be extremely salty. Maybe we ordered the wrong things?? Maybe it was an off night?  But it definitely wasn't worth the price tag (Or the sleepless hours trying to get reservations at 4am). Oh and can you please put a sign out or at least the address listed somewhere near/on the door? I swear we walked past this white door several times before we actually went in. I LOVE SBP:  I prefer to stand at chef's counter, which is relatively easy to do if you do not have a reservation.  Just put your name in and hop around the corner to Fat Angel for a drink while you wait.  The chef's counter is awesome because it allows you to converse with the chefs and see everything before it leaves the kitchen.   The thing that makes this restaurant truly fabulous is its truly innovative small plates!  After trying most restaurants in the city and being an avid cook myself, sometimes I feel a little uninspired and bored with the food scene (in my budget).  This restaurant however is guaranteed to reinvigorate your enthusiasm, always surprise you..... And at a price point much lower than other ""innovative"" restaurants in the city. (+0.5) Oh god the wait. I don't think I have waited in line for so long for a meal. The end result was a mix. Some dishes were definitely delicious and some were dare I say intriguing. I imagine this is how a none asian person's first experience with dim sum must be like. Half of the time we are trying to guess what we have just put into our mouth. I applause them for such unique experience, but I think in the end I was just overwhelmed and needed a good bowl of simple noodle soup. Phenomenal restaurant. Line is a bit ridiculous, but worth the wait.One trick is to go over early on a Tuesday or Wednesday and put your name on the list and then wait until about 830 and you should get in. Came here in a group of 8 and was served 17 different dishes for $65.  There are 4 courses, and in each course, there are 2-6 dishes.  *breathe and make room*The beginning in each course was a bit overwhelming because dishes drop down quickly during the start of the first course.  But, SBP gives a nice break in before introducing the next course.  *Whew~Memorable dishes:1. hamachi-avocado & seaweed cracker.  As far as hamachi dishes go...the hamachi shots at Alexander's Steakhouse is far superior, but it was interesting to eat on a seaweed cracker.  Great presentation.2. Garlic Bread with burrata - sometimes the most simple things are the best3. Pork Belly with blood orange salad.  I think the orange salad didn't help the pork belly.  Good thick cubed of pork belly with just a tad of salt is all you really need.  Simple.That's all, even the quail wasn't even that great. Ice cream ""sandwich"" was alright...well, it was the best ice cream sandwich I've tasted, but certainly not the best dessert.  It didn't live up to it's hype.  But still 4 stars for the ""dim sum"" dining experience and value. Still love this place! If you really want to try this place and don't want to wait for a reservation three months out. Swing by after work before 5:30pm. They start taking wait list names at 5:30pm. If you have two in your party, you will very likely get seated before 9pm if not 8pm. I recently went with a group of 4 and someone put our name down at 5:45pm and we were seated before 9pm which was longer than I expected. Had we put our name down right at 5:30pm we could've been seated at 8pm. Be patient folks. Now that SBP has expanded, getting a seat is much easier. There's a reason that SBP was named the Best New Restaurant of 2013. State Bird Provisions is the ONLY restaurant in SF that 1) I will wait 60 days to dine at; 2) Continually surprises me with their menu updates; 3) Continually impresses me with their regular dishes; and 4) excites me nowadays. I've been RAVING about this restaurant to all my friends. On the two occasions that I've brought friends with me to this restaurant, they agreed that the restaurant lived up to the hype! After my three visits, here's what I recommend:HIGHLY RECOMMENDED-Any pancake/short stack: I've tried corn, duck, and uni, and their savory pancake combinations are always a winner. -Duck liver mousse with almond biscuits: essentially, naughty cupcakes for adults. Perfectly sweet almond/corn biscuits smothered in a decadent, luxurious duck liver mousse that harkens back to the days of foie gras. -Garlic knots with burrata: Simple knotted breads, crispy on the outside and doughy on the inside, smothered with silky, pillowy burrata. -Anything with pork belly: I've tried several versions of pork belly at SBP. All are usually Vietnamese style, and all delicious. -CA state bird with provisions: perfectly breaded/crunchy outside and juicy quail inside, served on top of lemony stewed onions. Small, but packs a punch and well worth the price. -Any and all desserts: especially the ice cream sandwichesOK, BUT NOT TERRIBLE (just not ""must try/must order"")-charred octopus in tomato-chickpea salsa-tombo tuna-avocado & seaweed cracker-1/2 dozen cast iron quail eggs, sunchoke & ravigote -duck neck dumplings: SBP is well known for this, but I've had enough dim sum in SF to not be impressed by their version -oysters: interesting, but i'm a purist and I prefer Hog Island for oysters A fun place to eat New American cuisine and the dim sum/tapas style dining makes it a fun place to eat with friends. Here's hoping that SBP keeps up the good work! I LOVE this place! Worth the wait? I'm not so sure if a 4 hour wait is worth it but I did have a wonderful time with some friends. We ordered a bunch of tapas to try out but I guess one of the most memorable ones is the quail. We also loved the burrata and bread there. Don't order the lobster tapa because we were quite disappointed with that. The two unique sodas were also really good. I'd go back if the wait wasn't so long! Phenomenal dining experience. Cool vibe. Friendly staff. Three words: Food flavor explosions. Probably my top dining experience ever!  Best meal in 10 days of dining San Fran. First time trying pork belly and we were blown away! My husbands fav was the smoked sturgeon pancake-note- the 'pancake' itself was a masterpiece. The caviar w/chips was amazing as well. Dessert was ice cream sandwiches of perfection. There was so much more I wanted to order. If I didn't live in Colorado this would be my favorite go to for special occasions. Lark Bunting anyone;) ? American dim sum -- BRILLIANT. Service was amazing and different than anywhere else I have been (all the wait staff is at your service - no pride of ownership.) the eponymous fish was my favorite. Sea urchin pancake and burrata dumpling close second followed by dungeness crab kimchi. Only complaint was lack of cocktail menu, but nice wine list more than satisfied. This restaurant lives up to the hype!! i have been to Statebird provisions twice. The first time, I went with a big group and the Sous Chef Glenn coursed out everything into small portions which was great!! They have a sparkling Riesling by the Magnum bottle at around 100 usd which I think is a great deal, especially if you're with a big group. The second time round, I went as a group of 4. I was devastated to find that my favorite Asian Chicken vegetarian salad was NO LONGER ON THE MENU!!!!! ---- this, along with Commonwealths salads, are the ONLY two salads I would dream about in the Bay Area. With that said, food was still good although service seemed a bit rushed.The fried ""statebird"" was not bad, very well cooked, but the highlights of both meals were:- Housemade chips, trout roe & horse radish creme fraiche (YUM!)-  Hamachi on crispy Nori- Duck liver mousse with Almond biscuits (can have 100 of these!)- Rabbit and mushroom curry with Roti (I don't usually eat rabbit but the sauce for this was just BOMB.COM)DO NOT forget the milk dessert that taste like a snicker bar in a small glass... DELICIOUS! Could have that for breakfast everyday! :D I'm a big fan of tapas and State Bird Provisions definitely hit the spot. Tapas, in general, are pricey bites to eat, and State Bird Provisions is no exception.  However, the novelty, freshness, and quality of the tapas dishes are top notch here.  As many have remarked, it's like dimsum with a western/American twist. Many of the dishes make use of local ingredients and incorporate elements from different cuisines--mainly from Asian cuisines.  My friend and I shared about 9 dishes-- our favorites being the pork belly in Vietnamese broth, the garlic bread, hamachi atop nori chip, uni scallion pancake, and the bone marrow.  All the food was prepared exceptionally well, seasoned just right, and was just mouthwatering good!  One of the awesome things I found out about this place after eating here is that it has one Michelin star. Typically Michelin star restaurants tend to be kind of pricey, but State Bird Provisions is an affordable restaurant for those who want to try a Michelin restaurant without too big of a dent in your wallet.  Overall a good experience with good food-- 4 stars! State Bird Provisions is set up to be a partially dim sum style restaurant. There is a main menu as well as dim sum carts and trays that circulate the room. The wait staff is attentive and friendly and will explain the dishes on their carts in detail. The Menu Items1. Pancake of sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta- rich, but unremarkable2. Spicy fried cauliflower salad with bayley hazen blue cheese- really really flavorful and delicious. I could eat this every day. 3. Hearts of palm, avocado, pomelo salad with tahini chili oil- I wish I could make a salad that tasted like this. It was an amazingly balanced and flavorful salad with a great tahini dressing. WOW. 4. State Bird- The caramelized onions over the fried bird were really great. It was flavorful and moist. Plus, it's the signature dish so you must try it!The Provisions (Dim Sum Items) **Harder to remember because I can't reference a menu1. Burrata garlic bread- YUM YUM YUM. I love burrata in all forms and this did not disappoint. 2. Oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesame- I can be hit or miss on oysters, but the spicy kohlrabi kraut topping was soo good that I wanted to eat several of these. I wish I could have bought a bottle of the topping to eat with crackers. The dashi type flavors were great!3. Farro spezato salad- I wish I had more insight as to what was in this vegetarian farro salad, but it was just GREAT! This is the problem with eating dim sum; it's hard to recommend what to order. 4. Roasted asparagus with walnut aioli- the aioli was really good. The asparagus were jumbo sized, but I sort of wished they had been smaller. Desserts (we got a 1/2 order of all of them- don't judge)1. kiwi granita, yogurt tapioca, dates & kumquats- I loved the granita and my friend loved the tapioca. Probably my least favorite of the desserts. 2. guava tres leches, chèvre crème fraîche, rhubarb & pistachio- The waiter said this was his favorite. I liked it, but didn't think it was the best tres leches I'd ever had. The guava was a nice touch. 3. warm cornmeal custard, chocolate crumble, mapled apricots & walnuts- I would come back to this restaurant for the sole purpose of eating this dessert. It was rich but balanced and soooo well made. YUM!4. spiced cocoa nib 'ice cream' sandwich, black pepper pecans, plum fudge- this was a nice cold bite and the plum fudge was a really unique flavor. I enjoyed it, but might not eat it again. 5. 'world peace' peanut muscovado milk shots- literally a shot of PB milk. Yummy, but not super special."|5|100|0|Routine Inspection|This inspection has no violations.|GOOD: no inspection needed
State Bird Provisions 1|4.5|Tapas/Small Plates in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|1051|1|4.347619047619047|" First off, we really wanted to eat here because of course we've heard all the buzz about this restaurant. ""Michelin"" rated and blah, blah. I happen to think I enjoy the finer foods, so eating here was exciting for us. Come to realize we waited for over an hour parked for this place to be open, not knowing there was a line of people. The reservation process for this restaurant is really lame, 60 days prior or getting up at like 4 am to check if someone cancelled. Where is the customer service for people who want to give you the business. One thing I noticed is that there is a lot secret hand shaking going on there, how is possible for you to know people by when no one can ever get in?!?how or why were people who came after us leaving before we were even called. Completely turned off by this place from the start.I thought this was american food, but they should really say Asian flavors in the menu. I like the dim sum concept. I just was not impressed by the food, I wanted explosions of flavors not a bunch of seeds and herbs mixed with quinoa an fish or in a pancake or with more fish. I think we had 2 dished that were the best out of the night not that I've ever eaten. The seared trout and the trout with potato pancake.I would of given it 2 stars but the chef there Dave was just amazing, he has amazing customer service and great cooking knowledge he earn the the 3rd star. I don't see my self waking up in the middle of the night or waiting in the cold so I probably will never dine here again. But best of luck to SBP. My friend made a reservation TWO months ago at 4 in the morning and when we saw the line as we arrived, it was totally worth it. (Though 2 months was still a really long wait!)We got seated immediately and was explained that it's pretty much dim sum style where they come around and let you know what they have and you can choose if you want it or not, and you can also order off their menu. We got:Rabbit and Fontina Croquette: I liked this. It was a small piece of well cooked rabbit wrapped in a thin layer of cheese and some crumb coating. I could have had a few more of those.Smoked Sturgeon Cream with thin cracker things: i really liked this one. It was really light and a good starter of the meal. The crackers were super crispy and when added the dip, there was a really nice light smokey flavorGuinea Hen Dumpling with Aromatic Broth: This one was pretty good. It pretty much tasted like a dumpling in a really good broth and it totally reminded me of something but I couldn't figure it out and then I realized that it kind of taste like pho, but as good as it was, I rather pay $6 for a whole bowl of pho instead of $3 for a little dumpling.Hamachi-avocado and seaweed cracker: I liked this one, but it pretty much tasted like sushi. I liked the crispiness of the seaweed (I think they fried it) and the hamachi was fresh and the avocado sauce went really well with it. My friend really liked this one.CA State Bird with Provisions: this one you have to order off the menu and I always have to try what a restaurant is know for. It pretty much tasted like a really delicate fried chcken. It's a really light bird (It's quail in case you didn't know what CA's  state bird is lol) and wasn't too meat-y. The sauce, lemon and onion that came with it flavored it really well, but other than that, it was kind of like a good piece of fried chicken.Smoked Trout Quinoa ""Tabouleh"": This one was one of my favorites. The quinoa was really good - nice and crispy and the smoked trout is an amazing flavor to add to it! YUM!Pork Belly Grape Salad: i'm usually all in for fatty meat parts, but this one was a little too much. I wasn't a big fan of the pork belly itself - I didn't like the pieces that they chose to give us, but the vinagar-y flavor was really good and sad to say, but the grapes (though only a few of them) were probably better than the meat.Garlic Bread with Burrata: I don't really know what burrata is (cheese?), but it was really good. It was super creamy and cheesy and was really good with the warm bread. It was a tad on the greasy side, but the combination of cheese and bread was really good.Chocolate Cake Roll: Super rich chocolate. If you like dark chocolate, this is definitely for you. The cake itself was light and fluffy, but it hits you with a huge coco flavor! The orange clove added a unique flavor to it. It was sweet enough so it was good, but also a tad bitter for contrast.Poppy Seed Ice Cream Sandwich: You know you're a total dessert fan when you think it's the best dish of the entire night. I'm so glad we got this one and was thinking about ordering a second for just myself. The poppy seed ice cream was delicious and whatever the sandwich part of the dessert is was lightly sweetend and chewy. I didn't really taste any of the fruit flavors it said it came with, but I was happy with just the poppy seed ice cream and it's sandwich parts.Overall, it was a cool experience. When they describe the food, they mention a ton of ingredients that i'm not familiar with or can even pernounce and there are like a ton of different ingredients in each dish! For the most part, you can just go with what looks good. They were all pretty good, though I felt despite the complicated ingredients, nothing was really thaaat unque and it reminded me of everything I've tried before. All the dishes are pretty pricey (a small dish for $10?!?) but it's worth the try if you're there anyways. The servers are super nice and helpful and the food comes around more than once so you don't have to worry about passing on any dish at the moment because they will come back. I might come back to try some different things... or for the poppy seed ice cream!! First off, I want to give a shout out to hubby for coming on this mad adventure with me on our recent trip to SF.  He didn't call me crazy when I told him we had to get to the restaurant an hour before opening, nor did he give up when we missed the first seating cut off by 2 parties and were told to come back in 2.5 hours.  I'm a lucky girl!When we finally did get in, we were fortunately enough to be seated at the bar but in our own little section with only us and the bartender who ended up being our spiritual food and drink guide for the evening.Our evening got off to a great start with a small glass of their Anchor Christmas ale.  It was dark but totally drinkable and opened up my appetite in a major way.  After that, the food starting rolling by.  American-style dim sum is how it's described, minus the pushy cart ladies and the ensuing MSG coma.We pretty much tried everything they had to offer. We had two kinds of oysters that evening, one raw and one roasted - both the best I've ever had.  I enjoyed ordering, re-ordering, re-ordering both oysters.Other standouts:Some nori/seaweed chip laded with hamachi, dollops of sauce and other beautiful garnishes.  I ate TWO.This cucumber, creme fraiche and salmon roe dishState Bird ProvisionsDessert: Egg Nog sandwich and two shots of peanut milk.  To die for.  Because there were so many dishes being passed around, we only ordered their signature dish the State Bird (half) from their written menu.  Just about the only thing we weren't TOO crazy about was the garlic bread with burrata.  It was just too dense and doughy for our taste.  Otherwise, the evening was a whirlwind of wonderful service from EVERYONE (even the people cooking would check in on us if they caught us looking like we needed something).We are definitely going to make it a point to come back here soon!! Over-hyped and over-priced. We had to stand close to the door in the cold weather because reservations were booked for months. The food was really just so-so, even though there were a couple of surprises. By no means am I a ""foodie"" and should my review mean anything to anyone, but I'm sure the restaurant would like to know how well they're doing! All these positive reviews must mean they're doing something right!My gosh, where do I even begin? Yes, we waited for 2 hours to get seated right when they opened, but I'd do it all over again in a heartbeat. We were in the very front of the line so we were fortunate enough to be entertained by the cooks who were prepping at the window. Everything about this place is amazing- the atmosphere, service and of course the food. I love how fresh/crisp EVERYTHING tasted. All the flavors were seasoned perfectly, nothing was too little or too much. Even the pricing was fair, which is hard to come by for really good restaurant located in SF. I left feeling completely satisfied.Mad kudos to the chefs here, seriously. I haven't stopped raving about this place since I went on Friday! Looking forward to going again! There are two options if you want to eat at this new michelin star restaurant. Option 1: You get a reservation. Reservations are booked 1 month in advance and it's first come first serve on their website. The reservations come out at like 4am or something ridiculous like that and there are people with programs that get those reservations. Those new money, silicon valley computer engineers. So good luck getting a reservation. Option 2: you walk in and try to see if you can get a seat for dinner that evening. My girlfriend and I showed up at 4:30pm and waited an hour in line outside the restaurant before they opened at 5:30pm and there were still around 20 people in front of us. San Francisco gets crazy when it comes to food. We ended up getting a seat for 8pm that night. We walked around the neighborhood and went to a bar to enjoy the NBA All Star game while waiting for our reservation. If you get on the list as a walk in they take your phone number and text you when your reservation is ready. Our reservation was like 30 mins early so we walked over when we received the text. We were told we would be seated at the chefs table which is right in front of the kitchen so you can watch them work. If you can, get those seats and I will explain why.The concept of the restaurant is western dim sum. They walk around with small plates and tapas on a seafood cart for your fishy options. They also bring around trays of other bites to eat in various intervals. They also have a menu so you can order kitchen items as well. From the seafood cart we only got the oysters and if you can, get around 5 or so. Raw oysters with a crunchy slaw or something on top. Good texture to start with.From the small plates they bring around and options from the menu we had plenty. Here is what you should try: Riblets (tender and with a sweet sauce), pork belly (soft pork belly with a vinegar sauce and cilantro/jalapeno and grape salad), bone marrow (just trust me bro), beef tartare (make a lettuce wrap with it and get the party in your mouth started), duck liver mousse with almond biscuits (my favorite dish of the night), hamachi nori cracker (pretty much your average tuna with avocado cracker dish at any restaurant, but it was tasty just nothing special or unique other than presentation). Items you probably won't miss out on: state bird with provisions (fried quail with soggy onions and such), bread with barata (pretty much bread covered with cheese, tasty but you can live without it), a barley or oat dish that looks like risotto? (skip this, just filler without the thriller).They make in house sodas, we got both the plum and yuzu soda. You can do without the yuzu but you gotta get the plum. It's awesome, refreshing and something new. For dessert we got everything in a half order that we could because we were bursting at the seams at that point. Desserts that are a must have: Poppy seed ice cream sandwhich (get one for yourself, dont' share. trust me), peanut muscovado milk (it's milk that tastes like peanuts, it's a trip man and it's pretty good like a milk with your desserts, nothing is better).Desserts you can skip:  the cornmeal topped with dried fruit (it's good but the dried fruit on top is too overpowering), the chocolate roll cake (just a chocolate cake with orange garnish, don't eat the orange, that was a bad move on my part), asian pear granita (it's interesting but the ginger in the tapioca is too much).Now let me go back to why you want to sit at the chefs table. Not only did we get a waiter, we were right next to where they bring out all the trays of food they bring around to people. We got first dibs on all the dishes which were hot straight out of the kitchen. We could also ask the chefs cooking the food to put in an order for us and they would hand it to us personally. The service at the chefs table is the best in the house. You sit on stools and get a hook under the counter to hand your jacket. So if you don't have back issues, sit here for sure. You get the best service and first pick from all the food and you know it's fresh since you see it being made and handed right to you.Overall a wonderful dinning experience. This is an experience everyone should have at least once. If it wasn't impossible to get reservations or inconvenient to wait hours outside for a chance at a table, I would come back again and try dishes I didn't get a chance to. I hear the menu changes every now and then so if they make a lot of changes I might attempt to come back. Come at least once to experience this unique concept and make your decision from there if it's worth a second visit. I am content with my one visit and will wait for hype to die down before attempting to come again. Solid 4 stars overall. Holy. Crap. I haven't even left the place and I'm driven, like some madwoman possessed, to yelp this experience.Come prepared to open your mind. The menu is totally incomprehensible to mortals. I told my friend that it's almost like the names were generated by throwing a handful of dice, each side bearing some random and exotic ingredient. ""Duck ham pecan pancake with chicories & ha chits persimmon mustard.""  I don't have any frame of reference for this insanity.But who cares? Because when you put it in your gob - whatever the hell it is - you're going to shout. ""What the hell am I eating?"" And in a goo way.Go. Right now. And be delighted. I got a reservation super randomly (too many people know about the 4am secret. I just randomly clicked once and got a reservation for the next day for 8pm).  Due to the lack of effort in securing a reservation and the ease of finding parking, my experience started off on the right foot.Prices were very fair, Dim-sum style makes it interactive and interesting. I'd say 70% of the food, I would order or eat again. Short ribs, uni ginger scallion pancake, roti with Rabbit, and oysters were our faves and are worth 5 stars. The rest, were not:- State Bird: fried quail. Not as good as just getting fried chicken. Not as juicy or crunchy as well seasoned as the Foreign Cinema chicken. It's also just not a lot of meat on a quail wing.- some sort of cheese balls with dipping sauce. the taste literally reminded me of the last time I threw up after my birthday party (for the record, I'm in my 20s. throwing up after a birthday celebration should not warrant more than an eye roll. Keep your ""tsk tsks"" and ""SMHs"" to yourself)-salmon tartare (it was on a dim sum cart). I can't even remember the ingredients but it was underwhelming in taste and texture)- dungness crab with kimchi. My bf loves crab and korean food, so this was a no-brainer. I don't really have recommendations on how to make this dish better since the pairing doesn't make sense to me, but it was very ""eh"" in his words. Actually, those were exactly his wordsWe'd definitely come back but would probably stick to the things we already know we'd like.  But the barrier to trial here is super low as the price point on the dimsum carts rarely stray above $10.  Great experience, can't wait to return, assuming I can score an easy reservation. A western approach on ordering dim sum style? Yes please!Reservations are apparently super tough to get!! People sometimes camp out in front of the door just to get a reservation (about 1 1/2-2 hours) since online reservations are just as tough to get.But moving on, I love this place! The service was amazing, the girl in the front got me and my date in front of the counter where all the oysters were (ironically we didn't have any, lol) and where the food got prepared! Yuuuuuuum!! And if you're a first timer like when I went, the servers will basically tell you how ordering works (again, dim sum style) and give a description of each food item. Oh my, we definitely picked a lot of food! However...there is one signature dish you must order on the separate menu: the State Bird with Provisions! This is a must have! It was my first time having quail and wow, I'm now a fan! You can either order a half or full order of quail, but since my date and I were munching away, we ordered the half order, and believe, it'll be enough! The breading was light, crispy, and *gasp* NOT OILY! The quail meat was very tender and the cheese and onions with it added a nice little kick to it. I totally want to come back! Next time I'll take notes on the other dishes since I don't remember all the dishes, just that they were super duper delicious!! Fun approachable atmosphere with mostly hits in this borrowed dim sum concept. Friendly helpful service that assists when you need it but doesn't try to over sell.Notable must try dishes:Quinoa with smoked trout (Tabouleh)Spicy Dungeness crab with Kimchi yuba noodles and smoked eggPork short ribs - simple, but good smoky flavor with a touch of backyard exoticNori cracker with hamachi crudoWarm cornmeal custard for dessert is an interesting palate adventure.2 stars is decent/good. 3 stars is very good in my book. I would go there again and recommend to friends to try some of the notable dishes. 4 is excellent - just go and order pretty much anything. 5 rating should be reserved only for a select few. Amazing. New American Dim Sum.  There are some regulars for sure and you can see via yelp the ones mentioned the most ( Garlic bread AMAZING) But think the fun is not knowing what new things they are going to bring out to you on any given night!  I have only ever eaten at the bar so the service has always been good. I guess its hard to have bad service when someone is always trying to give you food.  Reservations are hard to come by but if you get there as they open you can put your name on a list and most nights you are able to get in.  One of my favorite places in the city. Scored a reservation easily solely because I work nights and can easily get to a computer at 4 am or whatever time they open their online reservation system. Oh the perks of working nights :)  Woohoo! Anyway 60 days later, finally stepped into this highly recommended restaurant and was reminded why I LOVE my fellow yelpers. I would have never discovered this place if it wasn't for them. And the fact that the outside is not labeled doesn't help either.We were total ""YES"" men that night. We didn't turn away a single person who offered us food. Highlights of the night for me: 1. State Bird with Provisions (duh the namesake) 2. Pork belly! (drooling as I type) 3. Crispy Quinoa (don't know what they actually called it but that's what it was to me) 4. bone marrow (OMG) 5. ice cream sandwiches!I'm glad I went with 3 other people instead of just 1 cause that meant we had more room to taste a variety of plates. Total came out to about $60 each which I thought wasn't bad.SERVICE: top notch! everyone was friendly and informative. There was something wrong with our bill at the end and they happily fixed it without second guessing us :) it's been almost a year since my last visit (i went once in between). state bird keeps getting better and better, and i am on board with it being hyped.  the word that still describes them:  INVENTIVE!still impossible to get inawesome servicestandouts:guinea hen dumpling in chicken lemon broth (i could eat 10 of these)fried state birdsmoked trouthamachi on fried seaweed cracker (absolute must)also lovedpeanut milk shotsgarlic bread burrattaduck liver patepassoystersi'm excited to go back again.  IF i can score another reservation (had to book 2 months out this last time!) great fun concept, who doesn't love dim sum and people coming around with food ready to eat!?!I was looking in december for reservations in jan, hoping to take the bf here for his bday, but as I refresh the page every second, the only things coming up were already for feb! darn! but lucky me, one day i stumbled upon a wed reservation for the 12th! whoohoo, the only night we have off and the week of vday! perfect!so the two month wait began. we arrived around 5 so we could run a quick errand and there was a line already formed! but bwahaha we have a reservation so we got to walk righttttt up at 5:30.the restaurant was very new american/hipster, communal feel.on to the foodordered off the paper menu:fried quail- crispy light, but a little tooooo citrus-ybone marrow- i guess i've never tried bone marrow so i can't compare it but it was ok? salty, glutenous, buttery. eat it with toast and mushrooms. the ones that came aroundduck liver mousse- bf really liked it, his favorite of the night. very very rich, too rich for me but it was good.salmon tartare- not special but it was good, with cucumbers and crunchy quinoa. i liked this one.chips with homemade sourcream- bf chose this, but i don't like sour cream, meh filler food, skip itpork ribs- it WAS fall off the bone...but the flavor was not there...pork belly in fish sauce broth- best part was the grapes...pork belly was something our parents could make...too tough, sour...skiphamachi avocado on crunchy nori- this one is good, creamy, light, crunchy.dumpling in broth- once again was okay? and once again too citrus-y? the dumpling was different, forgot what kind of stuffing was in there..unique butttt ehchocolate roll cake for dessert- super rich, interesting rice cracker bits but nothing special. SO, unfortunately maybe I was overhyped about this place and it wasn't what we expected. The dishes all had very similar tastes and style. Citrus-y and a cream-like texture...love the concept, it was very fun to pick what we wanted to eat and to see the dishes coming around, but sadly the food didn't do it for us. Service was nice and friendly though. For two, we shared about 9 dishes, and a drink each. $150 with tip. not badoh parking is pretty easy at 5/530. oh and the place is pretty loud...kinda hard to hear anything without having to raise your voice.. Amazing explains it all.  A great dining experience that everyone should experience.Small plates that are full of flavor, fresh, and most of all, unique.The servers come around and offer delicious plates, dim sum style.The staff provided excellent service and came around often.You absolutely cannot go wrong with anything here. Ladies and gentlemen, the hype is real. I was less impressed my first time here (about 4 months ago in Oct 2013), but now, the wow factor is everywhere. Though my most recent experience was marred with a rude and lackadaisical waiter and the fact that some dishes took a longer time than expected to arrive, a few truly outstanding dishes made up for those imperfections. State Bird Provisions is special because of its dim sum style way of serving food to its customers. Waiters entice you with beautifully crafted dishes while enchanting you with each dish's long list of ingredients. It's tapas style taken to new heights, and I love it. It's an absolute must-try. Here are the dishes to get (or not to get):Bacon mushroom and chili oil (+++) Hamachi with avocado on a seaweed cracker (+++) Salmon belly with miso glaze (+++) Glazed pork ribs with tobarashi and scallions (+++) Rabbit and fontina croquette (++)Duck liver mousse (++) - get it if you really like liver Garlic bread with burratta (+) Smoked trout Cold porridge with potato and seaweed (+) State Bird with Provisions  (+) - worth the try, but not exceptional Roti of curry rabbit and hedgehog mushrooms (+) Guinea hen dumpling (+) +++ - Must try regardless! ++ - Really good+ - Meh, could be better Only one word to describe this place..AMAZING! Went for a birthday dinner so it was a predetermined menu... unbelievable. Our server was perfect...not overbearing not negligent. My 2-1/2 year old loved everything as much as I did. Worth the need for reservations in advance and every penny spent. Hands down my #1 on the sf restaurant list. I finally secured a spot for the BF and me at State Bird's... for my Birthday Dinner! =DGranted I had to rush over and get in line around 4:50 because I didn't have a reservation. There were already quite a few people in line by the time I arrived, and I ended up waiting 40 minutes freezing my butt off in order to get in on a Tuesday night. Unfortunately once they opened the doors and I got to the hostess, she informed me that she couldn't seat me without my boyfriend (still on his way over from work). Thankfully she was lenient with me since it was my birthday and let me sit and wait at the bar for him. Thank you!!Once the BF arrived we started ordering:State Bird (Fried Quail): 5/5 - This was my favorite dish of the night. I don't have quail often, and I've NEVER had it fried but this was perfect! The meat was tender, the breading was light and not oily at all and they placed the bird on a bed of deliciously divine onions! They added some parmesan cheese slivers on top as well which were fun to chomp on between bites of meat and onion. MUST ORDER THIS!Hamachi with avocado sauce and radish: 4/5 - A solid dish. Cubes of fresh fish on an edible seaweed/crunchy thing with some avocado sauce. Tasty and light.Pork Belly with tangy addicting sauce: 5/5 - My second favorite, and I'm not even a big fan of pork belly! My boyfriend was in love with this one, and I found it hard to find fault with this dish because it was so delectable! The meat to fat content was perfect, and the outside of the chunks were crispy while the inside remained deliciously soft. The sauce underneath was so tangy and addicting, I was scooping it up and drinking it and dipping everything I could in there because I didn't want to waste a drop!Dumpling in aromatic broth: 4/5 - A very cute single dumpling for each person =) I really enjoyed this one, it was filled with some sort of poultry if I remember correctly but what really impressed me was the broth which was super aromatic and had a subtle lemongrass taste.Salmon tartare with crunchy quinoa furikake and cucumber: 2/5 - My least favorite... The crunchy quinoa put me off, but the salmon tartare part was pretty good. I love cucumbers but it was hard to eat them when they were covered in crunchies..Red Trout with citrus sauce: 4/5 - Now this was some great fish! It almost looks like salmon because the color is such a vivid red. No bones, the meat was very soft and tender, and it was nicely paired with the citrus/brown butter sauce. At the end of our meal we received two peanut muscovado milks for free because it was my bday =) The service was great and everyone was very nice and accommodating which was awesome! The only issue is some of the dishes that are not on the menu (the ""dim sum"" ones) can take awhile to reach you but it makes for a nice, leisurely meal. Thanks for a great birthday meal SBP! Everything. Salmon tar tar is better than ice cream!!  Garlic bread with burrata is heavenly. Terrific food, great service, fun atmosphere. That pretty much sums  it up. Our friends made the reservations 2 months earlier, we just tagged along without the hassle. I loved that the atmosphere was so casual, and we never felt rushed. I won't bias you by telling you what we had - its all good! I can say that we didn't order much off the menu but simply grazed our way through the plates that were brought by.The flavor combinations of everything we had was amazing, and reasonably priced. The 4 of us, sat there for 2+ hours, had 2 bottles of wine and split a $300ish tab ($150 each couple) - not bad for this city. I'll be back for sure but I am not one to get up at 4am just to get a table. They do take walk-ins, both for the bar & a few tables. I have heard there are long lines, but when we arrived on a Friday at 8pm, there was none. And the couple ahead of us who asked, were told there was a 30-45 min wait. Absolutely delicious food, but not worth stressing over a reservation. If possible, go at 5:15pm on a weekday for an early dinner. *just go here* #fancydimsumstyle#flavorexplosionWondering what all the hype was about, me and a friend popped over here to drop in our name. Reservations were long but we got a call back about 2 hrs. later. The lovely hostess let us know this was only for an hour so we agreed. I was not prepared for what went in my mouth (yeah yeah make a joke). I had no idea that they had their set menu, then everything else was pseudo dim sum style. Chef created, unique, original, and ever changing. These dishes were brought out in tapas style portions with some of the most vibrant tastes I've had. Dishes ranged from duck liver mousse, beef tongue, salmon tar tar, pork belly, and who knows what else I missed. Everything was incredible, interesting, and worth savoring. Also a fun point, if you're not buying a bottle of wine this place is incredibly reasonable. Go here for the experience, the taste, and all of the above. It is sooo hard to go to a place with so much hype, especially given how hard it is to get a reservation and waiting the two months for it to arrive!  The food here is good, yes.  There's really interesting combinations of ingredients that provide a really fulfilling eating experience (the key is eat slowly).  I love tapas style places because I like to try so many different things, but it is a little disruptive since people come by all the time with different plates of things, and it's sooo hard to hear every ingredient they list.  All the waiters are super nice though and are willing to repeat what items are, etc.  BUT like I said, everything is small plates, but they're priced like entrees!  So while the food is good, it is pricey and hard to justify the price, especially when some dishes are a little mediocre.What was the STANDOUTS that I would go back for?- Tuna avocado and seaweed cracker: my friend said it tasted like a sushi roll, but it's so much better!  crunchy, little salty, creamy, fishy goodness- Smoked trout with crunchy quinoa tabouleh: soooo good, really great flavors and just a great combination of textures too- Smoked sturgeon cream dip with chips: I'm really not sure exactly what was in this, but it was pretty tasty, and I liked that the chips were a harder textureThings that were SOLID:- Guinea hen dumpling: one dumpling with a lemony broth; good taste and texture; understated, but definitely better than usual dumplings.- Garlic bread with burrata: very light garlic, interesting bread texture (it's almost like a cinnamon bun, but not sweet and harder on the outsides; flakey, so there's gotta be butter!), and the burrata looks so creamy, but is so cheesy!- state bird: it's basically fried chicken, tiny pieces with lots of bone, but the lemony/cheesy onions on the bottom really make the dish complete and special- grapefruit curd poppy seed ice cream sandwich macarone with fennel: very light in texture and flavor; definitely an interesting, understated ice cream sandwich that's a little chewy; you can get a half of this one in case you want to try something else!Things I would definitely SKIP:- Pork belly grape salad: way too salty/vinegary, but the grapes taste really good as a comparison.  They gave us fatty pieces and the pork is just really fried and hard- Rabbit and fontina croquette: rabbit was gamey; I just had a tiny bit of one- Chocolate roll cake, sesame mousse, seville orange-clove caramel: a dark chocolate taste; just very sweet and nothing too remarkable for meOverall, a really good dining experience, but I don't know if it's the best food i've ever had.  I don't think I'd go out of my way to go here again, but I'd go back and try new things if I had the chance.Tip for everybody trying to get reservations online, go online at 4 am!!  That's when cancellations go through. Update - online reservations now start at 4am. Good luck! Today was my second visit to SBP, though the first time was well before reservations were hard to get and the line for walk ins wrapped around the corner by opening time.  The expansion definitely opened up greater capacity, and makes the space a lot more functional.  Arriving a little after 5 p.m. on Super Bowl Sunday, there were about 15 people or so in line in front of us, and we got the last two bar seats before the cutoff.  Actually, sitting at the bar next to the kitchen was pretty cool, since you could see preparation and scope out prospective dishes for sampling.  I did wish they had hooks under the bar to hang my coat, since we were on bar stools.We decided not to really order from the menu and just pick the offerings brought around, which were plenty, as we had ordered off the menu more during our first visit.My Favorites of the Night:--Chocolate roll cake with caramel sauce and candied oranges: Chocolate cake was rich and ganache-like in a smooth caramel sauce.  Delicious.--Pork belly: Crispy, flavorful.--Chawanmushi: Beautifully hot, creamy, spicy.--Farro with wild mushrooms: Earthy mushrooms with creamy farro.  BF didn't care for this one as much, but I really love mushrooms.Second Favorites, Still Delicious:--Pork Riblets: Tender, best slathered in its own juice/sauce.--Chips with Fish roe dip: Tasty warm dip.--Rabbit Croquette: A crunchy meaty bite.--Oyster: Lovely, but the spice probably overpowered the flavor of the oyster.Nice, but Could Do Without:--Salmon Tartare: Didn't seem special, but was nice. Crunchy quinoa was the best part.--Garlic Bread Burata: Apparently popular, but not my favorite.  Bread too heavy/greasy--Hamachi Kama: Beautifully plump and glazed, but somehow felt too saucy/salty/strong without some rice to go with it.--Hamachi on seaweed raft: Nice, but hard to eat.  Had to use teamwork to break it apart without launching fish cubes off the plate.--Duck liver mousse with little biscuits: I usually love duck liver mousse, but the little biscuits are a little too small/heavy/greasy.  I would've traded them for some fresh bread.Service was great, especially right by the kitchen where basically everyone is checking on you and asking if you need anything.  It's definitely a casual, fun environment, where the minute you sit down, people are ready to drop plates on your table for you to start eating. I would definitely love to come again if it ever cools down a bit, as I don't have the patience to try to book a reservation at 4 a.m. and don't want to stand in line for an hour before it opens. This is the sensation of san Francisco dining scene, my friend offered to wait for a table at 4:30pm on a Friday.  I thought he would take a number and wait at the bar, wrong !!!! When.I arrived, we both waited in the cold till 17:30 when door opened ... only people who got in with reservation are friends with chef ....the food is really creative.  It is worthwhile waiting for the dim sum carte:we loved the trout taboulis with crisps, pork belly with vietnamese sauce. Fried brussel sprouts with bonito flake, spare ribs, chocolate cake.  I was not so fond of the pancake with duck.  We had so many dishes .... it is a unique experience! I am not even going to try - just go.  Its really that good. So tasty!!! It was a great meal and I will be glad to return one day... If I could ever get a reservation. I had to really spend some time considering how many stars to give this place but finally settled with a solid three. Now before you start the barrage of diatribes, I'd like to first state my case. I, as well as any person in SF not living under a rock, has heard of State Bird Provisions before really even knowing anything about the place. Bon Appétit Magazine even named SBP its Best New Restaurant for 2012. My preconceived notion was that this place simply specialized in poultry, from fried to roasted to the hundred different variations seen from all types of restaurants across America. After dinner tonight, we realized that it couldn't be far from the truth.Without any prior reservations in hand (not that we hadn't tried, it's just the SBP website NEVER HAD ANY RESERVATIONS AVAILABLE!), we arrived to a line about 25 people, at about 15 min. before opening time of 5:30pm. When we finally got to the maitre d', we were told that our table wasn't going to be ready until 2 hours later and was instructed to leave our cell phone number so as to be contacted when table was ready. Thank God we had free parking after 6pm and had Japantown conveniently located adjacent to the SBP. We killed time by sauntering in and around Japantown shops (Nijiya, a bookstore and stationary store). Showing up again at 7:15pm allowed us to sit at around 7:30pm.Walking in, you get a very eclectic, San Francisco chic vibe (does that make sense?). The walls were adorned with vibrantly-colored construction paper cut to different shapes of cooking utensils. A concrete wall was the backdrop of one side of the space, with neatly-framed pictures rustically hung with metal wire. Meals were brought out by various waiters/waitresses in the same fashion as dim sum carts and trays, accompanied by a thorough explanation of ingredients and method used to cook the dish. Dishes varied from $3 - $10, but the key was to know that the majority of the dishes were small appetizer sizes. After reviewing the menu, turns out their signature dish was, in fact, quail, our great state's official bird. I wasn't up to gnoshing on an animal whose taste I wasn't particularly fond of. Instead I opted for inventive dishes never before imagined: Savory:raw oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesame **shiitake, persimmon & quinoa 'tabouleh' **duck liver mousse with almond biscuit ***garlic bread with bur rata *trout roe chip & dip **hamachi-avocado & seaweed cracker **mendocino sea urchin, ginger-scallion pancake with soy-lime glaze **roasted bone marrow with chanterelles & pink peppercorn **wild king salmon tartare with fermented turnips ***Dessert:chocolate roll cake, sesame mousse, seville orange-clove caramel **'world peace' peanut muscovado milk **   don't bother**  average/good enough*** exceptionalAbove said dishes (including a few drinks that were totaled to less than $20) left us with a bill of about $150. Would I go back to SBP with local friends? Probably not. With out-of-town foodies? Sure. But this place is all about hype. Quality of food will not blow your mind. Maybe my expectations are too high. But for a $150 meal between two people on a Wed night after a two-hour wait, not worth it.Thanks for the experience, SBP. It was fun while it lasted. It is nearly impossible to get a reservation here, unless you book way in advance and plan to invite dining companions later. So when my friend asked if I wanted to join a last minute reso, I jumped and said YES!I've been waiting to try State Bird for months, and it did not disappoint. I love the idea of New American/ fusion style dim sum. It lets you try a variety of small plates. They have a set menu that you can order from, and a few rotating carts that go from table to table with a variety of small plates. For a table of four, they recommended starting with 3 or 4 dishes from the menu and grabbing whatever looks good from the carts.DELICIOUS:* CA State Bird - which is a fried quail, in case you didn't know what the state bird of California was. Very juicy and tender. The cheese and onions on top elevated the dish to another level.* Pork Chawanmushi - must get this! I could eat a couple of these by myself.* Guinea Hen Dumpling - I didn't think I would like this, but the broth was very light and refreshing.* Spicy Dungeness Yuba with Kimchi - I honestly don't like crab that much, but this dish was delicious. Spicy yuba noodles with a nice kimchi kick.* Duck Liver Mousse - I love duck liver and this mousse was amazing. I only wish there were more biscuits to eat it with.* Roasted Bone Marrow - this is a must here. The bone marrow simply melts in your mouth and the chanterelle mushrooms on top were great.JUST OKAY:* Brussel Sprouts - These were good, but nothing out of the ordinary.* Salmon Tartare - Just okay. I didn't really enjoy the texture - tasted too mushy for me.* Sea Urchin Pancake - The uni was fresh, but overall the dish felt too rich and heavy.* Garlic Bread and Burrata - Two of my favorite things, but combined? Not so great.* Warm Apricot & Plum Mochi - Sounds like it would taste delicious, but I wasn't a fan. * Poppy-seed Ice Cream Sandwich - Light, creamy ice cream. The service was excellent and overall I really enjoyed SBP. I can't wait to come back here - I just need to find friends who already have reservations! One of the best meals I have ever had. It is hard to compete with the food greats in San Francisco, but State Bird Provisions raises the bar. We got there around 4:30 and got in the already long line and waiting until they opened. When we got to the hostess desk, she told us to come back at 7PM and they would give us a call if it was going to be sooner or when our table was ready.They called right at 10 minutes to 7 and said that we could start to head back.Perfect timing,On to the food. I love the dim sum style. I don't care  that someone is coming around every two minutes to feed me more food. Everything tasted superb.Some favorites included the state bird, the saurkraut and pecorino pancakes, and the rabbit cheese balls. (I don't remember the fancy term, oops)If you have a night to dedicate to this, there are plenty of places to shop and hang out while you wait in the area.As someone who no longer lives close to San Francisco, I constantly regret that I only ate here once.Great service, as well! One of the top 10 meals I've had in my life. We arrived at 6pm as a walk in and were informed the next available table for us was at 8:45. We were anticipating this so ni biggie. They actually called me at 8 and said our table was ready so we strolled over a bit early and were seated promptly. Overall the experience was just fantastic! We ordered 3 items off the menu and then sampled about 10 other provisions as they were passed around the dinning room and explained upon arrival. I could go on and on about each dish but I'll spare you the details.I will say from some of the reviews people rave about the burrata & the state bird and those dishes were good but literally some of the worst of the evening. Im not saying they were bad at all, they were really good but it goes as a testament as to how good all the other food is. Trualy an amazing and memorable experience. I have no hesitation in recommending this place to every single person I come across. The service was superb, the food was fantastic and even the Yuzu Shisho mocktail my friend ordered was unreal. I cant wait to go back and try some of the other nightly ""provisions"" Rarely does a restaurant live up to your expectations but this place is all that and more.  I went with a group of 4 and we tried about 10 dishes and shared them.  The food is made for sharing and I liked being able to try so many things in one visit.  Standouts were the wild mushroom farro spezzato, pork belly grape salad with a little jalapeño kick, CA state bird with provisions and curry rabbit roti with black trumpets and lentil dahl.  Desserts were also great especially the hachiya persimmon-hojicha granita, ginger tapioca and pears.  Not usually my thing but very refreshing after all the flavors in our earlier courses. The most surprising part was that the meal with tip and a glass of wine was about $60 per person.  If it was easier to get in I think I'd eat here once a week I think this is a 3 and half star experience. But I will go back to see if it can be better.I don't know how to review this place. The food was all great. The service was knowledgeable and friendly.But I was there to catch up with people I had not seen in a few years...and it was impossible. The food is all delivered dim sum style so we were interrupted  every two minutes. The music is so loud we couldn't hear the complex descriptions of the food. We said yes to every dish partially because we could hear nothing.I loved the Quail eggs, Sea Urchin Pancake and something with brussel sprouts. Only the pork bellies were meh to me. The Fable wine was a great match. Outstanding dinner. Outstanding service. Outstanding experience. We were three and had lots of plates they were all excellent. Unbelievable flavors. An experience for our palates. It was beyond our expectations. We got a reservation. Thanks to my husband - we didn't have to wait in the line. Based on all the raves - this is a chefs' restaurant, we were so excited to try them out. The concept is great and really well executed. The food were definitely played a lot with texture and flavor. The beef tone, it is the best that I ever had. I enjoyed the smoke trout and pickle beets. Pork belly was ok. Bone mallows and wild marshroom is a bit too salty. The state bird was a let down, and I like quals. It is interesting to have potato chips with fish eggs. I like the duck mouse, but I liked it better with the potato chips instead of the almond cakes. The oyster was excellent, and the grapefruit granita was really refreshing. The two vegetarian dishes were descents for carnivals. The service was really good if they didn't keep tripping on my chair  I was at the end of the middle row. For the quality of food and how much we paid for it, I would give it five stars, if I don't have to wait so badly and were not bothered by people tripping on my chair. Completely over-hyped. 1) You do not need to wake up at 4am to get a reservation for two months later, as some in this thread stated. I walked in at 9:00pm on a Sunday night and there were five empty tables. They were quickly filled within 15 minutes,but  let's not be overdramatic. 2) They do have a unique style for American food, but it is the same exact thing that Chinese dim-sums carts have been doing for decades. Just servers going around offering various small dishes and one cart. 3) The food was quite good, but Michelin-starred? You can definitely make most of the menu at home except the pancakes, that was really unique. I planned a trip to SF a few months back, and my friends and I were really itching to try State Bird. Luckily for me, I live on the East Coast and therefore only had to wake up at 7am, exactly 2 months to the day, before we wanted to eat here. My friends thanked me immensely for not forcing them awake at 4am. We had an 8:30 reservation, but got there quite early so asked the hostess for recommendations for cocktails nearby. She was extremely helpful and friendly, and pointed us in the right direction. Around 8:15 we come back and end up waiting around 30 minutes for our table because apparently they are just sitting on their check. Not cool. Although as other reviewers mentioned, it may have been because they were rushed through their meal? Moral of the story: come later. Our group of 4 decided to bring 2 bottles of our own wine, since the corkage was a decently reasonable $25 per bottle for the first 2 bottles ($35 each for an additional 2 bottles). Coming with a group was also a good decision because we were able to try a lot of things. I am going to spare you the details of everything we ate, but my favorites were:-guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth (order one per person) -trout roe chip & dip (I loved! Luckily for my, my friends did not) -pork belly grape salad-sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancake Definitely try the state bird (fried quail), and the oysters were also delicious. I am pretty open to trying everything once, so we did try the duck pate. Still not my thing and would probably never order again, but you live and you learn. When we first sat down, they definitely seemed to be bringing us our dishes at a very fast pace. However, as we were trying to have a leisurely dinner and really enjoy our food, we often told them to come back a little later. They had no problem doing so, and it made our dinner a lot more enjoyable. At one point we also asked our server if they needed our table, but she said as long as we were still eating, we were welcome to take our time. Also noteworthy, one of the owners was working, and he was more than happy to answer any questions we had. He even came back later and talked to my friend a little more extensively, which really went above and beyond. Overall, the service and food were both impeccable, and I hope to have another chance to dine here in the future! I just came from my dinner that I had made a reservation for  60 days prior.  The dinner was at 9:30 pm.  There is no sign on the door, nor a number.  I knew this in advance so I was able to find it easily.  My dinner partner did not know this and walked around a bit looking for it.  Finally she called me and I met her outside.  Okay, I know the place is trendy, but a number or a name outside the door would be nice.  So, moving on: service seemed a little tired at least for the main server.  My reservation was at 9:30 pm.  I was seated about 9:15 which was nice.  I had a draft which was good and cold.  As soon as my friend was seated before she could even order a glass of wine we were approached by servers bringing by small plates of yummy foods.  I think we ordered about 10 different items, mostly fish.  They were all good and some were great.  Was it the best dinner of my life? No.  The servers were all perky and I felt they were scripted ""You have to try this."" stuff.  Really?  I found it hard to get a smile out of the guy who seemed to be our main server, but the Jake Gyllenhaal lookalike was very personable and we were actually able to get a laugh from him.  I used to be a server so I know there are bad nights.  Oh do I know.  So I forgive the others especially if they are scripted which I think they are.  No bueno.  I just did not think this place is worth the hype, especially in San Francisco.  It is an interesting restaurant that is good to take out-of-towners.  The acoustics were horrible.  I had to yell across the table to my dining partner.  It was decorated like a diner caught in a time warp between the Madmen 50', the cinderblock 60's and a Denny's.  The bill was around $125.00 without tip for two with 2 drafts and 2 glasses of wine and about 10 small plates including two deserts.  It was not expensive and it was an interesting experience but there was way too much scripting of the servers.  I prefer a more original approach such as ""WTF, our specials are, blah, blah, blah."" It is better than ""Hi.  I am Bob Marley and is this your first time here?"" Yo baby, can't you see I have my ""Like a Virgin"" dress on?""....I would go back, but I am not in a hurry. Ok, State Bird doesn't need another five star review that talks about how innovative the food is, how nice the people, how electric the atmosphere yada yada. So I will focus on my experience as a single diner, not by choice, but with only one possible date and time to eat here during my current trip to SF.I arrived at 430 and was about the 8th person in line. That's actually the perfect position because you are standing outside the kitchen window and can watch your food being prepped. The doors opened at 530 and only 15 or so folks had reservations, so many of us outside were seated right away.I wanted to have a seat at the counter where I could watch the food being cooked, and that's what I got. There is less desirable counter seating right inside the door and beyond the waiter's station, so be sure to make a beeline for that kitchen seating for the best seat in the house. I immediately made the mistake a solo diner must not make if you're going to try lots of things: I ordered two carbohydrate laden dishes, duck pate with little honey muffins (I'd seen it being prepped through the window and couldn't resist) and the ""must try"" garlic monkey bread with burrata. Poof, I was full, fifteen minutes in.Of the other three dishes I ordered, the nori cracker with some kind of mollusk was a must-have as was the state bird (the small is a generous portion for one). And there were easily half a dozen items that sailed by which I desperately wanted to try. So I will be back, hopefully with a dining companion.P.S. I am not shy about sharing food with strangers, but my seatmate was a guy who eats there twice a week and had very specific interests, so didn't work this time. I don't review often - not unless I have something to say. This time, I definitely do - this is an open letter to the restaurant owners and their customers. Dear State Bird Owners. Love the food. But have to confirm some of the reviews that I read - we felt rushed. We were a party of six with a reservation for 6 30, and we were precisely on time if not early. Your delicious tapa-style food came out, was explained, and before we could even try it, another dish showed up. Turned out that you had reserved the table for some of your own friends at 8 30, so when it came time (and yes we were at dessert, but still) we were actually asked to free the table. Is it more important to flip a table or to have your customers enjoy their meal? Three stars - food is great but I am not sure that you put your customers first. I will be back when the buzz is gone and you start appreciating us again. Dedicated foodie-Annie D. Waste of time. Arrived at 6:20 on a Sunday night and was told that there were no tables available until 9:30. There was no one else waiting. They specifically indicate that 1/3 of their tables are reserved for walk-ins. I asked why there would be a 3 hour wait if they left 1/3 for walk-ins. I was told that there was a line when they opened at 5:30. Assuming that's true, there was no line now and it doesn't take 4 hours for those folks to eat dinner. It was just BS. Don't waste your time. Hands down the BEST meal of my LIFE.  I lucked out with a 5:30 reservation on a Wednesday night. Showed up at 5:15 and there was a line of people around the block without reservations.  Out of my way, people, I have a reservation :)  Anyway. Was seated right away.  State Bird does have a menu that you can order off of - but the highlight are the special off-the-menu items that are presented to you.  The staff comes to your table, dim sum style, and explains the dish and the ingredients used, the price of the item, and you have the option of saying yes or no.  One of the MOST amazing thing I consumed was the garlic bread with fresh burrata and oregano.  Another 'must order' (from the menu) is the Uni pancake - seriously, so freaking incredible.  These two items in particular have me still dreaming of the next time I can go back to this restaurant again!  The staff comes around to your table - A LOT.  So it is somewhat disruptive if you are in the middle of the conversation. But by the same token, I did not feel rushed or like they were trying to rush us out of the restaurant to accommodate the line of people outside. They are just trying to be attentive and make sure to present everything being offered that night :)  I didn't mind.   Other highlights in terms of the food were the Guinea hen dumpling, pork ribs, oysters, salmon tartare (omg), smoked trout, duck.  SIDE NOTE -- I gave up my vegan ways to fully indulge and immerse myself in everything this restaurant had to offer -- and I am so glad I did! One does not simply eat at State Bird Provisions. (Boromir voice)  It's front door is unassuming to those that walk by. There is a line of hopeful patrons, waiting for the limited walk-in tables.  The cooks are ever busy. It is a gourmand's adventure, filled with savory dishes, wines, peanut milk and desserts to consume. The very bites you take expand your palate beyond belief.  Not as a lone person should you indulge in this. It is delicious. I am still in awe of my two, yes two visits in one week to State Bird Provisions. The first was like a gift from God. I was just perusing the reservation web page late one night and realized they had tables available within an hour. My husband and I rushed down there and within 40 minutes were seated. I'm sure everyone gets it by now that it is excellent food served dim sum style. But what really left an impression on me was the whole atmosphere of the place. Everyone that works there are really, really excited about their food just as much as I am to eat it. They are friendly, high energy people with such a positive vibe.  My husband and I couldn't help ourselves and ended up eating about 15 different dishes. Yes, 15 dishes and each one of them were excellent. So then my friends wanted to go so we tried the wait in line approach. This worked out well also as we were early enough to be able to get a table right away. The wait until they opened was made easier by the staff bringing shots of drinking chocolate for everyone in line. I thought I would be more selective on dishes this time around, but failed miserably (ok, not so miserably). Between the three of us, we had about 17 dishes. Again, so delicious and creative. I now understand and appreciate the hype. Not only do they make wonderful dishes, they make eating out enjoyable. I highly recommend bringing a few friends, but no more than 4 since you need a special reservation for 6-8. You will have a great time dining here. I sure did! Everything I have ever put in my mouth at state bird provisions is above par - most times it blows my mind. . . food and drink.  The folks that work here are all very lovely. This is a quality business through and through. It is hard to get a table. but worth it. ...cuisine!With over 660 reviews and 4.5 stars - SBP does not need another dish by dish review describing various uncommon ingredients and exotic sounding preparation methods. So instead I'll just write my take on the place as simply as i can.First id like to state that hype is almost justified. To clarify - I'll compare it to another highly hyped venue Mission Chinese. The two are different on most aspects, one similarity is the amount, and type of publicity, and accolades they received. In the case of both the reputation is well earned.  However SBP epitomizes ""cuisine"" where as MC is the prime example of (best) ""food"" (ever).  The awesome thing about SBP is that its relatively cheap considering the awards, the ingredients, the variety, the skill and thought that goes into every tiny dish. But - its not really a place where you can ""Get into a dish"". At SBP you TRY things and move on. Its fun - but if you like quantity as much as quality you may not be as satisfied, unless that is -  you're looking for quantity of CHOICES.Finally i'll say that everything was awesome - delicious and interesting ( i was on a mission to find the worst sounding thing on the menu and to find out just how bad (good) it would be - it turned out to be the duck gizzards wrapped in bacon - it was a bit chewy - but otherwise delicious), most memorable was the deep fried quail - most perfect deep fried item i've EVER had.If you haven't been here yet - you owe it yourself to experience this place at least once.USEFUL NOTES:1. There will be a wait, expect 1-2 hours if you have no reservations, we planned for this and just hung out at japantown having drinks and checking out stores; also kabuki theater is an awesome near by place to kill just the right amount of time.2. If you're anything like me your meal will be 40-60$ without drinks (per person).3. This is a cool place to visit - not so hungry as the dishes are small and well priced!4. Service - personable, energetic and knowledgeable.5. Interior/exterior - well put together space, emphasizes the kitchen - we sat at the bar and felt the heat of the ovens - which i love but its probably not for everyone.6. Parking - this is a busy neighborhood that's heavily metered - meters do take credit cards.7. Try the namesake - quail - its one of those ultimate dishes.Other notes:1. great place if you want to establish your foodie cred.2. great place i want to expand your vocabulary of food related words.3. bad destination for comfort food. We'd been sitting on a gift card for over a year.  We have a hard enough time coordinating a babysitter for our toddler, let alone booking reservations months in advance or waiting hours in line.However, one night in November I just so happened to be awake at 4AM (see above re: toddler) and managed to book a coveted Friday night reservation.  When I checked again at 4:05 AM, everything was already gone.Two months later, we arrived-- 20 minutes late for our hard-won reservation!  As we raced down the street, I steeled myself for the inevitable confrontation with the staff at such a popular place.  I needn't have worried.  The hostess greeted us warmly, apologized for giving our table away, and brought us glasses of complimentary champagne while we waited for another.  Every staff member we encountered throughout the night was similarly warm, enthusiastic, and laid-back.The food was uniformly solid.  All of it was inventive.  And some of it was sublime-- in addition to the quail and garlic bread dishes that are much discussed, we absolutely loved a duck ham pancake that we ordered off the menu.  And the desserts were the highlight, especially the chocolate roll cake with sesame mousse.Was it the best meal we ever ate?  No.  Is it over-hyped?  Probably.  But I can totally understand why it is so popular.  The space, the concept, the approach are all sui generis.  In a town where it's easy to take good restaurants for granted, this is truly a great one-- because there's nothing else like it.And as always seems to happen on our long-awaited date nights, who should get seated next to us but a harried-looking couple toting a toddler who did not seem as enthused to be there as the rest of the crowd.  As they awkwardly wedged their stroller through the crowd waiting for a table I saw more than a few eyes roll.But the hostess?  She welcomed them smiling, helped stash away the stroller, brought out a high chair.  We watched every server come up and interact with the baby.  The chef himself stopped by the table several times, even brought out some special child-friendly treats from the kitchen.And this is why this place gets 5 stars in my book.  Arguably the hippest place in town, certainly the hardest to book.  But none of the attitude that usually accompanies such feats.  Rather than trumpeting their exclusivity, they've created an atmosphere that's warm and welcoming, food that's delicious, and an overall experience that's truly memorable. I thought to myself: this is my last chance for a grown up dinner with my husband before the second kid arrives and we stop eating out for a few years. I cannot take chances. If I were to arrive early to snatch a 5:30 table, I need to be there early.  In fact, so prepared and so early that I found myself standing outside the no-sign restaurant alone for a good half an hour before the next wave of people came.  By then, at 4:30, people started to come in large waves. Not everyone is seated at 5:30, of course, even though the newly renovated space allocated about half of the tables for walk-ins.  Some received later times.  The last ones were turned away. Of course, after 90 minutes of wait, I was beyond excited to eat, or mostly just excited to sit. The place is very cute and energetic.  Everyone working there seems so happy.  There is a menu where you can order some dishes, while the rest are being walked around on trays by waiters ---  truly dim sum style.  It's exciting to eye the food coming your way.  The unpredictability ---  will they run out before they reach your table?, makes you almost giddy.  And the selection is overwhelming.  We had to decide what NOT to get --- that's the hard part, when there are so many choices.  Uni pancake-- definitely. Brussel sprouts -- maybe next time.  Some of the highlights were surprises.  Like the rabbit croquette.  And the quinoa with persimmon and shiitake mushroom.  Really really good. Others didn't match the hype.  Like the state bird was tender and juicy but perhaps a little too greasy for us.  And the way they described the mushroom dumplings made it sound like a little spoon of heaven. But I thought it was a bit bland. Our waitress's eyes sparkled talking about the half dozen quail eggs. And they were indeed quite special.  runny yolks, tart apple, creamy mt.tam.  Strange combo but just worked.  And the burrata and bread dish ran out a few times right before reaching our table. so it was nice to finally get it and try the strange concept of garlic knots with savory cheese.  Really good, but came in at a time where our bellies were beyond full. Just like any dim sum restaurants, at a certain point, you need to know when to quit.  So we stopped and split the chocolate dessert, which came out looking like a piece of meatloaf.  Cute and inventive, but I was hoping for something more traditional. Service is obviously fast since there is virtually no wait time between order and eat.  And price is surprisingly affordable.  How many dishes did we get? Can't remember, but we only spent about $100 for two without drinks.  hardly counts as a fancy, special-occasion dinner, right? But the experience was certainly different and memorable, which makes it a great ""last chance for grown up dinner for two"" for me! The cheapest Michelin experience I've had to date. After 13 ""provisions"" and 1 large order of state bird, our total came to $175 (tax and tip included)! The service here is ok, they are eager to introduce the dishes but a little on the slow side in taking away empty ones. Highlights from the menu include: the state bird :) no surprise here, the pork belly with grapes, and the smoked trout. The state bird has a crispy outer skin with a surprisingly moist interior. My favorite ingredient was the beets in the smoked trout but my favorite complete dish was the pork belly. we made a reservation and when we got there two seats happened to open at the bar and that really made a better experience because you get everything fresh out of the kitchen and the chefs are really friendly. for 2 and we were really full after:rabbit croquettes: 4 / 5raw oyster: 4hen dumpling: 3duck liver mousse: 5bacon gizzard: 5garlic bread with burrata: 4.5honey mussels:4 hamachi avocado: 4king salmon tartare: 4.5 pork belly grape salad: 5ice cream sandwich (must get): 5overall it was just a very very enjoyable experience.i dont say this often but this place really lives up to its hype Interesting dim sum style service. The food is different and delicious. If you get in line an hour or two before they open, you can snag a spot without reservations. My thing for 2014 is low expectations. For example, I thought Anchor Man 2 was gonna blow, but lowkey loved it. For another example, I thought Wolf of Wall Street was going to be nasty and way too long and I loved it too. It's a formula. It's setting expectations. On the floor from whence there's nowhere but up to go. So when my girl called to tell me she had State Bird Provisions reservations for this past monday, I was concerned. You can't un-hype a place that's got everybody and their dad talking about it's greatness. I went in expecting to be let down. Alas, I was not.ALL of the food was delicious. I liked everything, but can't stop thinking about the salmon mousse, the pork belly, and the burrata. The desserts were straight sexual (and I don't even like dessert). Further, I'd gone in expecting to hate the atmosphere. I thought I'd be surrounded by stodgy folks actively involved in taking their food too seriously, but I wasn't. The vibe was nice and I felt comfortable snatching dish after dish off the trays as they passed us by. Is it possible to give this place 10 stars? I really don't want to let the cat out of the bag but it's safe to say it's already been out for awhile now. This is definitely my favorite restaurant in San Francisco.Where do I start? The food is amazing and unique. Every time we go there are always new dishes on the menu so you really won't ever get sick of this place. The food is tapa style which is great for me since I do not eat much but love trying out different dishes. Price is extremely reasonable for such exceptional food. I won't go into details about each dish because there are too many to name but our favorites include: the staple state bird of course (fried quail) , pork belly, lobster risotto, hamachi on fried nori, trout, steak tartare and the to die for ice cream sandwiches. The service is beyond excellent. We all know how popular this place is and how hard it is to reserve a table here. Even with their immense popularity they are not snobby or rude as one might except. They are extremely accommodating and willing to make sure everything will work out if you need to change your reservation. Katherine is exceptionally helpful and accommodating. If it was easier to make reservations I would be eating here at least once a week.  San Francisco is known for superb food and culinary excellence but state bird definitely is well deserving of its new One Michelin star and popularity. Omg new favorite restaurant in SF. Amazing food, great service, good prices. Believe the hype. Lives up to the hype.  Have been 3 times now, has really been amazing each time.  Had some sort of quail egg goodness which was out of this world.  They were great to accommodate a group of 8 during the holidays and we loved the service.  It's really a treat.  Highly recommend checking out Fat Angel around the corner if you can't get in. Not one complaint, although I will say, I love the ""starters"" more than the main courses. Will be back as soon as I can get in again! The first thing about State Bird is the wait.  If you have no reservation and are disinclined to wait a potential 2-3+ hours, then stop reading and go somewhere else.  My party dropped our names on the wait list, went to a 2-hour concert at the Independent, walked to Japantown for some snacks, and walked back to State Bird to a 40-minute wait before we were seated.  Was it worth it?  Mostly.The hamachi avocado seaweed is the best item on the menu by far.  One of these is meant for 3-4, but I ate one and a half by myself.  It is one of the best dishes I've ever tried, and if I had a reservation here, I'd come back just for that.  The quail was decent, though a far second to the seaweed.  Everything else was kind of funky (also tried the uni pancake, bone marrow, allagash black, rabbit croquette, pork belly salad).  Among the dessert, the peanut muscovado milk shots were my favorite, while the ICS and caramel tart were decent. Ringing in the new year right!!1.5 hr wait if you don't have reservationsSuggestion-GO EARLY and stand in line (like me)Reservations are only 60 days in advance within 90 mins booked online.Equals-WORTHY!!State Bird Provisions has an innovated style/swag with fresh inventive styles of what us Americans like to call ""Dim Sum"". NO NO NO they are far from pushing carts but with a friendly warm smile and fast service, you will NOT be disappointed.Each day the menu changes, so even then you see my photos the items may not be present. The staff was amazing, and no they don't hustle you into buying their dishes as they go around each table offering eclectic and creative dishes. I was quite impressed and our taste buds were dancing as my party of 4 kept talking about how good our food was. Would I come back? Defiantly! CHEERS and Happy New Year. My friend calls me up saying he was able to get us a reservation for that night and that I'd HAVE to come out! Glad that I did because the food was delish! A bit pricey for tapas and the style reminded me of a dim sum restaurant where they'd go around in a cart. Atmosphere was great and just overall great experience. I still can't believe we were able to get a reservation for that night. Talk about luck! The food was good to great, but the service was disappointing. The staff was in such a hurry to usher us out, they asked us if we wanted our check twice before they had delivered the desserts we ordered (which was truly a delightful dessert).The food is fun, but the personal touch is greatly missing. There are a great many other places to choose from where you can have it all (great food as well as service.) If it's possible to get a reservation here, take it- no matter what time of night it is. This place is basically an American dim-sum restaurant. The waiters/waitresses encourage you to order the smaller size of what's on the menu so you have more options to try. There were carts rolled around with different kinds of plates throughout the whole night and I wanted to eat everything. Some of my favorites include the Red Trout with Kishus, Hazelnut-Garum Brown Butter, CA State Bird with Provisions, Pork Spare Ribs, Tombo Tuna- Avocado and Seaweed Cracker, and for dessert, the Coffee Toffee 'Ice Cream' Sandwich with dates, ginger fudge. I guess the list is more than a few. Everything was delicious and it was definitely a treat to come here :) For the wait and the elongated reservation, State Bird surely did not disappoint. The bf and I actually attempted coming here a little before 5:30pm on my birthday with the hopes of scoring a table, but failed miserably. By the time we parked, which was roughly around 5:18pm, the line was already ridiculously long. Not knowing the normal protocol, we thought the line was moving rather quickly and that we were going to actually get a spot, but little did we know, by the time we reached the host, we were informed that they were all sold out until 11pm and will take down our name and number if anyone cancels for the night (but of course, the waitlist before us was massive as well). Bummed, we searched for another restaurant and enjoyed my bday meal elsewhere but swore to come back another day to try again. Luckily, we knew someone with a reservation a few days after that they could not make, so we took it!Let me tell you, even with a reservation in hand, we waited a good 30 min for the tables to pay and be entirely cleared. (Note: we actually arrived an hour earlier than our reservation but they would not seat us until our reservation time.) After sitting, we were informed that we were suggested to order a few items from the menu but around 12 items were dim-sum style and will be presented to us on carts all throughout dinner. Being too excited and mostly too hungry, we ordered the CA State Bird w/ Provisions  (half), Cumin Lamb & Baby Octopus, Duck Ham-Pecan Pancake, and the Curry Rabbit Roti. From the carts being pushed around, we tried a fish egg w/potato chips dish, salmon tartare w/ cucumber, one dumpling ( I forgot what was inside), a rabbit croquette ball, and a pork belly & grapes concoction dish. Since the menu changes so often, you probably will not see any of these items again, but honestly, they were all delicious and unique in their own ways. As long as the dish is filled with ingredients you like, dont hesitate to try it and be mind-blown!My favorite from the entire dinner was definitely the salmon tartare and the curry rabit roti. These two plates were at out-of-this-worth level of amazing. We also ended with the Buckwheat Bao for dessert, which was filled with Coconut Cream & Carrot Jam, and honestly, I am so glad that the waitress took a good 5 minutes trying to talk us into getting it. I am a dessert junky, but I was seriously so full that I was about to blow. Best decision EVER.All I say is, State Bird was amazing so get your reservations in early or be prepared to show up at 3pm to avoid the long line and guarantee your spots for that night! Favorite spot in SF, hands down. For my 100th review this year, I'm going to give a rundown of SBP. We decided to celebrate New Year's Eve a day early and go out for a ""fancy"" meal. The place is casual and we layered up with our coats and hats in preparation of a long wait. We found street parking on the other side of the grocery store. At a little before 4 PM, we were the 10th and 11th people in line! There is no sign marking the place, but it's obvious when you see the line. If you get there early, you can watch them prepping the food in the window.Doors open at 5:30 PM and those with reservations go in first. Then, whatever seats are left get handed out. If you don't get a seat, they will put your name on a waiting list with approximate time a seat will be available. We sat at the chef's table, which was a lot of fun. Everyone working here is super friendly.Food is served tapas/dim sum style, in tiny bites. You can also order larger bites. We started with oysters with a bit of chili oil and kohlrabi slaw. I don't like oysters, but I slurped these up. Next were the guinea hen dumplings in preserved lemon broth. A very tasty bite, but the broth made all the difference. You can definitely taste citrus notes. The duck liver mousse with almond cakes was exquisite. Nice blend of sweet and savory. A rabbit confit croquette with melted fontina-style cheese filling came out piping hot. It was only one crunchy bite, but delicious. However, there was a tiny bone in mine that ruined the moment!One of the highlights was the wild mushroom farro with preserved egg yolk and ricotta in broth. So delicious and creamy, yet delicate at the same time. This one wasn't over-the-top savory, just understated earthy flavors. Fried pork belly with grapes and spicy peppers was melt-in-your-mouth tender. Can't have too much of this stuff, since it's so fatty. Grapes were a thoughtful addition to provide contrast.We ordered a ""commandable"" pan fried red trout with kishus and hazelnut garum brown butter. Many of these were available in a half-portion. Fish was perfectly cooked to a silky consistency. The skin was lightly crisped. You could smell the aromatics wafting from the melted butter. Toasted hazelnuts were a nice, unexpected twist. Loved it!When the seafood cart came around, we had a great debate, but ended up getting beets with smoked trout mousse and salmon tartare with cucumber spears topped with quinoa/furikake-like mixture. The beets were superb, quite possibly the most scrumptious thing we've tasted all evening long. They were tender without any dirt-like flavor beets are known for. The mousse was rich and savory, smoky without being overwhelming. Wow. Capers and oil gave it another layer of complexity. Every taste bud was activated with this dish. DH liked how the chefs played with texture as well as flavor. The salmon dish used fresh ingredients, but I would have preferred it without so much crunch.We were already quite full, but DH insisted on ordering the hamachi crudo on a crispy nori chip. Wow, this one was truly special and looked like a work of art. Who would have thought that radishes would play well with hamachi? The sauces were delicious and the nori chip was crunchy and full of savory goodness. The chef sitting in front of us said it was ""one of their top 5"". Be sure to order one!Finally, their desserts are also available in half-portions, except for the buckwheat bao. We got the bergamot granita with yogurt tapioca, and honey-coriander syrup. It had some tangerine slices in it. Experience was reminiscent of Asian ice slush desserts, but this was on an entirely different level. I loved the subtle, woodsy herb scents with the sour notes of the citrus. Excellent.The coffee toffee ice cream sandwich with dates and ginger fudge was also delicious. The crust was slightly chewy, with flavors resembling a snickerdoodle cookie, but much denser. I wished I could eat more than 1 slice. I couldn't identify the other flavors (date or fudge), but I didn't care at that point.Overall, an excellent place for some new American style dining, and quite affordable for the the quality/uniqueness of the food. Total came up to about $50/head after tax and tips, no booze. Wait time was 1.5 hours. Service was friendly and efficient. Only gripe was that we couldn't try everything! Well...maybe next time. After waiting in line at 5 pm on Sunday, we finally made it into the restaurant at 9:30 (we went home and came back...). My highlights were the burrata garlic bread, the state bird, the scallion pancake with uni, and the rabbit. We had a lobster salsa that was disappointing, and a couple of porridge dishes that I probably wouldn't get again. The desserts were fantastic, especially the oolong ice cream sandwich!I thought prices were reasonable and service was solid. It also lived up to its hype, which is often hard to do. However, to answer your question: No, I would not wait that long again. The food was good, but not that good. I would wait one hour max! We decided to brave the line at State Bird and see if we could get a table for four.The doors open at 5:30 so we arrived at 4:30 thinking we would be among the first ones. Not so, there were already 30 people ahead of us.Around 5, they brought hot chocolate to everyone in line. Nice touch.When it was our turn to check in, they said we could get a table around 7:30 and got our phone number in case it was sooner.We headed to a wine bar nearby and had a drink while we waited.They called us at 7:00 and said 10 minutes.. That gave us time to pay and walk back.We got seated right away and started the feast.I am not sure if I'll remember everything but here are the highlights:Beets with smoked trout cream: Some creme fraiche with slightly smoked fish roe served on potato chips. Beef tongueOysters (served by piece)duck liver mousse with mini almond muffinscrab with kimchee yubascallion pancakes with uni.state bird with provisions (fried quail)coffee ice cream sandwiches.Everything was really tasty, my favorite was the beets with trout cream.Service is friendly.Corkage fee is 25.00Prices are really reasonable.I am not a fan of standing in line. I particularly think that no food on earth is delicious enough for a 3 hour wait. That said, if State Bird was near my house and didn't have a line, I would go there every day. I've now been twice, once with hubby and once with my sister, both times surprising and delicious.  I was unable to get any reservation at all online, so hubs and I arrived at 4pm, and were the fifth party in line. In the 15 minutes after we arrived, the line actually had gotten pretty long, so I'm glad we didn't come much later.  We sat at the chef's table (aka, the counter), which is fun for watching the preparations. Most recommended bites: 1) pork belly with jalapeno and chiles. I don't even like pork belly (usually greasy and fatty), but this was amazing. 2) Yuba noodles with kim chee and smoked egg and dungeness crab--I couldn't get enough of this taste, and again, these are not flavors I usually would choose, but they worked together in an unexpected and awesome way. 3) State Bird Provisions--amazing fried quail. Don't miss it. 4) Dumpling in soup--sounds simple, and it is, but also amazing. 5) ice cream sandwich dessert.If you want to go, and don't have a reservation, just bring a book, come at 4, and enjoy! Was able to snag a reservation when they reopened and had all 60 days of service become available at once.The dining style is definitely unique. It allows you to try many dishes, and keeps the excitement going because you don't know what's coming out next. It's been too long that I don't remember all the dishes, but the garlic bread burrata, pork belly , and coconut bao still stick out. With two beers for me and two glasses of wine for my wife (and at least 10 dishes), the total (after tip) was $175. Definitely an expensive night out for us but it was worth the food and experience.The only reason I'm deducting one star is towards the end of the meal I was interested in seeing what else there was to eat. Several repeats had already come by, but around 8:30 (the restaurant closes at 9) the carts seemed to stop coming by, and they were just trying to sell what they already had made. I guess it makes sense, but it was disappointing that the kitchen stopped producing new dishes before closing, while people were still actively eating. I've been trying to eat at State Bird Provisions for months now but haven't been able to get a reservation. On a Friday afternoon, I stood in line starting at 4:40 p.m. and was about 25th in line (the restaurant opens at 5:30 p.m.). When I got to the front, we were lucky to get a spot at the chef's table at 7:30 - the people in front and behind us were only able to get tables at 9:30. I love small plates and sharing - great to have lots of different tastes and flavors. And these plates are small enough so that you can try a bunch of different things. We got the pork belly, head cheese, beets and trout, garlic bread with burrata, dumpling with broth, trout roe with potato chip, state bird (with provisions), rabbit curry roti, dungeness crab with kimchi yuba, pork riblets, coffee ice cream sandwich and the granita. My favorites were the trout roe, garlic bread with burrata, rabbit curry roti and state bird - the rabbit curry roti in particular. So tasty!The plates are pretty reasonably priced so, as my friend said, you can eat your face off!All of the waitstaff were incredibly nice and helpful and provided great recommendations. We couldn't decide on dessert, so we had a half order of each. We didn't know that half orders were available but when we asked the waiter for a recommendation, he let us know that we could get a little of both! And even with the long wait and lots of people, the hostess was so nice and friendly. Reservations are taken 2 months in advance and you kinda have to be awake at 4am  to lock that ish down. Michelin and James Beard and Yelp-approved, there was a LOT of anticipation going into this dinner.We did a double date for maximum dish-tasting capacity. We ordered a few things from the menu and just snagged cart dishes that looked good as they went by. The menu items -- sauerkraut pancake, sea urchin pancake, were super good. They're not really pancakes but I guess how else would you describe them? Savory dough vessels for delicious toppings. The state bird was like an interesting fried chicken. Bone marrow and cumin lamb dishes were super rich and satisfying but not altogether very unique in flavor.I think we also had the cauliflower salad but it was pretty forgettable.. we def had a forgettable cauliflower something, maybe from the cart. The guinea hen dumplings were whatever too, from the cart. Pork riblets were pretty good. The garlic bread with burrata, amazing. Oysters were nice.For dessert we had the coffee toffee ice cream and buckwheat coconut bao.. not a huge fan of either tbh, thought they were just okay. I wouldn't have ordered any of the desserts except we didn't think we'd come back to try it another time.I really wanted to like this place more! Considering the hype.. and the wait.. and the like $300 bill. There are better spots int he city. Had the opportunity to eat here a few weeks ago, post-remodel. Reservations were a little painful to get, but was able to secure a spot for two on Sunday evening.I'm more of a filmore deli + zeitgeist kind of guy, but happened into a sizable gift card after speaking at a conference in town. I'd heard the hype about the place for a while, and expected that the $100 gift card wouldn't go far, but the portions were surprisingly meager for the price. The food was definitely interesting, but left unfilled and more confused than satisfied. In the end I was longing for an egg sandwich of sizable portions.All that said, an interesting experience. Where else can you have a foam made of duck marrow atop a single rib braised with a truffle from the moon? Spot on everytime, loving this place more every time I go, staff is so friendly and food is amazing if you have not tried this new addition t o SF your missing out, the only dish I have tried that  ididnt like was the liver mouse but everything else was amazing. Wow!!!! Totally blown away by this place it's completely all the hype it's built up to be and thensome. After hearing many ppl rave about how amazing this place was I jumped at the chance when my sister had an open reservation. It was a randoms Tuesday night at 8:30pm and of course it was still packed. I overheard that a walk-in had about a 45 min wait and the girl up from was super cute and pleasant. The restaurant was also really cutely decorated and so unassuming from the outside you'd never be able to tell this is THE restaurant in SF.Everything we are was just amazing I think it's hard to even go wrong. The thing I like about the place that I learned there was it was mainly small plates, dim sum style where a cart literally comes around with small plates then on top of that there's a menu with staple items. We were in love with this crunchy quinoa that came out on a cart seriously EPIC. Then we had this hamachi style tostada that I believe is a staple soooo good! The sort of cheese bread with buratta was out of this world! It was so delicious almost unheard of taste! We had a steak tartare equally amazing and some seafood dishes everything tasted extremely fresh and so original. You could easily taste every ingredient! We split a bottle of wine as all between about 5 of us. For dessert, we had this coconut bao our waiter came by and said it was he last one - so nice of him! It was heaven paired with this cream and fruit compote wow!!! We also had the chocolate ganache on the menu and it was equally out of this world!For 5 of us, we ended up spending about $50 per person not bad considering we kept ordering. That's the issue you can just keep going especially being small plates!Overall OMG amazing! Must try in SF! The Big Table.This is seriously the only way to do State Bird.Why? Let me tell you!1: You have to call or email; it doesn't use the online reservation system. This means you're not fighting all the people with bots, and it's actually possible to get one.2: You get to eat pretty much everything!  We had (I think) 4 courses, and each course consisted of between 4-6 different items, each made with enough for all of us. It was fantastic.The best things we had were spectacular; the worst things were still quite good.The wine list is on the somewhat more expensive side, and I'd recommend the whites over the reds generally; most of the reds are too young (and taste it). By and large, the whites will match the food equally as well, if not better, too.Can't wait to go back! We stopped to grab a drink and glad we did. The deviled eggs were ridiculously good, with a little dab of relish on top. Also tried the meat platter. All the meats were great and the stone ground mustard served along side was perfect. The chef was making rounds and meeting everyone, which was a very nice touch. After spending weeks watching for reservations to appear online to no avail, I decided to try my luck as a walk up.  I got in line 90 min before they opened on a Sunday and had only one party in front of me. Being this close to the front of the line meant that I had my pick of being directly seated at 5:30 when they opened, or of choosing a time later in the evening to come back. I asked for two people at 7:15. Word to the wise, come here with 4 people (or more) if possible. You will have a better experience if there are more bellies to share the small plates. For the service: We were at first confused, that it appears you don't have an assigned waiter, but we quickly realized any of the staff coming by with plates was happy to take our orders for drinks or menu items. This struck me as much more efficient. Our orders arrived very quickly and we never felt like we needed to flag anyone down. Since the small plates and cart came around so frequently, we felt showered with attention so I rate service as excellent. For the drinks: they make their own sodas and I thought the rootbeer was very tasty. The wine list is reasonably priced and contained a good variety. They have a good selection of hot tea and they serve blue bottle French press coffee in regular or decaf. For the food: we ordered 3 items from the regular menu and tried 6 of the small plates that came around. My favorite thing was the pork belly/grape salad. The pork belly was cooked perfectly to melt and disappear in your mouth without being chewy, yet it was very juicy and flavorful. The pork belly was juicier than the grapes, and the flavors married well. The ""state bird with provisions"" was good enough that I ordered a second serving to go. For the record it was still amazing when eaten the next day, cold and directly from the box. The veggie and fish dishes all had such unique spice blends and had beautiful presentations. The ONLY dish that was even mildly disappointing was the curry lamb/octopus because the octopus was more chewy than typical, and this one minor disappointment was easy to forget since EVERYTHING else was spot on. For the dessert: we ordered the ice cream sandwich and the grapefruit tapioca plus two shots of peanut milk. Both were wonderful, though, for a dessert the grapefruit tapioca was not very sweet and even slightly bitter. The ginger-fudge sauce on the ice cream sandwich is thick and has a perfect and subtle amount of ginger. The peanut milk shots were fun and unique, but a bit heavy after all that other food.  The duck liver mousse was served with sweet almond mini-muffins and it is a perfect blend of fatty, sweet and savory. Yes the food was good but No totally did not live up to the hype.  I was so excited when a friend had an extra seat at her table given how hard it is to get a reservation at this place.  We had TONS of different plates and, I can honestly say, the only dish that  I did not want to try was my favorite dish of the night: beef tongue.  I had never had it before and definitely enjoyed how tender the meat was.I'll disclose that I cannot stand it when a restaurant places on the menu that they have a surcharge to comply with Healthy SF.  Honestly, I would expect that at a tacqueria but not at a place like state bird provisions.  I find it totally tacky.  I mean what do they think people are going to do, leave because of a $1.50 charge at the end?  They should just factor that into the already overpriced menu and leave it at that.  I thought the staff was generally nice, a bit pretentious but I would expect that from a place like this.  Also, kind of sad that there was absolutely NO diversity but, again, not surprising.In the end, I was stuffed and enjoyed my food.  Probably will only go back unless the partner really really wants to go. I usually don't hit up restaurants this classy but I decided to jump out of my comfort zone a little with this pick. Knowing that I won't be coming back here for a long, long time, I went all out with ordering. And, I gotta say that State Bird truly delivers on both taste and texture in their dishes. Speaking of, this is my breakdown for each dish I tasted:- Smoked trout. Nice creamy puree with bite-size chunks of pickled beets, capers and onions. I liked it but it tasted a bit average for this quality of a restaurant. - State bird w/ provisions. Great buttermilk crust with cheese and onions. Quail was so tender and juicy also, a difficult technical feat, I know. The little bit of citrus gave it a nice kick, too. Not my favorite dish, though. I enjoyed but wasn't blown away by it.- Uni pancake. It really blew away my previous conceptions of uni. To me, it had always been soggy and grainy. This pancake topped with uni was at the same time crispy yet creamy. That uni was fresh, my friends. Sadly, the pancake itself was too small to warrant the 14 dollar price tag, IMO. - Steak tartare. Definitely an above average steak tartare. Bright and light on top of lettuce cups with some nice aioli on the side. The only thing that distracted me from the flavor were the croutons. I felt they were unnecessary and tough. I understand the need for a balance in texture but I felt the lettuce and toppings were more than enough to cover that.- Salmon tartare. Disappointing. My least favorite. This dish tasted like I could have made it. Fresh and tasty but not too inventive.- Guinea Hen Dumpling. A decent dumpling but I can't understand why the guinea hen made any difference in the filling. I thought the skin and the broth made more sense.- Garlic bread with burrata. Oh man, definitely my favorite savory dish here. I literally wanted to get another one just so I could eat it all by myself. The melted cheese on top of great bread, oh good god. It was like eating my dreams.- Pork belly. Awesome belly meat with super delicious broth. The grapes really tied the dish together, though, giving it that extra level of class. My second favorite savory dish.- Ice cream sandwich. We got the coffee toffee. Best decision in my life. This is hands down the best dish of the night and possibly the best ice cream sandwich I will ever eat. The ice cream was light but not watery with just the right amount of creamy. The sandwich was soft yet didn't fall apart. The ginger fudge, the toffee and the dates? Perfect toppings to an already great sandwich. I seriously cannot get enough of it and am so sad that the night is over. Otherwise? I'd probably go broke ordering more of these.Major drawbacks of the night: Waited a long time for my table to be prepared but the service when we sat down was great and we got to try some complimentary wine/rabbit meatball (which incidentally was also amazingly tender and juicy) in the meantime. The small waiting area was a little cramped as well, which is not to say the entire area is cramped. The actual space was quite nice and cozy. Overall, I definitely hope to come back here someday and hope they keep up the good work. Just like any hot restaurant, it's hard to get in. But once you do, you're taken by the little surprises as each tray gets presented to your table. The true challenge is being able to say no to some of those dishes because they ALL look so good. And they are, there may have been a dish or two that fell a bit short but that's part of the experience, you just have to try. I wouldn't miss out on the bone marrow, that sealed the night and left a savory memory to this day, along with other ones. Quick tip: apparently you have to line up before open and they book their seats first come first reserved style but if you come around 10pm (I know, late) then you may get seated as walk in, maybe. Good luck. Ugh....I've really been dreading writing a review of my experience at State Bird Provisions because of how long it will probably be. While I must admit this restaurant offers a fresh taste on Californian cuisine and prepares a lot of dishes well, there are a few things that fall short and don't live up to the legendary elite status this restaurant now owns. I loved how the restaurant comes around in a ""dim sum"" style and offers food at table side. I further appreciate how the price of everything was listed alongside the dishes so I was always aware what my running total was. My partner and I ordered only a couple things off the  paper menu and then sampled everything off the carts. Disappointments: burrata garlic bread; there was not enough garlic and the burrata was cold. Can we also talk about the state bird aka the take out from KFC with a few onions reluctantly tossed on the quails back? The eggnog ice cream sandwich; please discontinue this item as it tasted like freezer burn.Things I loved: shiitake, persimmon & quinoa 'tabouleh' , oysters with spicy kraut, the chips served with the tartare (the tartare itself was average at best) and corn muffins and liver mousse, The wine pours are incredibly prudish but at least the waitstaff are polite and friendly. I'm excited I got to try State Bird and maybe I'll come back at some point but for now I'm all set. This place is as great as the rumors say it is.  My husband and I absolutely LOVED our dinner experience here.  I would recommend getting one or two of the pancakes (the mendocino sea urchin, ginger-scallion pancake with soy-lime glaze was soooo good) and commandables (must try their CA state bird with provisions - the large size was a good amount for the two of us), and saving space in your belly for the provisions (what they pass around on the carts).  A few of our favorites were the raw oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesame, garlic bread with burrata, guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth (my husband's favorite), and the hamachi-avocado & seaweed cracker (this was my favorite).  Also, the 'world peace' peanut muscovado milk was a wonderful way to finish our meal.  In addition, the service was superb.  While they were super busy, we didn't feel rushed at all.  We really got to sit there and enjoy our meal, wine, and the atmosphere without being disturbed or rushed.  Finally, we thought it was a nice touch that the owner and staff took the time to greet the customers on our way in, and thank us and say goodbye on our way out.  Excellent food and wonderful service.  It does not get better than that! To celebrate a semester well done, my teammates and I decided that we were going to splurge and spend an evening at State Bird Provisions. We emailed the restaurant in September asking for a reservation for 5 people in December, so you can see what kind of planning goes into securing a spot for a large-ish group. We arrived for our reservation and were seated immediately. Waiting for us on our table was our fixed menu for the evening. I asked our server if we could order other items off the menu because I really love their peking duck and I saw that it wasn't one of the fixed items. She said it was possible, but cautioned us to wait and see how  much food was coming, which I really appreciated later when we were stuffed to the gills and could barely walk out on our own two feet.We started our celebration off with a delicious bottle of Prosecco. As each item of food was delivered to our table the servers gave a description. We were happy to find that each of the dishes had enough food for each person to have one serving. The restaurant has its portioning down to a science!We brought two bottles of wine with us, but I regret that we didn't really think very closely on the type wine we should have brought. The food at State Bird is very light and delicate. I would recommend bringing a really delicious pinot noir. We brought an oaky cab and zin and neither was a great match for the food.The best part about coming and having a prefixed menu was that we didn't have to make any decisions all night. We spent our time talking and laughing and enjoying the food that we were experiencing together. Our reservation clearly stated that we would only have the table for two hours, but we were having so much fun the time flew by and before we knew it we have been there for 2.5 hours! The staff was super friendly the whole time and never mentioned that we needed to leave or made us feel rushed. Here is our menu with some short notes about each item...FIRST COURSE- raw oyster with spicy kohlrabi krant & sesame (delicious and fresh)- hamachi-avocado & seaweed cracker (super tasty and left us wanting more)- smoked trout 'creamed' beets (so good we were literally licking the serving dish clean)- duck liver mousse with almond biscuit (I don't usually like duck liver mousse, but this was excellent!)- sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancakes (yum! especially with the dipping salt)rabbit & fontina croquettes (very savory and tasty)SECOND COURSE- garlic bread with burrata (delicious and the bread is very fluffy)- shiitake, persimmon & quinoa 'tabouleh' (we loved all the different textures in this one!)- pork belly grape salad (I thought that the sauce was a bit heavy on the fish sauce)- spicy fried cauliflower salad, bayley hazen blue cheese & fermented green tomatoes (super tasty and flavorful!)- 1/2 dozen cast iron quail eggs, apple, sunchokes & mt. tam (I thought that this one was a little bland for me)THIRD COURSE- CA state bird with provisions (perfectly crispy and tasty)- wild mushroom farro spezzato (it was good, but didn't stand out)- red trout, mandarin, hazelnut-garum brown butter (good, but not as good as other dishes)- spicy dungeness crab kimchi yuba with smoked egg (very flavorful and tasty)DESSERT- 'world peace' peanut muscovado milk (tasted like drinking a snickers in a good way)- eggnog icecream sandwich, almond macaroon (so delicious!!)- bittersweet chocolate ganache tart, brown sugar-oat crust, olive oil (great if you love chocolate) I managed to snag rezzies at State Bird Provisions for me and my mommy's milestone birthdays (actual milestones not to be revealed)!  Our server, Jess, and her crew provided impeccable service.  For those in the know, you already know State Bird Provisions' dishes are served in small portions, like dim sum or tapas.  When you have a big group reservation (we had 7 people), they have four ""courses,"" each course consisting of 3-5 dishes.Overall, I would say that State Bird Provisions does a fabulous job of making ""healthy"" foods taste delicious!  For example, I usually hate quinoa and cauliflower, but their quinoa and cauliflower dishes were amongst my favorites!  These were the highlights of our meal:* shiitake, persimmon & quinoa 'tabouleh' (we couldn't figure out what the crunchy element was, maybe toasted quinoa, but whatever it was, it really made the dish!)* spicy fried cauliflower salad, bayley hazen blue cheese & fermented green tomatoes (spicing up the cauliflower makes it delicious)* duck liver mousse with almond biscuit* pork belly grape salad (the pork belly was deep fried and heavenly)* sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta* spicy dungeness crab kimchi yuba with smoked egg (they don't numb the heat, it was actually a tongue stimulating spicy!)* eggnog ice cream sandwich (fluffy, not-too-sweet goodness)I can't wait for the next excuse to dine there again! Can I say, the 2 month wait for it to open and get our reservations in was totally worth the wait!  Had the glorious tasting menu and everything was wonderful. Although I still dream about the hamachi with seaweed cracker. Damn that was soooo gooood!!The service was great. Easy and casual, friendly and fun. We were a very happy party of six especially getting there with a line of almost 80 people waiting to get  a table. Phew!  Thank goodness for reservations!  Love love love this place! I visited SF with my fiancé on a culinary adventure and found this hidden gem that have been on our 'to dine' list. Below are the small plates we ordered. Pure goodness:*Quail w/ stewed lemon onions &      parmigiano-reggiano *Braised pork riblets in pork broth *Mendocino sea urchin, ginger & scallion pancake w/ soy-lime glazed*Duck liver mousse w/ almond biscuits *Guinea hen dumpling w/ aromatic star anise broth*Green garlic toast & burrata cheese *Oysters w/ spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesame *Eggnog ice scream sammie w/ almond macaron & cocoa-sherry coulis paired w/ a shot of 'world peace' peanut moscovado milk Just ok:*Tuna tartare w/ porcini infused cream and chips*Maine oyster w/ glazed onion strings *Roasted beets w/ special creamy sauce Super innovative cuisine. Unique eats that utilizes the dim sum concept. Everything was well balanced, from textures to spices to portions! I enjoyed the very casual/hipster ambiance. This is not a typical fine-dining experience. Photos and reviews cannot do this restaurant justice. This place does lived up to the hype & definitely one of the best in SF! Make reservation if you can. If not, expect to wait at least 1-2 hours to dine. It's worth the wait. Thank you for the scrumptious culinary experience! I highly recommend this establishment to everyone. was finally able to secure a reservation once they reopened after remodeling!the service here was wonderful! everyone was super friendly and you were able to ask anyone for help, instead of trying to wave down your one assigned person. i liked the idea of ""american dimsum"" it's always good to have a visual of what you can order. as far as the food goes, some were pretty good and some, sadly, disappointedoysters - forgot what was on top aside from sesame seed but it was too sourlobster salad - one of my favorites of the night, fresh and deliciousgrilled octopus - really liked the octopus but not a big fan of chickpeasrabbit croquettes - lots of flavor in a small little bite. just wish it was bigger or we got more thatn just one per order to be worth the $$state bird - i love quail so this dish was another one of my favorites! crispy on the outside and juicy inside, but i think $16 for two pieces is too priceyhamachi on nori chip - aside from the chip being too salty, i LOVED the hamachi and avocado moussebone marrow - i was really excited for this dish because im a big fan of bone marrow, but unfortunately the peppercorn ruined it for me and i felt like there was more toppings than the actual bone marrow itself.rabbit stew - did not like this one at all. had a weird taste to itcrispy pork belly - it wasn't really crispy but i liked how it wasn't toooooo fatty and serving it with a side of grapes was interestingly good!guinea hen dumpling - tasted like any other dumpling for me, and $3ish for ONE piece?!garlic bread with burrata - i loved the burrata but i don't think it really works with the bread and the bread itself wasn't very garlickyalmond macaron with egg nog ice cream - the almond flavor was overpowered the ice cream so it just really tasted like vanilla ice cream to me.overall it was a fun dining experience but since i only really liked about half of the things ive tried, foodwise overall was A-OK. im glad i came in with a reservation prior and did not wait hours for it. id recommend it for the novelty of it, but for me, it'll just be one-time visit. Good food, good service, good timesWas lucky enough to score a reservation for State Birds ""fairly"" easily and came with a group of 4. Tip: Ended up checking for reservations a few times a day when walking to meetings and such and was able to score one after the second or third day. Our reservation was for 5:30, right when they open, and the line was more than 25 deep by the time we arrived. We were sat promptly and greeted by the nice server. I love the dim-sum style of dining, lots of fun small plates, and you get to see them before ordering! While our dinner dates were a little less adventurous, we pushed them to try a few different things, we ended up ordering: * State Bird with provisions (menu) - crispy and tasty * Pancakes with sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta (menu) - doughy, yummy, unique * Hamachi avocado and seaweed cracker - one of my favorites of the night, fresh fish, crispy seaweed cracker and flavorful sauces* Charred octopus in tomato-chickpea broth - perfectly cooked octopus * Duck liver mousse with almond biscuits - velvety rich mousse with lightly sweetened biscuits * Dumpling with aromatic broth - dumping shot, nice and light* Garlic bread with burrata - was looking forward to this but the bread was a bit tough* Pork ribs - tender and flavorful, the guys loved these * Pork belly - crispy chunks of pork belly with jalapeños and grapes, yum* Lobster salad - fresh a light* Braised rabbit- another favorite of the night, tender pieces of rabbit cooked to perfection * Dungeness crab and faro spezzato - rich, another favorite for the guys * Tea ice cream sandwiches - unique dessert, not too sweetOur server was great, very informative, without being pretentious, and was always happy to answer our questions. While there were only a few great dishes, they were all good. Would definitely come back once the menu changes up a bit. Very interesting and fun concept of serving and entertaining of patrons.Prices were reasonable for the whole concept.For people who appreciate adventurous and diversity in a fusion of taste. Staffs were All enjoying and having fun.Owner is friendly and genuine, took time to introduce the concept and style of cuisine.The only downside is, we waited for about two hours plus, ( cause we didn't make reservations ...) Best food experience in the city, hands down! Very reasonably priced, especially for a Michelin starred restaurant! Amazingly, this place lived up to the hype. The food was so incredible I literally ate myself sick. But it was worth it. I went here last night with a friend. Starting with the hostess to our waitress, everyone was really friendly and warm. That is exactly as it should be. The decor is a little odd- like your dad's basement workshop on one side, but it was open and clean and I was there for the food and company. Had I been on a date, however, maybe I would have cared more.  Now, let's talk food. It was tasty, but it was not very exciting for me. I'm vegetarian so this reduced what I can eat, but my friend reported a similar ""ah, pretty good"" sentiment and she ate through every meat and seafood item she could. I've had a couple amazing meals recently, so I have been reminded of what truly excellent food and I had high expectations. This fell short. Finally, the dim sum style has pluses and minuses. For my friend and I it was fine, but remember it's disruptive- every few minutes someone stops by to describe dishes. If you're looking for a quiet dinner date or the ability to catch up with your friend uninterrupted, this isn't the place. I consider this to be the best food and overall restaurant in San Francisco right now. I would eat here weekly if getting a reservation wasnt impossible. The newly renovated space feels much more open and the ambiance is always lively regardless of the time or night of the week. Absolutely have to get: Pork Belly, Sturgeon Pancakes, Rabbit Croquettes, Garlic Bread with Burrata and the Spareribs. You also have to get the State Bird because it's their signature dish but I thought it was less memorable than many of the other items. For dessert I would say definitely try the ice cream sandwich and the Bao with coconut cream. Wine list is quite short so I would suggest bringing in your own bottle for a reasonable corkage of $20. Definitely lives up to the hype! Loved loved this place.My friend called in the morning and suggested we go there that night (it was Friday) She said she would get in line at 5pm. I have seen the lines forming earlier than that  - and said I would get in line at 4:30. I arrived at 4:35 and was the 5th party in line. The guy at the very front of the line got there at 4:10 pm. (when His party arrived there were like 8 of them).  At about 5:25 someone comes out and asks if anyone has a reservation they should come to the front of the line and they are seated (there were very few 5:30 reservations). At 5:30 the line was about 25 parties line by my guesstimation.  I believe the way it works is they seat as many of the line that they can, they give the rest of the people in line a TIME to come back and be seated. This is actually fair b/c I have heard that some computer geeks have rigged the reservation system and hog all the reservations (to sell them?)Our party of 3 got right in. We had a great table right by where the food comes out. I'm  the gal at the cocktail party who figures out where the food comes out and stands there for first pick!I took photos of everything we had EXCEPT the sauerkraut pancakes (which I did love)  I did not partake in the seafood options (but my friends did)  If I had to ""Sophie's choice"" it it would be the rabbit with the spetzle.  But the fried quail, and the quail dumpling were also amazing. And sadly we only had room for 1 dessert which we loved. Funny story - there was a kid (about 12 years old) in line in front of us with his Dad (Mom joined the line later). It was his 3rd time there! - they ended up at the table next to us and the kid was recommending what we should order off the regular menu. This Kid was chowing down, he ate the bone marrow, the caviar, fun kid (and I'm generally not a fan of kids AT ALL) - but this kid was so foodie-centric he won my cold bitter heart.We had one bottle of wine to split and one of us had a cocktail - we were stuffed and the bill (with tip) was about $210. Not a bad deal considering,My friend had now hired me as her ""line pimp"" for when her family is in town. I will secure a spot in line for her and they might buy me dinner. Sounds like a plan to me.As an added bonus - here is a adorable video of the owners making their favorite midnight snack at home - sauerkraut and pecorino tacos.   youtube.com/watch?v=ef7U… Delicious food but skip on the desserts. Favorites included the sourdough pancake with ricotta and pecorino and the guinea hen dumpling. The staff kept remarking that we were ordering a lot, which I guess in hindsight, yes we tried 15 dishes amongst three people, but it was our first time there and you know how hard it is to get a table here! For desserts, we had the ice cream sandwich and buckwheat bao, both were underwhelming, considering that everything else was so tasty. Would definitely like to go back to try some of the other big dishes on the menu. It's AMERICAN DIM-SUM! And is definitely a must-try.  I mean, fine-dining but dim sum style.....how intriguing is that?! Very interesting I must say.  You don't hear loud Asians screaming ""HAR GOW!! HAR GOW!!"" while pushing their carts, but rather polite Americans going to each table describing each dish that is too complex for you to even handle.  All dishes were different, delicious, and unique.  We had 10 dishes for 2 people, small plates that average to $8 a dish.  Funny how the most expensive dish ($12 dungeneous crab and farro spezzato) was the least favorite.  It was just too much butter. The best was of course, the ""CA State Bird with Provisions"" on the menu.  Breaded and fried quail, although it tasted like tasty gourmet fried chicken! Juicy, not greasy, tender, and the lemon juice made this dish perfect.My other favorite was the ""Smoked Trout, Egg, and Potato Porridge.""  Omg that blew me away! SO tasty. This is why I love fine dining - one scoop is just bursting with many different flavors that combine to make one amazing experience in your mouth.  Gosh, I want this dish again.  SUMMARY (of my opinions of course):1. CA State Bird with Provisions - 5 (menu)2. Smoked Trout, Egg, and Potato Porridge - 53. Hamachi Avocado and Seaweed Cracker - 54. Steak Tartare with Porcini Ranch - 45. Charred Octopus in tomato-chickpea salsa - 46. Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - 47. Raw Oyster with Spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesame - 4 8. Pork Spare Ribs glazed in their own juices - 3 (menu) 9. Guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth - 2 (i don't like curry :( )10. Dungeness crab and farro spezzato - 1 (too much butter) OVERALL: Other than the 2 dishes I disliked, 8/10 of them were all delicious, some even amazing where you have never had a dish like before (trout egg potato porride). 5 stars for the great service, quality of food, and unique concept of the restaurant that I am proud to say is from my home of San Francisco. Western fancy foodstuff served dim sum style. Yep, you heard me correctly. The concept of dim sum is actually a really strong one -- you are offered small portions of different dishes, freshly made from the kitchen, and if you like more of it you can always get more. It's just usually quite hard to realize for most places -- not to mention the amount of dirty dishes you'd generate ;)SBP does it by offering a couple of staples on a small menu, and have daily specials that get transported out to tables via trays or carts. There are a good number of different dishes -- it's going to be tough for 2 people to try everything in one go. Service was fantastic -- definitely the part most different from a standard dim sum experience. It was rather interesting as the restaurant feels very SF-hipster, but there was no snarky or snobby attitude at all.What we had:Hamachi with avocado puree on crispy seaweed. My absolute favourite dish of the meal.Lobster salad - meh.Oysters. Sauce was nice, but covered up taste of oyster.Roasted rabbit. Quite delicious, but rabbit was a bit tough.Beef tartare. Loved it, it wasn't very saucy or overwhelming, but felt rather light.State bird. This is one of the staples of the restaurant, always on the menu. The quail was very tender and delicious...makes me feel guilty now because I want to gobble up every quail out there.Cauliflower - decent, but could be done better.And we capped it with dessert. The desserts were so delicious they almost overshadowed the main meal. We had the peanut butter milk shots (a must-try!!), ice cream sandwiches, and one more thing that I forgot. I want to say it's an apple thing, but it is in my tummy now!I really want to come back again but reservations are hard to come by (at least they allow reservations...) Walk-ins can be a challenge if your stomach can't stand hunger for too long. I hope that I will have the chance to come here again in the near future. Since reservations are hard to get just stand in line next to the unmarked door about 4:45 and you'll have a good chance to get in. The flavors are exquisite and the variety and creativity is unique. We only had the passed around dishes and wish we had said no to a few because by the end we couldn't eat any more. Every dish was wonderful. Highly recommend. State Bird Provisions is a small Michelin-Star rated restaurant located in the North end of San Francisco. The interior of the restaurant represents a paradoxical approach to ""fine-dining"" by electing to go with plywood tables over those decorated with posh linen. Although the interior may be far from stunning, the food certainly is. Style: State Bird Provisions utilizes the dim-sum concept found in some Chinese restaurants. The menus found at every table consists of their staple items including their namesake ""CA State Bird w/ Provisions"", wines and desserts. Throughout the entirety of your meal servers will come around with different items not found on the menu. They will give you a brief explanation about the dish and then you get to decide whether to take it or not.Food: Every dish I had at State Bird was marvelous. The tastes were complex and the small serving sizes ensured that I got to try a large variety of dishes. My personal recommendation is the ""CA State Bird w/ Provisions"", it was a ""tastier fried chicken"" and everybody acknowledged that it was highly enjoyable. Overall: State Bird Provisions is a restaurant is a phenomenal restaurant with good service and fantastic taste. Although it is not the cheapest dim-sum you can get, I highly recommend this establishment to everyone. We came on a Wed night.  I waited in line starting at 5:15pm (30 minute wait), no problem getting a reservation for 7:15pm.  We were seated around 7:40pm which was no big deal since we were running 10 minutes late anyways.Service 4.5 StarsService was great.  It seems we didn't have a specific waiter for our table.  Different members of staff just came around to check-in with us.  Everyone was really nice, professional, and NO attitude.  Ambiance 4 starsNot too loud or quiet, they did a cool job of the remodeling.Food 3.5 StarsThere is a lot of hype regarding the food.  I thought the food was good, but not outstanding.  Everything was perfectly cooked... nothing too dry, overcooked, undercooked etc.  The memorable dishes of our dinner were the Himachi with avocado on a Sesame cracker, the quail egg with halibut, and the grilled octopus (and I don't really like octopus).  All well cooked, great flavors.  I did think the sesame cracker was a bit too thick and crunchy for a delicate topping as Himachi.  I liked the State Bird Provisions (fried quail) as it was perfectly cooked... crisp breading and moist and juicy on inside.I didn't care for the cauliflower dish that much.  The pork spareribs were also perfectly cooked (tender), not that meaty of a cut though seasoned well.  Would not get this again, simply because there was nothing unique to them and I could cook this at home.For dessert, I had the green tea ice cream sandwiches half size.  The dough was a french style macaroon.  Good.Concept 4 StarsDim Sum style serving (they come around with carts and there is also a menu). Gives you a chance to try lots of different dished without spending $30-35/plate on a dish that you may or may not like.  Great concept.Price 4 StarsI thought prices were reasonable for this type of dining experience.  It would be one of the main reasons I wouldn't mind going again for dinner.  Our bill was $100 for 2 people with 1 glass of wine, probably $120 if my guest was drinking that night.  Not bad.  We left full enough and not overly stuff with about 8-9 dishes. This place is AWESOME! I was lucky enough to score reservations. Right from the start we were greeted by the super friendly team of hosts. Drinks were offered which made up for the small waiting area. As soon as we were sat our server gave us the spiel on how the ordering process goes. Basically, the dim sum style dishes are rotated around you 'till you tap out. Every dish had such great flavor. Dessert was good.  A friend suggested the granita dessert and it was a hit.  Everything was great! Listen to the hype and get here if you can. This place is amazing and one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. The reservations here are ridiculous. SBP closed for a few months and when the reservations reopened I tried for an hour to get one. It was worth it. I will say that I went on a Monday night. At 5pm (they open at 5:30) there was a line of 20 people without reservations. By the time I left all of the people had been seated. I'm sure the wait is ridiculous on the weekend, but during the week, it's not a bad deal.The interior is quirky. The servers are playful. The food is amazing.First, there is a menu that you can order from. They have pancakes and main dishes. You can order these at any time and are meant to share. The real spectacular part is that servers walk around with food dim sum style. Things I've had here:- Salmon Tartare- Duck mousse and almond biscuits- Ravioli soup thing- ""Buffalo"" cauliflower- Quinoa salad- Oysters (best I've ever had, hands down)- Rabbit and spaetzel- Rabbit and fontina croquettes- Steak tartare and homemade potato chips- Garlic Bread with burrataThe only thing that I didn't love was the garlic bread. It was just ok.I am going back in a couple of weeks and I can't wait. It's simple. Come here and form your own happy memories of playful yummy tummy rubbing goodness because I'm hoarding my own drooly memories for myself (luckily State Bird Provisions encourages sharing at the dinner table--my friend and I have known each other since 2nd grade but if fancy food was a prison situation, we probably would have shivved each other w our forks to get some).Note to slackers who don't make reservations: it's worth standing in line for 1.5 hours for first seating. Second note to slackers who don't make reservations: flirting w the prep cooks at the window may not score you first seating but you should do it anyway. Laughing cooks put smiles in food.... Worked for us! AMAZING is all I have to say!  Came here for my mom's birthday and there were 6 of us. Since larger parties are required to dine off a set menu, we let the restaurant put together their favorites. 18 courses to be exact, and each one was out of this world! Normally if you were to come here on a date or with a couple friends, everything is served dim sum style. The carts go around, you peek at things you like and order as you go! The service was great, ambiance is very cool/hip and they play awesome top 40 and rap at a considerable volume, so its a super fun place to go if you like that kind of scene. Highly recommend trying this spot out, if you haven't already! I'm on a roll of reviewing today so was thinking what else I should review, and State Bird popped to my head as the best meal I've had all year (and let me tell you - I've been doing a lot of eating....).  Not only is the food excellent, but the style of service makes it almost more of an event as well.  We eat - and we eat a lot - and we ate almost everything that was offered to us. And it was all good.  This is a place I've already recommended to a number of people, and would happily return to whenever I have the chance.  I've eaten at a number of other of the 'top' restaurants and have had very good meals there, but I still would not look forward to going back to any of them as much as I would State Bird. I first heard about State Bird Provisions more than a year ago from a gay couple at the community table at NOPA. Since then, it had been on my list of places to eat at. Since it has been getting a lot of hype lately, especially with that James Beard award, I finally made an effort to check the place out. Reservations are usually booked 2 months out so if you want to eat here, you're going to have to come before opening (5:30PM) and get in line. This is the idea I had, so I arrived at 5:00PM to get in line hoping to get in the first seating of the first-come-first-served countertop. We were served hot cocoa in line--awesome. We, however, didn't make the first seating. It looks like you have to come at like 4:00PM to be a part of the first seating if you didn't want to be on a wait list. They do the thing where they take down your name, phone number, and give you an approximate time to return so you can go do other things while you wait. I always appreciate that. We were given 7:15PM so we went to a couple bars to kill time.I had no expectations and just wanted a quality meal. It was explained to us that food comes out dim sum style and they mark the paper menu they give you for things you accept (just like at a dim sum restaurant). My first thought was that it was ingenious to apply dim sum style of eating to quality American food. I don't know any other American place that does it.I wish I could remember everything I had (8-9 dishes). Everything was amazingly amazing. After a few dishes in, I decided that it was the best meal I've ever had in my entire life and it reminded me that truly good food can put you into a genuinely happier mood. You must absolutely get the friend quail and the egg nog ice cream sandwich.Should you come here? No doubt--the whole concept and the quality of the food here will blow your mind. I am extremely happy that I was able to experience SBP and they very much deserve that Michelin star. The price point is very fair. My friend and I paid about $60 each for ~12 dishes and a few of drinks. The service is impeccable.This is the place to be for quality food and a novel experience. This the shiniest gem in San Francisco, CA right now. I rarely give 5 stars, but this place commands 5+ stars. Oh my goodness! This place is absolutely amazing! It's entertaining/fun, refined, and  delicious, all at the same time! Everything was perfect with this restaurant. The service, environment, and food was excellent. If you're planning on coming here without a reservation, make sure you arrive at least an hour and a half before dinner service to wait in line. Otherwise, it will be an even longer wait! My boyfriend and I came here without a reservation and got in line around 4pm (they open at 5:30pm) and there were already about 15 people in line. When they opened for dinner service, we were seated immediately. The wait wasn't bad at all especially because the State Bird Provisions people prepared spiced hot cocoa for everyone waiting in line! That was a very sweet gesture! When we were seated the waitress enthusiastically explained the restaurant's way of serving food. Food is served dim-sum style; there's about a dozen different small-portioned dishes (tapas) that are served from a cart that get's pushed around the restaurant. The servers describe the dish and when you see/hear something you like, you notify the server pushing the cart and they serve it to you and mark your bill to keep track of your orders. In addition to dishes that are served in the carts, there is also a menu with more dishes you could order from. I tried:Oyster topped with togarashi and toasted sesame - $3 eachThe raw oyster was clean, fresh, and naturally sweet. It was delicious!Rabbit fontina croquette - $2 eachI never had rabbit before this. It was interesting and pretty good, the meat it a bit tougher than chicken and it tasted a lot like carnitas (pork). Mendocino sea urchin, ginger scallion pancake with soy lime glaze - $14This dish was savory and filling. The savory pancake is sprinkled with baby greens and the soy lime glaze and topped with sweet sea urchin. I really liked this dish because sea urchin is one of my favorite things. This had a very asian fusion feel to it. It's worth getting because it can fill you up. All the dishes are very small, so you have to order quite a lot to get full and this can add up pretty quickly.CA state bird with provisions (half order) - $8This is deep fried quail topped with parmesan on a bed of cooked onions. The breading for the quail was flavorful and the quail itself was moist and very good. This dish was highly recommended by our server.Guinea hen dumpling in aromatic broth - $3 each dumplingThis was probably my favorite! The broth was incredibly flavorful and the dumpling was so so yummy. Must try this!Grilled beef with maitake with bok choy - $18My boyfriend ordered this dish because it was one of the few non-seafood options they had. He loved it. The beef was well-seasoned and tender and the grilled mushrooms were incredible. This dish was a little pricey for the amount of food, but it was worth getting.Hamachi, avocado, on toasted nori - $9There were cubes of raw hamashi and avocado on a piece of toasted nori. The nori was more like a nori chip, it was thick and very crunchy. The sauce, hamachi, avocado, and nori (seaweed) all went well together. This was probably my second favorite dish!Dessert - Spiced pomegranate granita (shaved ice), lemongrass tapioca, and persimmons (half portion) - $ 4You can ask for half portions for desserts! That way you could try different desserts! This dessert was interesting, the granita was very strong with a pomegranate and plum taste. It was like nothing I have ever tasted in a good way. All the flavors from all the ingredients used in the dessert had an interesting taste. If you're feeling adventurous, try this dessert!Dessert - Bittersweet chocolate ganache tart, brown sugar-oat crust, and olive oil (half portion) - $4This was our favorite dessert. The chocolate and tart crust was not at all overpoweringly sweet (which we liked a lot). The chocolate ganache was a little bitter and had the right amount of sweetness. It also came with sunflower whipped cream! That also very delicious. This was a great end to a great meal!! FYI: Most of the options here were seafood options - most of the dishes being served on the dim-sum style carts were seafood. And there were a few non-seafood options they had were on their menu. The restaurant environment was very refined and also very youthful, hip, and trendy.  The food is plated with finesse and everything looked sophisticated and well-thought out. All the servers and chefs were great! They were super friendly and informative, and really wanted to make everyone's experience there amazing. My boyfriend and I loved our experience here! It's one of the best dining experiences I've had.I highly recommend this restaurant! :D Words can not express my after glow two days later after getting to eat here. We (party of 3) had no reservation. Walked in at 630 on a Wednesday, was quoted a time for 915.. We came back at 10 literally as they were closing. We got it!!Absolutely perfection. They even had  Alagash beer on tap! Everything here was/is exquisite.  The service was unsurpassed of exceptional quality.Do not miss this place. Go when ever you have a chance. I lived vicariously through the window. Judging by peoples faces, I'm sure it was amazing I didn't expect to go here this soon - the famous difficulty of getting a table put me off from trying this place. This place is obviously underpriced relative to the demand, and as long as SBP doesn't raise prices this means customers end up paying with their time (lining up at 5pm, staying up until 4am to try to get the reservation) in attempts to capture the excess consumer surplus. This isn't a game I like playing.But as four of us were leaving a concert at the Fillmore around 10:30pm my buddy's girlfriend dropped in to see if they had room for a table of 4. They did and we decided this was a better alternative than late night korean.They were closing soon so we didn't get the full psuedo-dim sum experience (We could order off of the menu but there were less dishes being moved around the restaurant). But the dishes they did come around with were all quite good.  In fact, if you are eating here I highly recommend making a meal of the appetizers. We tried about half of the dishes and none of the appetizers disappointed (except for the person who was here before who said that now the garlic bread and burrata is smaller than it used to be) and most were quite good. The hen dumpling soup was amazing as was the duck liver mousse.The main dishes were slightly less impressive. When we ordered the smoke sturgeon everything pancake we imagined some sort of awesome twist on okonomiyaki. What it was ended up being basically a very thick pancake with some fish and greens on top.  The state bird wasn't bad but it wasn't that amazing either - it was just fried and almost anything fried can taste good. No one really disliked the cast iron quail egg dish, but no one really liked it either.Dessert was a step up from the main courses - the peanut muscovado milk shot was very interesting and the oolong tea sandwich came in 4 pieces which made it really easy to split between four people.The service was great the whole way through even though we were among the last people in the restaurant.  I'll probably be back, but it's not quite worth giving up my mid afternoon/evening to try to show up at the restaurant and get seated when they have room. 4.5 stars. SBP has been on my radar for a long time, but I could never manage to snag a reservation.  Granted I didn't try very hard (not waiting by the computer at 4AM), so it was very fortunate that LR generously donated her reservation to J & me this past weekend (relax people, she changed plans and went out of town).  AMBIANCE: So popular/awesome that there are absolutely NO signs for this restaurant outside!  Too cool for school.  The space is on the small side, covered with pegboard, and is on the casual side-- I definitely felt overdressed in my dress/heels.  Tables are well spaced, and there are a fair number of larger tables for groups.  Lighting is on the dimmer side, but it adds to the laid back, relaxed vibe.SERVICE: Very friendly.  Its all hands on deck, especially with since several servers are circulating the floor carry trays or pushing carts full of goodies dim sum style.  Our main server (Melissa?  Sorry, I didn't quite catch her name) was awesome.  Just the right amount of camaraderie with diners while still maintaining professionalism.* side note: despite having a reservation, we ended up having to wait around 10-15min for our table... which was slightly annoying.FOOD: Don't feel obligated to read all my descriptions below.  The cliff notes version: everything was delicious.  Flavors ranged from delicate and subtle to bold and in your face.  My #1 advice to first time diners?  SLOW PLAY IT.  J and I went all savage and ordered everything in sight within 5min of sitting down haha (we finished our meal in a little over an hr).  Next time I will go slow and savor everything. - Dungeness crab with quinoa (?) porridge: so light, delicate and delicious!  A close second fave dish of the night.- Smoked salmon/trout: Possibly my favorite of the night.  The smokiness from the fish was the dominant flavor of the dish, but the potatoes (? something slightly mushy/creamy in texture) and other components of the dish were the perfect supporting players.  Despite the bold savory flavors, this dish still came off as light and delicate.- Garlic bread with burrata: fluffy, decadent burrata floated like clouds above a rich garlic bread twist.  Best eaten/devoured immediately upon ordering-- this dish only gets heavier as it cools down.- Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit: probably my least favorite dish of the night, not b/c of the flavor profile, but because of the combination of textures.  I was expecting a crunchy almond biscuit, so the small ""almond"" cakes (couldn't detect any almond flavor) just didn't do it for me. - State bird w/ provisions (whole $16): J loved this dish.  Perfectly fried (not at all greasy), fabulously tender and juicy... MMM.  The lemon onions were a perfect pairing for the quail. - Cauliflower ($14): such an interesting dish.  Our server described it as ""cauliflower buffalo wing style"" and that's exactly what it was.  I wish this dish came in half portion because the full serving was a bit much for two people.  - Trout (half $11): so tender and light.  I really liked the combination of flavors and textures-- the toasted hazelnuts provided a welcome contrasting crunch to the perfectly cooked fish.- Charred baby octopus: I really liked this dish, but it was one of the worst for J because it was too salty (the tentacles; the body had more meat and was perfectly seasoned).  The octopus was quite tender, and had just the right amount of chew for me. - Yuba noodles with kimchi: this was another letdown for me, though I can't decide if its because I was pretty full by the time we ordered this, or because I was expecting a cold dish.  We ended up taking the leftovers home, and I was right, it does taste better cold.- Peanut milk ($2/shot): smooth peanutty goodness.  I wouldn't go out of my way to order this, though I'm glad we tried it. - Oolong ice cream sandwich ($8): MMM such delicious, delicate flavors.  The pepitas macarons used in the sandwich were a touch too chewy/stick, but I loved the flavor combination.  The smear of apricot jam was such a bright, bold punchy addition that J loved, but I found to be overpowering when eaten with the other components of the dessert (it was really good on its own though).  OVERALL: Definitely lived up to the hype.  This was probably one of the best dining experiences J & I have had in SF in a loooong time.  Portions are perfect for 4-- enough to give everyone a satisfying taste of the dish while allowing for the group to order many dishes to try everything.  J & I also thought that pricing was super reasonable, especially given the portion size (we expected bite sized bits that would be difficult to share).  Total damage for everything listed above plus a glass of viognier was around $150 (including tax+tip).  We would've been satisfied (and full) with half of what we ordered, and $40/person for top notch quality dinner in SF seems like a steal to me.  Totally staying/waking up early to make reservations for my next visit. 1st attempt, came in with my friend at 6pm on a weekday after work and was told we can get seated 3 hours later. But we were hungry and tired so passed. 2nd attempt, no dice of getting seats. 3rd attempt, we wanted to eat here no matter what. So came here on the busiest night Saturday. Walked in around opening time and they got us squeezed us at the end of the night. Decided to go hang and eat some snacks until then.After all that effort and wait, we told ourselves that this better be worth it and had high expectations.The first thing that came to us was the Corn & Quinoa (tabouleh). And after that first bite, MINDS WERE BLOWN. The Corn & Quinoa was just fresh and delightful. All the flavors/ ingredients just mixed well, and it was something I could eat all day.Then we decided to try almost every dim sum style provision that was carted to us.What's worth getting:- Tabouleh!!!!- Any of the pancakes especially the smoked sturgeon.- spicy kimchi yuba- smoked trout- BURRATA!!!- BBQ RABBIT- state bird- pork spare ribs- grilled beef- the ice cream sandwichOther things were good, but not memorable. I would skip the dumpling and anything raw fish. Those dishes were okay, but not worth picking up. Due to a birthday blip mix-up, my bff gave up her reservation rights to State Bird to me.  Her attempt at getting these reservations was no easy task either, she said it was like going to the race tracks and making bets on who the lucky horse will be.  Her wild ride gave her reservations at the earliest timeframe of 9pm on a Saturday evening.  This is considered lucky, as I read other Yelpers ride into eating here was absolutely ridiculous!My first attempt of dining here was a weee bit over 150 days ago.  We tried to do a walk-in but just couldn't wait until 10:30pm to eat dinner.  And throughout those 150 days,  I checked their online reservation page but it was always booked.  Booked booked booked!!  So finally, my long awaited wish came true via my BFF ( thanks girlfriend!)... I was finally dining at State Bird... the #1 most popular restaurant in the nation.  And also...my first Michelin Star dining experience to boot.What a great dining experience it was!  EXPERIENCE is the key word.  Everything I tasted was brand new New NEW!!!I'VE NEVER HAD and ORDERED:! State Bird Buttermilk quail - signature dish and MUST TRY DISH!!!!!!!  MUST MUST TRY IT!!! 5 stars! Grilled beef shank with mushrooms, bok choy, and mixed greens. 4 starsDISHES THAT CAME OUT OF THE KITCHEN (dim sum style):! Deep fried seaweed with raw cubed hamachi and tuna with Hershey kissed shaped avocados and fresh slice radishes. 5 stars! Raw oysters with sausakraut and sarachi sauce. 5 stars! Rabbit with cheese fried dough balls 4.5 stars! Lobster with salad - there was an herb flavor that didn't suit my buds. 3 Stars! Beef tartare with nacho cheese and potatoe chips - who could resist potatoe chips, right?!  Loved the chips and beef tartare... However, the nacho cheese cheapened the taste for me, it was too much like those big ol' cans of cheese from the ballpark. 3 StarsThe decor was peg board chic with an open kitchen concept.  It is casual dining with a very expensive price tag.  We ended up spending $100 for 2 persons and this didn't include any alcoholic beverages.  My date actually ate noodles before coming out to eat here, it's a good thing he did, otherwise, we could had easily hit $200 bucks here.  Yowza!!The service was friendly and impeccable.  Our waitress came by after our meal was over and asked how we liked it.  It was fun dining here and trying flavors that were new to us.  We told her we'd like to come back but reservations are so hard to get.  She told us that their online reservations opens at 4am and to check at that time.  I was like, really?!  And she even let us know that the owner caught others trying to SELL their reservations on Craigslist... That is bananas!!  High demands can lead to these types of scandalous ideas.  So funny too!Anyway, this is off my bucket list now.  I hope I get to come back again someday... My hubs and I are in love with this place. He says it's the best meal he has ever had. We couldn't get a reservation so we walked in at 6pm. The extremely sweet and patient hostess told us we would have a table about 9:30pm. We expected this so no hard feelings and we took a walk around town and visited a piano bar nearby. We returned at 9:30pm and had to wait an hour longer for a table. The hostess was extremely apologetic and we were offered duck liver mousse with almond biscuit and sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancake. Both were delicious and we were very pleasantly shocked to enjoy duck liver! Once we were seated service was efficient. We ordered the garlic bread with burrata (absolutely delicious and addictive soft pastry garlic bread and both dense and light as air cheese) BBQ rabbit & spaetzle (deliciously bbq'd great balance of flavor), CA state bird with provisions (perfectly lightly breaded/fried tender quail) roasted bone marrow with chanterelles & pink peppercorn (melts in your mouth). For dessert caramel nut tart, poppy seed crust, pears, whipped ricotta (rich, sweet, but not overly so) and the delicious and oddly refreshing world peace' peanut muscovado milk. The prices are surprisingly moderate for such imaginative and high quality ingredients. If we lived in San Fran we would Definitely be back many many times!!! State BIrd is just plain awesome.  From the vibe, ambiance, style and quality of the food, everything was great.  I'm not sure if this is the type of place where you're suppose to leave super full but I sure did.  Unable to resist and deny any plates that came around, I'm pretty sure I tasted everything that was available that night. I highly recommend everyone to try this place out. ""Some people deserve to have their faith rewarded.""I was a bit nervous going into State Bird Provisions for a friend's birthday. I knew it would be a long wait, if we got in at all. The recent Michelin star gave this place a certain amount of cache with the foodie crowd in town, and they had come out in droves. I showed up at 6:15pm on Tuesday to put my name in, and we were told they had an opening at 8:30pm. Given the fact that their reservation list was packed for over a month when I inquired, that was better news than I expected. We grabbed wine at Dosa before eventually getting in. SBP is split into two zones, tables for the larger groups, and counter seating for the pairs. We had the counter, right at the entrance to the kitchen. From the counter, you can drool all over everything being made, but we had one distinct advantage. Every dish that was brought out was presented to us first. Yes, this made our bill skyrocket, but it was all so amazingly good. We had the state bird (quail), pork belly, the ahi/wasabi, oysters, and a whole a lot more. Between that and their excellent wine selections, we rolled ourselves out stuffed after a great evenings.Two shout-outs to the team. 1) Katherine from their reservations desk was incredibly responsive, even though I'm sure she's being deluged with last-minute requests from jerks like me to get a table. I'm sure her job involves having to say 'no' a lot, but she was great about encouraging me to come down on a weeknight and try my luck. 2) Melody was hosting that evening, which meant running defense from the 'Do you know who I am?' crowd that kept trying to muscle their way in, and she handled herself with far more grace than I would have. No matter how frantic the greeting area was, she was a constant ball of sunshine.We had an excellent evening at State Bird Provisions, and I hope you do too! I was able to snag an online reservation on the day that the system re-opened. It was no easy feat but I booked a dinner reservation for 3 weeks later. I sure counted the days until the reservation. Since it was for a very late dinner on a weekday, we easily found parking in the area. We got to the restaurant several minutes before our reservation time and miraculously got seated right away.The food is fun, fresh and flavorful, and it's really the experience I think that makes State Bird Provisions so special. The kitchen is open and centralized at the front, and the ambiance is very relaxed but the excitement stems from what dishes will come around on the cart or on the various trays. Order a couple of ""commandables"" = items from the set menu, but as one of the wait staff put it, ""just see what happens"" = play it by ear and order from the cart or trays. During our visit, the cart rolled around with primarily seafood dishes. Also, we found that although there were particular items that we wanted to try that we didn't see on the set menu, it was no prob to order them from any of the wait staff.  We tried a number dishes but the flavors and textures of the following 3 were the best for me: ***hamachi-avocado & seaweed cracker ***CA state bird with provisions***chocolate mint 'ice cream' sandwich, plum jam, walnutsDon't forget to save room for dessert! I had to order a shot of the 'world peace' peanut muscovado milk which was very delicious and to my surprise, tasted like Choc Nut (a filipino chocolate).On top of the amazing food, service was exceptional. This was a once in a lifetime experience. The stress of getting the reservation was well worth it. What innovative foods and fabulous flavors. The service was outstanding. Best ice cream sandwhich I have ever had The first day the opened the reservation like after being closed for a while was crazy.  I had two phone and two computer screens and after about an hour of constantly refreshing and dialing again, I got through and made a reservation for whatever they had.  Which happened to be Halloween.  I'll take it!I loved the whole concept, casual atmosphere and dim sum like carts rolling around with tasty treats, in addition to the larger items on the menu.  I really like being able to share and brought 3 girlfriends with me.  This is the kind of place where you benefit from coming with more people.  The more people you have at your table, the more items you can order and try.  Although since the portions are small, you sometimes have to order two of something, in our case that was the PORK BELLY.  It was so delicious I almost ordered it a third time as dessert, but I thought my friends would kill me.Some items that stood out in addition to the yummy yet not so meaty state bird (quail), were the dumplings in brother, the aforementioned pork belly, the beef tartare, the hamachi avocado seaweed cracker, the oysters, the egg on top of the trout and that chocolate crisp dessert, did I mention THE PORK BELLY?It is such a production to get in, and yes, the service is friendly and upbeat, and the food does not disappoint but it certainly doesn't make you want to necessarily make you want to run back.I am just happy I was able to experience it once.  When the coast clears up a little, I'll try coming in again. This was my first visit back since the renovations and revamping.  It's actually not that obviously different from before, but they did expand it a bit.  It still has a nice intimate feel but seems a bit less crowded, and they can accommodate some bigger parties now (but 5 is kind of the max at a regular table, and that's squeezing it in on the bench).They're still wine/beer only, no liquor.  Servers are very friendly and enthusiastic about the food.  We got 2 bottles of whites, both in the $45-65 range. Onto food.  It's the same as before where you can order pancakes and some more substantial dishes off the menu, and there are around 10-12 dishes brought around dim sum style (prices listed), which you can add on.  We did pretty well for 5 girls!- Smoke sturgeon pancake: a thicker pancake, lots of sturgeon (definitely smoky), like the beet accompaniment which added sweetness and a beautiful color- Uni pancake: a more traditional flat pancake topped with a generous amount of uni- Quail eggs: served sunny side up with cheese, topped with sun choke chips.  I'm a huge fan of runny yolks, which are hard to do when the eggs are so small, but they did a reasonable job- Salmon tartare: I liked the cucumber underneath, but it was a bit fishy for me- Lobster ""salsa"" salad: lots of chunks of fresh lobster!  But I could have done without the mayo.  Lobster was fresh, though- Crispy pork belly with grapes: one of the favorites of the night. It's exactly as it sounds - crisped pork belly, and the grapes soak up all the pork fat goodness and balance the heaviness- Hamachi on a nori cracker: fun to break up the large crisped nori, hamachi was fresh- Fried green tomatoes: I liked the shisitos and other peppers, slightly tart- Oysters: with a house togarashi on top, which I liked - Charred baby octopus: good charred flavor, plump octopus, with a good bean and tomato base- Chanterelle, persimmon, quinoa tabouleh: The quinoa was crisp and added texture, but I would have preferred more chantarelles.  The pumpkin goat cheese was a nice touch.- State bird: fried quail, good flavor, slightly acidic sauce- Bone marrow: the mushrooms got pretty heavy thanks to the marrow, and it's on the larger side as far as bone marrow portions go... bread helps- Dumplings with maitake mushrooms and broth: the broth had a light lemongrass scent and was very fragrant, and the dumpling was pretty meaty considering it was just mushroomDesserts: - Apple granita with fennel and persimmon: parts of it were light, but it was a bit heavy on the fennel, and I'm not sure the persimmon matched it- Ice cream sandwich: good for sharing, just the right proportions of ice cream and cookieOverall, it was a fun meal, and it's always great to be able to see/smell/hear about the dishes (and know the prices) as they come by before choosing them.  They have a wide variety to fit each person's preferences, so I definitely had my favorites (burrata, dumplings, sturgeon pancake, state bird).  I'm glad they're finally back open and that I was able to snatch a reservation on the first day they opened the site back up (despite urban spoon crashing for over 45 minutes..). State Bird is definitely the new it spot for SF foodies given how difficult it is to make a reservation or get in.  My friends and I planned to have a grandma dinner by going at 5 PM to be there right when they open, but lo and behold there was a long line that started at 4.  We ended up getting seated at 10:15 PM (they'll take 1-2 phone numbers & call you back), so make sure you're prepared to roam around the city, eat some crepes, or watch a movie (or 2) during the long wait to work up your appetite.  My favorites were the garlic bread burrata and the seawood cracker w/ sashimi.  I really liked the idea of American style ""dim sum"" and being able to see the dishes before I order, but trying 12-15 dishes and only being fascinated by 2 was not an impressive record.  I think it's a fun place to go & ideal for a group of 4 so you get to try the maximum number of dishes.  I would give it another chance since the menu items change and its very affordable for a michelin star restaurant Best meal I've ever had. From the amazingly friendly and efficient staff (including chefs, cooks, wait staff, and managers all of whom stopped to chat) to the unbelievable food. We had some of almost every dim sum-style dish, each one meticulously crafted. Will go back as soon as I can get in again. We had been here before and since there was so much hype we expected a lot and were a bit disappointed. Today, after months we came back. I have to say this was by far the best meal I've had, in every aspect.The chefs make very complex foods taste very simple, and make heavy flavors balance into several layers of palate sensations. Mr Brioza and his whole team are extremely talented and have made the most balanced and complete place i have ever set foot on. The pork belly was the best flavor my mouth has had. The texture, the sensation as I was chewing, the aroma of the vietnamese sauce, the perfectly measured spice of the jalapenos, the freshness of the mint. This is absolutely INCREDIBLE. I have no words to describe how pleased I was to come back and find such a delightful experience. THANK YOU STATE BIRD. KUDOS. I went to State Bird yesterday fully expecting to be underwhelmed. I had, after all, done my research, and everyone said the place was overhyped.I thoroughly disagree. I had a fantastic time, and I highly recommend this spot to serious diners in SF.To get the awkward part out of the way: yes, there is a wait, and yes, it's absurd. There is, however, a way to beat it. Come in early (~5.30pm) on a Mon-Wed, get your name down, and spend time at Dosa's bar or the Wine Jug with some cocktails. We waited about an hour. Next, the service. I was expecting the staff's pretentiousness to match the restaurant's hype. This was absolutely not the case. Everyone was super friendly and accommodating, including the head chef, who was so wonderful (I'd come back just to say hi to him!)Finally, the food. As you've probably gleaned from your Yelp research thus far, it is all dim sum style, but they do have a menu too. We mostly stuck with dim sum because we were too full to order off the menu after a few small plates. My reccos:Hamachi-avocado & seaweed cracker - SOOOO GOOD! Don't do yourself an injustice....eat the cracker WITH the hamachi, it's amazing!Buratta garlic bread - UNBELIEVABLE. It was more pastry and less bread. Forget your guilt. It's worth orderingOctopus - one of the best octopus dishes I've had. It was a charred octopus with some sort of chikpea salsa and simply phenomenalEgg white kimchi - what a novel dish! it's veggie-friendly and had a wonderful texture while still maintaining the authentic kimchi tasteOysters with spicy kohlrabi kraut - YUM.Quinoa - I LOVE quinoa so I liked this dish, but it wasn't anything crazy. Good texture - soft and crispy, but again, nothing wow-worthyRibs - the only thing we ordered off the menu, and though I don't eat ribs, these were apparently good, but nothing great. Yes, it's embarrassing that we didn't order the state bird. Apparently, it's epic. Order that.Finally: THE DESSERT. We had a lovely chocolate macaron ice cream sandwich with a pecan streusel. The chef was nice enough to give us peanut muscovado milk on the house with this....and the combination of the two was sinful, amazing, and heavenly. MUST ORDER. Textural synergy.Dish after delicious dish, I couldn't help but notice a mastery of this concept and really...it wasn't until near the end of me and my brother's epic meal that the term dawned on me.Having just finished renovations to expand the main dining area, I immediately fell head over heels for the eclectic layout of a space that vaguely resembles a child's wood shop...in the best way possible.  Tables and booths were both surprisingly spacious and there was nary a sense of confinement even with the servers constantly roaming the walkways.  Speaking of which, these staff members provided some of the most jovial and enthusiastic service I've ever experienced.  These folks presented their dishes with such passion that one would almost think they cooked it themselves.While I quickly realized that it was folly to make note of the ingredients in the fourteen ""provisions"" we ordered, every single one had a tasty combination of flavors and textures to offer.  But who says I can't try?  Roasted nori with hamachi, salmon tartare, steak tartare with potato chips, oysters and chilled crab all contributed to a crunchy and refreshing start to the meal.  Moving towards fried fare, duck and cheese croquettes exploded with savory, fatty goodness.  Likewise, lightly crisped pork belly killed it with its lipid-laden glory and...wait for it...grapes, basil leaves and red chili peppers.  In fact, I'd even recommend eating just those latter ingredients for a clean, slightly herbacious and sweet bite with a hit of capsaicin on the finish!Those pancakes.  Holy hell.  Leave it to Chefs Brioza and Krasinski to serve Mendocino sea urchin atop a wonderfully pillowy ginger-scallion pancake.  Then came the smoked sturgeon atop what appeared to be a rice pancake adorned with every ancient grain imaginable.  Crazy delicious especially when eaten with the accompanying jam and cheese spread.From the ""commandables"", everything will be hella (yup) delicious if the cast iron quail eggs and roasted bone marrow were even remotely accurate representations of the quality and ingenuity.  Each bite of the eggs was as if I was munching on delicately soft white and yolk...laid in a garden...with an apple that dropped from a tree.  Never would have thought that each of ingredients would contrast yet simultaneously harmonize so well together.  As for the fatty globs of undifferentiated cells, they erupted with an other worldly richness of umami and earth that was simply astounding.  Combine this with the superlative bread that achieved toasty yet spongy equilibrium and you have the best marrow ever.And finally, the sweets.  ""You're crazy if you don't try the birdseed,"" said one of the servers.  No joke, son!  My brother ordered seconds of this on his previous visit and for good reason: the caramel cloud (of the heavens) cream provided a nearly unparalleled softness that held in the chocolate crunch's full caramel, hazelnut and pecan flavors so that they could all blanket the palate at once towards each spoonful's finish.  The apple & vanilla granita, coconut-carrot cake and hefty chocolate macaron 'ice cream' sandwiches all offered uniquely tasty forms of sweetness as well.  I especially enjoyed the granita's exceptionally cool and refreshing flavors while the sandwiches' accompanying yogurt spread contrasted perfectly with the chocolate's richness.By the end, this effectively 22-course behemoth of a meal left me with the undoubted conclusion that State Bird has taken over as my #1 restaurant to date.  It was an absolute joy to experience such creative and exceptionally well-executed cuisine that incorporated both traditional structuring and influences from Chinese dim sum in a playful, inviting atmosphere full of great minds and personalities. Yes there is a 2.5 hour wait, yes the food is really that yummy. I thought I would never get into this place after hearing about it for so long. Yesterday was the night I decided to try to get into the place and succeeded! I went at 6pm put my name down then went home and hung out until 8:30 when my table was ready, uh yeah crazy...But it was an amazing, fun experience cuss we got the best seats in the house! Right next to the chef all night and right in front of all the food being made and first to see what was leaving the kitchen. They serve their food dim sum style which was fun. You need to go in knowing you will be spending a crap load of money and just enjoy it. It's so hard to say no when it looks so good my eyes won over my full stomach. Ok best dishes for me, beef tar tar, the state bird of course, garlic bread with barata, we had two!, and the crunchy bird seeds chocolate cloud dessert, my friend's eyes closed while eating it. Everything was good but if I were to pass on something next time, the lobster is just ok, the fried green tomatoes itself was good but I just am not a fan of the peppers around it...Service was beyond what you will expect. I think I had five people attending to us, that included the chef, manager, and a cook, where would you get service like that?..I hope I will be lucky enough to sit at the kitchen counter next to Chef again, it was fun. Went there recently and loved that 40 percent of their restaurant is avail for walk ins NOW!  I was really turned off by their reservation system last year but the walk in system is pretty easy now.  I think everything was good but not something I had to have again.  All in all it was a good experience.  Would I come again? Yes.  Would I wait in line for 2 hours no! State Bird ProvisionsDon't even bother.POSCan't believe they got one star.Crappy wannabe food with no substance, loud loud interior, we were sitting next to PEGBOARD. Yes, the entire interior decor is PEGBOARD.Wow, we'll spend $50 on the walls but charge you $300 for the food, WTF?They serve things in a tapas meets american meets dim sum way, with carts being pushed around with the prices of the American dim sum displayed prominently, but they PUSH them on you to jack up your bill like no place I've ever been to.The waiter was obsequious, and obviously just trying to get money. There were many people waiting for a table, every host(ess) was polite, but fakely.I wouldn't go back there even if somebody else were paying.It was beyond bad. We had almost everything they made, and there was not even ONE DISH that spoke to us, and there were four of us, it's not just me.The ""ribs"" were Asian Fusion, no smoke, just an Asian style sauce, the meat was tender but no flavor. What's the point? I'd rather have gone to Gorilla.The lobster salad was OK, but no flavor, the tuna tartar the same, the quinoa so bland I couldn't eat it, the smoked duck had never seen a pack of cigarettes in its life, one of the desserts was completely inedible, we had them take it off the bill, it was texturally disgusting and bland. Imagine completely flavorless sorbet with jicama shavings. Bland bland bland, flavorless.Did I mention the word bland before?I have no clue why anyone would want to eat there, and I don't say that about many high-end restaurants. Gary Danko or Quince is 1000x better.Summation: They're experimenting with ""daring"" food presented in a ""daring"" way and you're the test subject.No thanks, I literally would rather have eaten at Burger King.PS: And did I mention the new location is in the SF black ghetto? Lovely. Paying mucho money to have to walk past the projects and worry about getting jacked.I have no idea what the owners were thinking about the food or the location. The hottest restaurant in the city????? Not so hot...........All that hype..... Hard to get in and make reservations....... Need 60 days in advance to get one..... Ehhhhhh...... Really????? Why?????  (After eating here)Everything we ordered was good but not exceptionally good that would make me come back for more.  We ordered about 15 dishes and still it was just good.nothing really stood out.Best ones were the hamachi sashimi, salmon tartare, octopus and of course the pork belly.I was disappointed with their specialty- THE QUAIL.. Being it the ""STATE BIRD"" I was expecting a unique preparation and presentation. However it was a shock to see that it was just plainly BREADED!!!! I was expecting roasted with some kind of specialty sauce but it was just fried and breaded. Truly disappointed...They only serve BEER and WINE which  was again disappointing because we were expecting specialty cocktails... How about for people that drink neither????I was really expecting to be blown away by this place but unfortunately no. Being the best two chefs of the year , you would expect an extra ordinary experience ..... But no.... Nothing was memorable .... Even the food.I was going to give only 2 stars BUT their service was excellent so I gave this place 3 stars.Worth the visit here?????.. Sorry to say BUT no. 1. Getting in can be an tough task. 2. Going on any day but Thu, Fri, Sat, and Sun might bring more fruitful results.3. Have a backup plan when they tell you the next reservation is the standing room only seat at 9 PM.4. Enjoy the wait and then enjoy the food because it is fantastic.5. Service is awesome for a place that is this packed. Truly some of the best service I've had. NOTE: For all the whiners about the reservation system; yes, it is a pain to get a table. #firstworldproblems just like another poster said. Guess what, they have no problems filling their tables. Why? The food is amazing. As long as they keep up the great food I don't think their reservation will be their downfall. This restaurant is quite unique, given the dim-sum style of serving customers, mixed with nouveau dishes that reflects the fusion food that SF is so good at.Came here on opening night after the renovations, so I didn't have to go through the entire 2-month reservations waitlist. Due to being some of the people in the front of the line, my friend and I was seated promptly upon opening. During our wait, we were served some hot cider from the kitchen inside. They must have seen us freezing to death waiting outside for their food.Given the price tag, I was actually quite disappointed in the food. My friend and I sampled something like 10 dishes, and I felt only satisfied with half of the meal. There were only 3 hit dishes for me - the state bird with provisions, the nori cracker with hamachi, and the dumpling with broth (in which case, it was mostly the broth that blew me away). Everything else was either blah or good (uni pancake, sauerkraut pancake, quinoa bowl with goat cheese, octopus and chickpeas in tomato sauce, furikake soft boiled egg atop potatoes, corn biscuit with duck liver, peanut milk shot, chocolate crunch with caramel cream).Definitely felt that it would have been better bringing another friend or two to split the bill, since it was more fun sampling all the dishes than feeling really full. Definitely my treat for the month here! the fried pork belly. Let's get the bad out first. On line reservation system is terrible. Went on line to get reservation after State Bird Provisions closed for remodel. Was able to get time and date after a few tries. Hit enter and server crapped out. Was never able to get in. Turns out , I was not the only one. Not many people get lucky on on line or by phone for reservations. Ended up going to Soft Opening on Oct. 19th. Was actually first in line. Got there at about 3 o'clock for 5:30 PM opening. The /12 hour wait to get in was worth it. Went in with a budget, but ended up blowing it up. Everything was delicious. Couldn't stop trying all the items being carted around. If it wasn't for myself and my wife getting full, we would of been there longer. Simply Stated. Amazing. We are going back. Probably standing in line again. The people we met in line prior all had the same feelings. we are all Fans. As of October 23, 2013, State Bird Provisions has received a Michelin Star, in addition to The James Beard Award for Best new Restaurant 2013. This is a late post from earlier in the year. Food is a little pricey but is worth it for the experience. Portion size like all tapas are small, but the food will get your taste pallet dancing. This was like a dim sum experience minus the actual dim sum. You have your dedicated sever.  The staff all knew the menu. They not only knew what they were serving, but also how the food was prepared. I hate this place, not because of the bad food or the bad service, it's because every time the servers come by our table with new dishes i just have to order it! I had an awesome experience dining here, service was friendly and attentive. This restaurant serve's its food dimsum style. Each of the dishes were amazing such as the oysters, soup dumplings, octopus, oh don't let me forget to mention the quail, omg the quail is a must! I highly suggest reservations otherwise you'll be standing outside looking through their kitchen window dying just to get in. The idiot who wrote a bad review for the reservation system craping out is a moron. I hate yelpers like that, it's not helpful at all. Get a life. I ate there a couple months ago. It's the best new restaurant in America, for a reason, so of course it's a mad rush to get in. #firstworldproblems #amirightoramiright The food and experience are amazing, the service is nothing short of fantastic and I look forward to going again when things die down a bit. What's it all about? It's dim sum style new American food. Which means people come around with prepared dishes on a cart, you take it if you want it or they move on. There's a menu with prepared to order dishes as well. Menu changes regularly. If you're traveling from out of town and making plans for must dine places, this should def make your list. Can't get a reservation? It can't hurt to try to walk in with a smile on your face, a patient attitude and flexibility of sitting anywhere whenever they can get you in. Don't worry, be happy and eat well! How can a place of this caliber have a totally inept online reservation system? Get your shit together, SBP. I'll keep this short.Quite simply the best dining experience I have ever had in my life. Wow!  Never seen such badly managed reservation system.  Tried all different ways for over an hr - between crashing website at different stages and no phone service , it's unclear why no tables are suddenly available.  Even left a voicemail but no response!  Oh well, it would have been nice if the system was somehow managed better. Total disaster trying to sign up for reservations after the close.  Pages timed out and 40 minutes wasted trying to score a reservation.  Will not be trying again anytime soon. I've eaten here twice, and the food is good.  yes.  the ambiance is nice and the concept is fun and engaging... When my boyfriend tasked me with getting a table for four for us and his parents during their upcoming visit, I thought, no problem.  I'm all over it.You'd think that a restaurant with lines out the door every single day would prepare accordingly for the onslaught of internet traffic once their reservation page opened up again for the restaurant reopening.  But I have been struggling with 505 service errors, gateway timeouts, bad gateways and the like for over 40 minutes now to no avail.  I have been able to reach each stage of the reservation process through my NUMEROUS attempts, but the state bird website and the reservation website have crapped out on me every. single. time.  I have been tasked with scoring tickets to a number of lucrative events: Prince at DNA Lounge, Phish lotteries, Dave Chapelle flash sale at the Indy... and none have been as frustrating as this.State Bird: host your reservation site with a service company that can handle your level of web traffic.  This is amateur hour. Between reservation bots, an inoperative website and all around madness to get into this place, I'm over it.  Sorry State Bird, you won't be seeing me again. I had the pleasure to eat here a couple of months ago (pre-remodel),  I arrived at 4 to get a table and waited 2 hours.  This is not like me at all to wait.  I was lucky enough that they had a ""stand up"" table available (not like me at all to stand up for dinner) and the fun began.  The food is amazing, watching the staff's passion for food is amazing and nothing absolutely nothing disappointed me.  This place is a gem. I'm not a fan.  But maybe I went on an off night looking at all of these reviews.  The food was decent, best dish was an oyster dish.  Everything else was ok, the flavors didn't blend well together and certain dishes just left me wondering why?  Service was good and our waitress attempted to explain all of the dishes to us.  My friend and I left this place underwhelmed.  I'll come back again to see if I can update this review. why so fabulous huh????i will start with the negative. when i make a reservation that took me weeks, i don't want to wait at all when i get there....i should be seated asap. just being honest so get on point. SBP! if i don't have to wait at french laundry or le bernardin, my ass should not have to wait an additional 25 minutes for state bird....get your shit organized and if i come on time, you be on time too.on to the good stuff.staff is super nice. short stack amazing and to die for. everything we got was amazing minus the small bird or squab they had on their menu we got....i wasn't dying for it....but everything straight up was FANTASTIC.dessert was killer and i was floored. thanks for the fine fine food.

Delightful food and a wonderful dining experience. We were just about the last table sat during the last seating on Saturday, and the food and staff couldn't have been more wonderful. I also fully expected the check to be a bit more when all was said and done, so maybe they're not charging enough :) This place will always hold a special place in my heart- my fiance proposed to me here!Prior, my friends and I had been trying to get reservations for months. I was ""surprised"" when the boyfriend landed a last-minute reservation for two on a Saturday night ;)The setting is intimate, I always love open kitchens (though fiance tried hard to convince me to sit facing the other direction), the wall decor is fun, and the lone bathroom is super clean and posh. The staff is really friendly and proactive, and explained how to order (unlike some restaurants with unique concepts who assume you can figure it out on your own). They have a combination of made-to-order items that include the famous State Bird with Provisions, and other items come out of the open kitchen on trays and sometimes carts. They usually only put out 4 plates of each dish out at a time, but since every table is at a different point in their meal, you don't feel anxious to grab dishes as they came, as you would at a traditional dim sum restaurant. The pace is steady, we had about 2-3 dishes on our table most of the night, and we pretty much tried all but a few dishes. My favorite was definitely the heirloom cherry tomatoes on a zesty blended eggplant bed that reminded me of babaghanouj. We were recommended some great wines, and the dessert was so delicoius, combining some of my favorite ingredients in a minty pistachio ice cream chocolate sandwich with a raspberry sauce.They said they're closing down temporarily to remodel-- the waitress said they're opening up the space to allow more room for carts. Can't wait for them to re-open, we'll be back again! :D We had a great time here. Clearly other reviews have covered most important points, but my main observations were that we much preferred the meat dishes to the vegetable ones, and that the pancakes were completely delightful. We managed to come not hungry, which was a good strategy as we refrained from ordering every dish that came by. The bread + burrata was, in my opinion, not better than something you could put together at home with high-quality ingredients. I'm really looking forward to going back. They were at SFSFF 2013 and had $8 garlic bread. I didn't like it. I thought it was overpriced for the portion and it didn't taste garlicy at all. We did not have reservations so we stood in line for an hour to get a reservation.  Then we had to wait another hour and 45mins for our reservation.  They were nice enough to serve hot chocolate to everyone in line.  It was a nice teaser because the hot chocolate had a nice citrus hint so I really got excited.They serve most of their dimsum style wherein they will approach your table with small plates of food and you can choose to accept or say no to the food.  So it will be good to go as group so you can taste more dishes.  But not too big a group because the place is really small -- 4 pax will be ideal.My friend and I were so hungry by the time we sat because of all the waiting so we did taste several dishes -- 16 in total.  I will say that most were average -- good but nothing great.  Only two dishes really stood out which was the crudo sashimi with wasabi mayo on top of crispy nori and the braised rabbit.For dessert, we had the chocolate crunch and it was NOT the punctuation mark that I was waiting for at the end of a meal.I say go and try the place since the food is good but make reservations.  Its not one that I will line up for hours. The best food in recent memory, top 2 or 3 of all time.  Casual restaurant experience definitely worth the hour and a half wait if you don't have a reservation.  Service was excellent.- Go as a party of four so that you can try everything on the menu (best advice)!- Eat first from the trays that are brought to your table, order from the menu last- Try the house made sodas, all of them- Sit at the chefs counter, it's like sitting courtside or behind home plate- Go hungry and take your time working through all the dishesEnjoy! There are many beautiful restaurants offering friendly, attentive service and serving creative, delicious food in San Francisco. State Bird Provisions is one such restaurant, but it offers one additional thing that sets it apart from its peers and places it in a unique, far more elite class of dining establishments: It is a restaurant that captures the true heart and soul of its city. To step into State Bird Provisions is to enter a microcosm of the spiritual fabric of San Francisco. Allow me to explain:1) The Californian-Asian cuisineIt is no secret that San Francisco has a rich and lively Asian community that spans multiple countries, nationalities and ethnicities. It is also no secret that the city has access to fresh produce year-round. State Bird Provisions reflects both of these aspects in its cuisine. Whether it is a ""stew"" of purple radish leaves mixed with poached egg and fish, or a salmon tartare combined with pumpkin seeds and quinoa, or stir-fried vegetables with almonds, crunchy rice, cheese and romesco sauce, the menu each day is a harmonious marriage of Asian-Western ingredients, culinary techniques and cooking styles, combined with the delicious, endlessly fresh bounty of the earth that characterizes the Golden State.2) The dim sum-style serviceIt should come as no surprise, following #1, that State Bird Provisions also offers a uniquely Asian style of serving food. Most dishes are tapas-sized, good for 2-4 people and presented by carts and trays by various serving staff. Simply choose which dish(es) you want and your order(s) is marked on a checklist--just like at dim sum restaurants.3) The bustling, open kitchenI'm probably biased because this is where my friend and I were, but I would argue that the best place to be in the restaurant is at the standing ""chef's table"" at the front of the restaurant. Place your things on the hooks provided and stand back (literally) to enjoy the sight of State Bird Provisions' many line cooks carefully and meticulously preparing their dishes. San Franciscans love good food, but San Franciscans also embrace an open, casual, laid back attitude. This is reflected in the kitchen, where the cooks are a friendly, easy-going bunch dressed in whatever clothes are most comfortable for them (no matching suits and ties here) and chatting easily with diners while they slice, toss, sauté, roast and plate. When I left State Bird Provisions, I felt as if I had just spent the last 2 hours consuming the very essence of what makes San Francisco great. For that reason alone, a visit to this restaurant should be on everyone's to-do list. Why, oh why, did I consume a $3 slice of pizza before coming here?  I wish I had come on an empty stomach, but the drunk me after several Friday night drinksies forced me to buy a slice before I passed out on the street somewhere. My reservation was a late one, 10:30pm, and I had friends in town from Australia and it was her birthday, so it was perfect (especially before closing down for rennovations!) We were immediately awed and overwhelmed by the process of ordering here. Besides the menu of pancakes, commandables, and desserts, the staff come around with carts and trays of their prepared foods ala dimsum style.My co-worker told me to get the state bird off the menu, but we were quickly lured to sourdough/sauerkraut/pecorino/ricotta pancakes and the pork spare ribs. I thought the pork spare ribs were more delicious than the state bird (quail). Deliciously tender and the meat fell off the bones. The state bird came with some cheese and tasted like fried chicken. I only had a small piece because I was full. The pancakes could be used to dip in extra sauce, like what my friend's bf did with the leftover avocado dip.If my appetite would have allowed for more food, I would have definitely tried more plates. Lots more. I mean there was seafood, veggies, and so many other varietals I can't remember.  Some of the smaller plates ordered:--This slow cooked egg with trout (flavors were delicate yet decadent)--This avocado thing with spicy flavors that came with chips (YUM)--A dumpling in yummy broth. (should have ordered more than one!)Next time, I will do it properly by 1) coming earlier 2) coming on an empty stomach.Can't wait to come back! You can just tell the quality of the food is amazing, the staff really care about their food they prepare for you (cooked with love), and a great atmosphere for hanging out.P.S. They don't do anything special for birthdays here. We mentioned it once or twice but nothing happened. Sad, we didn't even get to order dessert! The food here was absolutely amazing. We had been waiting a few months to get in and finally made it off the wait list one night. Started getting food very quickly and couldn't stop trying new dishes. Everything had a distinct feel and flavor and there some pretty wild dishes. The quail was OK. The beef salad was memorable. The other stuff seemed awkward, and tasted kinda bland. The wine was good, though. Overpriced food that I forgot about by the next day. Ok so I walked in expecting hipster food. You know artisanal water and organic air infused broccoli which will cost you $45 dollars a pop. I was totally wrong and I am soo sorry for thinking this.Ok so I had no clue but everything is sort of served dim-sum style. Someone comes by and asks if you want a plate from their tray, and they mark off the amount on the card. Simple.  It ranges too. We had a vegetarian in the group and 3 other non vegs.Favorite little dish was the nori with albacore on it. Totally awesome. Came with a bit of avocado and a garlic mayo combo (hip kids call it aioli I guess).Honorable mention was definitely the pork belly plate but I mean it's pork belly, how do you mess that up.There was a quinoa and corn starch that was great too.People were talking about something like a garlic bread burata?, it was eh compared to other things on the menu. It was just garlic bread.The duck liver confie was awesome too. I kept just dipping other dishes in it or spreading it along other items.You can order from the menu as well, but among the 4 of us, we were all full off of taking 1 of each plate they had passed out throughout the night. A special callout has to be made to the staff here. They are awesome. Super friendly, totally engaging and very attentive. They had no attitude about anything and they just provided an overall nice atmosphere and were actually excited.When it came time for dessert we were stuck. We were at the standing counter all night which is right behind the place where they make the desserts. So we saw everything. But we thought we should ask. Everyone seemed to be ordering the ice cream sandwich dish, but no we were told by the server, we want the crunchy chocolate dessert. It sounded weird but it was delish. Just a bit nuty crunchy, chocolate not too sweet and man I was pleased. They even threw in a shot of the panicotta stuff after because they liked how we were up for anything.Then the bill came and ... it was actually pretty reasonable. Every dish they had, split 4 ways, cost about 50 bucks WITH tip. Come on that is crazy awesome considering everything.Pro tip, just suck it up and go for the standing table. (6month wait for regular table). It has the best view, so what if you have to stand, and you can get a seat day of. Go to fat angel and grab some wine and beers while you wait. Had dinner here during a stop in San Francisco on our honeymoon.  Best dinner we've ever had.  Everything we tasted was amazing.  Sat at the bar and tried everything that came by on the cart.  Service was great and everyone was friendly...we even got to meet the chef/owner.  When we got back to Atlanta, we saw that we had visited one of the best restaurants in the states in Bon Apetit. Dim sum nouveau.  More than anything else, I love this concept.If I were a culinary artist, this would be the format I would choose by which to express my artistry.  I would be moved to capture fleeting thoughts inspired upon seeing a beautiful bouquet of fresh vegetables, colorful shades of edible flowers, or fish that literally jumped out of the sea into my lap.  Life is to celebrate these things.Anyhoo, I don't know if these are the things that inspire chef State Bird, but I sure am glad he shares his love for life and his culinary inspiration with the rest of us, in little portions.  You know he has vivid imagination, as he can throw together unlikely and complex pairings of ingredients, or present simple ingredients, as they are (nasturtium and balsamic ricotta?).  As with all artistic creations, not everything works perfectly, but I am just as glad to be on the ride to experience someone else's inspired moments.  It feels honest and genuine.As everyone says, the wait was very long (got in line at 5:30 to get a standing spot at 8:45, but the time estimate given to us by the hostess was quite accurate).  Nonetheless, I was amazed at how calm the chefs in the kitchen were.  In contrast to the perceived craziness (maybe it was more excited anticipation) of hungry-people-waiting-in-line-in-tiny-dining-room, the chefs in the kitchen were so not Hells-Kitchen, they were zen, calm and collected, and warm and friendly.  In the middle of making yummy corn pancakes, the lady chef who happened to see me watching flashed a warm smile.  And everyone else patiently answered my million and one questions, and one chef even put together a dish we requested even though it was not in his rotation.  They say they will be closed after August 11, 2013 for remodeling.  I hope it's for expansion, although hopefully its charm won't be lost in the process. Yeah, I definitely think SBP lives up to the hype and is one of the more delicious and interesting places to check out in SF right now. We got in line at 4:40pm on a Tuesday and made it in the first seating. The line was loooong behind us. I love the dim sum style eating--it was executed very well --and the service was great. Everything was easy. We had plenty to eat and I thought the end price tag was not too bad considering the quality of food. There were two items that we didn't think were amazing but everything else blew our minds. Loved, loved, loved it. AMAZING!!! I had heard great reviews from friends about this place and was nervous to be disappointed - my expectations were pretty high after all the rave reviews. The food was AMAZING. The service and attention to detail by the staff was AMAZING. The chefs and wait staff all work extremely hard and are a clearly passionate bunch. They work very hard to get food out quickly and let as many people enjoy their art. This place is a foodies dream. Everything we tasted we truly loved. I recommend asking the wait staff for their recommendations and being adventurous. You won't regret it!P.S. probably not the best place to take picky eaters. The food all tasted great amazing, but you have to be willing to try things out of your comfort zone. This is no ordinary experience. Let me start by saying I will probably never go back here without a reservation, or unless I can convince someone to get there at 4:00 and stand in line like others have told me to do. Instead, I showed up at 5:30, got my name in by 6:00 (yes, we waited in line for a half hour just to get our names down), and then told we could be seated at 9:45, maybe 9:15 if people didn't show up for reservations. We decided to kill time and catch a movie at Kabuki, grabbed a few drinks at a nearby wine bar, and 4 hours later we were finally seated at 10pm. The food itself was great, albeit very rich. Lots of creamy, cheesy, meat heavy plates. There were a few let downs (steak tartare, oysters with kimchi, and duck liver mousse), but some highlights (pork belly salad, corn pancakes, salmon tartare, pork ribs). I'm most amazed by the staff, incredibly friendly, impeccable service. Even with a full house, they were attentive and made our dining experience really pleasant. After about an hour, we were finished with dinner, stuffed silly, in pain from overeating. As we left, I think 5 or 6 people thanked us for dining with them. Wonderful staff, really. I just can't forgive the insane wait time, I do hope their expansion will help avoid this. State Bird Provisions has a special place in my heart, and I was so lucky to score seats to such a highly rated restaurant! Reservations are done months in advance, and make the whole seating process a lot quicker. A section of their seating is reserved for walk-ins, and as long as you line up at least an hour before they open (yes, there is already a small line outside by 4:30pm... and they open at 5:30pm), you can get seats. Also, this isn't the place for large groups. I would say parties of 4 at max, maybe even 3 max. I don't think they can merge tables, not with the amount of people inside. Probably would end in a fire hazard or something...Other than that, the place is pretty spacious, despite a packed house, with servers running around with trays of small dishes, or with the one dim sum cart packed with goodies! The servers come around fairly quickly, and explain everything in the dish, giving you a few moments to decide before moving on.The quality of the food was phenomenal, and everything was really delicious. Pricing was fairly cheap, considering what you got. Also, State Bird isn't one of those restaurant where you pay exorbitant prices for food the size of your palm on a plate the size of your head. Think dim sum... pretty much the same prices. And for those small plates that cost around $9-10, same price as a dim sum entree you order off the menu.Where to begin with the food? It's tough, as everything was good!Provisions-- Raw oysters with spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesame - Delicious! Fresh! The kraut give a small kick to the ocean flavors of the oysters.-- Guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth - Solid! The dumplings were well made, filling, and definitely a good addition to our meal.-- Corn & quinoa 'tabouleh' - Hands down, the highlight of our dinner (agreed by our entire group)! A really fresh dish, not weighed down by meat, but not underwhelmingly light or lacking. It blew some of our dishes out of the water, in terms of flavor and satisfaction!-- Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - Amazing! One of the few times I've had duck liver mousse, and it was a real treat. One of our first dishes, we were left wanting more after finishing every last bit!-- Steak tartar with jimmy nardello ranch - Really delicious, although a bit lacking. The entire dish was well put together, but it felt more like filler than flavor.-- Salmon tartar with pickled turnips - A better choice for tartar over the steak version. Felt lighter, and a solid salmon flavor.-- Pork belly plum salad - Yummy! The pork belly was cut into cubes before cooking, and they were still really fatty! The pork was really tasty, and the fat intensified the flavors and the savoriness of the dish. It was also great to see plum in a savory dish, rather than toppled on a salad. The plum added an extra layer of flavor and complexity to the dish!-- Salmon collar - Really tasty! A bit difficult to extract the meat, only because of the odd cut of the salmon. Quality fish, and a good try!Pancakes-- Sweet corn & mt. tam 'shortstack' - Really delicious! Very dense, and packed with flavor. Served with a corn powder that amplified the flavors. Glad each individual piece was small, so you don't have to force your way through a giant, thick pancake! Little packets of mouth-watering goodness.Commandable-- Pork spare ribs glased in their own juices - Amazing! For the price, you get quite a bit of pork. The pork isn't too dry or under-seasoned. For three people, it satisfied all of us.Dessert-- Birdseed bittersweet chocolate crunch, caramel cloud cream, blueberries - Delightful! A great end to an excellent meal! The chocolate crunch was really light, but definitely in good portions. The cloud cream was to die for! We had to call dibs on the last bits, seeing how good the dessert was!Drinks (SBP Sodas)-- Muddled Herb - Think of a mint mojito, but without the alcohol. Pretty much sums of the flavor of this drink.-- Strawberry Plum Vinegar - Three ingredients that melded well with each other. I went through this drink so quickly, and really wanted another! Such a good combination, and a wonderful drink to enjoy while eating delicious food.For the amount of food we ordered, we could have easily paid a lot more than what was on our bill. The food was really enjoyable and quite memorable. Dining at State Bird Provisions is an experience, and it definitely lives up to all the high reviews and the love of all its customers!I will definitely try to come back the next time I'm in the area! No lengthy in depth review here.  Everyone knows it's hard to get in (lots of acclaim + very few tables) but it's absolutely worth the wait.  I'm still shocked it didn't get into the Michelin guide because IMHO it blows many of those other restaurants away.  Pretty much everything that we ordered was amazing and it's very reasonably priced.  The chef is very approachable and even remembered us from the first time we ate there almost two years ago!  The staff is very friendly too.  Can't wait to go back. It's good, but not that good.  This place is way over-hyped; why is everybody so smitten with the dim sum style service?  What's the big deal with food coming around on push carts?  Chinese restaurants have been doing this for centuries and nobody gets all googley eyed over steamed buns rolling by your table.  That being said, the simpler dishes can be quite tasty, but several more complex dishes were just too disjointed in flavor profiles.  For example, clams and scallops cooked with kimchee and bacon and a mess of greens - not sure what was the star of the dish, but between the sour kimchee and salty powerful bacon, I couldn't taste much else.  Lots of asian flavor profiles here, but I'm not a fan of fusion asian food.  You will spend at least 50-60 bucks per person and probably leave feeling hungry (I was more satisfied with the Kokomen ramen I had right after going home from this place).  The servers were nice but kind of uninterested over all.  It's a bit of a hectic eating experience, and not the best place to enjoy a relaxing meal. The service was not good. However, the bartender was so nice!! He was friendly and helpful. I liked the salmon collar very much. Fatty and delicious. The buratta on Garlic bread was kinda boring. I was most excited about this, but it's a skip. The anchovy pancake was tasty, but the portion was minuscule! The corn and mt. tam pancakes were great. The best was a white tuna tartare on a nori cracker with black garlic aioli and avocado cream. Fabulous. The octopus with chickpeas was only ok. The line is cray though. I don't know whether State Bird Provisions (SBP) is the best new restaurant in America, as the James Beard award declares, but SBP is definitely the most exciting restaurant I've been to in the past year. Much has been written about the core concept being inspired from Dim Sum, but frankly, it is the execution, energy, and personality that set the restaurant apart from any reference point. The servers, and one of the owners (Stuart) who I didn't recognize then, are passionate about what they do, and you can see that in the glint in their eyes - as they also size you up on what would appeal to you!The modular, changing menu is divided into four distinct sections: Pancakes, Commandables, Desserts, and Provisions. You could order plates from the first three sections, and/or you could wait for the staff to bring in front of you a tray featuring a ""Provision"", and select it if you like what you see. The best strategy would be to pick a popular dish or two between the Commandables & Pancakes, and choose well amongst the Provisions brought forth at regular intervals. You could select 3 to 4 Provisions (small-ish), while leaving room for dessert... I totally got carried away and didn't pace myself well. Despite reading prior yelp reviews carefully I immediately pointed towards the almond biscuit and duck liver mousse, and the steak tartare with chips and jimmy nardello ranch. I didn't think much of the former (either the biscuit or the duck liver mousse), or the latter, other than being amused by the construction. These two misses were followed by the guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth. Though, the dumpling was little more than a bite, I liked the dish. Next, I nodded at the charred octopus with chickpeas and tomato salsa. Charred octopus is currently featuring prominently across cuisines and cities in America as a popular appetizer, and though I didn't think much of the octopus' texture (compared to superior versions in Greek restaurants of NYC), the tomato salsa played off really well with the chickpeas. Mindful of limited stomach capacity I skipped the garlic bread with burrata, and instead chose the smoked trout with potato porridge, poached egg, and Nori. This was the first of my five star experiences in the restaurant with the senses being given a thorough workout by the smokiness, textures, and flavors.  Trying to balance my indiscipline with some greens, I next ordered the SBP Thali salad from the Commandables. This dish features greens the restaurant grows such as shishito peppers, in addition to yogurt, curried cauliflower and pappadum. Typical of the fusion across cuisines successfully pulled off by SBP, I marveled at how well executed the pappadum was and how refreshing the dish was (5 stars). By this time, I had no discernible appetite remaining, and so I can't commend the next provision enough: albacore tuna, avocado on a plate of sea weed cracker - again a mélange of colors, textures and flavors, and not to be missed out is the perfection of the crunchy, seaweed cracker (5 stars!). Going with my fervent belief that desserts are processed by another stomach with separate capacity, I went with the mint ice cream sandwich accompanied by chocolate plum coulis, and pistachio. Personally, I thought the macaron sandwich did nothing to enhance the experience (other than being friendly to those who like gluten free), but the rest of the ingredients paired off well together (another 5 stars).With a glass of Rose (2012 Abbaye Saint Hilaire Coteaux Varois en Provence), and including taxes and tip my bill turned out to be $ 90 - which was much higher than expected for I clearly ate 2-3 dishes more than I should have. But then: what's a vacation if you're not splurging on yourself?Standing in line outside the restaurant (I was 35th despite getting in at 4:45 pm, well before the restaurant opens at 5:30 pm), in my 8th year I realized just how useful yelp is. I had checked in to the hotel at 4:15 pm, taken a bus straight to the restaurant, and was able to dine at one of America's premier restaurants, while a multitude of bemused locals and tourists passing by had no clue as to why the restaurant was so popular. Now, not only did I know where and why - but I also knew when to get in line, what to order and how much should I expect to pay. That's truly priceless!SBP is one of those rare cases where the whole is truly greater than the sum of its parts. So, yes, do get in that line before they take a summer break... Love this place!  Such a fun idea, serving CA cuisine dim-sum style!  Must haves: burrata w/garlic brioche, fried quail, and corn pancake w/Mt. Tam cheese.  To die for!  Reservations are hard to come by, but if you plan ahead it's worth the wait! We were lucky enough to be the other couple invited to State Bird on a double date- my friend somehow finagled a reservation, to which we owe her majorly.I have never had such an eclectic array of food before. It would be impossible to categorize it under anything as it was a mix of the heavy french, Mediterranean/seafood all with a dim sum experience. That's truly what this was- and experience. Sadly, seeing it's closing in August for expansion they are no longer taking reservations. So, a once in a lifetime experience it may be for me :(Here's what we had:Octopus salad w/garbanzo beans- very goodDuck and mushroom stew - very goodDuck liver mousse - very good, but VERY richFried green tomatoes - very goodSalmon/cucumber salad - Excellent, and a refreshing lightweight mix into the mealAhi Tuna and avocado puree on a crunchy seaweed cracker- EXCELLENTRibs - I DIED AND WENT TO HEAVENCorn quinoa - BOMB and lightBurrata in a croissant - SERIOUSLY? DIED AGAINGuinea hen dumpling - very good, rich as hell but goodMint ice cream sandwiches!!! WOWLoved it all, I really hope I can make it back in there again! Service was patient with all our questions and interactive throughout the entire night. I love how everyone ""worked together""- you'll see what I mean. ;)*Nice idea to grab a cask beer or glass of wine at Fat Angel next door beforehand! Feel like a debbie downer for slamming another place with such glowing reviews but I just can't perpetuate the hype, especially when some of the dishes were so sloppy. Let me start with the memorable dishes: the fried quail was perfectly cooked (and surprisingly) one of the more restrained dishes there. The onions, parmesan, and lemon all complemented each other with the right amount of acidity and salt. The clams and scallops with kimchee, on the other, hand was a hot mess. Between the kimchee and pickled green beans you were left with an overwhelming amount of sourness that nothing else came through. Seemed like every dish had three too many ingredients that never came together harmoniously. To top it off? We were seated for at least an hour and half and still never saw several of the dishes that were being passed around. You have to give the place credit for it's creativity. That said, I feel like people give creative concepts too much of a pass. If you're going to have an incredibly hard time to get a reservation and win numerous accolades, you should deliver delicious, memorable food. Nothing there struck me in a way that would make me ever crave it again (like Delfina's simple, yet stunning, spaghetti, or Ichi Sushi's unique nigiri combinations). That's why I don't think I'll ever be back again. Much better experience with my girl and her family. I'd really like to get a space at the bar and just pig out on everything. I must return soon. It was impossible to get a reservation at this place.  They book out 60 days in advance and there were never any available, so my wife and I decided to try the walk in route.  I got there on a Wednesday at 4:40 (they open at 530) and there were 10-15 people in front of us.  The line eventually quadrupled in size by the time 530 rolls around, and we were very fortunate to get the last two seats available (the couple behind us were told to come back in 2 hours).I loved how they take the concept of dim sum and turn it into the ultimate food experience.  You never know what dish will catch your eye.  Some of our favorites include:the state birdthe pork bellythe salmon cheekahi tuna (my favorite)the chocolate crunch dessertThey will be closing on Aug 11th and expanding so hopefully that will make reservations easier to come by. Whatever. I went and never need to return. Nice presentation and ambiance. Also servers are very nice.They use very fresh ingredients. However, the food lacks real flavor and umami. The owner should pay more attention to whathe or she prepares and presents to the customers. Do you LOVE amazingly eclectic food and superb service? SBP is worth the hype and the 60 day wait. Plus, you need to book a reservation online circa 5am in the morning when the reservations go live. Everything was divine. I would go back for the: soft egg/dashi potato/trout dish, pork belly, scallop/clam dish, fried quail, and the burrata with fried garlic bread.  YUM. in an unexpected location near japantown, across the street from woori market. down the block from western union. it only has the word ""PROVISIONS"" painted on the front; no sign and no ""state bird"" anywhere.i feel like we tried about 3/4 of what was available. overall everything was good; a few things were AWESOME; nothing was BAD but there were a couple of misses. see cheatsheet below.overall, a unique dining experience at a really reasonable price for the quality of food (we just kept ordering and ordering and it came out to a very reasonable $50-$60pp). not sure it's really the ""best new restaurant"" in america per the 2013 james beard awards, but i'll gladly come back if i can get a seat without too much effort.---cheatsheet5* so good i wanted to order seconds right then and there:- albacore tuna-avocado & seaweed cracker $9- heirloom tomatoes with eggplant & greek basil $6 (so simple but so delicious)- blackberry & plum jam-black pepper cake, summer morettini pears, hazelnuts $8 (reminded me of pound cake w/ strawberry jam - no 'pepper' flavor at all)4* would definitely get again:- salmon tartare with pickled turnips $10- mussels with diced potato- glazed salmon collar $63.5* good:- seared scallops & clams with spicy bacon-kimchi yuba $16 (i learned that 'yuba' is 'tofu skin'! never had this outside of chinese food before - a fun dish with good flavors)- CA state bird with provisions $16 (we got a ""large"" - shared between 4 people it was about a chicken nugget size each - nice and moist, like a very good chicken parmesan)2.5* not bad but not great:- roasted vegetable 'romesco' $5 (i love vegetables but this didn't do anything for me)- guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth $3 (looked really good but was not memorable at all)- fried pork belly vietnamese style with fish sauce and basil (interesting but not a home run... flavors were similar to getting fried fish cakes at a pho place)- steak tartare with jimmy nardello ranch $8 (nothing special)- garlic bread with burrata $8 (the ""bread"" was reminiscent of the 'chinese doughnuts' eaten with porridge and soy bean milk)- SBP 'thali' salad $10 (shishito peppers, yogurt something, and curried cauliflower - interesting but nothing really jumped out at me)- mint 'ice cream' sandwich, chocolate-fig coulis, pistachios $8- 'world peace' peanut muscovado milk $2 (the peanut version of almond milk - very straightforward flavor, lacking complexity)2* fatally flawed:- duck liver mousse with almond biscuit $6 (the almond 'biscuits' were really enticing and were good - but the duck liver mousse reminded me of paint thinner - someone else here said it was the alcohol, that's exactly it - extremely overpowering)- birdseed bittersweet chocolate crunch, caramel cloud cream, blueberries $8 (nestle crunch-like chunks - yum - in a bed of whipped caramel - way too sweet) Well, it was certainly an experience.A tip for the spontaneous: don't underestimate the line.  We ambled over at 4:40pm on Saturday and ended up 24th or something with a 9:45pm seating time.  Ultimately, we got bumped up earlier, but just be prepared and/or flexible.  And, if you can help it, be a small party.The attention to service felt almost curated...from the chocolate milk shots in line to the detailed intros of each laden tray to the whip-smart efficiency of the maitre d'.  And of course, it's a culinary paradigm shift: dim sum style transformed into a completely reinvented dining artifact: a modular, ever-changing menu, various seating arrangements, and an overall DIY-eclectic feel to the space all contributing to this culinary concept of self-made fun.However, I'm afraid that in execution, the concept slips a bit.  - All of the seafood dishes were hits: lobster salad, scallops and avocado quinoa, oysters, nori cracker with tombe tuna.  (I swear, that seafood cart is rolling straight to the foodie hall of fame.)- A couple more hits: state bird and peanut muscovado milk (I could pound shots of this all night long).- But several others were misses: guinea hen dumplings, spicy yuba noodles, ricotta dumpling, sweet corn and mt tam shortstack. (sounded good, but all the ingredients/flavors were muddled and dull.)- And a few others suffered from mis-pacing (inevitable in the dim sum format but regrettable all the same): garlic bread burrata, steak tartare with house made chips, and some crudo (and perhaps others?) that never made it by our tableSo, 3 stars on the food (with drinks, it came out to $120 before tip), but the passionate service and flat-out fun experience tip it over to 4 stars.  I think even execution and distribution remain significant challenges (or lures for additional visits?) but how can you not fall for a place that believes so much in itself that they'll see your full tummy and raise you a half serving of the chocolate ice cream sandwich?  Self-made menu, thank you very much. Bon Appetit said this was the Best Restaurant in the US.  So, natch, it is busy and buzzy.  The food is spectacularly creative; it's not a place to take that person who thinks a ""nice"" meal is a steak.  Everyone dining here knows they are going to eat food that, not only have they never tasted before, but never even imagined before.  SBP is farm to table dim sum, you order some off the menu and some off the madly tempting carts rolling by.  I usually don't care for oysters, but the fresh oyster with sauerkraut and? was like a dreamy mouthful of ocean.  Sweet corn and Mt. Tam goat cheese short stack of pancakes?  Heaven.  Red trout, mandarin and hazelnut-garum brown butter?  More, please.  And the desserts!  Often granitas taste like a mouthful of melted ice from your fridge.  The greengage plum granita with tapioca and berries?  My, MY. While the food is transporting, the best thing about the restaurant is how nice everyone is.  The host, the servers, the chefs--Stuart and Nicole--everyone is so jazzed to be there, and so happy you are there, and so delighted to eat the food that a meal at SBP becomes the special-est of special occasions. bestporkbellyEVERA wonderful time with friends, Emily and Derek...also loved the second plate of pork belly we had.  So full I did not have room for dessert, which I regret.  (Did I mention the pork belly?) My friend and I dined here on a Saturday evening in June.   We didn't have a reservation so was told by the hostess on the phone that we could wait in line for bar seating and dining room seating that are set aside for walkins.  She indicated that some people start lining up 45-1 hr beforehand.  We got there about 20 minutes before it opened.  There were already around 25+ people in line already.  We were told there was bar seating or standing room at the counter by the door at around 8pm.  We walked around Japantown and had a light snack across the street.  Luckily we received a text around 7:15pm letting us know our seats were available.  We ordered a total of 14 dishes (most were from the dim sum style trays that were passed around).  Some of dishes were ordered included:PROVISIONSCucumber with avocado and fried quinoa- I like the fried quinoaTwo raw oysters with spicy kohlrabi kraut and sesame- tastyGuinea hen dumpling with broth- I thought it was averagePork belly plum salad- I like pork belly so it was my second favorite dish.  Very flavorfulDuck liver mousse with almond biscuit- it was average White tuna & avocado on a crisp seaweed cracker-my favorite; very deliciousDevil egg with salmon tartar- this was good as wellPANCAKESUni pancake- I'm not a fan of Uni so didn't enjoy the dishCOMMANDABLESHalf order of the CA State bird  with provisions- it was crispy but slightly under seasoned.DESSERTWorld peace peanut milk- amuse bouche; quite tasty and not too sweetHalf order of two desserts, one of which was ice cream sandwich - it was goodIt was a very casual restaurant with friendly and attentive wait staff.  It was fun watching them prepare the food.  It wasn't difficult standing while eating but it was definitely our first time doing so.  We were told by our waiter that we ate more than two big men:-) If you don't have a reservation, like me =( , show up at 4:15 to be the first one in line, like me! =)I'm not going to give you a whole spiel about why this place is awesome.  I will say that this place serves tapa style dishes so it's best to go with at least 4 people- more people=more food to try!rabbit- tastes like chicken teriyakiduck liver mousse with almond biscuit- slather on a lot of the moussegarlic bread with burrata- yuMmmm!!! I love bread and I love cheese.  Perfect!sweet corn & mt. tam 'shortstack'- YumMm!  We wanted to order another plate but had to save room for the other dishesCA state bird with provisions- the best dish of the night.  crispy, tender, flavorful.pork spare ribs glazed in their own juices- huge!  fall off the bone, finger lickin goodness1/2 dozen cast iron quail eggs- nothing special, pass on this.corn & quinoa- very light, fresh, and love the texturehamachi w/ nori chip- fresh.world peace milk- peanutty.  bittersweet chocolate crunch- a small block of chocolate crunch.  pass on this.ice cream sandwich- best dessertI'm probably forgetting a dish or two but this place lived up to the hype.  We could have passed on some of the dishes but the service, presentation, and of course the creative dishes, deserve 5 stars. Believe the hype. I had high hopes for this place given all the buzz and it absolutely exceeded my expectations. The food is incredible, inventive and on point. We had about 8-10 plates. It's damn near impossible to say no when the servers keep bringing around plate after plate of delicious steaming food fresh from the kitchen. The pork belly was stupid delicious. The barrata garlic bread was heavy, but soulful and bursting with flavor. The salmon belly, words can't describe. And don't forget to order a few tried and true dishes off the menu - the fried quail on top of the onions grilled in lemon are so good I might trade my first born for another plate. It's important to mention how cool the staff is as well. While the food rivals any fine dining in the city, the staff don't allow themselves to get caught in the pretentiousness that often accompanies high end dining. Each server was friendly and playful. The restaurant has a great sort of laid back atmosphere. The head chef and owner was there greeting people and helping with the service. Extremely humble and friendly, he embodies everything a head chef should be.Don't miss State Bird Provisions. It's worth the wait. 5 Stars for the food3 star for the Flow and Service. (please note this is not the servers themselves, who are wonderful, but the overall service experience)I am not an avid reviewer, but I have been here twice, each time with a similar experience so I thought it should be noted. First and foremost the food is simply fabulous, and you MUST save room for dessert! Faves...they do the most amazing things with quinoa  (who knew?!), the State Bird, tuna crudo, nd the Chocolate Birdseed dessert. The food is innovative, simple yet unique flavor profiles, not stuffy, and there is a wide variety of dishes to fit any palate. Now for the concept and service. Once you get seated, you will be greeted by a wonderfully friendly server, who will explain how things work. Then they leave and you can just start picking up plates as they are passed around. Issue...After that initial interaction it is really hard to get their attention. No one comes back to take your drink order! You literally have to flag someone down (after 10 minutes) to order a glass of wine. Meanwhile you see two servers setting a 4-top, while you are still parched and wanting that lovely glass of wine. Next...the passed plates. I wish there was a list (either verbal or written) of the evenings ""tapas"". The flow of the passed dishes is not always consistent, and unfortunately if you are seated not at the front tables, the trays are empty before they get to you. There were several dishes that we missed due to this. We also missed out on the duck liver mousse, bec we didnt see that until we were half way through dessert. We finally asked a server what else they were passing around so we'd have an idea. If we knew what was coming, we could have paced our meal better. You kind of get a feeling of being left to fend for yourself, and it's up to you to ask what is coming next or flag someone down if you want something. State Bird...I love ya, but the service flow issues need to be worked out. Maybe with the new reno??? I also hear the counter is THE place to be. Wish we could have sat there with our reservation. First time we had reservations, second time we got there a half-hour before they opened, and waited in line. You get a seating time, so we went to The Social Study nearby and killed some. The wait is worth it. Our favorite/stand-out item was hands down the SBP 'thali' salad. Of course everything else was excellent too.The girl with the messy blonde hair who handled the reservations/seating times is one of the best service industry associates I've seen; especially having to deal with the SF crowd. We are needy! This is one of those San Francisco dining experiences that you must try. Dim Sum style dining with cuisine from all different cultures? Who would have thought? We came into the meal with sky high expectations thanks to all of the attention State Bird is getting, and we were not disappointed. The food was all amazing!! The restaurant is tiny so now I understand why it is impossible to get a reservation. The vibe is a bit hipster but not over the top.One negative, we had a late reservation, maybe 930 or so. We showed up a bit early and were told it would be a little while until our reservation. Ok no problem. We told the hostess we are going right next door to the Social Study and we'll be back for our reservation time. We showed up 5 minutes after 930 and we were told that our table was given away because we weren't there on time..............Pretty poor. So we had another drink and were seated a little after 10. The menu changes often so I won't give the complete rundown but 95% of the things we tasted were amazing. The flavors and concepts are so different that this is truly a one-of-a-kind experience. Try not to overdo it at the beginning of the meal because you will be fighting back the urge to grab 3 of everything that comes by. It actually ends up being a good thing because you don't really have to decide too much, just get everything. It's great to come with a group of people so you can try lots of different things. Dinner wasn't cheap, about 240$ for 3 people and we didn't drink too much. If we can ever score another reservation we'll surely be back. An awesome restaurant. It is difficult not being glib, and joining the chorus, when I say this is Bay Area fresh/local angled diverse dim sum. AKA small plates of delightful and interesting ingredients rushed past you at a fever pitch. I might even toss in the concept ""gastropub"", because the lack of pretension, as well as paired down but frenetic service, certainly simplifies expectation - just grab what excites you, and pass on anything, without guilt.  The nature of dim sum means this can get spendy in a short period of time, but it's important to romp through the typical menu, and try one or two things off the specials menu.  The quail, the beef, the lamb, oh my....  I am fairly certain it's a worthwhile meal, and a proper way to spend hard earned money.  The only thing is that it may be addictive - you might want to save 2x as much, because you will want to go back.  For such a hip and in demand restaurant, it is nice they allow access by refraining from booking all their tables... It used to be 5p, but show up by 4.30p (or earlier) to hopefully guarantee a first seating when they open at 5.30p.  If you can get there earlier, or have one hold the spot for more, it's a wise idea.  It's truly worth the wait - just don't expect Michelin level china or tablecloths.  This is a room full of people truly excited to be there, proud of what they are producing, and just as excited as the people coming to wait in line. Liked most of the 16 dishes we tried!  Love that the plates are small so we can try a variety of stuff.  Group favorites include grilled octopus, anchovies sesame pancake, ice cream sandwich, fried green tomato, and balsamic roasted figs. Their brilliant concept of a dim sum restaurant serving dishes of infused cuisines from all over the world =  get here early or make a reservation.You will not be disappointed. Read a review of a local Atlanta joint that mentions this place so on a trip to San Francisco we decided to check it out. Went to the web site and had trouble making reservations so we took a chance and showed up at opening to a line out the door.It turns out they hold a third of the seating for walk ups but you need to put in your name ahead of time. We were able to get one of the last time slots of the day (10:45) which was late but we really wanted to try it.Before I get to the food the real stars of this place is the staff. A place of this kid of demand could have a stuffy staff but no. The host was as kind and accommodating as could be. I'm sure she gets a lot of people upset with not getting in or seating so late but you would not know it she is like a ball of sunshine.The wait staff including our waitress was also friendly and really explained the food and showed a great deal of pride in the work of the restaurant. I wish this group could train other staffs.The food was wonderful and familiar while still being creative. We went a little overboard sampling every dish that came by and ordering off the menu but it was worth it. The rabbit and potato salad really was the highlight for me. This place can be as expensive or reasonable as you want it to be if you have the will power to do so.Worth the wait. I rarely give FIVE stars to a place but WOW was this amazing.  We got in line about an hour before they opened to try and get the scarce bar seating but alas, we were not early enough!  However, we were game to try the ""Chef's Table"" right by the window where you stand for the meal and it was awesome.  Seriously.  I kind of loved getting to stand and see the action right there - not to mention talk to the totally subdued and very genial chef / owner.  Next time, I do think I want to try to get a reservation and sit to see what the difference was.  First of all, the way the waitstaff / cooks work is a thing of genius -- they are all able to help you / take your order at any time.  It's kind of like dim sum in that they will bring around the specials of the week -- I think they change the menu every week or so.  Highlights include: pork belly with peaches and fennel, smoked fish with corn and dill, the pancakes (both sardine and sauerkraut), sushi cracker with tombo.  All of it exquisit.  GO.  It's worth the wait.  This is a unique and wonderful dining experience and we are lucky to have it here in SF. Wow....don't be picky. Say yes to everything and you'll be pleasantly surprised. Favorite dish: almond biscuits with goose liver mousse...yeah, super good.  I will say though, as is the problem with many restaurants in SF...you're not just paying for the good food, you're also paying for the privelige to sit in the seat...and something about that just rubs me the wrong way, hence the four stars instead of 5...but seriously, it was a great dining experience. I love this restaurant. My fiancee and I have been lucky enough to go twice in the past 6 months.The experience here is one you will not find anywhere else. The eclectic mix of the delicious gourmet dishes is quite amazing.Last time we went we were extremely lucky and got to sit at the 'chefs table' which is basically the bar right in front of the open kitchen. It was such an amazing experience. To watch them create the dishes right in front of you, and also get the chance to choose what you want first! The chefs are amazing and very friendly, we talked with them almost the entire time. I admit, you need to be a little adventurous to come here, I am a very adventurous eater, but my fiancée  is not as much, but she still loved it. (though she did not try any duck liver mousse or the sweetbread meatballs).I really have to go back to what an amazing overall experience it is to eat here, all of the dishes are amazing, delicious combinations of ingredients you would sometimes never expect to be together. It is fun to try all the different dishes, allowing you to eat a vast array of things, much much more than you would at any normal restaurant. The best part is that you really don't have to do much deciding. You just have to say YES when that cart or that tray comes around. One of my favorites was the pork belly and citrus salad. The flavor of the pork and the fat mixed with that citrus (i believe orange and grapefruit) was a delicious explosion in your mouth, the way the citrus cut through the fat was amazing.Every dish is an experience like that, each bite exploding with flavor.I really could not recommend this place any higher. The only bad thing is trying to find parking and actually getting reservations! Haha...Oh, and you have to try the 'world peace' Peanut  milk with muscovado at the end of your meal. its sooo delicious, its something everyone should experience. What a great, GREAT restaurant!I was in line outside the restaurant as it was about to open, thinking I had little chance to get in that night. Once I got to the dining room manager, I was told the next table was about 4 hours from now. I was about to turn around when she went to talk to the chefs and suggested to make room at the end of the counter for ""table 100"", literally in the chefs' kitchen. Eating and chatting with the chefs made this experience even more memorable. They were really fun and made it a really fun dinner experience.The food you'll ask? Fantastic. I couldn't help myself and got almost all the plates that were offered to me. Favourites: shitake mushroom ravioli in broth, garlic bread with burrata cheese on top, the rabbit and fontina croquettes (OMG!), and the ricotta dumplings!I know it is booked weeks in advance, but do take the chance, it is worth the wait in every way! Holy schnikes.  If this place doesn't collect a few Michelin stars in the future, then perhaps I ought to stop eating out at awesome dining establishments.Let's hope they get those stars.The fiance and I decided to throw caution to the wind and our food destiny to the food deities above and went early to get on the wait list for the legendary State Bird Provisions.  Two hours later, we were rewarded.To save everyone the tiresome, long winded review... the highlights were:- Anchovy sesame pancake.  Get it.  Get two.  Just get it.- State bird with provisions.  It's the namesake, so you have to.  It's like an unspoken rule and you will be judged if you do not follow.- Salmon belly. OMG.  Fatty, tender, juicy, NOM.- Everything in general.  If you can eye a few things first and make sure to save plenty of room to try all of the ""dim sum"" items.Oh, and ask your server for help.  Daniel, who was our food ally of the night, came by and asked if we had already tried some small dishes and made sure we didn't miss any stellar hits.  Huuuuge thanks to him!Recommended tips:- If reservations are out of the question, go extra early for the wait list.  For us, going forty minutes before opening meant eating at 8pm.  If you're able to swing it, definitely try to get there as early as possible if you are swinging by town.  Head over to Japantown (or further north on Fillmore) if you need to burn some time.  It also gives you a great chance to talk more with your dining partners.  Oh, and if it's just the pair of you, ask for the counter!- Pick a few from the menu...definitely wait on the ""dim sum"" items that are unlisted.  Even though the menu was tempting, the ""off menu"" items were definitely worth it.  If it's your first time, you must try the State Bird with provisions (that goes without saying) and, again, the anchovy pancake.- Dessert isn't mandatory.  If you have to plot out your stomach space, as rare as it is for me to say, dessert isn't something you would feel too sad about missing out on. Even though the 'ice cream' sandwiches were tasty...it was okay.  The savory items outshone the sweets on this food trip. Amazing.  Fresh, seasonal.  And the staff was equally amazing.  Yeah, lining up hours ahead of time is quirky at best, but it was still worth it in the end.  We ended up going across the street for drinks and to hang for a bit i was so looking to state bird provision.  it took at least 5 attempts and planning many months in advance to finally secure a reservation at a reasonable dinner time. I thought going on 7/3 would be a great way to start the long weekend, little did i know I would walk out of there disappointed.  maybe i set my expectation way too high due to the james beard award.  I am so sad :( The dishes were interesting.  dim sum style american food with an asian twist.  I tried 1)  Guinea Hen Dumpling (gyoza in a sour broth) 1 piece $32)  Rabbit & Fontina Croquettes (2 meatball size $5)3)  Tombo Tuna-avocado & Seaweed Cracker ($9)4)  Charred Octopus In Tomato-chickpea Salsa ($8)5)  corn pancake (a small stack $10)6)  Grilled Beef ($16)!!!!  this was actually a salad dish with cooked asian vegetables, bok choy, scallion , and shitake mushroom in vinaigrette sauce7)   trout with claims ($9??)8)  lobster/scallop ($12)extremely small portion/bite size (i mean literally bite sized) for the price.  almost everything came room temp or cold except for the croquette and the pancake which were warm.  the octopus was fresh, reminded me of fresh calamari in Italy.  The steak was good although I seriously thought i was getting a hot steak dish but a salad came instead.  the warm bok choy and scallion mixed with cold salad complementing the meat was odd.  I have tried a lot of fusion, and is a huge fan, but state bird's asian twist just wasn't for me.  some asian dishes should remain its original goodness (i.e.:  the gyoza).  the food were on the oily side.  tho i must give the waiter/waitress credits.  the service was great, everyone was knowledgeable, helpful, and efficient.we spent $90 for dinner without drinks or dessert. seriously, for this price, I could be dinning at so many other amazing restaurants in the city. Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here. Loved the concept, loved the rolling dim sum carts, and the service was so friendly. We snagged reservations 60 days in advance, and I am glad we did because I saw the walk-in line.... looked brutal.Favorites:1. duck liver mousse with almond biscuit2. sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancake (the sauerkraut salt was incredible! I wish I could buy some to put on everything...)3. CA state bird with provisions4. ricotta dumplings with spring onion & sunflower seedsOther notables:1. chocolate 'ice cream' sandwich with cherries2. guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth3. raw oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesame4. lobster with corn & green corianderProbably wouldn't recommend:1. balsamic roasted figs with fondue2. garlic bread with burrataThat was all the food we ordered for 2 people. Plenty... With a blackberry limeade, the total was $80 before tip. Not bad at all! Will definitely be back. Variety of food and flavors.Huge Tip:  Try to keep track of what items just came out and what items have been making the rounds.  It is a huge difference; just imagine food fresh out of the oven, versus room temp food...Some things tasted pretty good, but I don't feel they have a dish that people would rave about; it's the variety that people seem to love. Some friends wanted to go to State Bird, so the foodie that I am, I was willing to give it another try.  I am so happy we went!  Service was great, and we ordered to our hearts' content -- the food was yummy and I would come back again for sure! go wait in line. Currently subdued in a lobster-and-fried-tomato-induced comatose bliss, I do believe that State Bird lives up to the hype. The service was impeccable from threshold to farewell, the charming chef and his crew crafted a seamlessly delicious dim-sum style culinary experience. The genuine warmth and friendly expertise of the staff was impressive and heartfelt--for this alone I would return. The menu is constantly shifting, but the staples we indulged in (The State Bird Provision--aka the crispy quail, the trout, the fried green tomatos, and the sweet corn pancakes) were flawless. For dessert, we had the most incredible caramelized coconut cake with a dark chocolate drizzle as well as a berry-infused peach rice pudding--both were some of the most wonderful sweets I've ever had the luxury to taste. This outing is well worth the several month reservation wait. State Bird doesn't miss a beat, and the unique opportunity to try so many exquisite plates in one sitting is a rare, exciting treat. Book it--giggling in elation with my friends over how many different amazing bites we tasted is a memory I won't soon forget. This place is Amaze-balls!  Came by for the second time in two weeks and it was actually more amazing than the last.  New love....ricotta dumplings!  This time only waited 30 min, and was able to kill time with a beer around the corner. Wow. This place blew my mind! So many delicious options, great service, and just an overall delightful experience. We didn't have a reservation but got in line around 5:20pm and got seated immediately! Definitely get the sauerkraut pancakes off the menu. They are insanely delicious!! Have you ever been to a restaurant that has so many interesting dishes on the menu that you want to try everything?? And what if almost every single thing actually WAS good? Well, that's State Bird. My mouth still waters thinking about it.They have an interesting serving style, where most of the dishes are NOT on the menu. Instead, they bring out small plates around, dim-sum style, and you can decide if you want to eat it or not.  This allows you to try out a variety of different dishes, as opposed to the 1-2 appetizers and an entree that you would normally get at regular restaurants.It looks like the menu changes all the time, but some of the highlights from when I went were the grilled baby octopus, ricotta dumplings with shimeji mushrooms, duck liver mousse with honey cornbread, and some clam dish which had a very Japanese-style flavoring to it. We had about 11-12 dishes total, and all but one were excellent!I definitely want to go back, but I hope I can get a reservation... This place is amazing!  It's like getting an amazing tasting menu where you get to pick your options.  I must have tried like 10 different dishes among my friends and I liked them all.  Ended up spending about $62/person with tax and tip.  They are going to be closing for renovations (making the place bigger) in August so they aren't taking any more reservations (they are booked!).  If you want to eat there you have to get there about 45 minutes early and wait in line! State Bird Provisions is one of those places you just have to try at least once.It's american food, it's tapas style, it's served in carts rolled by the different waiters and waitresses that try to sell you the item.Each item has a price, and you get a card with different prices on it, and each time you pick something from the cart, they put a tally next to the price.There are a couple of mains and dessert that are made to order, I guess because this would probably not taste that good if it was carted around and cold or melted.I took pictures of the whole thing, I'll have to post some photos soon.  I really enjoyed it and I highly recommend that you try it once.This is the problem with not writing a review immediately after eating.  It's so hard to remember what you ate.  But the important part is that if the restaurant was so good that it #1 compels you to write something #2 you just have an overall great feeling of when you were there.So go if you can get a reservation. If you can't, my suggestion is go early, like around 4 or 5, usually the first 10 people can snag a seat.  ( provided that you're not an asshole that brings 10 friends with you to a small, cozy, chill restaurant like this) This was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had! We loved all of the food and the staff was very informative and made us feel right at home! I love how they come around with carts, you never know what's coming next! If you can get a reservation, 5:30 is probably the best time so you're seated right when they open! After several late night/early morning reservation booking attempts and having to give away my reservation a month and a half ago at the last minute, I FINALLY went to State Bird Provisions last night!i would not advise going without a reservation. I've heard stories of 4 hour wait times and I saw firsthand some walk-ins eating their meals standing. BUT they are closing for a few weeks starting August 10th to expand the place so hopefully that'll help with the wait/reservation situation.Regardless, this place is worth any reservation/wait-time hoops you have to jump. Very rarely do I find that places meet the hype and almost never do they exceed it! State Bird Provisions is amazing on all fronts.There are around 20 menu items that you can order plus another 12 dim-sum style items that come around on carts and trays (all explained to you by really knowledgeable and patient waiters and all labeled with the price so you don't feel at all hoodwinked).Everything we had was delicious, here's what I can remember though not all will be available when you go...From the menu:- the state bird: nor particularly meaty but the fried skin was insane. Oh, and the onions and cheese! All worked perfectly together.- anchovy pancake: I don't like anchovies but this was incredible. Makes me want to start putting anchovies on everything but I have a feeling it won't be as delicious as they make it here- sourdough sauerkraut and ricotta pancake: another winner, served with dehydrated sauerkraut in a sort of salt form. Just beyond anything I could ever fathom.- the beef: served with broccoli, bok choy and cooked a perfect medium rare- the duck with cloud ears: this was probably the closest to traditional versions; still delicious- quail eggs: I am not big on egg dishes but this was so tasty- chocolate pistachio torte: good but not as good as....- chocolate ice cream sandwich: the ""bread"" of this sandwich is a delectable white brownie; mind-blowing.From the carts/trays:- scallops with avocado: I wish someone would try to drown me in it so I would be challenged to eat my way out- the clams: another seafood hit- liver mousse with almond biscuits: the mousse was light as air and the bread balls (sweet like cornbread!) were perfection- ahi tuna with avocado on a seaweed crisp: I'm probably not describing this accurately at all but it was divine and a favorite of our table (but really, everything was)What I wish we had gotten:- the fried oysters looked terrific- the lobster salad (genuinely regretting this)- cherry granita dessert- kim chi- everything elseWhile it was hard to notice anything else but the amazing and inspired food, the service was beyond reproach. The staff was so nice and patient (we were a bit overwhelmed but needing to make snap decisions with the dim sum options, especially in the beginning and they were happy to re-explain the system or give us our time). The waiters and even the chef himself (genius!) come around very frequently to check on us, refill water, replace our plates every few dishes, provide recommendations. All around stellar service.You honestly can't go wrong in this place. I earnestly believe every dish is a winner. Coming back here in a few weeks! We waited in a queue for an hour to get a reservation or that night at 9pm which we didn't mind and is to be expected in san francisco where for some strange reason people queue up for almost all restaurants! When we arrived at 9 it was another 45 minute wait standing awkwardly in their narrow corridor waiting for a table to open up. Their system is really terrible, they have your cell phone number, I'm not sure why they can't just send you away to have drinks elsewhere and give you a call when your tables ready?! Instead, the (very polite) host kept telling us tables were about to open up in the next few minutes and that we were the next table to be seated and then proceeded to seat other parties before us. It's really not fun to be lied to... The food cart is way too slow, and we waited far too long for the cart to show up at out table by which time it was empty and we had to choose from the scraps other tables didn't want... By this time we were starving and I had to ask our waitress to bring us something, ANYTHING for us to try. The wait staff are really lovely and friendly.The food was good, really loved their duck mousse, the rabbit we were told was served with romesco but it was quite obviously not romesco sauce but some sort of cold green guacamole beany thing, found the rabbit to be a bit on the dry side and overly salty, the garlic bread with burrata was divine, the deep fried quail dish was perfectly balanced with its accompaniments and peanut milk was deliciously simple. We had their cocoa ice cream sandwich which I found to be far too sweet and not enjoyable. I would recommend the place to others but this restaurant really needs to work on their seating system if they want happy diners! The food was good but I'm not sure if it was worth that sort of wait... This was flat-out one of my best dining experiences!!I knew going in that getting a seating would be a challenge. I decided with a friend to go in on a Monday as close to opening time as possible. They open at 5:30 pm and I heard that people sometimes line up at 4:30 pm. Well, we both had work on Monday, so we got there at 5:55pm (I remember because we had to put in 5 minutes worth of coins at the meter). There was a line to put your name on the list. When we got to the front about 10 minutes later, the dude was super nice and let us know that unfortunately all the seats were taken for the night. Wow!! But, they had standing room available at 8:45pm. Cancellations could potentially change things, but otherwise the only option was to have us stand at the counter right by the door. It didn't seem ideal, but we agreed. They took our # and would call us when ready. The whole experience would normally have been frustrating anywhere else, but here the dude was so polite and nice, that we were impressed. We ended up going to Fat Angel for a drink and then Pride of the Mediterranean for Hookah and had an awesome evening waiting for our table.  Okay...so now to the actual dining experience. We were hoping to get bar seating, but ended up at the standing are as originally planned. Turns out that this is the best ""seat"" in the house. Yes, we were right by the door, but we were facing the kitchen and right by the action. Every chef came over and talked to us while doing their thing throughout the night. Everyone was so friendly. They were absolutely slammed with a packed house, but they always took time to talk with us. No one was rushing around, the service never felt hurried, people joked with us when bringing around the food...it was great. The best part was that everyone in the kitchen was having fun! The standing area almost made you feel like you were part of that fun...and that makes the overall experience so ridiculously awesome. Now, the food...Have you ever read one of those ""Choose your own adventure"" books? You flip to a certain page if you want the character to do this or that. Keep that in mind. Now think about a fancy sit down tasting menu with carefully composed dishes at a place like Coi, Ame, Michael Minna, etc.  Now...combine the two, and you have SBP. Yes...that's right...AMAZING. Seriously...each dish could hold it's own against individual tasting menu dishes at a fancy Michelin rated restaurant. But the advantage to SBP is that you can choose your own dining adventure. You can pick whatever suits your mood. From Artichoke Bread Salad to Curried Scallops to Pork Belly to Garlic Bread & Burratta, each dish is unique and composed with various tastes to culinary perfection. It's a completely out of this world experience in the perfect dining environment. Desserts are just as phenomenal. I'm not going to describe each dish...you should just go there and try them out. They have something like 16 dishes that get passed around, plus over 10 more that are listed on the menu that you can order. There are several vegetarian dishes...in fact more than half our dishes were veggie, and they were delicious!I know there are some low Yelp Ratings in other reviews...that's fine. But trust me...make the effort to get a seat...or better yet...STAND. Try it yourself, and make your own decision. Good thing is that you don't have much to lose. If you don't like the food, you can leave after the first dish. But I'm pretty sure you're going to keep ordering more and have a ridiculously amazing dining experience similar to ours. SBP - you guys rock. From the very first taste of the first dish, through the 13 other dishes, all the way down to the last drop of the peanut butter milk shot, we absolutely loved every bit of it. Adding to that was the amazing fun attitude of every person in the kitchen, the wait staff...everyone. Make the entire experience over the top. Thanks, and we'll be back very very soon! You want it.All of it.You just don't know it yet.Until they show you.Presenting their provision wares, all fancy like.You'll be reduced to a fat kid in a candy store. Plenty of ooh's & aah's will be said.Your eyes will be making dirty love to each platter.Stupid pervert eyes with expensive taste.Temptation at every corner. You're in big trouble, mister.Temptation doesn't come cheap, but they deliver on the promise to make it worth it.What can I say, this is possibly the most engaging, interesting, diversely tasty and most FUN dinner I've had all year.Elevated dim-sum in a non-pretentious atmosphere with a personable staff getting down with some creatively delicious provisions that you can't get enough of. I stay in the know in LA, but I can thank my chef lover for knowing about this new gem in SF that I had no clue about. We came to the walk-in line that was probably a good 20 deep by the time we got there. Our estimated wait time was about 3 hours from when they opened, so we meandered around town until then. We were seated at the bars that surround the open kitchen and it made for interesting banter and fun sights.Some of my favorite + most memorable provisions:Tombo tuna-avocado & seaweed cracker: YUM! And so pretty too. For the love of KING TRITON, people, if this dish is till on the menu when you go, please note that the seaweed cracker ""plate"" is not a plate. It's part of the dish that is meant to be eaten. You are MISSING OUT if you don't eat this as intended. We saw people around us picking the tuna and leaving the seaweed..which was lightly fried and crispy..one of the most delicious elements.Curried scallop & avocado with crunchy quinoa: A delightfully fresh, textural treat.Guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth: I love how they pour the broth when you nod ""yes"" furiously upon seeing the tray holding these. This was delicious & so flavorful and just right.Balsamic roasted figs with fonduePork belly peach salad: I love how the peaches cut through the heaviness of the pork belly, making this dish feel surprisingly light.Ricotta dumplings with spring onion & sunflower seeds: I think this was the dish I was thinking of...the little yellow guys on a plate. Loved it.I found the pancakes on the regular menu to be overly loaded with butter for my taste, especially at their petite proportions. But, you might like it. Overall, I recommend coming here when you find yourself in SF. for a true San Francisco treat. This is a hipster joint. the food is good, but the food is disjointed and shares a similar fate IMHO to plum in oakland. everything has a vinegar or pickle component that just makes everything one note.I think the dim sum style eating choices is a bad idea. we tried about 15 dishes in total and there was no flow to the meal.we had the following items in this order1.garlic cheese bread - we got this because the lady said its the last one and we should get it cause its good, well its not good. it was stale and had a clump of soft cheese on top with pepper. what really ticked me off was that 10 min later they made a fresh batch of it. im sure if i had known it would be passed around again i would have waited2. rabbit meatballs - these were filled with cheese and had a creamy tomato sauce. just meh, it was over cooked and usually with rabbit you want to add some sort of fat cause its so lean, nope not here. the meatball reminded me of a cheese stuffed meatball i got at applebees.3. oyster - the oyster was good, it was fresh and expertly shucked. the only issue with the oyster was the sauce it came with. pickled salad of radish. its hard to beat an oyster with lemon and tabasco. this one did not4.sashimi - this was by far the best dish. it was sashimi of white fish with wasabi and various other ingredients served on a blue nori plate. this is where i have an issue with flow. this dish was balanced and delicate and should have been served first. unfortunately it was served in the middle of fatty overpowering vinegar/pickled dishes that muted the subtle flavor combination. if this dish was served to me first i probally would have given this place another start based on this alone.** at this point (15m into our meal) we decided to place an order from the menu we ordered the grilled beef and corn pancakes5. ricotta dumpling - this was horrid. so bland could have used some salt and the mushrooms tasted like canned. i almost spit the mushrooms out but decided to swallow as i was sitting directly in front of the chef who made them and she was watching for my approval.6. cured lemon dumpling - just ok but for 6 bucks for one dumpling i wanted better7. pork belly - this would have been the state birds saving grace. It was crispy pork belly with Asian cilantro jalapeño salad with peaches the flavor combination is great and it has the wow factor that foodies love when trying a new dish in fact I would go back just for this. My issue is with the dim sum format you see I was watching them make it and was salivating for my opportunity to get the first ""dibs"" on it, but they  skipped right passed me and I got the last dish on its way back when it was no longer crispy and the salad wilted. Such a shame cause this dish could have been the difference between the 2 stars im giving it and 4 stars it could have earned** another update, at this point im watching them make the beef and pancakes and i see that this might be more of the same potentially amazing food that i got a glimpse of with the pork belly. the chef finishes and plates my dishes and tells the server where its destiny lies, the the server mistakenly brings it to the couple sitting next to me. arggggh8. kim chi salad - this was good. very asian flavors as expected, had smoked egg on it and i liked it9. duck liver mousse - this was the weakest dish by far it was almond cake like cookies with a alcohol tasting mousse. the cakes taste like desert and the mouse which had a great texture was overpowered by the port that it was infused with10. squid salad - great taste but sadly over cooked, was like seafood chewing gum**10 at this point i see that my beef and pancakes have been made and served to other people that ordered after me. and im not happy about it, but im starting to think it was a happy accident cause im pretty full. we grab a waitress and inform her to cancel the two orders but instead she insists that the items being made currently are earmarked for us and its too late.11. grilled beef - this was a major disappointment, the beef was expertly cooked to a medium   doneness but again covered in vinegar. i just dont get it, if i want vinegar flavor ill order a salad, if i order beef i want beef flavor12. corn pancakes - just plain corn pancakes. not great, just standarddished 13, 14, and 15 were dishes that they pretty much guilted me into getting. sometimes the chef said that he made it for us cause he thought we would like it, sometimes they said the dish is the best and will not be made again tonight. whatever the reason every time we got guilted into taking one we were disappointed.my final recommendation would be to by all means check this place out, but its not anywhere near the level of food that people are reviewing as such.save your money and you can get many of the same flavors at your local highly rated cheap Chinese/vietnamese/asian restaurant"|5|100|0|Routine|This inspection has no violations.|GOOD: no inspection needed
State Bird Provisions 2|4.5|Tapas/Small Plates in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|1051|2|4.2543554006968645|" Excellent Service! Excellent Food! Excellent Décor!It is difficult to get a reservation here at State Bird Provisions. HINT: trick is to get here early before they open at 5:30PM and get on their walk-in list. I've seen folk line up as early as 4:30PM! My recommendation would be getting here around 5PM. If you're lucky, you can get a table when they open. If not, most likely you would get a table for 2 at 7PM or later at 9PM. This restaurant is not meant for large party; best to have a party of four max.Emily, our hostess, was a warm and welcoming face for Provision and 'seated' us by 7pm by the standing table (door area), Even though I was at the standing table , I thought it was one of the best 'seats' in the house. We got to interact with various sous chefs and was usually offered first in everything that was coming out of the kitchen. At Provision, they bring out a platter of the same dish (similar to the idea of dim sum) for you to take or not to take. If you do decide to take a dish, they will mark your menu and keep track of your orders. There are also dishes you can order off the menu, but the best ones are the fresh ones coming out of the kitchen for you to nab. I've literally almost tried everything that was coming out of the kitchen. What stood out for me even after a month were  the Hamachi Nori Cracker and the Macaroon Ice Cream Sandwich. Everyone should have their own Cracker and Ice Cream for sure! It's so good that you won't want to share!Tip: - free dessert shot if 'seated' by the standing table' (by front door)-kill some time with Happy Hour close by on weekdays-wear comfortable shoes Overall, Provision was so good that I wanted to grab another meal before I left the Bay area. Unfortunately, they are closed on Mondays. Provision would you please send me some yummy Macaroon Ice Cream Sandwiches? A girl can dream, right? Keep up the good work;  your dishes are tasty and creative, till my next visit! It was the most over-hyped restaurant of all time. I walked in at 845pm on a wed night and was immediately seated  with no reservation. Shortly after, a massive line formed so I guess I was really lucky.We ordered the sour dough pancakes and state bird off of the menu and got the rest of the dishes from the carts.The first thing we ate was the dumplings which were not much better than a pot sticker. Not impressed.Our statebird came and was a great dish. Probably the best quail I have and will ever eat but it begged the question why you would even want to eat quail in the first place. It was rough on the outside but juicy on the inside. Pretty good but felt like i was eating a fancy chicken wing.Next, the seafood cart came and I ordered three items, a lobster and honeydew dish, a scallop dish and some stopped oysters. The oysters were actually really great. I cannot remember what the topping was but it was a nice addition to a strait oyster on the half shell. The scallop and lobster dishes were good and creative but just did not blow me away with taste.lastly, the pancakes came and were pretty tasty and interesting. Sort of a new take on a latke. Again, a creative and tasty dish but nothing that I would crave.And that was it. I walked out of there wondering what all the fuss was about. With not hype this place would have probably gotten a 4/5 from me. The food is well prepared and there are some creative dishes for sure. However, due to the hype I am going to give it a 3/5 as it set my expectations too high. I also really liked the dim sum theme. However, at the end of the day, the taste of the food is the most important part of the meal and I have tasted better food elsewhere. This was one of my favorite meals, ever. I love small plates. Each dish we tried was surprising and exciting. The atmosphere was fun and relaxed.  My only complaint: hearing the thumping of club music while eating is annoying. The first time this place caught my eye was when I read about it in Bon Appetit in the top 10 Best New Restaurants in America article. One of my girlfriends managed to get us a reservation for 4 (over a month in advance) and I heard so much hype and positive reviews on this place that I flew up to San Francisco to try it for myself.End result: worth every penny.It's really a great place -- the whole ""dim sum"" spin on things is truly brilliant. While the food was delicious, the whole dining experience is really what made everything memorable. It's just a great little space to go to with a bunch of friends and just hang out and eat (and eat, and eat). I can honestly say that we didn't pass up any dish that came by the table. Everything looked so beautiful and tasted as good as it looked. Needless to say we quickly ran up our tab, but like any dim sum place, it's better to go with a large group so you have the opportunity to try more items.Like most people say on here -- order the CA State Bird when you go. It's a must and it's damn good. Fun and novel concept, great variety of unique and tasty dishes. Spendy but not super spendy. Hipster atmosphere.There are 2 kinds of really great restaurants. The ones that are constantly striving to be unique and different, changing their menu constantly. And the kind that really only do a small handful of dishes, but have perfected them over many years. This is the first kind.Long waits. Reservations were booked weeks ahead. We went on a Saturday, lined up for opening, then got quoted a 9pm seating.The food: the best thing is really the variety. Overall, I felt no dish was really done to perfection, even though everything was enjoyable. Which is what happens when dishes rotate so often, everything is pretty good but nothing you fall in love with.We had most of what was going around that night, like the garlic bread with burrata, guinea hen dumpling with broth, ricotta dumplings, oysters, duck liver mouse, grilled octopus, scallops, quail eggs, a tofu skin dish, as well as ordering the trout and quail off the menu. Most of it was very good, but no dish was OMG OUTSTANDING. I particularly liked the guinea hen dumpling, mostly because of the broth. The octopus was also nice, but we've had a better version at Son of a Gun in LA. The scallops were a bit strange, I enjoyed it but my wife did not. Fried pork belly - this is the heart attack plate. I like pork belly that's been braised then finished in the oven. But fried is okay too.Ice cream sandwich was tasty, but the ""macaron"" was a bit hard to eat because it did not pierce easily with the fork.Their food tended to be on the vinegar-y side, with the use of pickled or preserved items to bring in acid to the dish. Which is fine, but just so you know in case you hate pickles for whatever reason.Sat at the bar and chatted with the chefs while they were cooking, which was fun. The atmosphere is very personal. Almost too personal. If you didn't accept a dish a waiter was bringing around, it felt like you were hurting their feelings a little bit.Mostly the appeal of this place is the ability to eat 10 different dishes by looking at them instead of reading a description on a menu. Would go back if wait times were more reasonable and we lived closer. place opens up at 5.30pm, you should get there at 5pm and stand in line! There is a reason why you stand in line...cuz it's good! Some items are GREAT some NOT. Prices on dishes adds up FAST...Very tasty This reso was booked 2 months out, but the wait and anticipation was so worth it! This experience was out of this world and up there with Lazy Bear Underground Restaurant. The dim sum format was awesome as it allowed us to try nearly 20 menu times between 4 people.Here were the standouts (all BOMB.COM): CA state bird with provision, sweet corn pancake, pork belly plum salad (OMG this is was BOMB), curried scallop, smoked wild king salmon, tombo tuna avocado & seaweed cracker, and lemon curd ice cream sandwich (this is super interesting).Also, REALLY good were: eggplant frites, garlic bread with burrata, charred octopus, anchovy pancake, and quail eggThe items that were just OK in comparison to the rest were: spare ribs (too salty), duck (too plain; i prefer regular peking duck from chinese restaurants), and the chocolate pistachio torte (too dark/rich for my taste).The fact that I had 7 separate ""OH MY GOD THIS IS THE BOMB"" moments for under 80 bucks might make this my new favorite restaurant in SF Meh!Honestly a 2.5 is the best I would give this place. I am tired of over hyped, rude, hipster driven places in san francisco where people don't have a clue about good customer service and good food. They are so caught up in their fancy, unpronounceable ingredients which they are so utterly clueless about and have forgotten the basics.In any case, it's worth a visit if you have a reservation and want to see a new, gimmicky place but please be prepared for rude, customer service. Our waiter just appeared to be grumpy from the moment we sat down and we honestly felt talked down to. He didn't have any time for us or maybe he was just overworked. Plus we waited and waited for the magical 15 dishes that were not on the menu to appear dimsum style. Only half of them did in the 2 hrs we were there and we were made to feel like it was our mistake to arrive when we did (i. e. our reservation time) because apparently we had missed a lot of the dishes from the previous batch. They kept asking us repeatedly if we wanted to order from the menu or if we were waiting for more savory dishes. Seriously annoying.After a good 30-40 minute gap with no new dimsum dishes we asked for the check and our waiter turned completely cold. We couldn't believe it. Clearly we didn't eat enough food or spend enough money for him and his attitude was shocking. It just left us with a bad taste in our mouth walking out of the restaurant.Now the food. Nothing was mind blowing.Only memorable dishes were the smoked trout and everything bagel pancake, the ricotta dumpling with pumpkin sauce, the fried quail eggs and so some extent the name sake dish though it was a bit greasy and not as crispy.Nothing besides the ricotta dumpling above from the dimsum cart was worth it. We ordered 6 different things out of desperation waiting for food.My husband and his dad weren't impressed with the steak tartare salad and his dad lives in France. The quinoa and the vegetable dish was completely forgettable, in fact I wish I could forget them. 4.5 starsI ate here last night with a hungry group of 4 excited diners.  We ordered almost every item delivered by their mobile expediters carrying trays.  We also didn't shy away from the amazing seafood cart and items off the fixed menu.  Favorites from the fixed menu were the roast Duck/pancake, Fried Quail, Quail eggs, sweet corn/cheese pancakes, and 3 different desserts.  In all I would say our meal was executed commensurate with the reputation/hype.  My only recommendation is to make sure you go with a group so that you can try more of the dishes they offer.  Without a lot of time to spare there really is no way to line up reservations for this place with regularity.  So small groups will be stuck ordering only a handful of the many amazing choices.  Also make sure that the group you eat here with have flexible palates as the protein choices have a delicious range.  I cannot wait to go back here as my first meal left me in complete bliss. For any of you Foodies you probably have already heard of State Bird (what I've heard it commonly referred to as) the James Beard Best New Restaurant WINNER for 2012. It's a very small intimate restaurant (plan to call 60 days ahead to get a resi then when you're there make your next resi) and that's part of the charm. For a non adventurous eater be bold and try whatever is available. Save room for the cart vs. ordering too much off the menu prior to seeing the amazing cart options. I usually say save room for dessert however here I think the starters and entree's are so fabulous you may prefer to try everything vs. saving room for dessert. My second visit was my birthday dinner and we didn't hold back, trying everything on the menu and a few things more than once! My favorite's include: State Bird (it's a must try), Curried Scallops, Tuna Tartar (I normally don't like this dish but loved it here), Guinea Hen Dumplings, Spare Ribs, & Steak & Tartar.  Coming from New York where hot new restaurant's come with attitude the team at SB couldn't be nicer. Forrest is the host who's beyond adorable, patient and helpful and the chefs (was able to meet and chat with Glen the Sous-Chef during our wait) were also super friendly and approachable.  State Bird is not only AMAZINGLY delicious, unique , fab food but also amazing people. What a fabulous spot, totally worth the 2 month wait!Read more details:jsfashionista.com/san-fr… Remember to make reservation or try to, otherwise, prepare to go even before they are open and wait. This place is filled with so many unique tapas! There are so much on the menu as well as those that were being carted around and not on the menu. I love the dim-sum concept for this tapa restaurant. I swear every time someone take something out, I want try it! All the food look so fresh and vivid. Some of the ones that I recommended would be duck mousse with almond biscuit, CA Bird of Provision, the lobster, the peking duck and the hamachi on fried seaweed. Everything is small, but so, so flavorful!The waiters were super nice and helpful. I think next time I'll try to sit at the ""bar"" so I can see the chefs in action! Super tough to get a reservation at this place. Had to log-on to the website at like 6am to get a reservation 60 days in advance... and still could only get an 8:30 seating.  That being said, totally worth it. A very cool, dim sum-like concept, where the waiter/waitress brings around platters full of small plates. Each has a price, and you say either yes or no.  You can also order directly off a menu, and we ordered their signature dish, which is crispy fried quail.  Highly recommend this place for someone looking for a fun dinner experience Its still just as good as when they opened, but I feel like its slightly more accessible. I had to wait 5 minutes for a table at 9 pm. Not bad at all.  I have attempted to go more, but the wait is always too long. I just keep thinking I will get lucky like I did on this occasion. Even at 9 pm I would not be amazed if they told me I would have to wait for a long time. I have been a couple times, I was less impressed overall this visit simply because I know what to expect.I know there are going to be amazing selections and combinations of flavors that are unexpected. I know I am going to learn something new. I know I am going to leave happy and having eaten just the right amount. I know that I am going to spend a lot of money. The staff is cool, its a fast paced environment and its got to be hard work. But the stay cool. The signature dish is stupendous. The things they do with seafood, great pairings and tons of creativity. Fresh ingredients. If you have not been yet, but your thinking about it you should just go. Gotta give these guys 5 stars. The basics:  Service is great - ask questions, joke around, learn something. They even gave us the Duck Liver Mousse/Almond Biscuit while we were waiting for our table. Everyone that works there is knowledgeable, interactive and really look like they enjoy what they're doing.  Prices aren't bad (especially what you get, and especially for the City). Atmosphere great - not stuck-up, not divey, but Fun, somewhat loud and exciting.I'm not a food pro, but I do eat a lot - I have to say everything we had was amazing.   The kind of amazing where you don't want to use your napkin because there are still good flavors left to be had after you put that delicious quail leg down.(Get the State Bird w Provisions, 1/2 order for 2 people, Full for 4).   The kind of delicious where when you get the garlic bread and burrata and the burrata ends up all over your face and you still can't use that napkin. A few other favorites in no particular order:-Guinea Hen Dumpling with Broth.  Get one for each person. Drink the broth when your dumpling is done.-Clam & sungold tomato salad. Wish there was a little more sauce, but clams were perfection.-Duck Liver Mousse/Almond Biscuit - Fo' Free. Delicous small bites.-charred octopus in tomato-chickpea salsa - great texture, 'salsa' is great - salty and spicy. Crunchy octopus parts are the best!-tombo tuna-avocado & seaweed cracker  - this could have been my favorite, though it is nearly impossible to choose. Get this.-smoked wild king salmon with pea hummus & meyer lemon - very good, especially if you liked smoked fish of any kind. -sourdough, sauerkraut pancakes. Comes with this saurkraut salt. I was eating just the leftover salt with my fingers when the cakes were gone... -lemon curd 'ice cream' sandwich, poppy seed macaron, blueberries, fennel. Wow. So an ice cream sandwich - but instead of the normally delicious fake chocolate 'bun', they make it out of a flippin' delicious poppy macaron. Couldn't get enough of this.In short, go here. Enjoy, Have Fun and eat til you can't. Our spirits were in high flutter as we stood in line.  I've eaten here several times before so I was certain it was worth the wait.  Inside, this place is quite small.  We were lucky to get one of the last standing spots near the door.  This location is a bit on the colder side (obviously) but it is choice if this is the only option.   We began by inquiring about their gluten free options.  This was not a problem although the pancakes are out of the question.  The food here has remarkable presentation.  We were delighted by the taste of just about everything.  Visually, the food is put together with such thought and precision.  The servers come along in their dim style manner, waving their trays about.  I fancy saying yes to all options, as they continue to be favorable, yes, all of them!   It's all incredible!  I love this dining style, it feels so interactive and exciting, the dinner just continues to happen and evolve.  We left properly overjoyed! It was a crazy process getting a reservation, so if you want to go any time soon make a reservation ASAP! The tapas were all so amazing. The peking duck was spectacular (from the main menu). If you're there are going to splurge you have to get the dessert. The menu always changes and it's always great. I lucked out that one of my bosses had an extra reservation here that he wasn't going to use.  Score!  I've since learned how difficult it is to get a reservation here.We came in early on a Monday night and were seated over the kitchen bar.  It was a lot of fun interacting with the kitchen and everyone was super nice and you could tell they really enjoyed what they were doing.Loved their burratta, fried state bird and beet salad served with nasturtium leaves.  Very cool, normally I only see the flowers.  We enjoyed it so much we purchased a gift certificate for our friends to try.  I hope they were able to make a reservation. For the first of many upcoming birthday dinners, I chose the recent winner of the James Beard award for ""Best New Restaurant"". As it was a last minute decision, getting reservations was out of the question. After reading some Yelp suggestions, we showed up  at 4:25 p.m. and were the first in line for the walk-in lines. Half an hour later, there was a crowd of 25 behind us. It was a sunny but breezy cold afternoon in the city, and both of us commented how we had never done this before (wait in line for over an hour to eat in a restaurant). We were, however, able to watch some food preparation going on through the front window, and it looked like it would be worth the wait. Doors opened promptly at 5:30 p.m., and people with reservations were taken first to their tables. Walk-ins get sat at the chef bar or small drink bar, there is even a place for four if they are willing to stand while they eat their meal; we opted for the drink bar. What followed in the next hour and a half was a dizzying whirlwind of small plates of delectable food brought by on a cart (dim-sum style) or offered to us by servers walking by. We had pork belly, oysters, mussels, curried scallops, octopus, rabbit croquettes, duck liver mousse, guinea hen dumplings, smoked salmon, and sashimi on a seaweed bruschetta. The only items we had off the menu were the state bird (quail), sea urchin pancakes, and dessert (chocolate torte). The speed at which we were offered food was a bit overwhelming. After around 45 minutes, I started to feel the start of a early food coma. It wasn't the wine that brought it on, but just the large amount of rich food I consumed in a very short time.  I slowed down a bit and luckily felt better after a short time. Unfortunately, we didn't leave room in our stomachs for the Peking Duck, Garlic Bread with Homemade Burrata, Red Trout, Glazed Pork Ribs, or Lemon Curd Ice Cream Sandwiches. Regrettable, but I will definitely be back. And soon.My advice to Yelpers: Pace yourself. JUST SAY NO (but rarely) or better yet  ""I'LL TRY THAT LATER"". The servers probably moonlight as car salespeople because they do a good version of the relentless (but very polite) hard sell. If they see you wavering, they might opt to make up your mind for you... ""OK, I'm just going to make this decision for you, you know you want it!"" All of the servers were GREAT, by the way, and obviously love this restaurant. It probably is so much fun to work in a place where people are enjoying themselves so much. Will make a small mention of the bathroom (for you folks interested in this restaurant feature): There is only one unisex bathroom. However, it is nicely appointed with a fun painting of the USA with all the state birds listed on their corresponding states. The decor of the whole restaurant was interesting too, as some other reviewers have noted. But I was much too focused on the sensations my taste buds were having to really take much notice.Our bill, after stuffing ourselves with a plethora of food and two glasses of wine each, was $175 (not including tip). Really a deal considering how much wonderful food we consumed and what a fabulous time we had. Well worth the wait!!!! Just do it. You won't regret it one bit. Look I don't even remember all the things we stuffed our faces with, but I DO remember that it was all delicious. And the servers were fun. They didn't take themselves too seriously. Which is doubly impressive in SF.We made a rule: If it doesn't have meat or fish in it, we're not ordering it. It turned out to be a great rule, because when one of our party broke it, and he was disappointed. That's not to say the vegetarian items aren't good. We're just a carnivorous bunch.Some highlights:- Duck liver mousse ... yeah, it's fantastic- Fried pork belly. Why? Because. It's Fried. Pork. Belly.- Dumplings. Actually a light and fun bite, was a nice ender.- Seaweed bruschetta type thing...it was flipping amazing!!- State bird. Very very yummmyThe only thing we didn't LOVE was the blood sausage. It was a much milder flavor compared to all the other in your face items.If you can get a reso, EAT HERE. Apart from the ridiculous reservation operations and wait time for non-reservationists, this place churns out good food with an interesting twist in service.  I didn't have reservations so I arrived at the restaurant 10 minutes before it opened, only to find that there were at least 30 people already in line ahead of me. By the time I spoke to the hostess a few minutes after 5:30, I was told the wait would be 2 hours for a standing spot at the counter in the front area of the restaurant and to return around that time unless I receive a text with an earlier spot.  So my friend and I bided our time over drinks and a couple of snacks at a wine bar around the corner.  I received a text at 7:10 that our table was ready.  After closing out our tab and heading over to SBP, we were seated at a counter in the middle of the restaurant, WITH STOOLS!  So that was a pleasant surprise and a good start to my dining experience there despite the long wait time.  We had a very pleasant staff person/waiter standing in front of us, who would handle our menu orders and drinks.  We ordered the garlic bread with burrata, CA state bird with provisions and the Mendocito sea urchin pancakes off the menu.  There were other staff walking around with either carts or trays of food to offer to diners, akin to dim sum style.  We decided on the roasted vegetables romesco, raw oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesame, dashi pickled greens and smoked wild king salmon with pea hummus & meyer lemon.  The garlic bread with burrata was pretty good but the bread became a bit too overwhelming and dense the more I ate it.  The CA state bird and Mendocito sea urchin pancakes were amazing.  The roasted vegetables romesco was good but the almonds were not blended in the sauce and were left whole, so the dish tasted better when you took a bit of everything including the almonds.  I didn't really care for the dashi picked greens but the smoked wild king salmon was amazing.  My friend was avoiding dairy so she didn't want dessert but the pleasant waiter in front of us told me that they could make a half portion of the lemon curd ice cream sandwich, which he recommended as his favorite dessert.  The dessert was pretty good but what was astonishing to me was how well it paired with the fennel.  The good will of the restaurant to be willing to half portion my dessert was a good end to my pleasant dining experience here.  In general, the staff here is very nice and pleasant despite how busy the place was.  I would love to come back and try more of the dishes but am a bit wary of the wait time. I'm glad that I have finally gotten a chance to try the food at State Bird Provisions. I live right across the street and alway see a long line even before they open. It has been on my list of places to try and last week I finally got the opportunity.Reservations a hard to come by. However if you line up before they open you can snag a table. The reserve the counter area for walk ins. It's actually quite nice to sit in this area. It's not as private as an actual table, but I actually enjoyed it because you get to watch the chefs as they prepare each dish.The food is delicious. It's kinda of like dim sum style. The chefs prepare various dishes and take them by each table on trays. You just grab what you want and the mark it down on your sheet. Everything we tried was delicious! However my favorites were there Hamachi Nori Cracker (AMAZING!) and the Poppyseed Macaron Ice Cream Sandwich. Both are must haves!Definitely worth it the wait. If you can score reservations that's better, but if not try to line up before they open. I think they open at 6PM, so I'd try to be there by 5:30 to get your name on the list. We ended up with seats by 7:30, but it's worth it. Just put your name down and grab drinks at Fat Angel around the corner! Whether or not you like State Bird Provisions comes down to one thing, and one thing only.  Do you like (or are you a), hipster?The food is excellent.  It's a strange concept to only have half the menu on the printed menu, the rest is brought round on trolleys and you either have it if you like the look of it, of you don't if you don't (or if you're already full).  It's an interesting concept, that really doesn't work all that well, since you can't plan your dining experience.  We found ourselves not taking something we liked the look of out of concern that we might be too full for something that may come later.  Not knowing what might come later really impacts what you might eat.  While it's an interesting idea, and helps the restaurant stand out from the crowd, it really doesn't work.What lets the place down is the decor and the servers.  Everything is all oh so cool, in the sense that the art on the walls is hung by copper wire instead of picture string, so as to make it look as if it has been hung using whatever they had lying around, because they are too cool to worry about going and getting the right stuff to hang pictures.  The problem is with trying so hard to look cool is it is so obvious you've done it.  I'm an electrical engineer and I don't have copper wire just lying around - clearly they went to buy it just to make themselves seem more spontaneous.  It's pathetic, and it pervades the place.  Another reviewer referred to it as feeling like you're eating in a schoolroom - my wife and I had exactly the same discussion while we were there.Similarly, the waiters we all oh so cool.  The blood sausage they brought round hadn't been bought from a supplier, it was made by, ""one of their friends"".  The desperate efforts to seem like they are incredibly individual, when really they are just conforming to the culture they have decided to conform to really began to grate with me.When all is said and done, the quality of the food papers over many of the cracks of the place, and that's good.  When you go for a meal, the food should be the primary concern, and they got that very right.  The deserts especially were fantastic (I'd put the rice pudding I had in the top 5 deserts I've ever eaten).  It's a little expensive ($140 for two people, and we had very little alcohol - 2 beers between us), but fair play to them, the line of people waiting to eat is testament to the fact the prices are OK.The overriding question for me with most restaurants is, would I go back, and this place gets a resounding no.  If you're into doing everything you can to make it look like you're an individual, you'll probably love it.  If you don't, you'll enjoy the food, but find the place itself irritating. 3.5 starsA caveat: Bon Appetit named State Bird Provisions best new restaurant of 2012 and the restaurant has received all sorts of awards and accolades since. I think I was probably there on an off day. I'm therefore clicking on four stars instead of three for my 3.5 star rating because, to be honest, I would probably trust Bon Appetit over my single visit. State Bird Provisions' is built on a great concept. It's like non-exclusively Chinese dim sum. Dim Sum is amazing and taking the experience outside of the morning and opening it up to other culinary viewpoints (does that phrase sound like something from Top Chef, or what?) is brilliant. I will not call the dishes tapas, however, because I have found tapas restaurants to be way overpriced and State Bird Provisions is pretty reasonable. So here's how it works: 1) You try to get a reservation and discover that the restaurant is totally booked for the next 60 days. 2) Wait in a long line. In our case, we arrived at 5pm on a Tuesday (the restaurant opens at 5:30) and were given an approximate time of 7:30 for a seating.3) Have a drink and olives at Fat Angel nearby.4) You'll get a menu from which you can order small plates. You can order from this menu if you want, but wait first to see what will come out of the open kitchen. A cart will be wheeled around with different small dishes for you to choose from. If you sit at the bar, as we did, the chefs and servers will offer you dishes the moment they are ready. The experience is interesting and fun and, no doubt, the food is sophisticated and creative. This is probably the hardest gig for servers in town because they have to be salesmen as well as servers. I think it must take a really outgoing personality and I really give the servers there credit. My criticism, however, is that it just wasn't really seasoned the day we were there. I actually do not have much of a taste for salt at all. So if I felt that it needed a little, this lack was very noticeable. We almost ordered the cheesecake, which looked good when I saw other people order it, but the server convinced us to try this mochi thing which, to be honest, was not good. Afterwards, my friend and I realized nothing was really memorable. My friend said that the olives at Fat Angel were actually the best food we ate that night. Overall, I think one of the cooks had an off day or an overly light hand with the salt the night we were there. I'd try it again--but only when the lines go down! I can attest to the 4 hour wait! We got here at 6pm on a Saturday to put our name down and they told us we would probably be seated at 10pm (which was pretty accurate). If you know you're coming to wait, go to Social Study and get a drink or go watch a movie while you booze at Sundance. Or even go get a massage a Kabuki Springs. It'll help pass the time. They told us people started lining up at 4:15 for seats if you didn't have reservations. They reserve the bar area for walk ins which I actually really enjoyed. You get to watch the chefs prepare the food and you get first dibs on the plates that come out. They have a regular menu to order from and they also come around with various trays and carts of dishes that you can decide if you want to order or not. They all seemed to range from $5-$10 each depending on what they were. We were lucky to have been able to make a future reservation while we were there. Worth the daunting 4 hour wait and we didn't feel rushed at all even at 10pm! Excellent service from the staff as well. The best dining experiences I've ever had in San Francisco. My fiance and I decided we wanted to go to state bird provisions early enough that we didn't need a reservation. We got there on a Saturday night about 20 minutes before opening and there was already a 20 person line waiting ahead of us. 15 minutes later we felt pretty good about ourselves because there were another 20 people behind us in line. 5 minutes later a chef from the restaurant came out and asked if anyone had reservations. He asked that anyone with reservations please line up in another line. Of course, the 20 people behind us all had the forethought to make a reservation and immediately moved to another line.Eventually, the doors of the restaurant opened and we were in the last group of people who didn't get seated. The restaurant isn't tiny but the 30 people with reservations filled up a large portion of the restaurant. When we finally got to the front of the line we were told our table would be ready in 3 hours (8:30pm). We decided to just hang out in the area and grab a cocktail before our table was ready. Around 7:30pm they called us and we immediately ran down the street to the restaurant. I expected we'd end up sitting in the dining area but it was basically full and we had to sit at the bar instead. I assumed sitting at the bar would be a kind of crappy experience but I couldn't be more wrong. You only get the PRIVILEGE to sit at the bar if you DON'T have a reservation. The huge advantage of sitting at the bar is you're 5 feet away from the chefs having a great time making amazing food.Unlike your typical kitchen, these chefs are basically working autonomously. They're prepping a handful of dishes on their own and they're not waiting for anyone else on the line to hand them the next thing they need. You'd think this would be inefficient but it just works. They're making small dim sum plates for a small restaurant. The best part of this is they have time to stop, hangout, talk to everyone sitting at the bar and the rest of the staff because no one is waiting on them to finish prepping a some part of a dish. We ended up meeting everyone who was working there. It was an extremely relaxing and delicious experience. We'd randomly see a chef cooking something and we'd say ""Hey! watcha making?"", ""Oh this? this is a something something something something, want me to make you one too?"", ""hell yeah!"". This pattern of randomly asking about/receiving food continued for about an hour and we were absolutely stuffed. In addition to asking about what they were making, we also asked about how they had prepped things. My fiance and I are huge foodies and love to know how the sturgeon fish was brined/smoked and what the chefs love to cook when they're not working. We got all sorts of advice on topics ranging from cooking technique to favorite dives in the city (the chefs literally found a piece of paper and wrote everything down).Amazing food, amazing atmosphere, amazing staff, what more could I asked for? Well, the bill was a hell of a lot less than I thought. I'm used to paying too much for great food. I'm happy to pay for good food cause I love it that much. My bill at State Bird Provisions, $90 for two people including drinks. I thought something must be wrong, they must have missed the beer or something. Nope, fancy fusion dim sum is just a little more expensive than regular dim sum and just as filling.Totally worth the 2 hour wait, 5 stars without a doubt. Probably one of the best meals you're going to get in the city because of great staff and amazing, inovative food! Love the dim sum style that allows you to try just about everything! Anyone who questions the quality has rocks in their head! We somehow scored a reservation to this place without actually making one! I have no idea how that happened but i am glad it did. The food was amazing, the service was okay, we had to wait about 30 minutes past our reservation time but it was worth it. The food was inventive, fun, and priced within reason. It was worth the visit. There are a fantastic number of restaurants in San Francisco.  It really is a foodie town and eating has become one of the things I love most about it.  But not only is the food what I live for, but also the experience of the meal.  Coming together with friends and being brought into an installation of decor, atmosphere, and cuisine.  It makes it for me.  I've sat in an array of restaurants, from hole in the walls to Michelin star rated, and I always come with the same openness to the experience.  Some places have the worst service imaginable BUT the best food so there is a willing sacrifice.  And some places have food that's good, by no means amazing, but service that's incredible so it shines.  Not only can the food make a difference in the experience, but the service can as well.It is a treasure to come to a place that has it all right; fantastic food and extraordinary service.  When there's so much hype about a restaurant it's very difficult to not come in without an expectation.  I had heard nothing but positive things about the food State Bird Provisions so I was prepared to let that part of the experience happen on its own.  It truly is an amazing accomplishment by the chefs.  The food was killer, the flavors were excellent, and the meal was a highlight of my eating life in San Francisco.Along with the incredible food, the front of house staff was beyond.  From the moment we arrived there was a feeling of being welcomed from everyone.  The service is based off a dim sum service, so throughout the night you meet a lot of different staff members as they bring you food and everyone who came to our table made a great impression.  At the same time, our actual server Janice (NOT Jan!) was close by, attentive, and charming.Food highlights:QUAIL EGGS.  I could have eaten 5 of those.duck liver mousse with almond biscuitricotta dumplings with spring onion & sunflower seedspork belly'peking duck'lemon curd 'ice cream' sandwich  !!The difficulty of getting a reservation should not deter you from trying.  It is worth the wait and a necessary experience to all foodies in San Francisco.  And when you do get in, order everything (because it might be a while before you get back in) How to Have a Great Meal at State Bird Provisions:1)  DO make a reservation before they win any James Beard Awards.***whilstinsf.tumblr.com/po…2)  DO eat snacks in the afternoon since the only reservation you could get was for 9pm on a Tuesday.3)  DON'T show up early as there isn't really a waiting area and you may be waiting a bit past your reservation time.4)  DO take in the eye candy of plates coming out of the open kitchen and the cool kinda-of-reminds-me-of-a-tool-or-rock-climbing-­wall decor.5)  DON'T let anyone take a sip of your refreshing, unique, and very pink Rhubarb Soda ($3).  (Otherwise you will find yourself with a half empty glass.)6)  DO start off with the dish that you've been eyeing, the fried Garlic Bread with Homemade Burrata ($8).  DON'T grab another one (although you really, REALLY want to.)7)  DON'T order more than a few small items off the menu so you can try as many dishes as possible.We loved the the crispy skinned CA STATE BIRD with Provisions ($8) and the perfectly brown butter cooked Red Trout sprinkled with mandarins and hazelnuts ($11/$22).  We also tried the Glazed Pork Ribs but due to the mushy texture and abundance of salt we preferred the swiss chard that came with it ($10).8)  DO try a bunch of items off the trays.  Our favorites were the Guinea Hen Dumpling in a flavorful and citrusy broth ($3) and the spicy, balanced Yubu Noodles with house made Kimchi and Smoked Egg 'Bottarga' ($7).We also tried the more basic Golden Beet 'Caesar' (solid) ($4) and the Octopus in Tomato Salsa (rather chewy) ($7).  9)  DO check out the seafood cart.  I tried the Raw Oyster with Kimchi-like Kohlrabi and Sesame on top but the oyster was overpowered by the kimchi ($3).10)  DON'T forget to save room for dessert!I could eat the elegant Lemon Curd Ice Cream sandwiched between chewy poppy seed macarons all day long ($8).  The Black Sesame-Walnut Chocoyaki with roasted strawberries and whipped ricotta was warm and oozy with chocolate inside but next time I'm getting more ice cream sandwiches instead ($8).  11)  DO be surprised you managed to rack up a $100 tab for 2 people (+tax and tip).12)  DON'T regret it.***Too late!insidescoopsf.sfgate.com… Wow that would accurately sum up my experience at State Bird Provisions.  This restaurant has received many accolades.  2013 James Beard Award for Best New Restaurant in the country and 2012 Bon Appetit Best New Restaurant.  Reservations are booked 3 months in advance.  Aileen and I decided to tempt fate and got there an hour early before they opened to wait outside the restaurant in hopes of being that little child looking through the glass starving and watching all the elegant patrons eating their small plates.  When we arrived we weren't alone there were already 12 people lined up.  One star for the restaurant bringing out little samples of some wonderfully citrus spiced hot chocolate to thaw out our fingers during our wait.  The concept of the restaurant is genius.  Provisions has a small menu of staple items that they will make to order for you but the magic of the place are the creations, the plethora of small plates that are the brain child of Stuart Brioza the owner and his talented culinary artisans.  In the dim sum tradition tray after try is brought around and you have the choice to say yea or nay.  Small plate items are reasonably priced between $3-$10.  The doors opened and we scored a seat at the counter.  We were blessed because we had a state birds eye view at all the chefs creating culinary masterpieces.  Stuart was chatting with us like we were old friends and just took any air of pretension right out of room and I felt like I was at a friends house for dinner.  He told us to pace ourselves because they have 18 different small plates to offer tonight.  I threw his advice right out the window I couldn't say no.  Every plate that was presented to us we accepted.  Unfortunately I can't remember everything that we devoured.  Some of my favorites were the smoked salmon and the butteriest tuna if ever had.  We also had rabbit croquet's, octopus and spare ribs to name a few.  Each dish pushed the limits of imagination and was artistically beautiful to look at. My mouth danced as I experienced new combinations of ingredients that I had never imagined let alone tasted. Save some room for dessert the perfect way to end the night.  Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to try the State Bird but want to return soon with close friends and relive that wonderful experience with others.

Love the dense warm chocoyaki, though the strawberries roasted made them just seem soggy & old. Great concept, good food. I feel there's definitely a hipster hype factor to all the rave reviews this place gets, though. Favorite menu item I tried= hamachi-avocado seaweed crostiniLeast favorite= state bird with provisionsI'd certainly return to SBP, especially since I found it to be a great value for the money. Yes.  that is all I have to say.I love everything about state bird provisions.  though the concept may be new to those who don't frequent dim sum establishments, it's a nice experience with excellent food.  Everything we had was tasty, the right temperature, and a good size to share.What did we eat?  What didn't we eat is the question you should be asking.  We had octopus, rabbit, state bird with provisions, smoked sturgeon with an everything pancake, scallops, pork belly, dumplings, asparagus, and a nori cracker with tuna.  For dessert, we had a light and airy cheesecake and some kind of chocolate dessert (whose texture I actually didn't particularly care for).  Favorites for me were the pork belly which was cooked perfectly and seasoned well and the state bird.  who doesn't love deep fried quail?service was friendly and attentive.  I'm not surprised everyone loves this place. We got here 30 minutes before they opened on a Tuesday night and there were already about 10 people in line so plan on getting here early if you want a table.The duck liver mousse with almond biscuit was amazing, garlic bread with burrata was too chewy, the namesake state bird was cooked to perfection, and the red trout with hazelnut brown butter was delicious. I'd pass on the scallops with avocado mousse-it was pretty bland.Funky vibe, friendly staff, interesting concept, definitely worth checking out. 7x7 100 Best Things To Eat In SF Before You Die 2013#99 State Bird with Provisions2013 James Beard Award for Best New Restaurant, 2012 Bon Appetit Best New Restaurant Think of any culinary accolades or cliché praises one could give a restaurant and that pretty much sums up how I felt about my experience at State Bird. Food was fresh, vibrant, innovative and delicious. Atmosphere was lively and energetic. Chefs and staff were hospitable and accommodating. Special thank you to Forrest for going above and beyond. Recommend make a reservation or get there at 5:30, right when they open and get your name down on the wait list. Keep in mind the wait can be lengthy, we waited for 2 hours but man was it well worth the wait. In the mean time, go for a walk to the near by park or head over to Japan town and explore. I would suggest checking in every half hour and see if you can get in sooner than estimated, we were told 9:00 and were able to be seated at 8:00. Next, try to get a table at the chef's counter, in the middle if possible so you can have the best seat in the house to see all the action in the kitchen. Another perk of the chef's counter is you get first dibs on whatever the kitchen is making. My favorite dishes were the ones served hot more so than the cold dishes served from the dim sum cart. I would gladly go back for the Quail, Hamachi over a bed of homemade noir cracker, Rabbit, Pork Belly and for dessert the Cocoa Nib and Mint Granita. I will definitely be back in the fall to see how they interpret the new seasonal products. Overall ThoughtsThe best restaurant I have been to since I moved to SF! The best restaurant experience of 2013 so far, and the truly extraordinary experience was had standing up! I dropped by State Bird after several recommendations to try it, but I only had a couple of hours before I had to return to the airport. I showed up at the opening time -- this is key since they don't take many prior reservations -- and the host graciously offered to reserve a standing room spot for me. I can't remember his name, but he was one cool, interesting and engaging guy. I chatted with other guests in line, with the host, with servers, and the kitchen staff while waiting. It was just that kind of warm, friendly and low key place -- quite amazing considering the quality of the food coming out of the kitchen and the Bon Appetit ranking as the Best New Restaurant in America in 2012. Better yet, each item costs less than $10, and one can have a filling experience for $50 without wine with no problem, and even less for just a couple of tapas.The servings are served dim sum style, and my samplings involved dishes that ranged from the more gamey balls of rabbit meat and cheese, to the Asian fusion flavors in the Thai Pork Belly Salad, and to southern comfort style fried quail (the state bird of California). Though I certainly love fried chicken, I think I would probably skip the quail next time in favor of other options. The Thai salad was my favorite. I violated my no sugar rule and made an exception for the ice cream sandwich with chicory ice cream and coconut caramel. Amazing, and enough for 2-3 diners.The food was excellent, but I will have to admit that it was the atmosphere and vibe created by the engagement of the staff that made State Bird Provisions a memorable experience. It's worth the hype and then some.Fantastic food and unique experience aside, what really did it for me was the service.  Every single flannel-clad member of the waitstaff was genuinely kind, helpful, and excited FOR me to be gettin' my State Bird on.  Like, almost as excited as I was.  They nailed it. Very fun.  We did not have reservations and were in line at 445pm.  The restaurant doesnt even open till 530pm.  We were lucky to get the last 2 seats that were at the counter overlooking the kitchen.  It was great to see how everything was prepared and cooked.  It was like a show and dinner.  We were also able to ask questions while the staff prepared the food.  One of the ladies let me hold a quail egg which was awesome and so small.The food was an experience and delicious.  Different from average everyday food which made dining here special. It is pricey if you come hungry and wanted to get a bottle of wine.  The cheapest bottles of wine are around $50 and dishes range from $5-$9.  Seems reasonable but the portions are small, the food is delicious, so you end up spending over $150 before you notice it between 2 people.  Definitely worth it though. State Bird Provisions takes an unconventional, eat-by-the-seat-of-your pants approach to serving its Asian-inspired small plates, a sort of Western take on Chinese dim sum service. You get thrown out of your comfort zone of knowing what to expect from your meal, as there is no set menu to refer to. Instead, dinner becomes a game of chance, and a server comes around pushing the plates on a cart, asking you point blank whether you'd like to accept or reject the options. It's like a culinary version of Shark Tank. I would say overall the food here is solid, and nothing ever tasted bad. My only complaint was that something wasn't mind blowingly good, and that's only because I had huge expectations for a restaurant voted ""best new restaurant"" by the James Beard Foundation. Amazingly good: hamachi-avocado seaweed crostini. They should call this seaweed crack. We ordered two plates of these, and we were so full.Very good: charred Spanish octopus in tomato salsa, garlic bread burrata. The octopus was pan fried to perfection, with a nice char along the edges. The sauce was slightly sweet and spicy, similar to Korean gochujang sauce. The garlic bread burrata was deep-fried to a perfect golden form, resembling a soft, fresh and pliable cruller doughnut. The salty garlic seasoning was a perfect complement to the crispy, golden crust, and the burrata's creamy flavors and texture balanced everything out. I only wished that the bread were served a tad warmer.Solid: smoked sturgeon pancake, tuna crudo & confit with chickpeas and cumin. The smoked sturgeon tasted like a really good smoked fish and latke, nothing more and nothing less.  Same goes for the tuna crudo & confit. Potato chips and chunky, creamy dips is a proven flavor pairing. The restaurant executed everything well, but not in a way that significantly elevated the dish above existing forms.Ok: state bird with provisions, kimchi yuba noodles. I personally thought the buttermilk batter that was used to coat the quail meat was too thick and didn't allow for the delicate, gamey flavors to come through.The yuba noodles taste exactly like they sound--bland tofu skin noodles imparted with flavor from the intense pickled kimchi, but that was it. You were literally eating noodles and kimchi, and integrating the two didn't result in some powerful flavor combination.I certainly enjoyed my dinner at State Bird Provisions. I wasn't the biggest fan of the Russian Roulette type ordering experience, but I can appreciate how this type of dinner service is more adventurous and unique than you would get a a traditional sit-down place. And the joy of stumbling upon the amazing seaweed crostini  was one of the most memorable dining experiences I've had to date. I would gladly stand in line again for dinner if the opportunity ever presented itself. I'm not sure if this is THE best new restaurant in America, but it certainly is one of the best. absolutely positively worth however many hours in line / months to wait for reservations. just hunker down and do it. the food is other-worldy, you guys. it's the best i've ever had. ever.the service is stellar: super-friendly, casual, and incredibly knowledgeable waitstaff. the atmosphere is comfortable and a visual treat. you can deck yourself out, or cruise over in more casual get-ups. you'll be comfy either way.oh & come hungry! it's an amazing experience. i love that this is in my city!!! i want to curl up under a table and live at state bird provisions! love you guys. and congrats on the radness that is james beard BEST restaurant in the country! Really best new restaraunt? Bc I ate there and it is lame, the decor is horrendous unless you like pay $100 a person to sit on 1950's grade school chairs surounded by string art, the food is dull, servings are tiny, and the same sad eight items being pushed around on carts like white people dim sum is not I repeat not dim sum and not an original idea. Basically the menu has eight items and instead of making them to order they pre make the food and push it around on carts. The best thing we ate was guacamole with shrimp. I am sorry but guacamole with shrimp is hardly James Beard worthy or maybe James Beard awards don't mean what they used to. Do not order dessert as we did and the ""ice cream sandwich"" was more like two hockey pucks stuck together with vanilla ice cream. One plus was the wine list was reasonable. If you want to try a new place in SF that's delicious and has original flavors try Plaj or Boxing Room. State Bird Provisions meh I've had better just about everywhere. Yes, a happening and food.....perfect! State Bird Provisions.....I get it....quail but still love the name! Got here early, waited in line with all the other hopefuls and just our luck, we got in. OK, we had to eat while standing (at the little bar area by the front door), but that was fine as we were going to an event afterwards where we'd be sitting all night! Plus, you get to watch the food being prepared and you get first dibs at the food coming out! We had so many wonderful dishes that I don't know where to begin but some favorites were the toasted seaweed with various fish/avocado/radish, the oysters, croquettes, potsticker, and while I'm not doing them justice with such short names......they were all incredible! Cute place with a real unique flair. I'd go back but be ready to stand in line longer now that it just earned the James Beard Best Restaurant award! State Bird Provisions just won the coveted 2013 James  Beard award for Best New Restaurant.   Good luck getting in. Janice and Emily are my jam! They are awesome and will serve you so well. I've been here twice, and they were both equally memorable. The staff is fun, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable.The food is so good. The word on the street is true, and you need to either book far in advance, or come early to stand in line. Dinner: So the dinner is like dim sum, but not asian food. The servers come around with a tray of small portions of simply delicious bowls of goodness.  The food that I've had here is awesome. Here's a quick list of the items I loved: Garlic Bread with burrataraw oysters with spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesameGuinea Hen Dumpling with aromatic brothCrunchy Quinoa-Hass Avocado with lime pickle yogurtTuna Crudo & Confit with chickpeas & cuminRicotta Dumplings with spring onion & sunflower seeds\CA state bird with provisionsEach dish ranges from about $5-$8 so it's really reasonable to try so many incredible dishes for such a great price. If I were to break it down:Service: 5 starsAmbiance: 4.5 stars (casual, but cute and quirky)Food: 5+ starsOverall: 5 stars - Can't wait to come back again! After each of my three visits, I've left with a stomachache. Not an ""I ate so much food and feel so full"" kind of stomachache, but like a ""whoa that fried quail/dessert did not sit well"" stomachache. So, as much as I've enjoyed (some of) the food, it's hard to deliver a solid verdict when it's made me feel like crap afterwards.I think this place is more about the experience than the food. It's a fun environment and the dim sum thing is unusual and interesting. I've had a few dishes that I thought were really remarkable (beef salad, vegetables with romesco, a dungeness crab dish back in January), and a bunch I thought were not very special (any/all of the pancakes, the burrata garlic knot). I also think some of the crudo dishes sit too long on trays waiting for a taker. We had some sliced grilled rabbit on pea puree that seemed unintentionally cold (one of the passed dishes). It still tasted great, but I wondered if it was at the right temperature. The desserts have really not agreed with me, especially the ice cream sandwiches. I would definitely avoid those.For a place with this much hype, the prices are pretty reasonable. It's easy to get plenty of food, a few drinks, and dessert for $50-$60 per person after tip. Most beers are like $5, which is really fair of them. Service is also great. The people are good at what they do - they're all over the place covering for each other. So, I guess I'd recommend trying it out, but after three visits I've definitely had my fill. I say less so ""tapas"" as Yelp lists it and more like Hipster Dim Sum as Phil H. describes it. Despite my hipster bias the food was awesome. I am predisposed to not like trendy places with small quantities of food but State Bird Provisions lived up to all the hype I had heard. My favorite dish was the garlic bread and burratta. Yum. I also enjoyed the state bird (quail).It's tough to pace yourself as so many good things are coming at you that you want to eat everything. Even dishes that sounded odd to me were tasty so I enjoyed stepping outside my comfort zone. I would go back. The staff are SUPER enthusiastic. Very friendly, helpful and you can tell they are passionate about their food. I can't say I have ever seen such passionate staff and I've been to a ton of restaurants. Good job, state bird. Awesome experience.  small interior with simple and cool decorations.  make a reservation or else be prepared to wait.  Walked in for a table for 2 around 7:30 pm and the next available table will be at 9:30pm! they have the ""sweet tables"" which requires standing throughout your meal in front of the kitchen.  We waited for that instead, since it was promising to be free in less than an hour.  It was a neat experience.  We stood, watched food prepare and come out from the kitchen, were the first people to order, and was able to catch up casually.  They have a set menu where you can order from the kitchen staff and also a ""dim sum"" style ordering where they bring food items to your table and try to sell them to you.We tried scallop in curry jelly and avocado whip, rabbit meat,  seaweed tostada with hamachi and avocado (DELISH!), chips with fava beans, garbanzo beans, and tuna dip, asparagus with truffle yogurt, fried garlic bread with burrata cheese, grilled octopus, smoked sturgeon and pancake (ehhh), and finished off with smoked chicory ice cream sandwich with coconut walnut caramel (chewy and yummy!!) and a shot of peanut milk.Fun and interactive dinner.  definitely a cool place to have in the fillmore! An amazing experience.  Rarely have I walked into the ""it"" place to be and been treated so well.  My first interaction was with chef and my second with Emily, the hostess.  We were walk In's and put our name in, completely expecting to never receive a call as it was busy beyond belief.  20 minutes later I received the call that we had 2 seats at the bar.  Not only did we get to watch the amazing chefs in action but we were the first to see and choose the fresh food that was being prepared.  To say it was an experience is an understatement.  The food is to die for and the staff is as great as they come, we will come back again and again. I'm obsessed.This is one of my happy places :)Exception food (fresh, fun, creative, tasty), really great service and people. Top off your experience with a seat at the chef's counter (foodie friends only) and chit chat with the chefs and get food right off the burner. LOVE IT.In the 3 times I've gone, these are the items we ate each time:- State Bird - quail is delightful, if only the portion were bigger- Pork Belly with citrus salad- Crispy nori cracker with hamachi and avocadoOther highlights: ice cream sandwiches to die for, buttery lobster, duck plate, uni pancake, guinea hen dumplings in aromatic broth. mmm ... ah the list goes on. Try it if you can but remember to pace yourself because there is always something else new coming out of that little kitchen. I came here in Fall 2012 when the reviews on this place were flamin' HOT. The whole staff was hyped and you could feel the enjoyment they get from their work.  Memorable menu items: The dessert shot was easily the most memorable; I highly recommend it as a topper to your already amazing meal. The burrata was also delish but I don't think I've ever had *bad* burrata. Note: It's easy to drop a bill here (including wine) and then go home an hour later and make yourself a sandwich. Just a heads up from one fat kid to (probably) another ;) I don't even know where to start... the wait for a reservation is ridiculous, but the food is on point.  Decor is modern and rustic at the same time; you can order things off the menu but the fun is in the dim-sum style carts that come around with tasty little surprises.  A server accidentally spilled a beer on my dress, but it was in the middle of a heated argument and actually broke the ice... so thank you for that one! They even offered to pick up the dry cleaning, but I told them not to worry about it since the dress was machine washable (and the beer came out completely). :)Overall, I would 100% come back again as soon as I can get a reservation! Truly a new and dynamic food spot in San Fran.  Californian style Dim Sum so you can order off the menu and be surprised by the delicatbles that are floating around the place. The staff is super helpful and chill including the chef. Sarah is especially helpful behind the bar with food and drink decisions. This is a destination stop and one of the top new places in San Francisco if not the country. This was a fun and pretty tasty experience. I thought that it was very reasonable with regards to price and portions. Most of the food was good. I didn't love the quail (was kind of greasy and heavy) but most everything else was excellent. I went with my wife and another couple and the total was $200 plus tip but none of us had alcohol but we were all stuffed in a good way. We tried a ton of different things and even my rhubarb soda was really good. This is well worth trying once. I'm not in a huge rush to go back (not because it wasn't really good) but glad I tried it. I took off a star b/c we had a 9:00 pm reservation and waited 30 minutes for a table and they didn't offer us anything aside from a glass of water while we waited. Still, the service was excellent once we were seated. Friendly servers and good food. Imaginative tapas style dishes served in a dim sum cart way!  However, not like in the Chinese dim sum restaurants...they don't give you ""whatever"" looks if you don't want an item !! All the dishes were fantastic.... some of my favorites were the pork belly, the ricotta cheese, the red trout and clams, and a crab dish. Anyway the menu constantly changes (which I love) , but your favorite item may not be there anymore. I am always a proponent to trying new things, so this just helps me from being a creature of habit! The chefs and crew are all young. Chalk up another winner from the new generation of chefs!! The open kitchen provides you a look at all the dishes being made with what seems like a "" college fraternity of cooks"" The vibe is busy busy busy which adds to the excitement and hunger. They even have a ""standing area"" to eat for walk ins... cant say I recommend this area unless you really want to try it. Looks like an area that they were using for ""to go"" orders.  Anyway just goes to show you that people are willing to literally stand just to try the food.... this place rocks!! Love this place! The whole experience was so great that waiting two hours seemed worth it!! The food was great but honestly what puts it over the top is the wonderful hospitality...For me, their ricotta dumplings and the pork belly was the start of the evening! If you're new in town, head over to this little gem and give it a shot! Cheers! Everything about this place deserves 5 stars (except being located in the part of the city that is like 10 degrees colder half the time and I froze my ass off getting there b/c I'm cheap and didn't want to take a cab..oh well), 5 stars!! The servers and staff are so enthusiastic about the food and seem to genuinely love what they are doing.  Our waitress immediately asked if anyone had food allergies/aversions and was so helpful with ordering and making sure that we got enough food (even offered for some of the dishes to be made specially for me).  We started with a bottle of tempranillo that was very reasonably priced and amazingly peppery and then went on to order half of the menu: --raw oyster with kohlrabi kraut and sesame--beet caesar salad--rabbit and fontina croquettes--tuna crudo & confit with chickpeas & cumin--garlic bread with burrata--hamachi-avocado seaweed crostini--dumpling with broth (not sure what kind) --kimchi and pork belly pancake --CA state bird with provisions--glazed pork ribs with swiss chard, togarashi --cheesecake japonaise, rhubarb syrup, boozy cream, pistachiosEverything was really good but i LOVE LOVE LOVEDDD the seaweed crostini and the glazed pork ribs.  I saw so many other things going around after we had finished, but was completely full (that order was for 3 girls mind you).  I will be coming back 100% and can't wait for the new restaurant to open. BRAVO! This is hands down my favorite new restaurant. Such a fun concept and executed so perfectly! It is very hard to get a reservation these days- and the line is so long if you don't have one- but it's worth it. The state bird (their namesake dish) is not to be missed! So deliciously fried. Also, the sturgeon pancakes were to die for. Also, if they have a dish with some sort of smoked potato component- get it! Their menu changes all the time, but I had two different dishes (on different occasions) that had a smokey potato element- and they were both so unusual and amazing. I'm a big fan of the garlic bread with burrata- though some of the people I dined with weren't as into it. It reminds me of a grown up, gourmet version of round table's bread sticks. Personnally, I would skip dessert and use that tummy real estate for more savory dishes! SBP's been on my list for quite some time now, long before they were named Best Restaurant in America by Bon Appetit. Of course, with my mile-long list of bookmarks, I never made it out here until reservations became notoriously difficult to book (pro-tip: check every morning, as they're on a rolling 60 day schedule - and once you're booked, don't cancel!)For those unfamiliar with the theme at SBP, their modus operandi is, ""eat with your eyes."" Think of it as New American food, served dim sum style. The waitstaff wander about the restaurant with little trays of freshly made dishes, each carrying a little price tag on them: simply ask for whatever catches your eye. That said, there are a handful of entrees that are actually only available as orders off the menu, so make sure you don't miss out on those. Our group of three ended up ordering their [ instagram.com/p/ReuH-SQf… ]:== Tasty! ==* Shrimp, Avocado, Nori* Steak Tartare with Poblano & Sunchoke== Good ==* CA State Bird with Provisions* Kimchi-Pork Belly with Tofu* Fried Green Tomato, Eggplant, Spanish Remoulade== Okay ==* Guinea Hen Dumplings* Duck Liver Mousse with Almond Biscuit* Sweet Corn & Garlic Chive ShortstackSo, overall, while nothing was terrible, nothing was mind-blowingly delicious either. Still, the experience is unique enough, and some of the dishes are tasty enough, that it's worth trying at least once. Not to mention that the service is great, and the owners are awesome folks :)***Accessibility Info***Venue - Fairly spacious, but more length-wise than evenly, with table arrangements that are a little bit tight, but still maneuverable. Be sure to let them know your situation beforehand though, and they should accommodate you at some of the slightly more accessible tables.Bathroom - It's been a while, but if I remember correctly, their bathrooms were absolutely accessible. I've now been here five times and I love it more and more each time. The service continues to be incredibly attentive and caring. The vibe is warm and intense and casual at the same time. They take everything seriously here. What I love most is the surprises. You never know what you're going to get. The combinations and inventions are absolutely brilliant. But, here's the thing - most restaurants that try to be inventive end up producing a bunch of crap. Anyone can mix a bunch of stuff that's never been combined before then throw it on a plate. To come up with a new idea that is surprising and that works, that makes sense, that is delicious - that is brilliance. To do this plate after plate, and repeat it day after day, season after season: That is sheer genius. I can never get reservations here. I typically wait 1-1.5 hours just to get in. And, guess what, it's worth it. Best meal I've had in SF.  Fantastic food.  Great service.  A slew of interesting things all cooked perfectly.  Good price.  Seamlessly wonderful experience.  There's really nothing I could complain about.  FYI:  You need a reservation.  I'd skip the pancakes (still good) to save room for everything else.  It's trendy, not fancy. I came to State Bird a few months ago, and was very impressed but forgot to write a review. I sat at the bar and it really was the best seat in the house, as we got first pick of everything coming out of the kitchen. Tonight was my second time and I came with a few friends (all first timers) and we left extremely satisfied. The food was AMAZING but the real star of the show was the service! Emily the hostess welcomed us and was able to get us seated very quickly although we were walk-ins, Sarah, our server, was great at helping us pick from the pre-set menu and described everything so well, we wanted to order it all (...and we did.). My friends thought EVERYTHING was outstanding (literally everything, even something as simple as quinoa-crusted avocado). Standouts were the garlic burrata bread, the pancakes, and the state bird of course. I can't remember the name of our dessert, but it had roasted strawberries and oozing chocolate. SO GOOD. Thank you State Bird Staff for making my friend's birthday memorable in every way! Very creative concept and fun place to eat, especially at the ""Chef's Table"" to watch all the prep and get the description right from them.  Everything was great and the variety made it interesting.  I felt some items were a bit too salty and the effects lasted into the next day so I didn't feel great, but the solution might just be to eat less next time, which is hard when your constantly being offered plates of great-looking things.  Staff nicely handled the crowd and wait. I visited State Bird Provisions a few months ago, in which I was lucky to score a reservation. Overall, the food is very diverse and also very creative. The State Bird Provisions was excellent and easily stood out. From my understanding the food changes quite often, but I do remember the garlic bread was pretty good, but unfortunately because I ate there so long ago, I don't quite remember everything (not to say the food was bad). I recommend going with a larger group (4 if possible) so you can try more things. It's a fun and unique restaurant with an interesting concept. I highly recommend, although, be aware that getting reservations at this place is VERY tough and decor is very hipster-like. Ok, I'll admit this review takes in the hype factor - its just not worth the hype!  We waited a few months for a reservation, so expectations were high.   While we liked our food, there was only one 'oh my god' dish (the Trout), and everything else was just ok.  Meh for the price. Oh yeah, the decor? It feel on the cheap side of quirky.  Peg-board and ugly crap hanging off of it.   Its just not a top restaurant. I would give 6 stars if I could. San Francisco delivered. Mostly we stuck to the carts, other than the sturgeon pancake and the burrata garlic bread knot. We were at the chefs counter and we had first pick from the carts, truly it got to the point where we were just getting one of each dish from every new wave of food. Nothing disappointed. The chef working the station in front of us was great. He humored us and answered all of our stupid questions. The other nearby chefs were just as friendly and funny. For the quality and flavors the prices are reasonable. great place! Fast turnaround so we didn't have to wait in line. The garlic bread, rabbit, and sweetbread meatball were delicious... as was everything else. The waiters are amazingly helpful (and patient). We were abit disappointed by the cheesecake soufflé. Also, they don't waste time once you sit down. Maybe not the most relaxing/romantic atmosphere as you are constantly being interrupted to choose items off the cart (but hey! that's the point of the tapas/dim sum style restaurant). All in all, one of the better dining experiences I have had in a while! Love the concept! My bf and I chose almost everything that came by but didn't feel full at the end of the meal. A great place to go with a bunch if friends willing to try/share everything. Be sure to make a reservation 2 months ahead!! Wow, it is astounding that so many ""seasoned palettes"" have given this restaurant a good review. I've tried to understand, yet can't seem to make sense of it. The only thing I can think of is that everyone is jumping on the hype bandwagon. I don't care if I have to wait in line for over an hour. I don't care if I have to dine standing up (a first for me,) but at least give me good food!! How disappointed my friend and I were to find such small quantities of high-priced, mediocre food. The flavors were just not there. I only enjoyed one of the many dishes I tried and actually felt nauseous after eating the garlic bread with burrata. Advice:make reservations well in advance or get there at 5pm for open seatingorder only 1 of anything (even if you have a group of 4)go with a larger group to try more thingspace yourself...there is a lot of food and you don't think you will fill upRecs:guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth spicy kimchi yuba with smoked egg 'bottarga'tuna crudo & confit with chickpeas & cumin garlic bread with burrata hamachi-avocado seaweed crostini dungeness crab & mandarin gelatina with avocado mendocino sea urchin, ginger/scallion pancake, soy-lime glaze artichoke bread salad with last summer's tomato grilled beef 'salad' with maitake, brussels sprouts & umeboshi vinaigrette 'world peace' peanut muscovado milk shot So if you think the massive Hype is worth waiting for, you are WRONG!!!! This Resturant is NOISY, NOISY, NOISY. I think everyone there feels the need to yell while dining. Yes, there were a few nice dishes that were good, The Hamachi on nori was by far for me the best dish. I enjoyed the chips and dip also.The desserts were under rated!! For the most part, its just OK. I'm getting really tired of writting about   BULL S--T FOOD!!!!! Most of the wait staff were great.... Of all the new restaurants in SF, this is my favorite.  I was lucky enough to get a call from a friend who wrangled a last minute 7 pm reservation. We were seated at the bar, right by the kitchen, so we were able to watch the chefs prep and also get first dibs on anything coming out of the kitchen.  That said, the food was amazing--creative, tasty, and inspiring.  Definitely try the quail, and anything with tuna or yellowtail.  We also loved the fried garlic bread with burrata--decadent but oh-so-delicious. The waitstaff was friendly, very helpful, and not at all overwhelming. I liked the dim sum style--portions were small enough that you could try multiple plates, and we were out of there for about $100.  I was disappointed in the desserts--we ordered two, and I thought they just didn't stand up to the quality of the savory dishes we'd tried. Heard a lot of good/great things about this restaurant so I am glad that i finally got to try it out.  Let me say that I like a restaurant with rules.  Take that for what its worth.Food: Crispy pork belly...awesome-town.   Sturgon Pancake...delicious  Those were the stand outs.  Everything else was good, just not super memorable.Service:  friendly, casual, knowledgeable.  No complaints.I enjoy the concept of the ""Dim sum"" style service but I think i enjoyed the core menu items better.  It was fun though.  Warning...the bill can add up quickly.Yes...you will probably have to wait in line. Yes its not in the best neighborhood to have to wait in line.  Yes you will still wait in line.  Crazy people are less agressive if you smile. You'll find a line of people waiting for the doors to open far before they're scheduled to. Once they do, they'll instruct groups with reservations to make a line on one side, and any walk-in's on the other. They've got this part down efficiently and waste no time seating tables.It's a dim sum style service serving american food. It feels like you're back in workshop class with perforated beige walls and woodshop art projects on display. It feels new and fresh despite spending many weekends dining at a traditional dim sum restaurant in San Francisco. My table had a lot of fun choosing dish after dish from each passing cart (while trying to ignore the equally noticeable price tags). We supported the small plates with two dishes off their printed menu to round it off and ordered a bottle of wine. It was the perfect amount and we felt well taken care of by the staff.The stand outs from the night and current menu:Garlic Bread with Burrata (FAVORITE! Get it. Doesn't disappoint.)Dungeness Crab and Mandarin Gelatina w/AvocadoHamachi Avocado Seaweed CrostiniPork Ribs with Swiss Chard (A heartier dish)Chicory Ice Cream Sandwich with Coconut CaramelAnd finally, the State Bird with Provisions. Our friend deemed the breading the ultimate Shake N Bake and assured us he would buy it in bulk if it existed. I've had quail at many Chinese restaurants and enjoyed eating it cooked a different way at State Bird. The onions are tangy and delicious. I guess all the hype messed my taste buds up?! I really wanted to love it but half the tapas were meh and the other half amazing. How is that even possible you ask? Well, the fresh oyster with kohlrabi kraut and sesame just seemed to mask the oysters flavor and the burrata (while delicious on its own) was served with what seemed to be a microwaved garlic bread. It was as if it had been over cooked and was super chewy and bordering on the tough side. :( Sadly dessert was also a disappointment. We were standing in the kitchen area and noticed a lot people ordered the earl grey ice cream sandwich with figs so we figured it must be good.  The texture was really nice but it was extremely sweet for my taste. With that being said, I will say that the fish collar, pork belly with winter citrus, hamachi-avocado seaweed crostini and the sourdough, sauerkraut pecorino & ricotta pancake were amazing!In continuing with the good...the atmosphere was really hip and had a comfortable vibe in the air. I liked the dim sum style of serving and loved being in the kitchen while I ate where I could interact with the chef and servers. I think this place is worth a try as their menu is constantly changing! I love the concept of an American / Fusion dim sum restaurant. If you haven't been, here is how it works...HOW IT WORKS:There is one seafood cart that goes around with a static 4-5 dishes to choose from. There are about 8 other dim-sum style items that rotate, it took about 40 minutes for us to see the full rotation. They have a small menu with apps / entrees / desserts / drinks.THE FOOD:All of it was delicious, and the tab definitely adds up quick! They are famous for their pancakes (loved the pecorino), and the fried quail (good but didn't blow my mind). My absolute favorite dish of the night was the nori chip with kampachi on top, followed by a seasonal crab stew. Freakin amazing. I thought the fried garlic bread with burrata was a bit overrated, and the mushroom dumpling in dashi sauce was OK, but the best way to experience State Bird is to just try it all because everything is unique and very fresh. Go with 2-3 people and get the full experience.THE DRINKS:The wine and beer list is decent, and given the food prices, I was pleasantly surprised by the delicious Malbec and Saisons I had (only $9 and $6 respectively).I would definitely recommend State Bird, and encourage you to make a reservation - there are last minute options available on OpenTable. The line on a weekday at opening was ridiculous, I would never wait. For someone with a big appetite like me, it can be expensive but it doesn't have to be. Come in and order a bunch of dishes to try, and you will not be disappointed. Enjoy! 4.5 starsThis was one of the restaurants I really wanted to try while I was in San Francisco (probably #1 on my list). Not surprisingly, reservations are still very difficult to come by, probably one of the most difficult in the city. I checked their website multiple times per day for a couple of weeks, and the best I could do was a party of 2 at 5:30 (looking for any availability over a week span). The day before, some cancellations yielded a 10:30 table for 4; very late, but it allowed our whole family to dine together.duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - The rich mousse was pretty tasty on its own, but the warm biscuits (scented with almond) were a great pairing.porcini dip with rosemary buttermilk cracker - Another spreadable dish, it showcased clean porcini-cheesy flavor with crispy rosemary crackers. This was pretty nice too.garlic bread with burrata - If I saw this on the menu, I probably wouldn't have ordered it (it sounded kind of plain). But seeing this come out of the kitchen, it was clear that my assumption was wrong. The hot, fried bread was light and airy and just oozing burrata and olive oil. The garlic flavor was fairly subtle but present.fuyu persimmon with caraway cream - This was one of the lesser memorable dishes of the evening, showing off predictable sweet and tart flavors.seafood 'salsa' - Scallops, mussels and clams were bathed in a jalapeno salsa; a little heat complemented the seafood but this one wasn't particularly noteworthy either.shrimp, avocado, nori - A strong seaweed flavor and texture came from the fried nori, complementing the tender avocado chunks and grilled shrimp. Black garlic provided a mellow garlicky flavor throughout.guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth - A nicely-chewy ravioli was stuffed with rich and flavorful guinea hen, sitting in a comforting, savory chicken broth. Quite tasty.CA state bird with provisions - The restaurant's namesake dish did not disappoint. Fried quail (the state bird of California) was both juicy and crispy, while sweet onions and pecorino provided additional depth of flavor. I just wanted more of this addicting bird.vinegar glazed smoked potato with tonnato - The potatoes exuded a strong smokiness that paired pretty well with the albacore tonnado. Crunchy onion rings added the crunch in each bite.steak tartare salad with anchovy & castelfranco - We didn't care for this one. Too much salad, not enough steak.glazed pork ribs with swiss chard, togarashi - Luscious, tender ribs were delicious, especially with a slight heat from the togarashi spice. Swiss chard helped to balance everything out with its earthiness.hamachi spring roll with fuyu persimmon - Cool hamachi and sweet persimmon were a good duo, but the spicy dip overpowered the subtle flavors a bit.buttery lobster with farro ""spezzato"" - The lobster was cooked well, leaving it spongy and succulent. A very buttery-rich farro base added a creamy starch presence.sweetbread meatball with quince & pickled veg - There was something kind of chewy inside the meatball, but I liked the flavor. Pickled quince added a sweet acidity to balance the richness of the meat.red trout, mandarin, hazelnut-garum brown butter - The trout was well-seasoned and cooked to a nice crispy skin and moist flesh. Hazelnuts and citrus provided some nice complementary flavors to go along with the fish.'world peace' peanut muscovado milk - moving on to the sweet part of the menu, we began with 'shots' of this milk that really resembled Reese's peanut butter cups.cocoa pudding, huckleberries, white chocolate buddah's hand crunch - Next we had a rich chocolatey pudding with a lot of fresh huckleberry flavor. The white chocolate brittle added crunch to each bite.eggnog 'ice cream' sandwich, sherry chocolate coulis - This was my favorite of the desserts, which I thought was executed very well. Eggnog ice cream was delicious, particularly with the soft cookie, chocolate and almonds. A touch of salt was a difference-maker.This was my favorite meal during my holiday stay in San Francisco. I felt like we tried a ton of flavors throughout this meal and most everything seemed thoughtful in concept and execution was pretty strong. Sure, there were some plates that I found more successful than others, but that happens over 18 different dishes. The spreads/dips, guinea hen dumpling, fried quail, pork ribs, trout and ice cream sandwich were excellent. State Bird truly lived up to its high expectations. These three are very VERY good: duck liver mousse, fried bird, pork belly. And I'm partial to eggs so I would always say yes to the quail eggs! Steak tartare salad is good too but I wish there was more tartare. Great concept, great execution, nice people, yay!I'm sure that passed small plates, dim sum-style, is really good for the bottom line too - it definitely pushes you to eat more than you would normally order when something delicious is right in front of you, and each person at the table can say yes :) But on the flip side it's fun, and we ended up with a reasonable bill and really full bellies.The only things I didn't love were the artichoke bread salad (we got it late in the meal, and I think it was just too rich at that point, so maybe a timing issue), the asparagus with truffle something, which was okay, but didn't really come together as a dish, and the oyaki dessert which was fairly bland and boring next to the sabayon ice cream sandwiches. After months of checking their web site for availability and almost giving up hope, I was thrilled to see a Tuesday 5:30 reservation randomly pop up.  It was a long and excruciating 2 month wait before our res, and during that time, they received their James Beard nomination, further fueling my impatience. Finally, the big day came. Upon arrival at 5:30, there was already a loooong line going down the block, but they called all parties with reservations to the front. So this is my new. favorite. restaurant.  We were a group of 4 and ordered 5 hot items off the menu, which was the quantity recommended by our server. We then ordered about 8-9 amazing ""dim sum"" items that were circulating the room. I love this decadent style of dining! Everything was delicious - not a single disappointment - but there were a few standout items: cast iron quail eggs, sea urchin pancakes, smoked trout porridge, duck liver mousse with biscuits, pork belly (dear god!), hen dumpling in broth, and a heavenly cracker spread with sturgeon roe, lemon, and egg (I think?)...and the earl grey ice cream sandwich is a MUST.   Atmosphere is totally casual, with pretty much every customer in jeans and servers in plaid shirts. Service is mercifully hipster-free....they were friendly and down-to-earth, no airs or pretentiousness.  The space itself is simple but stunning -- bricky lofty with very high ceilings and an open kitchen right where you walk in. The counter (for walk-ins) is set right up against the kitchen...I would imagine that sitting there and watching the artists in action is a special experience.Now back to obsessively stalking their web site for another reservation. Ridiculous! So tasty, one of my favorite SF spots. The reservation situation is out of control, but if you get a table, you won't be disappointed. I am a vegetarian but also a lifelong food lover, and everything I have here is incredible. Finally something different and unique from the loads of California cuisine restaurants that are all kind of the same. Each plate is well thought out and curated. Not to mention the staff is wonderful and interesting, and make you feel like you are eating in their home. If I had a meal here, had sex, and then died....I could say I would have no regrets! I came here on Saturday night with my husband and another couple. We didn't have reservations since it was a last minute decision to eat here. Thanks to all of the yelp reviews, our friends arrived at 4:20pm and was the third group in line! The first group arrived at 3:30pm! The line grew to 30+ people by 5pm! We were immediately seated at 5:30 (it looked like 10-15 people were able to sit at 5:30). They also served hot chocolate while we waited in line, that was nice.They have food on a menu that is made to order like pancakes and the quail. They also have food that are on trays and carts for you to see...this one entices your palate with your eyes. It's sort of funny to see the look of rejection that some of the staff have when you don't want a certain dish (in dim sum the ladies don't care, haha). My favorite made to order dish was the ribs and the quail. The ribs are not baby back but very tender. I was indifferent about the sourkraut pancakes. Of the tray/cart dishes, I liked the salad that had slices of rare beef and mushrooms in it (sorry don't remember what they called it). My favorite dessert was the earl gray ice cream sandwich with the dried fruit soaked in riesling. While the dessert sounded fancy, it was yummy and didn't taste complicated. The cheesecake was ok, it was very fluffy and not cheesy enough, if you're ok with that. Overall it was a good experience. If you walk in and are a group of 4, make sure you come EARLY. Otherwise a group of 2 has better luck of scoring a table, bar seating or even standing at the bar. If you don't want to deal with waiting, then I highly suggest just making a reservation far in advance. I got a reservation back in January, and waited two months to finally go to State Bird!  Our reservations were at 10:30PM, so we stopped by a bar earlier and got ready for our NY style dining (late night dining).One thing that completely stood out was the fact that this is probably one of the hardest restaurants to get a reservation at right now, but the staff had no airs.  They took a while to seat us, and they gave us wine on the house while we waited.It is a really fun dining experience, I'm not really fond of traditional dim sum since I don't eat a lot of meat.  But I'm all for American style dim sum.  I wouldn't suggest coming here on a date, since the servers do interrupt a lot with the new items and explaining each item.  My favorites - Sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancakes (mini ones), green garlic bread with burrata and Earl grey, almond & cocoa nib 'ice cream' sandwich! Freakin expensive but worth every bite.JONASAPPROVED! A great dinning experience to say the least!  I rarely go to the same restaurant twice but with State Bird Provisions I will make an exception! My 2nd dining adventure at State Bird was even better than my first; experience helps. - State Bird: We didn't even mess with it this time; the moment we sat down, we ordered a full serving of the fried quail so we didn't have to wait for the 2nd serving after we realized the 1st serving was awesome .Yeah. We got smart. - We ordered less from the menu this time; we skipped the pancakes entirely- they were too soggy and unimpressive. -Ricotta Dumplings: light, fluffy, and pillowy. Highly recommend- The ribs were still smokey and yummy. - Quail Eggs: i love quail eggs but these were not what i was envisioning. I'd skip this- Guinea hen dumpling in aromatic broth: honestly, just as delicious as the state bird. They walked around with these in a tray and they are $1.50 per bowl. I could easily have gobbled 10 of these. Dangerous- I've grown to like the Peking Duck. It's very respectable as long as you don't think you're eating Peking Duck. Think....duck confit. Yum- Ahi Poke: I like but i'm a poke snob. It ain't Hawaii. But it was pretty good- Duck liver mousse with Financiers: silky and light. Good for a starter- The ice cream sandwiches this time were earl grey;  i wasn't a huge fan. If they have chocolate ice cream sandwiches, i'd highly recommend them. Even if you have a reservation, be sure to get there a few mins early. If you're the first seating, don't freak out by the sight of the loooong line. Most of these ppl are in line for walk-ins. Someone from the restaurant will make a short announcement about forming a line for reservation holders and you'll be seated the moment the door opens. LIsten up for that. Walk-ins who don't make the first seating (at the bar) will probably have to wait 45-60 mins for the next seating. For the top new restaurant in the country, the service here is friendly and efficient; no pretentiousness or snootiness. Love I've been here twice so far. Luckily the last time I made a last minute reservation for 9:30 and was able to walk in and be seated right away with my super cute date.The food here is dim sum style. To sum it up, the dishes are all very creative. Some tasted great, some were good, some were ok. I don't remember eating anything bad. I found the servers to be informative and accommodating. They might have a stuck up hipster vibe about them, but once I got over it, I really did enjoy the service.You MUSt try the peanut milk shot. It is AMAZING! Heaps of praise have been poured on State Bird Provisions over the past year. It has already won Bon Apetit's 2012 Restaurant of the Year award and is now a contending finalist for a James Beard Award in the Best New Restaurant category. It is nearly impossible to walk in and expect someone to give up their reservation. In fact, due to the recent critical acclaim, it took me nearly a year to finally snag a coveted reservation, which only opens a month in advance (and fills up quickly). Expectations were definitely high.What makes State Bird unique is their menu. In addition to a frequently changing menu, you order from a number of small plates to tide you over until the dim sum-style service carts come rolling by. This was where it got dangerous because everything looked better plated than described on a menu. Order everything? We pretty much did. Here's a breakdown of the menu plates we tried:Sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancake - I couldn't get much of the sauerkraut, but the pecorino and ricotta were distinct. These were addicting and I could see why people order more after the first plate.CA state bird with provisions - Fried chicken, but with a quail. It was good, but not amazing. Glazed pork ribs with swiss chard, togarashi - The meat was very tender, but it was too salty to enjoy.Buttery dungeness crab with farro 'spezzato' - This was by far, the best savory dish of the night. The crab was so buttery and delicious. It was like a really magnificent rendition of a crab porridge. Please sir, can I have some more?Earl grey, almond & cocoa nib 'ice cream' sandwich, riesling-poached winter fruits - This dessert was outstanding. It wasn't too sweet for a dessert and the presentation was beautiful. And the plates from the cart:Crispy pork belly with mint, jalapenos, and winter citrus - This was a great appetizer to start off dinner. I've had a lot of pork belly, but never with a combination of refreshing mint and citrus. Great contrast in texture with a splash of acidity.Potato chips with beans, salsa, and avocado - It looked cool when the salsa was in the mason jar. It turned out to be really expensive chips and dip.Raw oysters kohlrabi kraut - The worst plate of the night. The kraut completely overpowered the oysters, but the waiter gave us a free oyster for our party of 3.Lobster croutons topped with lobster salsa - The croutons were genius. They had a satisfying crunch while drenched in lobster goodness. Garlic bread with buratta - The bread had the texture of a churro. The buratta was good.Rabbit with cannellini beans - Actually, this is tied for the worst plate of the night. The rabbit tasted exactly like cold grilled chicken. Really expensive chicken with hummus.We washed it all down with the St. Stefanus, Belgian Blonde, which was an excellent beer to pair with our dinner. The service was great and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. Most of the dishes were really hit or miss. There were a couple of really great dishes and a couple of awful ones. Overall, I wasn't wowed by the food. The concept is interesting, but if I have to wait this long to get a table, I better be impressed by most, if not, all the dishes. All in all, very pleased.  This place lived up to the hype.  Everything we had was good to excellent.  The concept of this restaurant is neat.  I like the idea of gourmet dishes coming out on carts for you salivate over.  When they bring them by, it is really hard to say no.  We were starving when we arrived, and within three minutes, before we knew it, we had six dishes on our table and were overwhelmed in foodiness.  This place serves about 2/3 of its menu via dim sum carts (think of these as your appetizers) and the rest is made to order (mains and desserts).  The best strategy is to bring a group of people and just try a bunch of stuff.  Slow it down after the first few, and then order some larger stuff.  Save room for dessert.We ate the following:- Saurekraut pancakes - i had never heard of such a thing and they were great.  Little silver dollar pancakes with tangy, crunchy sauerkraut in the middle.  delightful.- scallion ginger pancakes with uni and soy lime glaze - amazing.  The uni was really fresh and added that nice briny creaminess that really worked with the flavors of the glaze and mixed nicely with the texture of the pancake- green garlic burrata toast - what more can you say.....puffy green garlic toast with burrata smeared all over it.  delish.- guinea hen dumpling - loved it.  the broth was incredible.- state bird with provisions - breading on the quail is awesome and the bird is perfectly cooked.  the onions and parmesan are an unusual but delicious combo.- peking duck - duck leg confit, with scallion crepes, some pickled type of mushroom and plum sauce - really, really tasty.  I loved this.- steak tartar caesar salad - very good, but all you could really taste was the dressing.  That said, the dressing was really good.- tuna crudo with chickpeas, capers - delicious.  had a nice cuminy flavor.  served with potato chips.- quail eggs with sunchokes and ravigote - amazing.  tasted like breakfast in the most wonderful way.  the sunchoke chips were a nice crunchy texture.- crab with mandarin gelee with avocado - this dish was good as long as you had every component of the dish in one bite.  if not, it tasted kind of bland and mushy.- sweetbread, veal and pork meatball with fig - very good, but it did not blow my hair back.- cheesecake souffle - excellent.  was light, tangy and creamy all at the same time.- earl grey ice cream sandwiches - delicious.  the earl grey ice cream was amazing.  the only downside was that the service was sometimes a little lacking.  by and large, servers were attentive, but there was a little lag in getting drinks sometimes.  The fast pace of the dim sum style was a little intense at times too.  You are bombarded with food as soon as you sit down.  Service is very quick and it is NOT meant for a romantic, quiet night out.  Its not bad, it is just different.Great spot.  Nothing else like it.  WIll go back as soon as the buzz dies down a bit. I brag to everyone I know that my boyfriend and I went here the week it opened (pre-hype) and ordered so much food (and finished it all) that the chef, the sous chef and the hostess all came to say hi to us. I have been back another ten times since then and the hype keeps getting crazier and the wait keeps getting longer....but the food is still as good. The food is delightful and inventive, just don't go with sky-high expectations, because seriously no place lives up to those. The staff is really nice and the atmosphere casual and unpretentious. The place is expensive but not for the quality of food (and the cool experience). Make sure you don't miss- the burrata on garlic bread- the state bird of course- the almond biscuits with duck liver mousseMost of the menu keeps changing, but the pork belly and the grilled lamb are really good too (but not always offered) I am not the biggest fan of the pancakes or the quail eggs and to be honest, haven't given any of the veggies much of a chance.Definitely a must-try place, just be prepared to wait, but hey, you can watch a movie at Kabuki right around the corner. Loved it. We did the ""wait before it opens, get a reservation for that evening and come back"" thing. But that's miles better than the ""wait an undetermined amount of time in line for a table"" thing. So, props for the system.The food was relentlessly inventive and exciting; everything was delicious. The system may be dim sum style, but the cuisine borrows a bit from here and there. (Note: not a negative thing). The concept is actually quite brilliant, you're eating as soon as you sit down. And they've created a restaurant where they're free to continually reinvent their food.Stuart walked around greeting people with a huge smile, clearly (rightfully) delighted that his creation (obviously the product of a lot of shared hard work) was being received so well.It's memorable and genuinely worth it. We got out, with tip, ~14 dishes, 2 desserts and 3 glasses of wine for under $140.Not loud at all for us, seated at the counter.They're doing it right. They did not create the hype, which some people are now reacting against. The public choose to buy into it. The restaurant just puts out an excellent product and hopes people respond. Personally, I hope they're around for years to come. Like Clint Eastwood once said in a sappy movie ""This kind of certainty comes but once in a lifetime.""  I love you, State Bird Provision. Scored a res on the online roulette system prior to it winning all the accolades.  Lined up with everyone else in the rain prior to it opening and waited anxiously, wondering if any restaurant could possibly live up to all the hype.  Love the casual, non pretentious atmosphere.  Since the offerings are constantly changing, I won't delve into what we ate, but into the experience itself.  My husband, dining companions, and myself thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  Rather than paying upwards of $100 for a fixed menu, we were able to pick and choose what we wanted.  Reminiscent of times when you are dining and you see someone else's meal go by and think, ""I want that!""...State Bird allows you to see, smell, and hear the description of each dish before you decide if you want it.  My husband thought it was a great dining ""deal"".  We got seconds of some dishes and passed on others that just didn't appeal to our senses.  I can certainly see why State Bird has been racking up the awards! Nicely executed dishes served dim sum style.  SF is blooming with creative chefs and concepts.  This place is always packed and best to come early or be patient while they put you on a wait list.  The food is approachable using the best in local ingredients and delivers on flavor. The restaurant just wasn't up to the hype. One of the biggest weaknesses of the place is that some of the off-the-menu items were not all offered to the table when you are there. But one could request it from the kitchen if you know what you want. So one always feels like you are missing out somehow. For instance, the burrata on garlic bread looked great that another table ordered, but we never got to try it since we saw it at the end of the meal. The restaurant was incredibly loud, reminding me of one of those trendy restaurants in NYC, where one can't hear the waitress who is trying to communicating the special of the day (in this case, what's in the cart), except that everyone is a lot more casually dressed and the wall hangings are a bit too apocalyptic for my taste.some of the best dishes:lobster crouton with lobster salsa on top. Fresh, perfectly cooked lobster steeped in a lovely sauce, which is a lot less sour than the usual ceviche sauce.dungeness crab with farro: farro produced a texture that almost reminded me an in-between of risotto and steel-cut oats, not too creamy, with fabulous aroma, and topped with big chunks of crab.CA state bird -- fried quail, the signature dish. Very good, light crusted with tender moist quail. Half portion is enough for two for a taste.The other ones:Smoked Sturgeon -- this was a winner at my table, especially for the people who like smoke salmon lox bagel. I think of it as a riff on that dish, a much more refined version of it, with sturgeon whose texture is cooked to perfection. Boudin noir / blood sausage -- average, especially for a person who was never that into boudin noir in France.Kimchi on top of tofu skin -- not sure what the big deal is, if you have tasted a shanghai dish with pickeled mustard green with tofu skin and soybean, you would not be impressed.Sea urchin pancake -- I like the sea urchin, but the amount of sea urchin to pancake was too small to satisfy the sea urchin lover's palate.Pork Belly dish // Short rib dish -- same genre, average. My favorite pork belly is still momofuku noodle bar's pork belly bun. this one is just not as tender. Earl grey, cocoa nib, almond ice cream sandwich -- the best dessert, not too sweetoyaki (japanese bean cake) with some sauce -- interesting combination. averagechocolate souffle cheesecake -- unusual texture. I liked the chunks of chocolate that sometimes one happens to catch in a spoonful of the dessert. It's having a bit of an identity crisis though, not as rich as a chocolate souffle, and not as creamy as a cheesecake.Gosh, we did eat a lot for the four of us, had a bottle of wine and 2 pots of coffee. $60-70/person which is quite reasonable.I highly commend the chefs on being experimental and constantly combining various elements of multiple cuisines every day/week/month. But part of the downside is that the quality may be inconsistent across dishes. As long as one doesn't care and want to experiment with the chef, one should try this place out (when the hype dies down a bit and when it's a bit easier to get a reservation). Delicious!!  My bf and I waited two hours to eat at this place.  It's always best to make a reservation but good luck getting one!  The staff say on the weekends you have to go at least 1.5 hours before opening and on the weekdays maybe 30 minutes to an hour.  This place is definitely worth the wait.  Because we waited so long, out in the cold, the staff gave us some free hot chocolate and if you're waiting that long you can always go to Q-cup across the street and get some milk tea while you wait.I recommend trying everything, but be sure to get the CA state bird with provisions dish which is on their menu daily.  Also, try out the dishes that are not on the menu.  I really liked the hamachi-avocado seaweed crostini dish.  Everything tasted delicious and I would love to come back again. Unique set up - you can order small dishes off their menu, and other items you order as the waitresses/waiters bring it around to you, as in dim sum.  Fair warning though, it is kinda hard to pass up the dishes when they offer it to you in your face - I think that was their plan.  Some of our favorites included the quail, duck pate... It's pricey though.  $$$$$$$ Be prepared. Tried just about everything, and loved it all. Crazy busy, and loud, but it's a small charming place, with a friendly attentive staff. Food was delicious.  I can't remember 1 dish I didn't completely enjoy.  I can see why it is so difficult to get into this place!  One suggestion for all future diners is to take it easy and go slow.  Since this place serves their food ""dim sum"" style it is easy to get excited and order every delicious looking dish that passes by.  But the problem is that you eat everything as fast as you order it (just like good old regular dim sum) and you get full crazy fast.  You can't help yourself as things are just so yummy...or maybe that was just a problem my group had?!?  Minus 1 star because service was meh...our waiter was a little too cool for school.  Usually poor service would affect my experience more.  I think the dim sum format and that fact we ordered a bottle of wine made it easy for us to ""take care"" of ourselves and still have a fabulous night despite the meh service. Wow, what a lucky person I am to have ended up at this restaurant by accident.  How perfect to have incredible food in a completely relaxed atmosphere.  I love the fact that you can try so many things, rather than an appetizer and entree in other great restaurants.  The trout was delicate and perfectly prepared.  The crab and farro, was what a day at the beach would taste like.  The pancakes are amazing.  I have reservations to go back and can't wait!  But, it was worth the wait in line and hour and a half to get a seat.  There is a cute wine bar around the corner to wait at. I loved Silver Linings Playbook. Wait, that's the movie (I did love it though). State Farm Prudential? Nope, insurance companies. State Bird Provisions...that's the name of the restaurant!When I first heard about it, I kept forgetting the name, so up until our visit my girlfriend and I kept amusing ourselves with various versions we thought the restaurant name sounded like. I could go on, but I won't. And rest assured, the food was no joke.Although there is a standard food menu, what makes this place truly unique is the pay-as-you-go dim sum style small plates that the servers carry/roll around. Whereas in dim sum it's fairly easy (for me at least) to pace myself and not over-order, it's nearly impossible here. BECAUSE EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD. How much do I order from the menu? Do I get one or two orders from this cart when I know more is still to come? Do I have room for dessert? WHERE ARE YOU STAN?? I'M IN A GLASS CASE OF GLUTTONY!!!Whoa. Lost my composure there. Apologies.Now on to the food. I'm not going to go over everything we ate, because as evidenced by our bill, we practically ordered everything. I will say, the highlights were the peking duck, the pork, the hamachi nori, and the ribs. And I'm not even a big fan of ribs, but they were fall of the bone tender. So glorious.One issue I had is with our service. Our waiter wasn't rude, he was just...weird. Everything he did was at inopportune times and he was clearly not amused by anything we were saying. I know this place serves food dim sum style, but I wasn't expecting the service to be similar to those restaurants as well. Whatever, it wasn't enough to dampen the overall experience, as all the other servers who brought around the provisions were nice and welcoming, and the food was delicious, of course.I can't wait to return to this place. But it will have to be in two months (at the earliest) because this place is already booked through then. The place is small, so unless you want to wait for hours, reservations are the way to go. One final shout out to the earl grey ice cream sandwich. A delicious end to a great meal. There is a lot of great food in SF, so it is a real treat to go to someplace for the first time an come away anxious to go back.  We had a four-top on Friday evening.  We ate robustly, ordering one of just about everything that came around, plus a few things off the fixed menu.  The flavors were universally bold and interesting.  The one non-meat eater among us had plenty to eat, despite the carnivores among us.  The five star rating is for the food and for the staff who were awesome.  The wine list has enough choices to have something nice to pair with the food, but you are not coming here for the wine.  Also, the place was packed and very loud. It is a tough reservation to get, but one that I will make and clear my calendar for. I just couldn't get into this place.  And I didn't even have to wait, even though we were walk-ins and the place was packed.  Admittedly though, the servers were really nice, and pointed me in the direction of a great wine that I've never tried before (cannonau).  With respect to the food, there were a couple of hits - and a lot more misses.  Maybe I was expecting too much of the quail and the short ribs, which were dull.  Burrata cheese garlic bread was nothing special, especially once the cheese cools down and hardens.  The guinea hen dumplings seemed gimicky.  I probably won't go back. I am giving it a 4-star, because the quality is not as good as when they first opened. Don't get me wrong, their duck moss and the sea urchin pancake are still to die for. However, they took away a couple of my fav dishes (salmon roe with chips and the salmon pancake) and for some reason the fried quail isn't as delicious anymore;( We rolled in past 10 pm last night, and we were seated within 10-15 minutes. It was our first time; we were curious about all the press surrounding the restaurant. The entire staff was friendly and down to earth, and everyone was enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the food. The inside of the restaurant was cheery and a bit kitschy, reminding us of an old school diner. It was fun having the option to order from the ""dim sum"" trays and/or from the menu. So many choices, and everything was made fresh from the open kitchen!We tasted the following provisions:- kimchee yuba- glazed pork ribs- sweetbread meatball- red trout- cast iron quail eggs- ricotta dumplings- smoked sturgeon pancake- Seville orange granita, lime curds, and Asian pearAll the flavors popped for us. In fact, some dishes were too salty. To us, the stars of the night were the red trout (perfectly cooked) and ricotta dumplings (reminded us of burrata.) Both dishes included hazelnuts - the crunch contrasted nicely with the soft texture of the fish and dumplings. We appreciated the addition of fresh herbs to many of the dishes and the piping hot temperature of our main proteins.We are glad State Bird Provisions takes reservations, but we wish they were on Open Table... We'll be back! Been hearing a ton of hype about this place as ""one of the best new restaurants in America"" and whatnot. And while I do agree the food was really good, I wasn't completely blown away. A big part of it for me was the fact that they come up to you every 5 minutes asking to try something off the tray. This would be fine -- IF you had the option to opt out. I've eaten at similar restaurants (Dim-Sum and Brazilian churrascaria steakhouses) where you can put up a small flag or other such indicator on they table if you would not like to be approached by the food trays. It became hard to have a conversation with my date when we were being interrupted every few minutes and I found myself starting to resent the servers for doing so, even though the staff was actually really nice.My only other critique would be lighting. The decor is neat but it was too bright in there, which hurt the ambiance. Felt like a cafeteria. I would recommend it for sure, and all this to say the food *was* really good -- especially interesting and tasty was the fish egg/egg salad and the ribs. And of course the state bird...with provisions. :) I really wanted to like this place, as I've heard so many good things, but after paying way too much for leaving still hungry, I was very disappointed.The wait for this place is out of control. I got there right when it opened and was told there was a 2.5 hour wait. I understand that it is a tiny restaurant, but then why have a reservation system at all? It would work better to have a walk-in-only establishment.I was seated around 8pm and ordered quickly, since I was starving. While I waited for my food, various servers came up to me and thrust dishes in my face. They described them and would insist that I eat them, looking disappointed if I didn't oblige. I could barely have a conversation with my friend because I kept being interrupted by them and it got annoying quickly. Many of the dishes did look good, but they were so tiny that they didn't seem worth the $8-$10 price tag, so I only ordered one small plate that was indeed, so small that I could barely enjoy it.The crab farro was not worth its $20 price tag - it was small and lacked seasoning. I had to ask for salt and pepper and got a dirty look when I did. The sturgeon pancake, however, was delicious, and I only wish I had ordered 2 or 3 of those and called it a night. Everything was expensive, so I left without trying dessert and ate another dinner at home since I was still hungry.State Bird has a lot of potential, and I can see it being a really great place. But if it wants to have a successful dim sum concept, it needs to be a bigger restaurant and it needs to appreciate that its diners are waiting 2-3 hours to eat there. Not once did anyone ever acknowledge me for waiting so long or offer me anything complimentary or otherwise, which was a total letdown. It didn't feel very hospitable to me, and I was very disappointed. I'm a bit torn about this place.  Went in, knowing about all the hype and having read the articles about it being the best new restaurant in 2012, etc, etc.. so it was pretty hyped up.  Went in.. the space was nice... kitchen WIDE open and in the front.  A counter at the front for 3 people to stand and eat, then about 9 more bar spots to sit and eat and watch them cook.  Everyone waits along the wall by the kitchen... and the seating area is in the back.. looks like no tables more than 4 people.  It's an interesting and cool concept.  You order off a limited menu and then they also come by with trays and carts (kinda dim-sum style) with special dishes of the day.  There is a price clearly showing how much each is, which I think is nice.  Everything is meant to be shared.  It's an interesting way to eat... there is food, you just eat and share... no order to anything... no courses... kind of like a tasting or a cocktail hour with horderves.  Some notes:1. The service was great.  We were greeted warmly.  Our server asked us if we'd been there before and explained everything well.  The people who came by w/ the trays/cart described their dishes well.  Our plates got switched out when we wanted, etc etc.2. It's not pretentious at all.  It has more of a neighborhood, casual feel.... kinda hipsterish.3. The price wasn't bad.  We got a LOT of dishes, including 4 big $16-20 ones off the main menu.  The smaller plates they come by with are small and cheap.. they range from $6-10.  Include a bottle a wine and it was $65 a person w/ generous tip.4.  The smaller dishes, you wonder how are four people going to share this (one meatball?).  but it's actually no problem.5.  They bring out the trays and carts at random, so they brought out stuff at the end I wanted to try but we were already full and done eating...The food itself?  It was interesting and unique.  It was good but not awesome.  Nothing wowed, nothing popped, the flavors were kind of muted if anything.  The state bird (fried quail), the duck, the beef salad were all pretty good; the ribs were weird.. not really glazed or sauced like you would think.. tender, but not super tender; the pancake with smoked sturgeon was awesome; the garlic bread with burrata was good texture, but no flavor; the sweetbread meatball was ok; the spicy kimchi yuba with smoked egg 'bottarga' was interesting in a good way... a bit oily but it did have a good kimchi flavor; the vegetable romesco was so-so... the swordfish and artichoke was so-so... I didn't like the ice cream sandwich...  we got a few more dishes I think, but I can't remember... overall, it was just muted flavors.Given the opportunity I'd go back.  try some other stuff. My friend took me here for my birthday!  Fried quail: must have.  the half order ($8) was just enough to taste Several cold seafood dishes (salsa/avocado thing, raw seafood salad) were flavorful and refreshing.Steak salad: very very rich, with delicious lemony oyster mushrooms.The garlic bread is deep fried and topped with a mound of burrata.  My friend needed another order, but I found it to be too rich.Other things were unmemorable: a single dumpling in a lemony broth, sweetbread meatball.  Mini sauerkraut pancakes: delicious Expect a slow meal (carts came by once every 10 min).  We had a 30 min wait even with reservations.  Easy street parking + structure nearby. Meh. Food is good, but service needs a lot of help. Don't ask me to pay $200 for dinner for 2 and then act like you're doing me a favor.Got a walk-in table, which they told us would be late. They ended up getting our number wrong, so we called in at 9:45 and they gave us a table. Our waiter was very cool when he was at the table, but I've never been so rushed in a meal in my life. It was just uncomfortable. Staff literally was mopping around the table at 10:45. And there was an audible cheer as we walked out the door.Net net: if you're going to play in the big leagues, act like it. If you didn't want to stay late, don't seat a customer late. That's all there is. But when you do seat a customer, you should at least pretend like you're excited to make more money. Because you're charging an arm and a leg for what's basically fried chicken and a few novel sides.I'd be shocked if they got a Michelin star. That requires service and class. This is more like a hipster flash-in-the-pan type place. Excellent service, but the food was fine.  Not bad, not great, just fine. Details: guinea hen dumpling (basically, a won ton in chicken broth with cumin)garlic bread burrata (bread was tough but burrata is always yummy)quinoa and mushrooms (very bland and mushy)pork belly with orange and mint (dry/overcooked but good flavor combination)ribs (dry/meh)beef (the best dish)the seafood selections (lobster lentil dish was good, but the others were just ok) the ice cream sandwiches (ok)After all the hype, I was a bit disappointed. One of the few restaurants that actually live up to the hype. Living walking distance we  figured we blew our chance to try SBP once every magazine started pimping it, locally and nationally. It was to out pleasant surprise that we walked in ans scored a cancellation and was seated at the counter within 5 mins. I'm feeling you now, State Bird!No need to go on about the food. Enough has been said and 9 out of 10 our dishes were awesome. So you're good there. Where my expectations were essentially neutral was in the staff. Genuinely happy to be working there and it showed. We got treated to the milk shots for dessert too so got to feel a little special though guessing this happens often but whatever-nice touch SB! And it was my official first goodbye hug by a staff member I just met. AwwwPersonal tips:-Don't take every dim sum dish that first comes out. The options were plentiful and you'll get stuffed so bide your time and check out all the options first-Go counter. You get to chit chat with the cooks about anything and everything Thank you Stuart!  You and your staff are all super cool.  Not much else to say other than it was a truly great experience dining here. I enjoyed every dish I tried.  The state bird (Fried quail), the uni scallion pancake, the lobster jar, the guinea hen with fragrant broth and the sweatbread meatball.  All were delicious and should be on everyone's must try list.  I left the hollow leg at home otherwise I would have gone for the hamachi crudo on the nori and the burrata and garlic bread.  Good luck getting reservations or try coming in super early at 5 to get a walk-in spot.  It's totally worth it. One of the best dinning experiences I've ever had hands down! All the servers are extremely friendly and informative. But the food is what takes the cake here! I loved the small tapas style dishes. And just so creative with all the different combinations. I would recommend anyone to go here! You will not be disappointed!  Definitely go with  a group of 2-4 people and share your dishes. It's extremely fun!Definitely rated best new restaurant in the country last year for good reason :) this restaurant was amazing and def worth the two month wait for the reservation!  Just walking into the restaurant and watching the food that was coming around in the carts we were ready to make our next reservation.My favorite dish by far was the pork belly.  The sauce that it came with was to die for!  Another must for me was the sourdough pancakes.  They came out at the perfect temperature and the ricotta inside made for a great texture.The only dish that I could have gone without was the steak tartar.  The anchovy was a little too overpowering for me but it was still nice to have a few bites of salad with the meal.I would definitely recommen only ordering a few dishes off the actual menu and waiting for the carts to come around.  The element of surprise about what we could possibly have next was really fun.  For dessert the candied almond and chocolate ice cream sandwich was my favorite.  The meringue almost made it taste like a sophisticated s'more.  And yes on our way out we did make our reservation for our next dinner there. 13.02.19    1st TimeFood                      4 1/2Price                      $45-$65Atmosphere         3 1/2Words cannot do this place justice.I will try.Everything other than waiting in line was fun experience.I will bring out the bad news first.NEGATIVE:   YES, the line IS infamous as other blogs say.          - Showing up 40 min earlier still garner  2hr 06min wait.              We were text-ed earlier than estimated time.             I love restaurants that gives worst case scenario time.            At least we could do other things other than ...                     hearing table will ready in 10 min ... for 5 times! Yes it did                                  happened in the past. *(*&% bad thing to do.   YES, it seems that majority of the reserved party showed up!   Like to be touched or bumped or recreated riding MUNI Metro during              rush hours. However ... the same counter seating gives you              many benefits!!!  (listed below)   Was unable to eat every offerings that came by ... I was full          and yet the temptation kept coming ... next time          you little devils...--------------------------------------------------­-------------------------------------------POSITIVE:  (Counter seating ... dubbed Chef's Table or Counter)   One hell of customer service!   Not a single snubbed or bad service.   Everyone was introduced ... including all 5 line cooks!!!   Each order was vividly and fully described !!!   Each offerings had price listed. (Great ... easily to over order)   Amazing price for well executed masterpieces !!!      In the bathroom ... they provided several                stacks of fluffy cotton hand towels !!!  (Super green)   The dim sum style was                       At the chef's counter:        See everything being executed before you eyes.                 You can see the concentration and love                        placed in each well though tout dishes        You can ask or just get the order directly from either 5 line chef                I intentionally called them line chef or fill out a list of                         items that your heart desires.    Usually at other restaurants that  offered  very good food you still              can describe or imaginatively or logically breakdown how it was               created almost immediately. HOWEVER ....              The some of the dishes STUNS up or WOW you heart !!!              After your senses recover from the WTF factor ...              you wonder how in the world he thought of this combination!              Some of the dishes did this to me. (Not to sound like a food snob                       I don't usually sounds like this ... check my past blogs ...                       some of the dishes was breathless.rough draft ... will update For how busy they are, their customer service rocks.Food Quality - Excellent.Food Taste - Good.Food Originality - Excellent.Price - Good.Customer Service - Excellent. The lady who manages the place has so much positive energy even tat 10:45PM. If everyone enjoyed their work like she does the world would be a better place :)Ambiance - Good. My #1 bestie and her boyfriend went to statebird while I third wheeled, but we're all family so it's whatever. We stood at that standing bar and ordered a ton. They say its fun to stand there but don't believe them!!Food:The duck liver mousse with almond biscuit was creamy, flavorful, and really cute. Yes, order this.garlic bread with burrata- good but not garlicky enoughSeafood salsa wasn't great. Kind of bland and boring. I felt schemed. Meh, I'd pass.CA state bird with provisions. This is their fried quail. The lemony onions were great but the bird was bland. I'm obsessed with fried food but even I was kinda just like wtf. HUGE disappointment. Super PASS.Half dozen quail eggs on iron pan. nothing special, an expensive nothing special too..Strawberry ice cream sandwich- yum yum yum, yes please!The peanut muscovado milk was given to us complimentary for being in the standing spot. The girl was super sweet but I just don't like peanuts vey much..UNI PANCAKE. THIS. THIS. THIS. FIVE PLEASE. SERIOUSLY. MAKE THAT SEVEN. WHY ARE YOU SO DELICIOUS. this was the absolute BEST thing I had here. So obsessed. Arguably the best uni I've had in my entire life. Order this please. One for yourself and one for me. Think of me while you eat it and graciously thank me by dropping one off to me after. You're already welcome.I'm gunna try the sturgeon pancake next time. But forreal, uni = bomb. I enjoyed this place. Went on a random Tuesday night without reservations at 5:10 and just missed the first 5:30pm seating. Why is this place so jam packed? Mardi Gras that night in the Fillmore? Maybe, but I would like to say it is because of the well warranted buzz surrounding their delicious food and novel concept. Burrata fried bread and nori fish thing were great. Dinner at the bar overlooking the kitchen enhanced the experience. We got superb service from Glenn and had fun watching him and others assemble each wave of dishes. Drink and wine menu were fine. Atmosphere was hipstery and alright. Key thing, everyone felt welcome there and I saw so many happy dinners. I was one of them.Try to get a reservation or get off work as early as you can to get a walk in spot. Worth experiencing at least once. Best dining experience I've had in awhile! The service was amazing and the food was fun, inventive and delicious! Each dish is explained properly and there's no pressure to grab everything that passes by, although you'll want to since everything looks great. Just pace yourself and enjoy the experience!Note: Definitely get reservations. Chances are slim that you'll get seated if you wait in the LONG line out front unless you're willing to wait a few hours. We made another reservation with the hostess as we were leaving - heck yeah! This is actually the real deal.  The food was super fresh, creative, interesting.  A unique dining experience even for a jaded crowd that has seen it all.Good atmosphere with clearly lots of adoring and doting fans. For the big #600, it seemed fitting to review ""one of 2012's best new restaurants in America"".  Fortunately for me though, I actually knew nothing about that before my friend and I stopped in for dinner (does that mean I'm not a true foodie?).  However, despite not having those huge expectations, I was still hopeful after hearing so many good things about them, and State Bird did not disappoint!Although it's not a concept unique to them, it's pretty cool how State Bird runs its meal service like a dim sum restaurant.  In addition to their staples you order off the menu, the workers will also bring around the day's ""provisions"" - about 5-10 dishes that rotate and change on a day-to-day basis.  Of the ones we tried, the first two below and the dessert are signature dishes, while the rest were part of their daily ""provisions"".- Green Garlic Toast and Burrata Cheese(yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…)One of the two dishes my friend said we had to get (the State Bird was the other), but I would have got this whether she wanted it or not.  Lightly fried garlic toast topped with creamy burrata cheese, olive oil and ground black pepper...what's not to like?  It was so good, I wish she ""made"" me get my own order!- CA State Bird with Provisions - Breaded and Fried Quail with Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese and Stewed Lemon Onions(yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…)We split a half order so that we could try several other things, but it just wasn't enough.  Unlike some Yelpers, I didn't think the breading was all that thick, but I agree the quail was missing that mild gaminess to it.  However, I actually didn't mind since it didn't get in the way of the tasty stewed lemon onion sauce and the MMMMMM...CHEESE!  Just make sure you get enough to go around. - Togarashi Oysters  - Saint Simon Oysters topped with Pickled Corabi, Sesame, and Chili Pepper(yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…)Really fresh, but it was our least favorite of the night.  For me, the pickled corabi and chili pepper came off a little strong for the more delicate oysters.  Still, not a bad dish at all; just that I might look to try something new before getting it again.- Duck Liver Mousse with Almond Biscuits(yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…)It's no foie gras, but I'll gladly take this as a substitute while I hope/wait for the real stuff to return.  The liver is rich, but it doesn't leave you with that gross feeling inside.  The almond biscuits though, were amazing - just the right amount of sweet, almond flavor.  If it's offered, it's a must get if you like duck liver.- Eggnog Ice Cream Sandwich with Sherry Chocolate Coulis(yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…)Neither of us really had dessert in mind, but my friend really wanted to try this one after she saw another table get it.  Good call!  The egg nog flavor was rather mild, and the chocolate was delicious.  The almonds were great as well, and added some nice texture/crunch.With such awesome food (and amazing service...the workers were so genuinely nice!), it's no wonder getting a table at State Bird can be tough.  Reservations are ideal, but they're usually booked up a month or two out.  Otherwise, they do set aside some tables for walk-ins.  Just arrive early or late (it's not that big of a place).  We did the latter and were lucky enough to get a table immediately...at 9:15pm on a random weeknight.  However you get in though, I'm sure you'll leave pretty happy! My wife was out celebrating a friends birthday so I decided to give SBP a try as a single walk-in on a Tuesday night around 7:30.  Was seated at the bar in about 5 min.  Everyone was extremely friendly and seemed to really enjoy working there which made for great conversation throughout the evening.  Forrest, my commrade behind the bar was gracious enough to let me talk his ear off and was extremely helpful with the menu items (what his favorites are at the moment, all-time, wine pairing, etc.).My top 5 favorites of the evening:- mushroom & quinoa with toasted 'gomasio'- duck liver mousse with almond biscuit- hamachi-avocado seaweed crostini- raw oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesame- garlic bread with burrataThe mushroom & quinoa and hamachi crostini dishes tied for my overall favorites. I, of course, overindulged and had a few other small plates and was pleasantly stuffed to the gills.  The ambiance was a bit loud, but I thoroughly enjoyed the lively atmosphere.  Upon leaving, the majority of the staff behind and in front of the counter made it a point to smile and thank me for coming in.  Definitely going back soon! 1 month of waiting for a reservation.2 months of waiting after the reservation was made.2 meals skipped prior to dinner.4 famished/excited people.2 hours of stuffing and gluttony.after 3 months of waiting to try State Bird Provisions, my game plan was to wreck thru the place like a tasmanian devil...mission accomplished.as soon as we sat down, it was like we've all been there before...i mean, we've all had dim sum before, and State Bird is practically the same...err, just better...concept wise, pre-made ""share"" dishes, carted around for people to eye f*ck while you still have other dishes on your table...this place will definitely bring out the fat kid in you...if you were to ask me what i had for dinner there, i honestly wouldnt be able to tell you, ONLY because there was so much intermingling of all the dishes that i couldnt keep track...all i remember was sweating and stuffing my face full of all the different flavors that kept popping up in the middle of our table...appealing to both the eye and the palate, State Bird Pro. definitely lives up to the hype and accolades that its received in the past year.after revisiting the menu online, these are the dishes (and prices) that we had...-raw oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesame 3-guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth 3-duck liver mousse with almond biscuit 6-sweetbread meatball with quince & pickled veg 6-lobster, lentil & asian pear salad 8-steak tartare salad with anchovy & castelfranco 8-seafood 'salsa' 10-pork belly with winter citrus 10-mendocino sea urchin, ginger/scallion pancake, soy-lime glaze 14-glazed pork ribs with swiss chard, togarashi 10/20-1/2 dozen cast iron quail eggs, sunchoke & ravigote 12-'peking duck'....spiced confit leg, crepes, cloud ears & persimmon 20-buttery dungeness crab with farro 'spezzato' 20-candied almond & chocolate 'ice cream' sandwich, apricot meringue 8i dont want to bother you with describing every single dish (although i easily could) BUT i will tell you what i think are the MUST TRY DISHES...MUST TRY-----SEAFOOD SALSAMUST TRY-----PORK BELLY W/ WINTER CITRUSMUST TRY-----SEA URCHIN W/ PANCAKEMUST TRY-----1/2 DOZEN QUAIL EGGSMUST TRY-----PEKING DUCKMUST TRY-----DUNGENESS CRAB W/ FARRO SPEZZATOthe above dishes were amazing, and when i go back on April 4th (yes, we made reservations again immediately after dinner) i hope to have at least 3 of these MUST TRY items again...the only thing i was not impressed with was the steak tartare salad...was more of a caesar salad with a sprinkling of steak tartare...tasted good, but not up to par with some of the other dishes...cant wait to see what new items will be available for us in April...love this place! Love this restaurant!  I think, so far, my favorite in SF.It's a long wait if you're a walk-in, but it's worth it to sit on the counter near the chefs.  My opinion...best seat in the house.  (Suggestion: sign up on the waiting list then go grab drinks around the corner.  They'll call you when your table is ready.)Everyone is super nice and informative and the food is AMAZING! Disclaimer:  We haven't eaten here yet, we tried, oh yes we did.  Went down early, like 6 on a Monday and was told we could be seated at 8.  That's fine except I don't think they should have ""Walk-In's Welcome"" on the website.  It's kind of a farce, if I understand it correctly (please correct me if I am wrong) they use the counter space for reservations, not for the walk ins like most restaurants my husband and I go to.  It just turned me off... 3.5i've been wanting to try this place for months and would check the site periodically to make reservations.. i've never seen the reservation tool whenever i went on so i was convinced there was something wrong on the site.. on a random early sat afternoon, i saw the calendar for 60 days out but it landed on a tues so i made a mental note to check on wed.. i almost forgot about it but a friend just posted a pic from sbp tues night to remind me. i stayed up til almost 1am wed but no luck.. luckily my bladder woke me up in the middle of the night and saw that was about 430.. i immediately checked the site on my phone and lo and behold the calendar was up! scored a prime time sat 730 seating 60 days out. (had to cancel last min and made reservations for a diff day). it took a while but i finally made it...they have a menu where you order the bigger dishes and the smaller ones come out on a cart, dim sum style..now on to the food:-mendocino sea urchin on ginger/scallion pancake: the creaminess of the uni went well w the soft pancake-hamachi collar(special that night and only had 2 made): this was good and the soy glaze made the dish-seafood salsa w tortilla: salsa on top of whipped avocado.. i liked this but wasn't amazing-ricotta dumpling w chanterelle dino-kale ragout: ok, i wouldn't order this again-duck liver mousse w almond biscuit: loved it w the biscuit-chips and ahi tuna salad ""dip"": ok, the home made chips were a nice touch but too oily-ca state bird w provisions: so good we ordered another at the very end but the wait took so long that we didn't even want our second order and weren't in the mood to grab dessert herethere were def hits and misses.. would i come back? yes, but not in a while and only to try dishes i didn't get a chance to eatside note:bonappetit.com/restauran…bonappetit.com/blogsandf…bonappetit.com/restauran…nytimes.com/2013/03/10/m…;immaculateinfatuation.co… I stalked their homepage for months before I finally was able to snag a 9 pm reservation on a weekday. It felt like winning a golden ticket. Reservations are hard to come by, but it's definitely worth trying. I thought this was over-hyped, but it deserves all the accolades. It's one of my new favorite places to eat in SF. I think the ideal party size is 4, that way you can try a variety of dishes.Loved the dim-sum style of serving the small plates, we ordered almost everything that came around to our table.  Things that were noteworthy for me were:Here were my favorites:- Trout - This had mandarin oranges and the fish was tender and melted in your mouth.- Sea Urchin Pancake -  I don't normally like sea urchin too much, but this was delicious. A savory pancake, well seasoned, and the uni on top was the perfect touch.- CA State Bird - Deep fried anything is good. Slightly small portion, but delicious breading on the quail and fried to perfection.- Pork Rib - Tasted great, good seasoning, not too salty and the meat fell off the bones it was so tender.- Beef salad - So good, I don't normally like red meat, but this was delicious. Was seared just right, super tender, and good flavor. Roasted vegetables were paired perfectly. Okay:- Lobster, lentil and pear salad - It was good, but it was $8 for a baby-food sized jar of this salad.- Mushroom & quinoa - Tasted good, but wouldn't get it again. Could probably make it at home.- Oysters - The vinaigrette was a little overpowering on the oysterWe had other dishes but they must have been not-as-memorable. I didn't have anything that I didn't like, though.The highlight of the night was the dessert. The ice cream sandwich was the clear winner - thin brownie on the outside, vanilla ice cream with candied peanuts, apricot puree and a toasted marshmallow cream. We enjoyed it so much that we ordered a second of these. Definitely a must-have if you come.The total bill (before tip) for 4 people was $200. Not too bad since we got to try a wide variety of dishes, the quality was excellent and all the food was delicious. I'll definitely be back. What a fun and delicious place. Am stalking their site to make my next reservation 60 days from now...Definitely get a reservation for four people (can only do 2 or 4) -- like with dim sum, more dinner friends means more dishes. I think we ordered all but two of the dim sum dishes. We ordered without abandon, had 1-2 beers each, and ended up with a $50 bill + tip (so about $60). Favorites- Lobster salad with lentils- Garlic break with burratta- Ricotta dumplings- State Bird w Provision - crispy deliciousness- Ice cream sandwichWe also had the oysters (yum), uni flatbread (i've had better ways to have uni but interesting), ribs (fatty and delicious), bacon wrapped fish belly (fatty and delicious), and the white chocolate mochi rice pudding (yumm).Highly recommend getting two orders of the ice cream sandwich. They cut them up to four pieces, but it is SO worth getting two pieces each with the delicious citrus dollop and the marshmellow with the roasted crust (guessing torched). Gingery cookie. So good. Came here a few months ago right when it was featured in Food & Wine, just before reservations became so hard to get.  It was really good, but we resigned ourselves to not going back for awhile.  Then we got not one but TWO gift certificates here for a recent birthday!Tuesday was our second trip there, and that sealed it: it was terrific!  The service -- great; the wine -- delicious; the food -- wow!  Some of the tastiest, most creative preparations I've ever tasted: oysters with kohlrabi, uni on a seaweed 'cracker', sweetbread meatballs -- come on!  And the concept is still awesome: I haven't heard of dim sum trays and carts being used anywhere else but in a traditional dim sum restaurant, so kudos for the folks who thought this up!Interesting note about the crowd: it attracts all kinds, which is cool.  That night, we saw hipster buddies, PacHeights socialites, bridge-and-tunnel couples, and (annoyingly) some combo of 20-something guys and their 60-something bosses who must've been here for an IT convention and didn't know how to modulate their volume (no, bro/dude, you don't have to laugh at EVERY bad joke your boss tells).  It's a small space so expect to hear everything and have your chair bumped by the person behind you, but it's all part of the experience -- and worth it. OMG the hype on this place is well deserved. Love their dim sum concept. We really do eat with our eyes and seeing the dishes presented to you is much harder to say no to. I went with my husband, foodie friend, and my 5 year old son. He came away full and happy. He knows good food.My favorite was the duck liver pate w/ almond cakes. First off, the cakes were more like little bites of honey cornbread. The pate I literally, scooped onto my spoon and licked it off. No need to put the pate on the almond cakes at all. We had 3 orders. My son kept stealing the almond cakes off our plates.The hamachi on nori was beautifully presented. The nori was thicker than normal sushi nori but it was crispy and full of umami. The hamachi was tender and fatty and the light drizzle of sauce on top was perfect. There's nothing wrong at all with this dish. We had 3 orders of this.The ribs on the menu was surprisingly delicious and out-of-the-box. I thought they would likely be BBQ but I was wrong. They came on top of some greens that were drenched in oil. Too much oil on those greens. The ribs looked bland w/o the usually BBQ sauce drizzle and char. However, they were delicious. Not BBQ but braised likely. It was tender w/ the meat falling off the bones easily. I would have gotten another order had the greens not been so oily.The oysters were fresh but I did not like the overpowering mignotte on it.The lobster lentil salad was ok, not spectacular.The cerviche with potato chips was good. The fresh potato chips stood out more than the ceviche.The chocolate soda sounds really weird but I got it just to try. It is actually pretty good. It is good in a weird way.I don't remember what else we had. I was in a food coma and was blissfully happy. I didn't think it was that expensive. I think it is very reasonably priced for the quality of food. If the wait wasn't 2 months for a reservation, I would definitely go back more often. The service was wonderful and knowledgeable about what they were serving. It's important to know that they do not take reservation over the phone, you'll have to do it in person. All the staff are very nice and helpful. They serve the food in a ""dim sum style"" as they will walk around with a cart or plate of tapas and you can choose which one you would like to take. But, I found it easier to order from the menu as I was ordering from the walking plates at the same time. It was hard to tell when the next cart/plate will come around. My favorite dishes are the avocado and shirp with nori chip and buttery dungeness crab with farro 'spezzato'. A waiter told me that the Garlic Bread with Buratta is their most popular dish but it was a little too ""cheesy"" and too heavy for me. Also, I wasn't too fond of the dumplings, they were bland and stiff.Another tip for ordering food: do not order anything with the host. We could not locate our waitress for a while so we asked the hostess if she could find our waitress for us. The host took our order and ended up chatting with the gentlemen sat behind us for half an hour and our waitress never received our order.Overall, I love their decor and atmosphere. Service was great, and I enjoyed most of the dishes we got! This was singularly the best dining experience I've had in years!  I was completely blown away!I had heard this was the toughest place to get into with a 2 month wait and was fortunate enough to get a table.  I assumed it was an ultra trendy, upscale place and was surprised that it was so much more casual.  So casual and NOT trendy that I thought I was in the wrong place.  And it was all up hill after that. The concept is brilliant.  Signature menu-ed dishes while the staff wheels carts of small plates like they do in a dim sum restaurant.  The dishes are extremely inventive with a lot going on in texture and flavors yet all working magically together.  And the staff was the most pleasant, happy, helpful people you'll ever meet.  So much so that they helped make for an amazing experience!We had about 10 dishes and one was good, two were very good, and the remaining were sublime!  In the ""sublime"" bucket is: hamachi & avocado seaweed crostini; red trout; tuna crudo; ricotta dumplings; sourdough sauerkraut ricotta pancakes; and peking duck among others.While eating, I met the owner and instinctively stood up to speak with him out of deference because it was so amazing and couldn't have been nicer or more humble.  Brilliant!!!! It took about 2 months for a reservation.I wanted to loooooove SBP but I just couldn't.  The concept is amazing and it was well executed.  But I did leave hungry with a hole burned into my wallet.WHAT I ATE:fried herring: it was ok moist and crispstate bird: love the crisp on itquail egg: so delishtuna: passfried pig ear: LOVEEDDDD IT ordered it 2xhamachi on fried seaweed: SO GOODburratta garlic bread: so greasy gooddessert:  I can't remember what I ate so it wasn't that great. The concept is unique. The food is average, maybe a bit overrated. The staff is very friendly. Would I go so far to call it the best restaurant in America? Probably not. This was my third time at this restaurant. Keeps getting better. Service - on pointDecor - inventive? The map of the US with each of the state birds is pretty classic.Food - off the charts1) Uni Pancake - never seen anything like it. Tangy pancake, sweet salty uni2) Chips with Tuna Tartar - best salsa I've ever had 3) Ricotta pasta with roasted squash sauce - killer4) Crab with farro - toned down farro with some awesomely buttery crab5) Housemade bread with Buratta - I would take this as my last mealRelatively inexpensive and well selected draft beer. Good, but not zany wine list. HOLY COW. State Bird Provisions is hands down one of the best experiences I've had here in San Francisco.  The wait, the food, the ambiance, the restaurant - ALL WORTHHH ITT.Let's start with getting a table.  We all know it's next to impossible to get a reservation at SBP.  So, for the desperate triers like myself and Greg, we decided to game it and crash the party by showing up at 7pm and putting our name down on the waiting list.  Of course, we were met with ""it's going to be awhile"" and of course our response was ""yeah no problem, when is the next available seating?"".  The last thing we were expecting was, ""9:30pm or 10"".  Um what?  We put our name down, and then set off to go watch Lincoln at the Kabuki Theater around the corner.  As it turns out, this was one of the smartest things we did.  2.5 hours later, we saw the movie, and headed back to SBP.  When we got back, we had to wait another 20 minutes for our spots at the chefs bar to clear out, and finally, 3 hours later, WE WERE SEATED.  It should be noted that each time we walked in, we were greeted with one of the people at the restaurants.  This person made sure we were able to get on the waiting list, made sure we had the drink menu in case we wanted something to drink, and as it turns out, it was Stuart Brioza himself!  How awesome is that?!Ok, so, onto the food!  So right when we sat down, we could see the chefs preparing all of the tiny dishes that were going to go out to the tables.  One of the BEST things about sitting at the chefs bar is that you get first dibs on what's coming out of the kitchen.  That means, while the chef is garnishing that savory meatball, you get the first crack at it.  Not only that, but you get the 411 on what's in a dish, and can request something you like, or reorder your favorite item.  Here's what we had that night in our order of favorites:1. California State Bird with Provisions: YES YES YES.  This is as amazing as its advertised.  The perfect crust on the bird, an easy dish to share, and topped with some parm and onion jam.  The only small thing about this was that you have to kind of work for your food, the bird is a little small for a knife and fork, but it's totally worth it.1a. DESSERT: Candied almond & chocolate 'ice cream' sandwich, apricot meringue.  This was most definitely a piece of art and not dessert.  This was absolutely incredible.  It was as beautiful as it was delicious. A must try item (even if its just for the pics!)2. Greg's favorite of the night: the veal and sweetbread meatball.  The meatball itself was HUGE. Greg didn't feel like sharing, but in the small few bites I managed to get in before it was gone, this was delicious!3. Pan fried guinea hen dumpling with mushroom in a wonderful aromatic broth: This wasn't an item on the menu, so I don't know the specifics of what was in it.  BUT. long story short, Greg and I loved this so much, we got it again later on in the meal4. Pork belly with winter citrus:  This was one of my favorites!  I LOVE pork belly, and this was crispy and totally savory and when paired with the citrus, made for an absolutely wonderful experience!  I would have totally gotten this again :)5.  Homemade potato chips with avocado, tuna and bell peppers:  Greg loves potato chips, and with the avocado it was like guacamole meets poke meets picnic.6. Hamachi avocado seaweed crostini:  I really enjoyed this, but you have to really like seaweed to enjoy this.  I really loved the avocado and fish to go with the big nori chip.7. Olive oil bread with burratta: This was a really whimsical dish, I'm not sure if I loved it, but it was certainly a great idea!  Definitely worth trying since it was a popover with cheese on it.8. Sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancakes: I'm not saying these aren't good, but relative to everything else, these were just OK.  They were dollar sized so they were perfect to share.  I love these, but I'd try another version of these next time.So, the long story of this, I totally would wait 3 hours again for State Bird.  And I would want to go with a bigger group so that I could try more things!  I love here, and I can't stop raving about this to all of my Yelp and non-Yelp friends :)  Do yourself a favor and head over to SBP! It took us 2 months to get reservations for SBP....5:30pm on a Saturday.  Traffic was bad getting into the city and I knew they would cancel our reservation if we were more than 15 minutes late.  We called 3 different times to let them know our status and arrived at 5:46pm (5:45pm to the restaurant, but took us a minute to get to the front of the line).  We had to beg to be seated, and told we would be seated, but that we had to leave by 7pm.  I didn't think much of it, but she actually came up to us at 6:55pm to remind us that we had to leave by 7pm.  This was with one more dish coming out from the kitchen and no dessert ordered yet.  We paid $340 + tip....I would expect to NOT get rushed through my meal.  Our waiter was extremely bored, but he got us stuff when we needed it.  The people ""selling"" the food didn't make much of an effort besides tell us the ingredients. They didn't tell us how it was prepared or anything.   The chef came out though and he was a really nice, happy guy.  Total burst of sunshine and energy compared to the rest of the drab snooty staff.  Everything we ate was unique and well made, but nothing was insanely addicting that would make me want to come back.  $340 + tip for 4 people.....stress on the drive up....stress checking in....stress in having to eat at warp speed...stress at getting reminded that we had to leave at 7pm .....really not worth it.  There are so many other places to eat in the city.  This fad will quickly die out. Great restaurant, innovative, friendly, down to earth, not pretentious, exceptional food. Hard to get reservation so plan ahead. Love it! Update 4/24: I returned to Statebird when Emily was working. Shout out to Emily - hostess, scheduler and customer service representative extraordinaire. All staff were super friendly and helpful. Def returning for my next set of friends visiting or new to the neighborhood. Love the food at State Bird. The chef's table is always a great time.Living so close to the restaurant is awesome. The State Bird experience is a must do. For veggies, the Buratta with bread has the flakiest tastiest bread - nice and not too creamy.One note: I've always love the way they've treated myself and my guests with our day of reservations. January 14th however, I was slightly disappointed. Our reservation was for 7:30 PM. I was taking my visiting from out of state friends and they were all excited. We arrived on time. Once arrived, they told us we did not have a real reservation and that we would have to wait until someone left. I've never had anyone ever tell me this, and had I known we would be treated this way, I might have chosen another option. I don't know if it was a chaotic night or miscommunication but after nearly an hour of waiting we were seated with no apologies or remorse.Again, I love this place, but please note what day you are going and how your day of reservation might be treated. This place is a must eat! Wonderful American food in dim sum style. The only have about 10 items on the menu and then everything else is brought to you on trays or a cart. I can't wait to go back...probably in at least 60 days since they are always booked!If you want to eat here and can't get a resi, stand in line at 5pm and hope to get a table when they open at 5:30pm as they save a few tables for walk-ins. You just have to be okay with eating that early if you go that route. I forgot to write my birthday review back in April...2012 so not sure this counts. Food was great (yes, the quail was good. Small portions really add up $wise. Let me just say I am surprised about all the hoopla with waiting 2 months to get a table lately. I think there are better places in SF to wait for....Let me just share my b-day disappointment. The bf asked the waitress to put a candle in our dessert. She apparently said they don't do that here. So I see this dessert come out with a candle....right past me and served to another table :( My sad dessert came with no candle. WTH? I hope that waitress is no longer there. We got a Saturday night reservation, an amazing feat!  This is a fun place to eat.  The small restaurant is filled immediately on opening.  And soon after being seated, lots of food comes rushing out by cart and on trays.  You get to see the small plates before being served them which I enjoyed.  On their looks and verbal descriptions, you pick what you want from the servers.  My husband called it white man's dim sum.The food is interesting, tasty and fun.   There might be 15 small plates offered by servers on a walk around and then there is a ""Commandable"" menu of 9 larger plates, 3 pancake dishes, and desserts each made just for you in the kitchen upon ordering.  We enjoyed 9 small plates and 3 ""Commandable"" plates, 1 pancake dish and 1 dessert.We of course got practically all that walked by though one gal never stopped or even looked at our table as she went by offering them to our neighbors so we missed out on her dishes.  It did seem like most things made one trip out and about and then probably not offered again.  So do not hesitate to pick the dishes you want when you are first offered them. The food was good, not great but definitely not boring.  I found the small lobster and lentil cup lacked much lobster and the ahi tuna salad served with potato chips lacked much ahi tuna.   But the Dungeness crab and farro dish on the ""Commandable"" menu had great lumps of crab.  The Mendocino uni pancake too had a good amount of uni and we loved it.   There was also a hamachi small plate served on a fried nori that was really good!  There was a big hot bread served with a huge spoonful of  Buratta that should have been good but the fat was pooling on the plate.  I think the fat was not even from the cheese but from way too much butter on the bread.  The bread got tough and old immediately on cooling. We only each had a bite, for it definitely looked better than it tasted.  A large dumpling was served and enjoyed as well as some sort of meatball which my husband especially loved.  A refreshing small salad with grapefruit was especially interesting with many flavors. Oh, we had oysters too which were good but not great.  No oyster liquor left to give that so loved briny sea flavor.  I felt they may have been opened earlier so not just fresh for us.   None of the dishes cost so much that if they were misses, you did not feel abused and misused.  We also had the duck confit leg, their rendition of ""Peking duck"" from the ""Commandable' menu which was good too.  Served with thin pancakes which you filled with the duck and cloud ears.  The State Bird was some kind of tiny fried bird that which was as thrilling as its size.Our server was a delight.  We so enjoyed the ice cream sandwich offered on the dessert menu.  It killed me to leave some, it was that good. We found we ate for the first hour fast and furiously then spent the second hour relaxing as we picked at our ""Commandable"" menu choices while bemoaning our too full stomachs.Bill for 2 piggy eaters was about $240 including a bottle of wine plus 2 glasses.  We may come back!Update:  Just got home from Rich Table (the chef's menu with pairing)  and had to downgrade State Bird by 1 star.  Rich table was so much better.  Lots of WOWS  Our bill was comparable at about  $280.  Lots, lots of food and great pours. A gem in the Fillmore/Western Addition corridor. Reservations are basically impossible to get a this point, so my lady and I put our name in around 6:30pm on a Friday night and were told we'd be looking at a 10pm seating. That was fine with us, and we headed out into the night to enjoy some wine and cards over at Social Study. We got our seating call earlier than expected, and were seated with menues around 9:45pm--a late dinner to be sure, but worth the wait!As vegetarians, we were a little nervous but shouldn't have been: we ate the eff out of that restaurant:- Garlic bread with baked in burrata- Hummus and pita- Quail egg hashI also broke the vegetarianism and ate two oysters with pickled jalepeño. We enjoyed pistachio/strawberry ice cream sandwiches for dessert. But by far the best part of the evening was the waitress delivering our rosé champagne with squeeling, ""pink bubbly!"" with obvious delight. Service was excellent, as expected. The unexpected part for me was the price: entirely reasonable for a splurge! If you eat a lot of the small dishes, they do add up, but if you keep yourself in check, you can get out for about $40/person, including alcohol and tax/tip.Take aways:- Resign yourself to eating late and just put your name in at the beginning of the night- Come hungry State Bird with provisional 60 day wait to get a reserved table! Yay, still a fan but minus one star for that 60 day wait.The day and time came alas for our reservation which took 60 days to arrive. Cut short that last 30 minutes that Tarantino flick, Django Unchained, just to make our 10:30 Saturday night reservation. That was brutal so I was hoping State Bird Provisions would make our first visit worth the visit and make us forget what had ever happened to Django.The +'s:+Saturday night parking was not a wretch. We landed a place three blocks north of the destination but this area can get sketch. Luckily a policeman caught a brawl on the street and we safely passed.+Staff are very friendly and nice. Such a nice reception!+Quail eggs. Half a dozen arrived sunny side up. They were delish. Just perfect golden jewels!+Sea urchin pancake at $14. Get it before it runs out. It was just that good!+Glazed pork ribs on Swiss chard. The meat slid right off that rib. Half order is enough I think for 2 girls. Consider the Full order (4 ribs) if you have a bigger appetite.+Chocolate mochi dessert was plenty for two. That date with marscapone on the side definitely was a winning combination.+ Plenty of tapas kept running by our table on a timely basis. I love the idea of tapas rolling by dim sum style. There was plenty of variations to keep us hungry for more inventive creations but sated after each taste.The -'s- BIG minus is this 60 day wait for a reservation. Mentioning it a third time because it's a real sore point but hey this place is still hype. At least you can show up and hope you get seated before the places closes.- Not all the tapa dishes are a hit and at $8-11 per tapa, the bill tab adds up way faster than a dim sum restaurant.- It's kinda noisy. Voices echoed off our silverware, table, glasses and walls. It was kinda hard to hear my companion speculate on what had happened to Django in the end.- Mushroom dumpling. Meh. I thought it was salty and not much but my companion disagrees completely and said it was a highlight of the meal.- There was a poke like mix of tuna and chick peas that top off a potato chip. Not my fave either. claustrophobic creativity. When someone mentions this is the hottest new restaurant in the world/US/SF, the expectations are going to be high.  At 530 pm there was a line of about 20 people standing by outside, and it seems like maybe the first 12 sat down when the restaurant opened.For the price, I thought it was quite good.  And if it was easier to get in, I'd definitely go back.  The prices are reasonable, but yes, they are tapa sized items.  If we hadn't ordered wine, it would have only been $40-50 per person.  For that level of food, that is about what I'd expect for a good value.  I WAS expecting more ""wow factor"" given the press and rep--only 1-2 dishes really did that for me--but the service was excellent/friendly and approachable.  The citrus, avocado chili lime tapa was excellent.  Refreshing, but not so beguiling that I couldn't duplicate it at home (or so I think!).  I much appreciated the supremed citrus though.  The state bird was also pretty good (fried quail--just like you expect it to taste).Ribs were solid but not anything exceptional--dark green accompanying the ribs were also not so remarkable to us.  I personally thought the uni pancake was nicer (a bit more fluffy, and many flavors/textures) than the the saurkraut pancakes with salt.  But my other dinner guests would say the opposite  We also had two seafood tapas which were unremarkable and two desserts which were ok.  Despite the fact that we all thought the desserts were just ok, it was all gone somehow before we left.We were lucky to get a reservation for the same day we called (due to a cancellation).  If it were easier to get in (not such a labor) I would definitely come back because I thought the price for the level of what you get and what they're trying is great.  I don't think (personally) it's a michelin star level (does not delight and beguile).  But it's very smartly run, the kitchen has great intent, servers go out of their way for you, dim sum concept is fresh, and I hope they continue to be a great success.  When we go again, one thing we'll do differently is skip the $80 bottle of oregon pinot noir.   The wine was nice on its own, but once the food came... Let's just say that a lot of their dishes have enough fatty mouthfeel that any half decent glass of wine would go great.  Next time we'll just order a few individual glasses to have more fun sampling different wines.  That's probably a better philosophy given the variety of dishes State Bird offers. I was very excited to come here of course because of all the surrounding hype.  We were able to get a same day reservation, so if you really want to come here, just CALL and see if there have been any cancellations so you don't have to book 2 months out. The staff was all amazingly friendly and thank god for our reservation because there were about 20 people waiting to sit at the counter. We sort of went all out for this meal and just ordered whatever we wanted in order to have the full experience. We tried all the standards: sauerkraut pancakes, uni pancakes, State Bird w/ Provisions. Then some other plates: Lentil w/ Lobster & Fuyu, some dish with avocado and citrus, the ribs, the Peking duck, a mushroom wonton, the potato chips with creme fraiche, garlic bread w/ burrata, and others I can't remember. We also had two desserts: ice cream sandwiches and the mochi rice pudding.  I wish the Peking duck's skin was more crisp, the burrata more chewy, and the ribs were just really standard, nothing too exciting. The mochi rice pudding was yummy and not too sweet, but I won't think about it again like I do with some desserts.All of the food was interesting, but I have to say that the only things I really loved were the sauerkraut pancakes and the avocado with citrus thing. I could make the citrus/avocado thing at home and the sauerkraut pancakes were good because they were crunchy and balanced flavor-wise. All the other food was pretty good, but not mind-boggling. It was exciting to dine here, but I don't need to come here again.  The price of everything was very reasonable for the quality. 4.5!!Atmosphere and owner attentiveness make it worth it! Will write more soon. Such a fun evening! FYI: arrived at 5:00, a few parties ahead of us and we were the last walk-in to be seated (standing table for two hours!, great calf workout). Sixty days is a long time to wait for a restaurant reservation but in this case it was well worth it.  State Bird Provisions' ""dim sum"" concept is genius.  I wish more restaurants would adopt this approach as it allows you to sample more of their cuisine rather than being saddled with one or two principal dishes.I consumed far too much food to remember each and every item that I ate.  Resounding successes include the vinegar glazed smoked potato, garlic bread with burrata, seafood ""salsa,"" and the glazed pork ribs with swiss chard.  Service was excellent . . . the ambiance was so-so given that the place was packed and it was hard to have a real conversation but, whatever, that's the price you pay for dining at the new ""it"" spot in the city. We ate like royalty.Everything is well made and the atmosphere is casual. Go early REALLY early if you don't have a reservation. Tried to make a rez but nothing until Feb and it was a week night at 8;45 so on a Friday nite, we decided to take a chance as an early walk-in. BINGO.... got to the fillmore at 5:10pm, parked right in front, a line forming already and we are about 10th in line. Within 10 minutes, there is a line 1/2 a block long... Was it worth the HYPE? YES, YES, YES.... love sitting at the bar watching the action and being the first to check out the food as it comes out. We basically ordered all the food that came out on the cart. Didn't care what it was, we wanted to try everything. I can't even remember the name of any of the dishes we tried but they were all good... will post pictures in a bit... perhaps that would help... let's just say, there was not a thing we did not like...you must be an adventurous person to appreciate State bird. If your idea of dinner is a burger or pizza, skip this place and leave it to the adventurous souls. I would say you can easily spend $100 for 2 people without drinks but hey, it's worth it. Plates on the average is about $8.00 and they are tapa size. okay...this place was amazing.  we ate at 10pm because reservations are hard to come by, but it wasn't a big deal still had a great experience.  they serve american food dim sum style... the food was amazing.  i love that you get to try a bunch of different items.  they walk by and ""sell them"" to you without being pushy or salesy.  my favorite was the hamachi on the seaweed.  amazing!  the menu changes, but would definitely recommend it if you see it on there. It was a memorable dinner at State Bird Provisions.  I went here with my girlfriend and she emphasized it was the last Thursday meal of the year.  So for a Thursday dinner, it was quite fab.  We spontaneously decided to go to State Bird Provisions since it's one of her favorite restaurants and I had heard a lot of great buzz about this place.State Bird Provisions is in the Fillmore area inside a space that is quite cozy and small with an open kitchen in the front.  The food is brought out to you in ""Dim Sum"" style carts.We ordered the following:Ray OystersHamachi-Avocado Seaweed CostiniPig Ear ShoestringsCA State Bird with ProvisionsGrilled Beef SaladLobster, Lentil & Fuyu SaladI thought most of the dishes were excellent.  The Pig Ears were tasty and crispy.  I really enjoyed the Grilled Beef Salad since the beef was a perfect medium, rare with a nice flavor to it and buttery.  The Lobster was another highlight.  I can never get enough Lobster.To top it off, we ended the night with a full stomach and fully satisfied as well as we closed the night out with a shot each of the ""World Peace"" Peanut Muscovado Milk! I feel privileged to be able to write this review as my dining experience at State Bird was one of the most ethereal and euphoric I have yet to experience.  As close to perfection as it gets. Delighted to have shared this meal with two wonderful people that savored every morsel as much as I did.  Dinner here was an amazing way to end 2012. State Bird Provisions reservation is one of the toughest in the City. I booked New Years Eve on the first available day. Try going to their reservation page, and chances are that they're booked for the next 60 days. When you do get a reservation, just go all out when their dim sum like carts starting rolling towards your table. We basically tried everything off the carts because they all looked good. From the menu, the fried state bird and red trout is a must. From the cart, duck liver mousse, pork rillette, garlic bread with burrata, raw oysters, seafood salsa, potatoes with tonnato, variety of raw tuna with chick peas and chips, veal sweet bread meat ball,  and rice pudding. I could go on about SBP, but I won't. You really need to try it for yourself because it's a very different experience. Took my girlfriend here for her birthday on NYE. Definitely make reservations as the wait is easily 1-2 hours, even on a non-holiday night. The staff was very friendly and the food was excellent. We sampled several different items that the staff brought around and everything we tried was great. I wish I had written down what we wrote (which would probably make this review more helpful), but honestly, we didn't try anything we didn't like. I loved the experience I had! I cannot say enough about the staff, they are very accommodating and friendly. The Chef himself is personable and will answer any culinary question you have.  It is a unique atmosphere, the kitchen is in the front of the house.  We sat at the ""Chef's Table"" and watched as our food was prepared.  Everything from the Duck Neck Dumplings, to the Beef Cheek Salad with Bone Marrow was spectacular.  I highly recommend! I was really excited to take my sister to State Bird while she was visiting from New York. We had read all the hype and were intrigued by the dim sum style serving. However, we were completely disappointed. The pancake dishes are excellent. Unfortunately, the night we went they didn't have good pancake options (at least compared to others I talked to who recommended certain ones to us but they were no longer on the menu.) The other dishes are mediocre especially many of the asian inspired dishes. The combination of flavors don't go well together. It's almost as if they are trying too hard to come up with interesting combinations.If you want to eat right when you sit down, you won't have a problem. The food comes out immediately. The drawback of the dim sum style serving is the servers push food on you and almost make you feel guilty if you don't want it. They do a good job trying to sell you on each dish. If you want to have a quiet and relaxing dinner this is not the place to go. You will likely be in and out fairly quickly and it's difficult to have any conversations at the table without being constantly interrupted by the serving carts. The worst part about our experience was our waiter. He was very friendly when we first sat down and throughout our meal but when we asked for the check much earlier than he expected he turned completely cold. We couldn't believe it. Clearly we didn't eat enough food or spend enough money for him and his attitude was shocking. It just left us with a bad taste in our mouth walking out of the restaurant. This restaurant could be a lot better if they had more pancake options. Usually there are three on the menu, and they could easily double it. They are unique and very tasty. A friend had made reservations two months prior. We ordered the quail, seafood with raw veggies, hamaki with avocado, beef tartar. Everything was delicious, but we didn't like the duck liver pate with almond biscuits. The first biscuit was fine, but they became too sweet didn't complement any of the other dishes we had. Had been looking forward to trying this place since devouring their garlic bread knots with burrata at the mission street food fest in August. My expectations were met and then some! We didn't have reservations and got to the line at 5:00, about 12 people deep by then. We missed the first wave of walk ins, but enjoyed cocktails at Yoshi's-who mentioned how they've had more bar customers since SBP opened. :) We were seated at the chef's counter by 7:15 and enjoyed every minute of sitting up close to the action. Everyone, from the owner to the chefs to our waitress and the hostess, was extremely helpful throughout the whole meal. We tried 10 different things before we filled our bellies to the brim, enjoying each one. We especially loved the quail, kimchi pancake, sweetbread meatball and burrata (of course :)). Interesting, but we could have passed on the pork ear strings. In the end, it came to $70 each (went with my bf) including the $20 corkage, 10 items and tip. The bf was just as excited to try each dish as I was and we both can't wait to go back! A really different approach to American cuisine. They have a dim sum style which is really cool if you're the type that wants to taste a little of everything! The food was delicious but I gave them 4 stars because they didn't have much of a variety. I went back and ate at the counter.  Excellent.  Once you do not have the interruption of the cart you can just sit and point to the food coming hot off the stove and there it is right in front of you.Though some dont like sitting at counters, I love it as one gets to see the action up close and this team is fun to watch.The food was as good as it was on the first visit and I must reiterate, there are a lot of hip restos in this city that are hard to get into but in truth, the food is really quite mediocre where as here at SBP, the food is very very good.I will be going back very soon. Over-hyped, but entertaining with regard to the dim sum style service. Be prepared to spend some money if you want to leave with a full stomach. The best tiny dish, hands-down, were the dumplings in broth. One tiny dumpling for $3, but the broth is great. The signature state bird was not very good, in my opinion. Too much breading, the sauce/broth in the bottom of the dish was way too acidic.  I agree with other comments that the staff members are very friendly and efficient.  We spent $100 for two of us, including one glass of wine. I'm glad I went but probably wouldn't bother to go again. I'm not totally sure about what I ate but damn was it tasty. I remember a perfectly fried quail and a tuna and quinoa dish topped with crunchy toasted quinoa, both wowed me.My sis and I settled for the standing dining area as we didn't have reservations. It was actually really cool sitting so close to the action. The lady making the desserts was super fun to talk to and she had us sample the persimmon, kiwi granita, and yogurt dessert for free.This restaurant really pays attention to detail and the service is phenomenal. Attentive and friendly. Having random servers come up to offer different dishes was fun for me. I'm sad I passed up on the sweetbread meatball. I should make a reservation next time and save up because I'm willing to drop many pretty pennies here. It's rare to find a restaurant firing on the cylinders of Food & Service, but St. Bird does it.  I've never encountered a staff so sincerely invested in making the dining experience as satisfying as possible.  We entered sans reservations and were provided with a 'standing table' at the end of the bar that afforded a great view into the machinations of the kitchen.  The staff could not have been more attentive and engaging.  The food was worth every piece of praise its received.  Sweetbread meatballs were amazing, the signature dish was very succulent (fried quail), great pork ribs, and the mushroom dumplings were uniquely flavorful. If you want amazing food and a truly unique experience, friendly service and a chill atmosphere, go here.  It's worth the wait to get a reservation.  Loved it! Food is 4 stars, concept is 5 stars.  The dishes available on my visit were excellent.  The quail was divine.  Love the idea of offering dishes dim sum style, especially when eclectic- viewing helps w/ the selection.  Cool location. i went here with some friends several months ago. we ordered over half the menu and everything was awesome. would definitely go back (if i could ever get in!!! =) ) One of my favorite things about eating out is the variety you can get.  That's why dim sum and tapas are some of my favorite things on the planet.  Walk in, and go to the far end of the bar. This is where you check in. We were seated very promptly.  We started with several items of the passed trays:Matsutake mashed potatoes with goat cheeseChantrelles with butternut squash and farroGuinea hen dumpling with aromatic brothDuck liver mousse with almond biscuitsVinegar glazed smoked potato with tonnatoShrimp, avocado, noriGarlic bread with burattaWe also ordered a couple of items off of the menu.  Smoked sturgeon, horseradish schmear with an everything pancakeState bird with provisionskiwi-moscato granita with persimmons, pomegranate and tapiocapeanut milkNothing was a total miss, which is impressive.  The matsutake mashed potatoes were wonderful, and the guinea hen dumpling was really stellar.  The fried garlic bread with buratta is one of my favorite dishes. So straight forward, and amazing.  I can't currently eat the duck liver mousse, but my husband was sent to some kind of happy place as he ate it.  The shrimp with avocado and fried nori was excellent as well with a great balance of textures and flavors.  The smoked sturgeon was lightly smoked, and the pickled onions on the dish made it really pop.  Of course the signature dish was excellent.  If every fried fowl had this kind of crispness, I would be the fattest person on the planet.  Each dish hit a high point on some element.  The food was tasty, playful, and satisfying without being so filling that you couldn't continue trying other tastes and textures.The biggest pain about the place is getting a reservation.  Check midday to see what has opened up, an note, a late reservation doesn't necessarily mean you'll be there until midnight. We got a 9:30 reservation, and without feeling rushed, I think we were done by 11. This place currently has a HUGE buzz. That's what you get for getting write ups in both Bon Appetit and Food and Wine.  I'll be back, but maybe after the buzz has settled down a touch. What? You have not been and you are just sitting around reading the reviews to make up your mind. Best thing to have happened to  San Francisco in 2012. Followed by those Giants winning...again. The most creative, yummy dinner that you will want for all of your friends to experience! Seems like second time is the charm. I came to SBP a few weeks ago for dinner, without a reservation, but willing to wait. A lot. No luck, all the tables were booked for the rest of the night! Boo hoo.Second and Third times were a lot easier...we waited outside in line for about 30 minutes before they opened their doors, and voila, we got the best seats in the house!SBP offers a completely new style of eating, where all the dishes are presented to you, dim sum style, but with much better explanations. Each person coming around has a sense of pride for the dish they are showing. Dishes range from $2 - $16, and trust me it will add up! I've eaten here twice, and both times have spent more than I'd like, but not regretting anything.Must-haves:Garlic bread with burrata and oregano - a flaky bun of garlic bread with a huge serving of burrata melting on top from the heat of the bread. It's topped with oregano and pepper. It's like crack.Mashed potatoes - a small iron casserole dish containing creamy mashed potatoes topped with matsutake mushrooms and shredded nori. An original combination of flavors that work so well together.CA State Birth with Provisions - buttermilk battered quail, in a sauteed onion sauce. 1/2 order for 2 people (which is what's recommended) will not be enough.Pancakes - their options change regularly so they may not have the same combination of flavors. My favorite was the uni pancake with ginger and a soy lime dressing, topped with micro greens.The kitchen is definitely fast-paced, and you may feel rushed. It's ok to turn down dishes if you're the slow-eater type. They're not rushing you on purpose, I think they lose sight of the fact that we're there to enjoy a meal and not always on the go. My friend and I got into line about 4:30pm but it was worth the wait.  I loved all of the individual dishes and the abundant choices.  The flavors were delicious. My biggest complaint was that they really seemed to push you taking the new dishes as they arrived and I felt like there wasn't any time to talk or relax.  It was a bit like a real ""night market"" in that regard.  So food gets 4 stars but wait and frantic atmosphere lower it to a 3 star restaurant (for now) Hipster dim sum. And hipster (aka pretentious, bitchy, rude) service. Fun concept and some really good dishes. It's great to be able to sit down and almost immediately get food options. But the waitstaff here overall (with the exception of a couple cheery faces) is not pleasant....as if you're doing something wrong for expecting service. Anyway, the ahi tuna tartar with quinoa was good, the CA state bird (quail) was decent, and the fried garlic bread with burrata was amazing. The seafood salsa was okay but not amazing, and the spicy tofu skins were not spicy and kind of a weird texture (totally an opinion thing). We dined over those things plus a couple more for about an hour, and for some reason the servers STILL hadn't come and offered us the remaining 3-4 dishes, so even though we weren't totally full and would have been curious to see what other options there were, we didn't want to wait forever for them to notice and serve us.This place is a cute idea. It has potential to be great. The main missing element is experienced, sophisticated service. Really good food and different experience....long wait Hipster dim sum! One of the funnest and most enjoyable meals I've had in a long time. You get to order some food from an established menu in which they recommend only 2-3 dishes. We thought they were kidding because everything on the menu looked amazing. Thankfully we listened to them. After ordering we were bombarded with tons of amazing looking dishes on carts with price tags ranging from 5-9 dollars. The portions were more than enough for a party of 4 to share per plate and the price was unbelievable cheap (around 50 per person and we had around 15 dishes). The food was delicious. The cornbread with duck liver mousse maybe a loop hole around foie gras but it was GOOD. Try the pig ears! Fat is good!Since it is a dim sum experience, I would recommend going with a party of 4 (max allowed) so you get to try more dishes. I do think the portions are large for a party of 2 which would limit the variety you get. Just went last night after hearing a lot about it. I wouldn't say its the best meal I have had. Unfortunately it didn't look like a crazy night, bad I had to send a dish back and that was the state birds with provisions. Completely rare and under cooked and they had to serve up another one. Sad.Most of the foods were heavy definitely need to drink lots of wine. Dim sum style foods I would have expected to have a little more balance between light foods and heavy foods. Basically tried a couple of salads, like the quinoa salmon (interesting texture), but taste was just ok. This was same with the oyster with some spicey sauce. The fried bread with burrata was good, but the portion was definitely more fit for 4.Steak Tartar was interesting in terms of taste ass it had some papaya in it (?) Definitely had better....Something else was the tofu skin with some tomato based sauce and that was ok. Had the original pancake type thing with some special salt, but it just tasted like fried batter and cheese.For desert had the walnut tart with fresh asian tart... Thought it would be a little lighter in taste but also very heavy. The asian part was a complement to the tart rather than a balance. Overall I think it should be a try, but get 4 people to go. I went with my wife and I think the portions along with the heaviness of the of the food definitely could be just bite sized for 4. For 2 people, it would be a struggle to finish a dish. One of the best total meals I've had in awhile - from the food, the flavors, the format to the service, setting and just overall impact...wow. They definitely deserve the line of people fighting to get in. I had so much fun!They have a small menu of set items that you can order from that aren't passed around the room - a pancake section, some 'mains' including their state bird dish, and a dessert section. The rest of the menu is carried around the room on trays or wheeled through on carts for you to order just like at a Chinese dim sum restaurant. It's so much fun to watch what is coming up next - the element of surprise keeps you intrigued throughout the entire meal. There were so many diff items presented, and I love that they have stands showing the price for each dish too ranging from $2 to $9/dish.  I somehow managed to say no to 4 or 5 dishes even though I wanted to try it all. The pricing is totally reasonable as well! I expected the bill to be so much higher.  Tried a lot for under $60/person all-inclusive incl wine.I won't go into too much detail since there are too many to describe, but from their set menu:Everything pancake with smoked sturgeon and horseradish - the sturgeon was so fresh and delicious. The pancake was a bit big, so we couldn't finish it. Good fresh dish though. I saw the other 2 pancake dishes circulate the room. The first one that is vegetarian is composed of maybe 5 or 6 mini pancakes. The bacon pancake dish had 3 medium-sized pancakes (my neighbor said they were great). Then the sturgeon one had one large pancake. For dessert, the plum jam ice cream sandwich was so good. Bright tart jam, macaron-like sandwich portion, and an 'ice cream' filling with nuts and chocolate drizzled on top. 4 pieces to an order. So good.'dim sum' dishes:Best ones were the guinea hen dumpling (broth tasted like pho), shrimp/nori/avocado, fry bread with burrata, boudin noirThe kimchi pork belly, oyster, & steak tartare were just ok, so fell into the shadow of the other dishes. Didn't get a chance to try the mashers, tuna w/quinoa.Get there by 5:15p if possible and join the line if you don't have a reservation. They will separate out the reservations and seat them and then file everyone else in right away. The place fits about 60 diners, and I think at least 20 of us walk-ins were seated right away. Make sure your entire party is there. The poor girl waiting before us had to leave the line because her dining partner hadn't shown up yet. They couldn't reserve seats for them either. As an SBP regular and patron from the earliest days, I'm gonna throw in my pennies.  I'm not sure what some of these negative yelpers are seeking, but it is obviously not innovation, lack of pretention, eye and tastebud opening flavor combos, general good times and the warmest crew I've encountered in SF.  This place is an explosion of happiness & creativity and provides one of the most enjoyable eating experiences around.  Believe.    I've eaten here going on twenty times and each and every time we're introduced to new and groundbreaking dishes.  Thankfully most of our favorites have also managed to stick around... balancing this kind of innovation with consistency is no small feat.  And did I mention the staff?  For a restaurant in such high demand, they could not collectively be any kinder.  These are good peeps doing what they love, and the result is almost magical.  Every time I leave The Bird I am fat and happy and grateful SBP exists.  For those battling the reservation gods, I'm here to tell you it IS worth it.  Once you arrive, be patient, open your mind and enjoy the exploration! My boyfriend and I had a great dining experience at State Bird Provisions! It took us forever to be able to get a reservation but it was so worth it. Really delicious Californian cuisine - so flavorful and fun. Order a few things off the regular menu and then go for the carts.It wasn't expensive at all - was expecting much worse from the price rating on Yelp.Be sure to try to snag a table near the front - all the best dishes might get grabbed before they reach the back. Really well-done concept with good service and decent food.The space is small and loud, but comfortable.  Three beers on tap span a variety from light to dark to a very nice IPA.  Wine available by the bottle and glass.We were seated remarkably on-time for our reservations.  Street parking was easy to find close by on Webster street.  Walk-ins had a 1.5hr wait at 7pm on a Monday night.Unlike most dimsum places, they have a menu of items you can order from the kitchen that doesn't overlap with the passed items.There's a cart of seafood dishes, but otherwise the servers walk around with trays.Hilights:  Duck liver mouse - almost perfect.  Steak Tartare - very good, though a small portion.  Seafood ""salsa"".  Sea urchin pancake was amazing.  My companion loved the sweetbread meatball.  Beef cheek curry was good.Lolights: Mt. Tam pancake was perhaps a little over-bacony and oily for our taste.  Shrimp avocado nori was not particularly interesting in flavor.  Cumin lamb was an oily stir fry without strong cumin or lamb flavors.  Honey nut tart was a bit heavy on the nut component.Also - you are almost required to get the ""state bird"" - a fried quail.  It's good, but so rich that a half order was enough for the two of us.The place is not cheap - the little dishes add up.  Say $100/person is not unreasonable.Overall - liked the concept, some good food, some duds.  Would go back. Cumin lamb= phenomenal, possibly the best lamb I've had in life. The sourdough sauerkraut pecorino and ricotta pancakes are always delicious. Also the desserts are amazing- especially the plum jam ice cream sandwich and buttermilk maple granita/ tapioca! Sit at the chefs counter- pick and choose as you like! It took about a month to get a reservation, which was a bit annoying. I hadn't heard about the Bon Apetit article yet, so I was baffled. While my meal was tasty, I do think that most of the charm was found in the method of delivery and innovative pairings, but in many ways I can't help but feel like there was something left to be desired in the preparation and seasoning. We got around 10-12 dishes and a couple of glasses of wine each, which I felt was more than a fair sampling of dishes for 2 people. The vegetable preparations were generally a blur, which unfortunately tells me that they weren't quite the standouts that I had hoped for. The corn pancakes with Mt. Tam were delicious, but one must pose the question: can you really lose with Mt. Tam? Nope, never. The ribs with swiss chard alone however, might have been worth the month long wait. Smoky, sweet, delicious they were so beautifully meaty. Also noteworthy was the shrimp and avocado served with nori chips. Sadly, dessert was largely a disappointment. The cheesecake was oddly savory (and not in a good way) and the toasted tapioca was nothing out of the ordinary. The small dishes added up, but when the bill came, I was actually surprised by how reasonable it was, especially since you expect to pay a ton to dine at a place considered to be the ""best in the US""...you know, whatever that means these days. I'm not entirely sure I'd jump through hoops to come back here, but hey, I'm glad that I was able to come here at least once and see what all the hoopla was about and form my own opinion outside of it. Lady and I agreed that this is certainly one of the best eating experiences you can have in the bay area.  Yes, it's a pain to get into.  But sit at the counter, where the action is, and don't come with too many people.  Try to go early, if possible.  Then let the food come to you.  It works kinda like dim sum--there's a menu, but also a whole host of other dishes (about twenty different ones per evening), that come around with the servers on carts and trays.  These are definitely the highlights, and between the two of us, we must've had all twenty, PLUS a couple menu items.  The food itself is clearly Asian-inspired, but mainly just goddamned delicious.  Beer and wine selection is really intriguing, and service is not at all what you'd expect in an uber-hyped San Francisco restaurant.  People are attentive, well-trained, and there's this pervasive atmosphere of cooperation and helpfulness among all the staff that's just a blast to watch.  Very few lowlights among a roster of fantastic, delicious bites that very in size from one forkful to ""really quite a bit.""  The only ones I will certainly avoid next time are the uni pancake (not that it wasn't good, it just wasn't particularly special) and ribs (not particularly good or special).  Both are on the menu, further bolstering the notion that what you REALLY wanna get are the ""cart"" dishes and use the menu solely to supplement.  I'll be back soon, and you should make your reservation (for 3 months ahead, no doubt) ASAP. We ate there the other night for the first time and were looking forward to it after all the great press.   The staff were great - friendly, upbeat and attentive.   The food was good with some wild combinations that actually work for the most part.  However, this is a place to sample lots of different foods,  but not a place to sit and and leisurely enjoy the food and people you are with.   Once everyone is seated,  the progression of food carts start.   At first it's a couple of carts, but then the area gets chaotic with someone asking you every 3-5 minutes if you want to try another small plate (and yes, there are very small - usually a bite or two for two people).  The idea of pushing around carts with different foods is a cute idea, but we've been there and done that - now I want to try a place with great food, where we can actually savor and remember what we ate before our next course comes, and maybe even enjoy our friends without constant interruption. It's definitely worth trying once, and a good place to take someone from out of town for a different experience - especially one with ADHD! Awesome place to dine.  The dishes are fun, rich, and innovative.  I ordered a couple of dishes off the al la carte menu and about 5 dishes off the ""dim sum"" trays. Off the hook dish: uni pancakes!RSVP is difficult to get.  The wait for me was 2 and a half hours.  It was well worth it, though.  I just went up the street to Yoshi's and had a couple of drinks and listened to some jazz.  The restaurant texted me when the table was ready.  Service is impeccable, food is out of this world good,  and overall experience was memorable.  A repeat is in the works to try all the dishes I didn't get to. I would probably give this a 3.5 if I could.  The food was good, but I think my expectations were just way too high.  Bon Appetit named it the best restaurant in America, so I thought I was in for something really extraordinary.  The food was good overall, but definitely not the best I've ever had or even in San Francisco.  People seem to go nuts because it is served dim sum style on carts; come on, Chinese people have been doing this forever.Reservations were booked up for two months, but we showed up at 5pm and were second in line.  We were seated immediately when they opened at 5:30.  Service was fine and the ambiance was casual.  I think I would have given it a higher rating if I didn't buy into all the hype. State Bird Provisions has been named Bon Appetite's 2012 best new restaurant in America, consequently making it the most hyped restaurant in the bay I have seen in long time. You can imagine my excitement when I was finally able to secure a reservation (two months in advance).First and foremost, what a fantastic, well-executed concept. American tapas served dim-sum style off carts and trays. A handful of items can be ordered off the menu, but the rest are only available as they come around and change daily. Reservations are required for a table, and they are hard to get. (available 60 days in advance.) There is counter seating available for walk-ins but expect to wait 2-3 hours for a seat. Food dishes were hit or miss, most ranged from good to great for me with a few misses.Excellent:- Duck liver mousse and almond biscuits- Garlic bread with burrata- Albacore crudo with quinoa- Shrimp, avocado, noriGood:- CA state bird with provisions- Guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth- Glazed pork ribs- Sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino, ricotta pancakePass:- Veal meatballs- Plum jam ice cream sandwich yum yum yum! came here for my birthday dinner and it was darn tasty. i would say we liked the majority of our food. there were a few let downs tho. i like the concept and the waitstaff was incredibly nice. the space is tight and wait is long if you don't have a reservation. we walked in around 7 and were able to get a table around 9:45. guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth- mm.. savory little bite (wish i had gotten 2)duck liver mousse with almond biscuit- biscuit and mousse went together so well, a little salty and a little sweet great texture (we had extra mousse left after we ate all the biscuits and they so kindly brought us more)garlic bread with burrata -- HORRIBLY disappointed in this one. it was too salty to eat. tasted like it was covered in salt crystalssweet corn & garlic chive 'shortstack' with mt. tam- absolutely divine, one of my favorite dishesCA state bird with provisions- solidly tasty, loved that it was mostly deboned buttery dungeness crab with farro ""spezzato""- the other bleh thing we had so fishy tasting. needless to say we didn't finish it at the restaurant ( I later made crab benedict with it and the burrata)chocolate-gingersnap pudding, coconut pecan crunch- super gingery not a big fan of this dish either. it was ok Wish it was easier to get a reservation here :) Just had desserts and I cannot wait till I get to try the real deal. even the desserts were spectacular! Great small plates. Good concept. Good food. Bingo! Holy moley. EVERYTHING was sooo good! Low key, casual service and the food- OMG. The garlic bread thingy with burrata, the fried quail, tuna w/ quinoa- uuuummmm. Dying over how good this place is- book it 60 days from now if at all possible- I think it's nice to have something to look forward to. I fought long and hard with the rest of the Bay Area's diners to secure a reservation at State Bird, a task that became immeasurably more difficult after Bon Appetit and countless other magazines, blogs, and newspapers dubbed it the hottest thing in SF aside from the ban on public nudity. Finally, though, I got a reservation, albeit at a super early (5:30) time.No other restaurant has been this hyped in the Bay since maybe Mission Chinese, but I can say that it mostly met my expectations. The food, concept, service, and decor all range from good to excellent, but there were still a few moments that just barely kept this from being a 5 star restaurant for me.Here's the rundown:- Sweet corn pancakes with garlic chives and Mt. Tam triple cream cheese: this was the first thing we tasted, and it was one of the most spectacular dishes of the night. It was so good, in fact, it set an impossible standard for the rest of the dishes that followed. But the sweetness of that corn, the light touch of the cheese...oh my.- Quail: I had to try the namesake dish of the restaurant. I think this was battered with panko, and there was a nice citrus sauce that went with it (yuzu, I'm pretty sure) - cooked really well. I love quail (it's one of my favorite things to eat when done correctly) and this was spot-on.- Cauliflower viennoise, beets, horseradish-ale cream: Easily the single best dish of the night, aside from the corn pancakes. My wife is the pickiest eater on the planet and she loved this dish. The complexity of flavors on display here was impressive, with the earthy cauliflower, sweet beets, acidic and creamy horseradish, bitter arugula. Well done.- Farro with pickled vegetables, topped with a mixture of seeds and nuts and a yogurt sauce: also really good, and a very complex flavor profile. I love pickled anything (comes from the Korean and Polish heritage), so this dish was a winner for me. - Pork belly, kimchi, tofu: Because State Bird's dim-sum style approach to smaller plates, it's hard to get everything you want - this dish kept running out before it got to us, so we had to ask our server for one. It didn't disappoint, though the belly was a bit too dry on some pieces and the dish could've used more kimchi liquid. I'm sure this was inspired by the buta kimuchee dishes you find at izakayas and was a good representation of that dish.- Oyster with kohlrabi and chili: Not as great as I wanted it to be, though the contrast in texture between the kohlrabi and the oyster flesh was fun.- Huckleberry beets with yogurt: A great dish - almost could've been a dessert.- Pork pate with rosemary chips: The pate was really, really good and flavorful, though the chips were too flaky to support the thick pate.- Burrata on garlic fry bread: one of those dishes that's awesome for the first few bites and gets less appealing as it sits. The fry bread got too hard after a few minutes, but the burrata was sublime.- Guinea hen dumpling: I loves me some guinea hen, but the flavor of it was a bit lost due to the intensity of the mushroom and yuzu broth. Skin was a bit too thick for my tastes, too.- Tuna crudo with quinoa: A fun dish - like the oyster dish, there was a texture balance here that was really fun, and the sauce was great, too.The biggest letdown for us was the dessert, which was the cheesecake japonaise with huckleberries. I must confess my palate was letting me down in this case. My wife is Japanese and we normally love Japanese style cheesecakes, but there was something off about this one - I tasted curry powder, though I'm sure that wasn't in there. The texture also just didn't agree with us - it was too dense compared to how fluffy and light Japanese style cheesecake usually tastes. The other dessert choices looked really good, and we regret not choosing something else. aaaahhh State Bird Provisions. in every sense of the word, it's awesome! from the concept and the ambiance to the food itself, it's a fantastic experience. this restaurant is quintessentially ""Californian"" in that the dishes are conceptualized based on seasonal ingredients, fusion cuisine, and interesting combinations of flavors, tastes and textures that aren't always standard. i mean, Bon Apetit named it the #1 new restaurant in America so they've got to be doing something right.over a year ago, during one of my frequent walks through the Western Addition in SF i noticed that a restaurant was taking shape on Fillmore St. i had no idea what it was but became quickly intrigued when i saw that they were a ""cart and tray service restaurant."" what does this mean? it means small plates served in a manner like dim sum is traditionally served. people walk around with carts or trays carrying the various dishes for the night and you decide on the spot whether  you want it or not. often times you read a description of a dish on a menu and it doesn't sound appealing. but when the dishes are presented to you in this manner, you immediately ignite the visual sensory as well as the smell sensory. then they describe the dish and you can't help but want every dish that passes by, though ordering every dish is pretty impossible because nobody could ingest twenty or so dishes in one sitting. fortunately i have an incredibly large appetite and was able to sample a lot. of what i had the garlic bread with burrata, the almond biscuits with duck liver mousse (helloooo foie!) and the sweet corn pancakes with Mt. Tam cheese were the absolute winners, though everything we had was very good. i LOVE state bird. someone take me again! Generally speaking, I'm a fan, and I like the concept, hence a generous 4*, but the dishes were uneven. A few of them are really good, like the state bird provision itself. Others not so much, though overall, pretty good.  Really liked 3 of the 9 we had, and the 10th, dessert was very good too. I would certainly recommend going with 4 people to be able to eat more of the dishes. Got too full too fast with only 2. It's easy to end up with the ""eyes bigger than the stomach"" syndrome as the dishes are brought by. Space can get pretty loud; service is friendly. I admit that my expectations may have been too high. I REALLY wanted to like this spot. I had heard really great things about this spot from an acquaintance who worked at Saison and F+W plus a few people had mentioned the great reviews. I really tried to get there at 5:30 but ended up in traffic for an hour and half due to some stupid protest in Union Square and a couple accidents on the bridge. I was pretty famished by the time I got there. I really liked the concept and thought the service was perfect but the atmosphere and the food.... frankly, the both left much to be desired. There is a little bar space where two people can stand up eating right by the front door. I was immediately super irritated by the idea but I was so hungry that I agreed to eat standing up by the door which of course opened a million times leaving me freezing. There is a section of the menu served dim sum style on carts and a section that is by order. I like this idea a lot. At least for me, the service was absolutely perfect. Everyone was super friendly, quick and on top of things without being stuffy or overbearing in the slightest which is a big plus for me. The only shitty thing was I didn't end up being offered all the dim sum options and since there wasn't a list that I could see, I wasn't able to ask after the ones I wanted to try (like the oysters or the duck liver mousse or spicy tofu skin).The food was such a bummer. Maybe I just went here on an off night?Here is what I had:+huckleberry beets with goat yogurt. One of the better dishes and also something I have had a million times often much better at many different spots.-sweet corn, garlic chive and mt tam pancakes... I don't know what happened... how could I not like something where all the ingredients are things I hold so dear? I just wasn't into this... a little too soggy and had a weird bitter taste+sea urchin pancake with ginger scallion and lime-soy. This was great. It was the only thing I genuinely enjoyed. I will probably go back just to eat this.-steak tartare with grilled broccoli and shishito. I love steak tartare usually...  I only ate one bite of this-guinea hen dumpling... super boring. -shrimp, avocado and nori... again, all things I love... it was just bland and not very inspired.-marinated yuba 'noodles'- this was probably my least favorite. -quail with lemon onion provisions... I am so sad to say this was disappointing. I was most looking forward to this dish as I love quail. I felt that it was too heavily breaded and somehow in the cooking it really lost that sweet gaminess that I love about quail until it just tasted like badly friend chicken. greasy and oily not in a good way. The lemon preserves were decent but made the bottom of the quail soggy.I wish I had tried the pork belly or the garlic bread with burrata. They looked good but I was stuffed.I had the Japonais cheesecake for dessert (again 1 bite and I didn't want anymore....) then the strawberry granita with honey and tapioca.... I thought I would LOVE this and it was ok... it was my second favorite of the night. I didn't like the decor and it was a bout a million decibels in there but I don't think the atmosphere matters that much, it should be about the service and the food. As I said, the service was great and it makes me feel all the more worse that I was so disappointed by the food. Maybe I will try this place again, but I it will be with a hesitant tongue. A few other people told me they had a similar experience. I hope it was just an off night and not that they really are super missing on the flavor profiles. there was just something off and weird or bland about everything for me. :( I didn't even like the iced tea or almond horchata that much. With tip my bill was $125. I have no problem dropping a bill or three on a good meal but for such a disappointment I felt really ripped off. Super excited to super bummed. Boo. Buratta on Fried Bread? Mollusk Ceviche? Sesame pancakes with anchovies? Halibut Crudo? Korean pork belly and tofu? Yes please. The dim sum was eclectic and perfect in my opinion. I enjoyed the several different wines we had and was glad to get the tip that if you have an early reservation (which is nearly the only one you can get these days) be prepared to wait in a line outside since there's no where to stand inside. After their Gourmet magazine write up I understand all the fuss over the food but where they are lacking was on the aesthetics. The cute DIY vibe inside would bode better in a boutique rather than a highly revered restaurant in my opinion. Regardless, I will certainly come back. Was very much looking forward to trying this place out.  They received a lot of good press in the past year and if you combine that with their unique 'dim-sum' type of dining I was very intrigued.The place has the atmosphere of a shoebox combined with a kindergarten classroom.  Cheap pressed boards with holes (like in a garage for hanging tools) cover the walls and ceilings, and the one wall that IS exposed is concrete.  I think this has something to do with trying to tamp down the acoustics that make this place almost unbearably loud.  I like loud.  I enjoy the energy and hum of a place that is packed on a Saturday night.  But keep my loud at something less than a lawnmower decibel level.  The lighting is without note.  I think it's flourescent covered by a bland fixture.  Not great lighting here.  The art here is almost non-existent.  Visually the place is very UN-stimulating.The service was good, but not great.  Pet peeve....if you are going to address a table take the time to stop and do it properly; don't do it in a huff as you walk by without stopping or making eye contact.  It's an extra 2 seconds and makes a big difference.  Outside of the small things that make big differences we found the staff to be knowledgable, friendly and accomodating.  But not up to the standards of a restaurant getting national press.  Sorry, but you have to be ON YOUR GAME from a to z.  The food was quite good.  But all small.  I think the small plate offerings hit a point of diminishing returns when you get too small.  And I think State Bird has gotten them too small.  Each plate is like a tea cup saucer.  Which really only allows one bite each for two.  This is just too little to be satisfying.  And their namesake 'State Bird' is a quail that is so thickly breaded you can barely tell that there is supposed to be a slightly gamey wild bird underneath.  Tasted like chicken.  The saving grace is the onion/lemon/rosemary sauce underneath which could quite possibly be the best condiment I've ever had.All else is good.  Some awkward combinations afoot:  Steak Tartare with hot peppers?  Not a good idea.  Pork Belly with Tofu?  C'mon.  I'm now craving a decent serving of a simple meal. We made the reservation WAY in advance so we had a 6 o'clock reservation on a Saturday. Friends couldn't make it so it ended up being just me and Jovanie. They sat us promptly and the restaurant was already packed. Theres a little counter to your right as you walk in which people can stand and eat.Seriously. And they do. We tried ordering a bunch of things but our waitress cautioned us saying that we were ordering a lot of food and there were going to be trays coming around with food not on the menu(She was right). So we ended up with all three of their savory pancakes (uni, sweet corn, and sourdough sauerkraut). The sweet corn had melted brie on the top and it made my toes curl.OHHHHHHHHH it was so good. Jovanie loved his uni pancakes as well. We tried some faro which was good. The state bird,which is fried quail, was very moist , and tasted good but I'm not a fan of fried things so it wasn't my favorite thing.However,if you like fried foods, then you will LOVE it. They don't have hard alcohol so we stuck with a drakes beer ,which is always good and then some kind of ale from a outfit called Pretty Things.It was good, but i'd stick with drakes if i had a chance to order a third round. We also got to try the garlic bread with burrata which everyone raves about but though it looks like heaven, i wasn't a big fan.I think mostly, because i was so looking forward to it.It was alright but as other Yelpers have pointed out,it is greazzzzzzy. The waitstaff has got to be one of the hardest working staffs i have ever seen in my life. They are not only waiting on their tables, but they are also wandering the room with trays of other food not on the menu and they describe to each and EVERY table. Now thats commitment. For dessert , we had the pudding and the plum ice cream sandwich. The pudding is not sweet. WARNING. You will expect sweetness when you see it on the menu.You will expect sweetness when you see it placed in front of you. You will expect sweetness when you put it in your mouth. NO SWEETNESS. The off menu items were heavy on the seafood side. This place is not for the faint of heart. They really elevate all the ingredients and challenge the diners with the combinations. Even though I'm not that adventurous when it comes to dining,I really enjoyed the experience and will go back. Thank you, SBP!PS When we left there were people lined up all along the wall like a gulag of human bodies waiting for a table to open up.Be prepared. We had so much fun that it didn't matter that our reservations were at 10:30. We bought a bottle of wine, stayed til midnight and ate everything that came along. I was so so so full when I left but was happy to have tried so many amazing little plates of things I already like to eat served in styles that were new and fun!We had oysters that were well shucked, ceviche that hit all the right notes, beef curry that made me want to sing, pork belly (really - that too was friggin amazing), some trout in brown butter NOM, and the state bird provs which was oh so delicious, There was a pretzel thing with burrata that we could have gone without but that was the only regret... We were handed a shot of the peanut milk for dessert. A perfect end to such a tour de force!! I attended a conference in SF, and one of my friends mentioned State Bird Provisions.  So clever-dim sum type carts as well as a standard menu.  I was going in Oct, called for reservations with first available in Nov, so I decided to take a chance and see if I could walk in and get a seat at the counter.I ended up walking from Bloomindales on Market to the restaurant, as I was rusty on my cab catching skills.  As I walked into the restaurant, my heart sank as it was packed, and there were even two patrons eating dinner standing at a small counter near the entrance.Fortunately, the kind waitress took pity on me and let me know there was a table available.  The space is cozy, filled with energy and anticipation.  The couple next to me was out to dinner for the first time since having a baby and they were thrilled to be here.I started with the oyster.  This was my 27th oyster of this trip, so I probably have not met an oyster I did not like.  The deviled egg was elevated by the addition of the cured salmon.  The seafood pork belly pancake with the soy lime glaze was a bit dry.  I would probably order the corn pancake next time.  Red trout with mandarin and hazelnut-garum butter was perfection.  Seared skin, tender meat with the citrus adding a bright note to a comforting dish.  My introduction to yuba was a revelation.  Yuba tagliatelle with matsutake and nori was light and refreshing.I only wish I hadn't been so full to order more of the tempting dishes as they circled the dining room.  Definitely worth the walk. State Bird Provision pretty much had me at the name of the restaurant, I'm a sucker for interesting monickers. They totally had me at the concept. Moderately strange American tapas dishes served off dim sum carts. Why had no one ever thought of this before? It's almost genius. Being named Bon Appetit magazine's Best New Restaurant of the year made me determined to try it. One problem, they're booked solid for months these days.We walked in on our first night in town blissfully unaware of this, four adults and one gregarious three year old. The hostess was exceptionally sweet and understanding that we'd made a long trip and though they couldn't accommodate us on that particular evening, she kindly booked one of the walk-in tables for us a week later. By the time we returned, we had eaten in some of the Bay areas finest restaurants and I wondered how this trendy newcomer would compare. Not to worry: the food is fun, inventive, tasty and eclectic. It's also reasonably priced, so it's possible to try many dishes. We nibbled (ok, we don't ever nibble) our way through a large part of the menu, not sure there will be room to discuss them all and the offerings change quite often so it would be useless, but I'll hit the high points.Most of the smaller plates come out on trays or carts, and you can choose which ones you'd like to sample. While the plating isn't always the most artful, it doesn't diminish from the illustrious flavors at all. If the kitchen doesn't have quite the craft of the Michelin star restaurants, it makes up for a lot with ingenuity. There wasn't a bummer in the bunch, except for two too bland desserts at the tail end. Not to worry, the two good desserts were so good I still can't stop thinking about them Especially the ridiculously addictive ice cream sandwiches. The wonderful:Oysters on the Half shellHaas avocado with Seafood salsaAlbacore crudo and quinoaHuckleberry marinated beets with goat yogurtSweet corn pancakeDouble chocolate pudding and spiced pearPlum jam ice cream sandwich The very good:Steak tartare with shishitosKing salmon deviled egg saladFried green tomatoes with tartar sauceCA state bird with provisionsRed trout in brown butterThe disappointing:Cheesecake japonaiseStrawberry granita and tapioca The restaurant is alive and full of happy, joyful people. That's always a good sign. Even on a rain drenched night like ours, it felt like a warm inviting house party. Service was sweet and attentive, top to bottom.I wish I lived near State Bird, it would be a regular stop. It feels as though there will always be new and interesting tastes to explore here. It's also easy to tell the kitchen loves what they're doing, that they're having fun twisting expectations. Anytime you bend convention, you'll have some missteps along the way. It comes with the adventure, and while there weren't any on our visit I'm sure they do arise on occasion. As with all forward thinking experiences, it won't satisfy everyone but then what does?I'm really enamored of State Bird, it was everything I hoped for and quite a bit more. A superb way to end a marvelously delectable vacation.Best Plates: Oysters, Seafood Salsa, Albacore Crudo, Huckleberry Beets, Sweet Corn Pancakes, Steak Tartare, Salmon Deviled Egg Salad, CA State Bird, Red Trout, Double Chocolate Pudding, Plum Jam Ice Cream Sandwich Palate: eclecticFood - AAmbience - AService - AValue - A I love the concept. It's not dim sum but its served like dim sum. Gourmet carts going around. If you can't say no, this is a horrible place to be. My hubby had to reel me in [cuz I can't say no]. Space: horrible if you don't have reservations, which I didn't. The bar area, where the walk-ins have to sit is tight. I worried about how the cart will squeeze in. It did manage to get through though. :) I got a good spot where all the food came out. You are the first to be asked, would you like to try this. Pretty soon, my hubby decided it was a bad spot. Onto food. State bird was excellent! Love the tart onions with the crispy quail. Garlic bread with burrata - They fry the garlic bread then add the burrata. Heavenly!ribs - bland bland bland! Let me get to the point. The asian inspired dishes were almost all a complete miss. If I went back, I would skip all the Asian dishes and stick to the ""American"" dishes. So don't get the kimchi dish, or the ribs with togarashi, or the Asian-like pancake. Everything else is excellent. :) Overall, love the concept, about half the food and wished the space was bigger. If you're afraid of food do not eat here.  I understand people have food allergies, don't eat certain things for different reasons, or are just absent minded when it relates to food as entertainment and pleasure and see it just as an energy source.   That said, the meal I had last night was perfect.  I didn't take any pictures, I'm not diving into the details of the food I ate.  If you like small plates, enjoy sharing, expect reliable and attentive service while dining, and are not afraid of food, this is the place to go.I've heard  about the wait, that it is hard to get a reservation and some have even said it was over hyped.  People...  This is what food is about.  Young people sourcing good product and using their knowledge and skills to serve said product efficiently and tastefully.It's worth the hype, it's worth the wait, it's worth the cost. ah state bird provisions.  first off id like to say that when a restaurant gets this much hype (best new restaurant in america, 2 month ahead reservations) the expectations skyrocket.  with great reputation comes great responsibilityof course we made the reservations online about two months in advance.  our slot was at 7:30.  previously i had actually gotten some reservations but they were at 10:30.  who the heck eats at 10:30? they were super accommodating when we called ahead to arrange a table that could take a baby carrier as well.  their largest tables are 4. we sit down at a table in the far back and our table is freezing!  so cold i had to put on my jacket at the end.  not sure if it was cuz the vents were right above us?  the decor was cute.  i loved it.  just mismatched things here in there. string and pegboard walls.  colorful abstract veggie cutouts.  exposed beams, concrete walls.when we walked in the kitchen is right there and everyone greets you.  kind of nice and welcoming.  service is ok.  i think most of the people who are bringing the food around are in a rush or something.  sometimes when they brought stuff around. i felt really rushed to make a decision.i have to agree that the concept is novel for american food and that is the main draw here.  there are drawbacks to carting around the food.  there is a reason why most dim sum restaurants in hong kong dont offer the carts anymore:  space.  there isnt enought space.  and such is the case here.  when we walked in we waited by the door for a while because there was a cart being wheeled in the narrow entrance corridor/bar.  another thing is that when dim sum is getting wheeled around, those carts have steamers/heaters in them. not here.  so most of the food that we got off the cart was not hot.  on cold days, i want hot food.ok onto the food.  in general i thought dishes were inventive but the taste was not stellar.  from the menu we ordered (of course) the state bird/fried quail, uni pancake, and also the trout. i have to admit ive never been a fan of quail but this was decent.  it was piping hot, brined?, breaded, and deep fried.  the meat was tasty and moist.  crunchy and soft textures.to save space here ill just list out what we got off the carts/trays and comment: duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - liver was mild, biscuit was sweetsherry glazed smoked potato with tonnato - good! smoked fish spreadshrimp, avocado, nori - nori was deep fried until crispy.  all else was kind of ... blahgarlic bread with burrata - deep fried bread.  love burratasteak tartare with grilled broccoli & shishito  - flavors of veggies were better than the tartarekimchi-pork belly with tofu - sour?  not a fancheesecake japonaise, huckleberries, candy cap - def japanese influences.  deliciousplum jam 'ice cream' sandwich, chocolate & fennel - also delicious.  mix of textures.i have to admit the flavors are not harmonious.  sometimes they dont go together.  sometimes they seem off.  maybe as the restaurant evolves, this will improve.  not sure. State Bird Provisions is a tiny restaurant in the Filmore. Ever since it won Bon Apetit's best new restaurant in America, it takes three months to get reservations here. Quite crazy!The way things work at this restaurant is there's a fixed menu and a rotating menu. You can order things off the fixed menu which has about eight or so dishes. Then the rotating menu is the things on the ""dim sum"" cart that goes around the restaurant. The waitress will tell you what the dish is and how much it costs. All food ordered is marked on the medium dim sum style. == Food ==The food here is a hit or miss. There are amazing ones, good, mediocre, and meh.The tout was really amazing. Totally fresh and really tasty. I don't usually like cooked fish, but this one was so good. The oyster on a half shell was good. Fresh and tasty also. One slurp and it's all gone.Steak tartare was good. It's rare beef. My first time having it. Quite different so I can't say much about this except it was pretty good.Ahi Poki was good. The tuna was really fresh. It tasted like tuna? Can't really say much on this.Garlic bread with burrata is amazing. If you love cheese, garlic, and bread, this is the dish for you. The gooey cheese is nicely melted in the middle of the spiral garlic bread. The bread is oily with possibly garlic oil and it has a great garlic taste to it.Ciccioli with rosemary buttermilk cracker was mediocre. It felt like cracker and white tuna.The state bird provision was really mediocre. I don't see what's the hype about this dish about. It's a panko breaded quail and tastes like one. The lamb dish from the fixed menu is really meh. Strips of lamb with some greens. There wasn't anything special about this.== Service ==Service is good here. The waitress really know her food and can recommend some good things. == Overall ==Really hard to get a reservation here. Then just like how dim sum restaurants are, things can really add up in the end. There's some really good things here and some really meh things. Be sure to do some review reading to maximize your experience. There's definitely some really tasty dishes here. Original and fun menu. Nice to see food choices before having to select. Enthusiastic and attentive service. Most but not all dishes were very good. Desserts were also very good. Certainly would go back. While waiting for our table, someone who just finished her meal passed us and gleefully/facetiously said ""you guys are gonna HATE EVERYTHING!""3 well known things about SBP:- Bon Appetite's 2012 best new restaurant in America and James Beard Nominee- Self-described ""dimsum"" style small plates - pick off of trays and carts that go around, with a few select items off of a menu- Hard to get reservations - but possible to get squeezed in the same week, just callSERVICESolid, very nice staffDECORKind of random and looks like could have been thrown together in a short time, watch the open kitchen if you sit at the bar.FOOD: Touches of Asian influence in most dishes...Great: Almond cake & duck liver mousse, Plum jam ice cream sandwich, Earl Gray Ice Cream SandwichVery good: State bird, Sweet corn garlic chive short stack, Sturgeon and Pancake, Ricotta DumplingsGood: Tuna crudo with quinoa, Avocado/shrimp & nori chips, Tuna & potato chips, Almond horchata, Peanut milk shot, Strawberry granita & quince tapiocaOK: Fried eggplant & greeen tomato, Guinea hen shitake dumplings, sweetbread poplette, Garlic bread burrata (greasy), Eggplant w/ rumesco, Pork BellyBad: Mushroom & eggplant puree, Yuba noodles & pesto, Trout hazelnut butter (unbelievably salty), Pork Ribs (massively overcooked)DAMAGE:Incl t&t =$65-80/person Overall 6-7 plates/person will get your pretty stuffed.

The decor is awful - the place is really loud. The food was good but  it didn't knock my socks off.  The assortment was fine. We had dessert then decided we wanted more food but they kept walking by and wouldn't stop.. what gives.. LOL I like to eat. Anyway, sure I recommend it since it's the new hip place but, make sure you have low expectations. I really don't know what all the hype is about.  My sister convinced me to be nice and not factor in the hype when rating SBP, thus the 3 stars.  I'd say it's more like a 2.5.I made reservations 2 months ago to get into this place, since it seems impossible to do so any other way.  My brother, sister, and I had a nice sibling dinner at 9pm on a Saturday.  Let me start by saying this: the food is good, not great.  Generally tastes pretty good but nothing really stood out (ie. mind = not blown).  The nori chips that we got off the cart (with shrimp/avocado) and the fried qual were the only things that are really worth talking about.  The meatballs with some sweetbreads was pretty good too.  As for creativity in food, pork belly w/ kimchi, fry bread with burrata, and porcini muchroom spread on flatbread aren't exactly ground breaking foods.  Call me a food snob, but I wasn't really wowed by these dishes.  They tasted good, but weren't amazing, and the pork belly was slightly overcooked (how that even happens I'm not even sure).What really bothered me about SBP was the whole concept of this ""dim sum"" style dining.  The wait for this place on a given evening is so damn long because diners are sitting around waiting for the next dish to come out.  When the servers tell you there are about 12-15 dishes offered via cart or tray each evening, you'll likely want to hang around to see what all of those dishes are.  We were there nearly 2 hours and probably saw 8 or so of those dishes.  The cart only carries about 3-4 dishes, meaning you're waiting for ~10 additional dishes to come rotating out via tray.  Problem is, they rotate a tray dish probably every 15 minutes or so, so you're literally waiting the entire time, nibbling on a tiny plate of food, then waiting again.  Unless you're ordering a bunch of food off the printed menu, you're going to be sitting at your table with maybe 1 or 2 plates at a time.  People want to know what all the dishes are, so they will wait, and that means, my friend, you will wait outside until I am done.Basically, I think the entire operation is completely inefficient and given that most of the food is just average, I'm generally surprised at all the hype this place has been getting. One of my favorite dining experiences I've had in SF. Went here a couple of months ago and loved it so much that I promptly went home and made reservations for tonight! Here are some details about our first experience: In September, my boyfriend and I walked in with no reservations at around 6:45pm and were told it would be about a 2 hour wait. We went up the block to Dosa for cocktails (good drinks btw), and received a call around 8:15pm. What we ended up being offered was the standing room-only ledge by the door. It ended up being a great experience. We were able to watch the chefs prepare each dish and got first dibs of everything. Everyone was friendly and attentive. The food was so flavorful and creative. I loved the small plates/ dim sum concept because it makes you try things that you wouldn't necessarily order. Some highlights for me were the duck liver mousse with almond biscuits, the guinea hen dumplings, and ""statebird.""The two of us ended up getting about 8 dishes and we were absolutely stuffed. Can't wait to try one of the savory pancakes tonight and some of the new seasonal dishes. I will definitely report back! AMAZING!  Genius!  I love everything about this place.  The food, the unpretentious feeling and ""no rules"" attitude.  My husband came in at 6 pm and put our name on the list and we got a 8:30 pm seating.  We arrived at 7:30 and grabbed wine/cheese at Fat Angel around the block. We were sat at the end of the bar which normally would feel like a bad seat but have to admit I was so happy we sat there.  We chatted it up with the chefs and owner and learned so much more then if we were at a table. We tried a lot of things but the highlights for me were.- fried quail (1/2 portion)- sweet corn and mt. tam pancakes- albacore crudo & quinoa with bonito-rosemary aioli- garlic bread with burrata- steak tartare with poblano & sunchokeMy mouth is drooling thinking about those right now.  The owner is a true artist and even makes some of the plates that the dishes were served on.  I can't wait to come back! The only thing that saved this from a ""one"" star rating was the staff: friendly, committed and apologetic about the rather dismal experience we (four) had at this place.Let's start with the wait.  We got there at 8:20 for an 8:30 reservation on a Wednesday night - and weren't seated until 9:10.  Now, I realize that it's somewhat unfair to hold the restaurant accountable for the bad manners of patrons but isn't it the job of the front of the house to make judgments about turnover and be realistic when confirming reservations?  Anyway, it set the tone for the evening.Among the four of us we tried a fairly wide range of dishes and the consensus among us was that, in almost every case, There was either one ingredient too many or an unnecessary complication that robbed the dishes of what could (and should) have been clean, fresh and enjoyable flavors.  Instead, almost every dish was muddy, confused and/or uninteresting.  A perfect example was the fried green tomatoes with chipotle aioli: the breading had absorbed a touch too much oil, leaving the dish tasting more of grease than of fruit, and the aioli was bland (!!) - we all agreed the dish was, essentially, tasteless.  Everyone enjoyed the corn pancakes and the dumplings but with every successive dish the execution was less and less successful: the lamb with cumin was greasy and undersalted; the quail (their signature dish) was overly breaded, underseasoned and, resting on a bed of lemony wilted onions, didn't make any sense; and the steak tartare alternated between too much spice and no spice at all - weird.As I said, the servers were uniformly enthusiastic and the only knock I have to deliver is the odd progression of the dishes: you are met with a flurry of dim sum/tapas-like small plates, of varying degrees of interest, and then the ordered dishes start coming - and then, for no good reason they stopped and we wound up waiting for our very last dish for an inexplicable 10-15 minutes.By the time we finished dining it was almost 10:30.  We waived away desert and heading for the door as quickly as possible.  None of us will go back.If you consider this place, go as a two-some - for larger parties, timely seating is a pretty dicey proposition.  Overall, we were definitely not impressed. Yes, we waited 2 months for our reservations, but... It was well worth the wait. This place is great! Very laid back and not stuffy at all. Everyone working there acts as your server. Everyone knows the dishes inside and out. The woman who sat us, Candace was a total sweetheart. Since it was our first time in she was sure to bring us whatever the ""must-have"" dishes were. And boy was she right! Jason was our actual server and he was very on top of his game. Super nice and again, very informative about the food and portion sizes. We brought along our own bottle of wine and they were perfectly okay with that ($20 corkage). We of course tried their famous dish, state birth with provisions. We had the half size, which was great for sharing between the 2 of us. Perfectly cooked with a balanced citrus sauce and shaved parmesan; the meat fell off the bone so easily.Another one of my favorites was a burrata dish with a puff pastry and shaved parmesan and cracked pepper. So simple, yet so delicious. And they are not shy with the burrata! We also had a lamb sweetbread dish with a fig and cherry chutney. A small dish as there was only two balls, but so good! The flavors are strong and can really stand on their own in the dish. We also had a pork and tofu kimchi, which was amazing. They make all their kimchi in house. I wish I could remember all the dishes we had, I'll add them as I remember. Plus pictures to come! I have a massive crush on this restaurant. Like a 12 year old in love, I sit and daydream about State Bird Provisions.  I even doodle Rebecca + State Bird = True Love Forever all over my Trapper Keeper notebook.  Everything I have had here has been delicious... from the raviolis (I actually made a special request for these on my second visit) to the Buratta to the beet salad dish. Dishes come around on carts like dim sum and you can either take the dish or pass on it. Great for trying lots of things.  Ask the servers what you absolutely must try and then take their recommendations seriously. They definitely won't steer you wrong. I can't wait until I go see my crush again. You'll find me there all dolled up and eating as much food as I can handle. AMAYYYYZING. Thanks to everyone from the hostess to Megan and Chef, my friends and I had a night of good food and drink. Started off with a Drake's pale ale, I love me a smooth, crisp ale, while waiting for our table, which was miraculously made a few weeks ago. Rumor has it there is at least a month or two wait for a table.The most memorable dishes were the pork belly with kimchi - the pork was soft and chewy, altho the kimchi could have had a bit more spicy bite, the cheese burratta, which was like a crispy, cheesy pastry with a hint of rosemary flavor, and the nori chips with avocado and shrimp. Surprisingly, though the plate sizes were small (think of ban chan bowls served at Korean restaurants) after 5-6 dishes everyone was sufficiently full. To top it off, we ordered the strawberry granata with quince and tapioca (not the tapioca in milk tea kind). WOW! The granata had a iced gelatto texture and paired well with the tapioca and quince.The bill was not bad either. I told Megan I will be back for the cheesecake though, I had to hold back!! Irrefutably hip and impossibly hyped, State Bird is an experience worth having, even if it does take calm perseverance to wait out the long lines or play the often-frustrating reservation roulette on their web site.  I chose the latter, and squeezed in after about four months wait.Squeezing is the first thing you do at the Bird - the passageway between the front door and dining room forces you to forge a narrow path through the teeming bar, cramped with festive folks getting the prize of quick counter service.  The dining room itself is an homage to industrial chic, with its concrete walls, warehouse floor, and black-and-white photographs.  The food literally comes at you from all sides, almost sensory overload, but oh-so-incredible.  You have a plethora of food choices, between the printed menu and the beautifully presented small plates that dart past, around and over you on trays and carts commanded by knowledgeable, personable servers.  Our favorite item was on the menu, a short stack of sweet corn and garlic chive pancakes topped with transcendent Mt. Tam cheese, a moist, rich, sweet and salty phenomenon...and gone so soon.  The other menu item we indulged in was the rice-crusted red trout with mandarin oranges, hazelnuts, and garum brown butter.  The flavor explosion defied categorization and defined eclectic, and we loved it.  The dim sum style cart and tray service yielded two superstars.  First, a perfect marriage of grilled shrimp and avocado, with a dousing of black garlic aioli and the ideal, heavenly accompaniment of crispy nori chips.   Second, a warm garlic fried bread (the forced sophistication of your favorite carnival fried dough) topped liberally with coarsely ground peppercorns (roasted to sweetness) and other mystically unidentifiable spices and then covered with a creamy, gooey burrata.  Need I say more?  Need I HAVE more?The answer, fortunately, was yes.  Dessert featured a brand new entry to their delectable roster, a chocolate-gingersnap pudding with toasted coconut-chocolate-almond crunch and topped with a roasted and caramelized sliver of delicata squash.  Words fail me in describing it further:  it's as good as it sounds.  Alongside, we tried the ""World Peace,"" a small shot glass of peanut muscavado milk which should be the new norm for palate cleansing.  It was also the perfect  nightcap. Although I wasn't blown away by the food, I can definitely say that it was inventive, well-executed, clever and tasty.  What really made my experience was the fact that the entire staff was very accommodating and friendly.  For that reason alone, I will definitely be revisiting provisions.Reservations are tough to come by, but if you're willing to come early and wait, you cna most definitely score a bar top or a table. I can't believe no one has thought of this before: bring dim sum to high end ""american nouveau"" or california modern, with a dash of asian influence. The experience is a great one, even if it does take a while to get a reservation. Everyone should try it once to see if they love it, and those who do will undoubtedly become loyal devotees. Tasty treats:- pancake with sweet corn- albacore crudo- pork belly- CA state bird with provisions (the namesake of the restaurant; thus you have to try it) Totally amazing concept.  Very competent American-inspired dishes served dim-sum style.  The best of both worlds.  I wish some dim-sum restaurants would step-up the quality and take a lesson from this place. What makes State Bird so good you ask? Food, well that's a given.  It's reputation precedes itself.  Will there be things you don't like? Naturally, traditional dim sum is that way.  You like some you don't like some. Difference is nothing should gross you out like Dim Sum can.   Dim sum joint remixed is one way to describe the place but my thought was more of a Chef's Choice remixed kind of place but the difference is if there's something you like you can keep going back to it over and over again.  Let me tell you that is handy. Can get expensive but it's handy.  I'd like to sit here and kill the hype but I simply can't. If you think the food isn't that great there is no way you could dis the hospitality of the staff.  Anyone can serve food and be efficient and nice. But to make you feel like you are at a friends house, well that takes a special kind of place. The people who work there make this as much as an experience as the food. So in summary it's fun, friendly, and f'ing good. That's 3 F's that equal to an A+. Top 3 dining experiences I've ever had.  Maybe number 1 after I break down other meals in my head. Hope I can get back there soon and I hope if you are reading this you do too. The food was awkward.  The flavors did not always match or compliment.  There were 3 things that stood out as solid:Yuba tagliatelle with matsutake and noriCumin lamb with scallions grapes and zucchiniSweet bread with black figThe other things mentioned by other Yelpers were just awkward in taste.  I really wanted to like this place... So sad... It's quite good.Very very good.In fact, almost everything I've had here was good, with the absolutely glaring exception of...... the quail.Surprise!A tiny, wee, little, miniature bird is not great in deep-fried form.The amount of batter, and oil, totally overwhelms it.There ain't now way that thing is winning.Sad, but true.No chance.Avoid.Aside from that; good stuff!P.S. Oh the ""delicious"" irony of their signature, namesake dish, being their least tasty, and least interesting dish. Sigh. Really unique, interesting food, and the folks keeping it all moving (Emily especially) are awesome! Unexpected and innovative idea of having small tapas, served like dim sum!  Fun, exciting, and leaves you curious to try more dishes.  Creative, new, and delectable flavor combinations surprise your palate and bring you to gourmet-gasm!  However, be prepared for a 2-MONTH waiting list to get a reservation... Wow. I'm not even sure where to start. I guess I'll kick this off with the first words that come to mind: incredibly disappointing and extremely overrated. I had such high hopes for this place after reading about it in Bon Apetit and pretty much every other food related blog on the planet. It took me 2 months to get a reservation (which was at 10pm, the only time they had available). We were seated pretty much right away which was a plus, and judging by the other reviews not all that typical. The dishes we had ranged from bland to just plain bad. They are clearly trying to be inventive and original and in my opinion drastically failing. The food was just plain not very good. We had the short ribs, pancake, some sort of ahi tuna thing...nothing very memorable and not during a single bite was I impressed. My boyfriend felt the same. An additional annoyance was the lack of food they had available - maybe it was because it was later in the evening, but one guy with one cart with a few measly small plates on it just didn't do the job of serving an entire packed restaurant. Maybe my expectations were too high bc of all the hype - but I think when a restaurant is voted best new restaurant in America the food should be impressive. Especially considering all the amazing restaurants in SF I am just blown away that this place tops the charts. Go !!! Good execution, with complex flavors. Some dishes were a bit muted though, like the cumin lamb. After a while, the cold dishes leave you wanting something hot, but some of the hot dishes weren't hot enough. We spent about $50 a person, which was a good value I thought.pork belly korean style, tofu, green beans; very goodchip with seafood salsaoysterking salmonstate bird nicely friedbeef cheek currypork ribscorn pancake, surprisingly goodgarlic bread burratacumin lambWe scored last minute reservations through a friend, but I'd be hard pressed to wait the two months to get a table here. One of the most amazing meals! Fun, fast, and tasty. Diversity Americana cuisine. A special treat worth waiting in line for. Price to very fairly to keep returning. This place is delicious! Cool staff, decor, food, and surprisingly a good value. It's tough getting areservatino, but it's well worth the wait. The food is great here, but the service is seriously lacking.  We had reservations at 8pm, showed up right on time, but they didn't sit us for 22 minutes.  They asked if we wanted wine while we waited, so we ordered some, but it turns out they were out of wine glasses (something they discovered right as we were sitting).  So they gave us some complimentary cava instead, which was nice... but other tables were having wine glasses brought to them about 2 minutes later.  We ended up having to re-order the wine, since they forgot it... and a constant theme of the night was that any wine order took 15 minutes.  We should have ordered a bottle.Food-wise, some things were amazing, some things were simply good.  Strangely enough, the seasoning was completely inconsistent: The steak tartar had basically no salt in it, but the deep-fried eggplant was quite salty (and amazing!!).The corn pancakes and quail were definitely on the amazing side, as well as the ice cream sandwich.  But the other things: Oysters, sea urchin pancakes, the ciccioli - definitely good, maybe not stellar.Overall, I won't be coming back just because I prefer good service.  Like places that sit you on time (or truly apologize for not), deliver wine quickly when you have a dish infront of you (not 15 minutes), ask you if your dishes are OK and if you need anything, don't try to charge you for complimentary things at the end, and don't ask you if you want more food after you've ordered dessert.  The front operations were just such a circus... but for some, the food's probably worth the hassle. Absolutely mind-blown and shocked with this place! Their servers, service, and food will leave you talking about it for months! Of course, that's if you're able to get past the 2 hour wait (if you're lucky) .. Or one month booked RSVP! The servers walk around constantly with different exquisite dishes, so it'd simply be a crime to not try them all. Their corn pancakes are a must-order-4-of-those ! ( bear in mind, Ive never been a fan of corn, so for me to praise about it, should really mean something) Love. This. Place. Amazing place!  We sat at the bar facing the chefs and enjoyed watching them prepare the various plates. The Kimchi that Chef Glenn has perfected was out of this world with tofu and pork belly!  The garlic bread with Burrata was yum!  The double choc pudding with passion fruit is not to be missed!  Chef Steve and Glenn made the night one to remember - such a fun atmosphere! Guys this is foodie white person dim sum.  I'm yellow, so chill.  It's nice.  It costs too much for a good dose of ordinariness.Yes you can get an appetizer for $5 and not $15.  But they are tiny.  And this is not Le Bernadin, OK?I'd up it to a five star if they started serving using a floating sushi boat mechanism and cut their costs accordingly by 40%.Three stars is like a kick in the groin from Yelp, but this is about mean and median for SF places that will run $50 a person for a after work meal.  It really is. amazing ! can't wait to go back !! This is the only meal I have ever had in my life at which the entire table decided we should immediately make another reservation to eat here again in 3 months. The food ranged from very good to unbelievably good. I had the best rib of my life here. One rib. One kind of expensive rib. It was worth it.UPDATE: I went again in December 2012 and it wasn't as exciting the second time around. I think the dim sum style American food is only worth extra points one time. Most of the same dishes were served and were still delicious. I might come back in a couple years. I had a great meal at State Bird Provisions a few weeks ago.I had a reservation at 9p for four which was a great way to try a lot of the menu on a first visit. Service was running a bit late (not surprising on a Friday night for this tiny place) so I checked in with the hostess Emily and she gave me a call when the table was ready so I could enjoy a quick drink nearby. She was great.Definitely a fun way to do dinner with friends. It is like building your own tasting menu! You have to stay on your toes and make some quick decisions but over all we were very pleased. Some portions are very small (splitting a tiny palm sized pancake 4 ways!) but we ordered 16 dishes (a couple were double orders) and a bottle of wine and left more then satisfied. Our total was $65 per person (including tip). I think that is a great value.Stand out items for me:cast iron eggs with guanicaleeggplant friesribsthe state birdthe ice cream sandwichI wouldn't wait three hours or eat my meal standing up (like some of the walk ins were doing) for this meal. Just stay vigilant and make a reservation. it is worth it. I was BLOWN away by this place...surprising as I eat out ALOT! and the concept idea is usually such a let down. Not so at SBP!! Amazing interior and even more delicious food!  We walked in at 5:45 and already an hour wait at this tiny place, no bigs for us as we just went and had a glass at dosa.The food was delicious I believe we had 12 plates and all were yummy (although my table said the state bird was the least tasty).  Of course the brie pancake and burrata were the highlights for this vegit!Worth the wait! It's always a thrill eating at the hottest new culinary hot spot, even if the only reservation we could get was at 9:30pm on a Tuesday night.  Even so, I came away pretty impressed.  Every dish we got was good--there was honestly nothing I could say was bad or even ""just okay.""  There were some standouts.  One dish, which I'd describe as a fried dough ball covered in warm burrata, was simply amazing: soft, chewy dough and creamy cheese, mmmmmmmmmmmmm.......  Also good was the fried egg with vegetables and pork skin, and the guacamole with spicy seafood salsa (pretty much a ceviche).  Service was very friendly, and the entire experience was a fun little food adventure.  This isn't really the place for a casual night out with the sig-o, as the dishes might leave hungry or somewhat unsatisfied.  But it's definitely a place I'll take guests or visitors who want to see what the SF food scene is ""all about."" Husband and I had dinner here this past Saturday, thanks to a friend who managed to get reservations for 4.Interesting way of serving foods on trays and carts, but then I grew up with dimsum every Sunday, so nothing new here. As far as food is concerned, it's pretty solid, but prices wise it's quite expensive, around $5-$9 per tapas sized dish. Value wise, considering both taste and spend, it's a OK.Between 4 of us, we tasted every single dish they served that night, and more (from the order menu). We tried a total of 17 dishes, plus 2 desserts, some notable ones are:- Sweet corn pancake- Biscuit with duck pate mousse- Egg with salmon and roe PROS- unique dining experience- tasty dishes- good serviceCONS- Incredibly hard to get a reservation- Not enough veg dishes- PriceyWorth going once but not sure I""ll go back. Such a fun experience - unique concept. Friendly and fun service. Amazing food.Our party of two risked going w/out a reservation - and on a Friday night - we lucked out and got the best seats in the house: at the end of the bar where the food comes out. When a restaurant gets this much hype I always fear that I will be disappointed. Lucky for me, this dinner was one of the most unique and life affirming (yes, life affirming!) experiences I have had in years.The place itself is urban in all the right ways and accented with beautiful floral arrangements and an open kitchen. We tried almost every dish that came by and each one was stellar in it's own way. I have rarely had such refined, beautiful food in such a casual, fun atmosphere. Hooray for it!I also loved that everyone served as part of the wait staff, including the chef himself. Everyone was so warm and personable and excited to be there I almost felt like I was in a sitcom about a restaurant.**My only negative feedback was that the hostess refused to acknowledged that we had to wait even though we had a reservation - a personal pet peeve of mine after working in the service industry for years. Would it kill you to say, ""So sorry about the wait, your table should be ready soon""?? I have to agree with comments that the food was all good, interesting, balanced, but not that much was outstanding. Nothing orgiastic, melting, burning and spinning, stunning your socks off - just healthy, nicely arranged, cute little dishes in a cute little restaurant staffed by young people with shaggy bangs and hipster clothes. The staff was friendly but again, while very competent the service was not particularly outstanding. Really great service is when the waitstaff just pour out knowledge about the food and wine; this staff is ""a little too cool for school"" without the drive and professionalism that really makes you feel taken care of. Before tip our tab was about $125 for two people which was surprisingly low given the huge number of dishes that we tried. I might go again sometime but it just wasn't enough of a blowout for me to become one of my all time favorites. Went with 2 friends and sat at the chef's counter - best seats in the house as we got to talk with the chefs preparing the dishes.  We all thoroughly enjoyed each and every bite of the many dishes that came before us.  And it wasn't just the food, but the intimate space, warm and sincere service.   Everyone that we came into contact with seemed to genuinely enjoy what they were doing and was excited about the food they had to offer.  When we asked questions, they were ready with the answers.  they were attentive with water and beverage service. The only draw back is the wait to get in whether you plan months in advance or wait in line to put your name on a list and wait for a call back later in the evening. Whoa.  I lived in SF years ago and had friends in the industry, so always ate well... For my return week in SF I was determined to eat as well as possible.After extensive research I dined at about 10 restaurants.  Several of them were great, what you'd expect of fine dining.State Bird Provisions, however, is on a level all it's own.  By far my best dining experience in SF, and on of my best ever. I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to have eaten at some excellent meals at fine and not so fine restaurants around the world.  State Bird will be remembered as one of the best.Applying the ""dim-sum"" approach to fine dining makes the whole experience more interactive and gives the diner a chance to let their senses decide on what to eat.  Nearly every dish I tried was so beautifully balanced and subtle.  Their concept may be inviting, but the skill of their staff is what makes this place SO incredible.The wine list was small, but provided what I wanted.I urge anyone who loves great food to try this restaurant.  If there are 2 or less in your party, you probably don't need a reservation.... So, we made a reservation--6 weeks to get in for our prime dining request of 7pm on a Saturday.  We later learned that walk-ins can get a table and a little flexibility will go a long way in making a reservation.  Bon Apetit had just named it the ""Best New Restaurant in America"".   So, I was expecting it NOT to live up to the hype and a six week wait.   I was totally and pleasantly surprised!  They have a menu of 5 or 6 items you can order and about 15 items that come around on trays or carts (think dim sum style).   The food was awesome.  Tasty, inspired, new-american meets tapas and dim sum.  loved the food and the concept.  Most importantly, the staff were warm and friendly.  The dining room manager was very friendly and engaging.  The wait staff very informative, explaining the food and and wines.  We were not rushed and enjoyed most of the dishes tremendously.  They seem happy to be there and so were we.  Can't wait to go back and eat my way through the rest of the menu.  Recommend that you try one of everything, share the small plates and enjoy! What a lucky surprise! I made a reservation for SBP three months ago and promptly forgot all about it only to be reminded by email last week. I rounded up some friends and we had one of the best meals in recent memory. I liked the tapas style, although we felt the need to order quite a few different dishes off the regular menu. Instead of giving a blow by blow of each dish, I'll just say that the quality of each one was outstanding and the uniqueness of the dishes was often surprising. The downside to trying lots of experimental small dishes is that there are always going to be some you don't really like (and as a group we did tend to disagree from dish to dish) but at the end of the night, we all agreed it was one of the better dining experiences we have had in SF. And to top it off, it was relatively inexpensive given the quality of the food. Highly recommended! Third time was the charm. After a one-and-half hour wait, we finally got seated and the adventure began. All the dishes were beautifully presented and packed a lot of flavor. Service was attentive, but nothing special. Recommend, but be prepared to wait..... The whole dining experience at State Bird Provisions is so uniquely different.  It's so fun to pick and choose as the waiters come around with their carts and explain the assortment of dishes to you.  It feels very personal.  The food was good, but nothing that I had was amazing.  The bf and I sampled a good share of the 13 or so provisions they were offering that night, with a couple of commandables as well.  A highlight was the seafood salsa, although very familiar in flavor profile to many Mexican salsas with tomatoes and avocado.  A miss was the cast iron egg.  There was no flavor to the dish, and the fried bread compounded the greasiness of the dish.  The peppers seemed a bit out of place as well.  Everything else was good, but not blow your socks off good.  The experience overall was more fun and adventurous than anything.  I think it's totally creative and accessible, and I'd love to go back.  Hopefully when I do, they'll have proper beer glasses though.  My Green Flash Rayon Vert was served in a ridiculously narrow glass that foamed over at the slightest pour. I really don't understand what everyone is raving about.  It was an interesting concept but overall the food was poorly executed.  The kim chee tofu pork belly was not good, in fact it made me sick.  Passion fruit was a step to far with the pudding! Came in a last minute whim and was seated right away with no reservation. Lots of little plates full of fried and raw delicacies. The plates never stop wheeling by so pace yourself! The state bird was good. Had an epic coconut cake which was as cute as the woman who made it. The kitchen staff all smiled and waved at us when we left. Super cute place! Let me preface this by saying that I love my Bon Appetit magazine...I've cooked tons of recipes from their magazine and I love reading their various articles an tips!  I am a loyal reader and I really trust them.  So maybe my expectations were set too high since I had read about this place on Bon Appetit as being the Best New Restaurant in America.  I just can't seem to agree less.First off, we had a 9:30 reservation and did not get seated until a little after 10pm.  There is really no room to stand around and wait in there since they have to cart their food through any open space they have so we kept getting asked to move out of the way with no acknowledgment or apologies that they were late on our reservation. Fine, sometimes they can't control the tables eating beforehand but I would have expected them to feel bad about seating us so late and perhaps offer us a glass of wine or something.  I will say though at the very end of the meal someone did come to our table and thank us for waiting for so long to eat and that they were sorry about the wait.  I would have felt better had they done that from the start.Part of why they probably won Best New Restaurant in America is due to their unique style of service.  Think Dim Sum...but is that really new or unique?  I've been eating in dim sum restaurants since I was a toddler....I won't say how old I am but let's just say it's not new...not by a long shot.   The servers and hosts were not particularly friendly either.  I will say there was one server there that was actually really nice and then rest never really smiled and didn't have really have any personalities. Maybe they are just too hip for me.There were four of us so we pretty much almost ordered everything they had that night on the menu.  Of course you may never have these items on your menu if you go but I will review based on our menu that night. I wouldn't say the food was bad but I wouldn't say anything really blew my mind and made me want to go back anytime soon.  There were also a couple things that had strange flavor combinations that just did not work or that just didn't taste right.  A couple of those dishes came to mind that I wish I hadn't ordered:1. Kimchi-pork belly with tofu.  Something was off putting with their tofu.  The taste reminded me of the smell of bad tofu...and since I have never eaten bad tofu but boy have I smelled it, I could only imagine their tofu is how bad tofu would taste...sour and bitter and made me want to spit it out.2. Glazed Pork Ribs with Swiss chard, Togarashi.  I could not finish my pork rib.  Not because I didn't try but it was so dry that I could not get it off the bone.  Even when I tired to fork and knife it it was tough.3. Pickles, Smoked Albacore-Lardo Butter. The main parts of this dish were not bad tasting but they had these chicharron toppers and when I bit into mine it was like a piece of rubber.  Not crispy, rubbery as hell.  Not edible...imagine biting into a piece of styrofoam, I couldn't even bite it in half. Not to also mention that they were completely tasteless.  I should give them 2 start just because they didn't put any salt on those fried pork rinds.  Isn't seasoning your food ""cooking 101""?4. Marble Chocolate Pudding, Birdseed Crunch, Passionfruit.  This dish was not finished by any of us and that's hard to imagine. We finished every other dish except this one and the 3 above.  The pudding and the passionfruit just didn't taste good together.However, I will say though that there were a few dishes that helped them retain my 3 star rating:1. Garlic Bread and Burrata.  Think deep fried beignet with creamy burrata...I mean you can't really mess that up.  Fried bread nom nom nom...it was good.  2. Cheesecake Japonaise, Tomato Carmel, Strawberries.  This was excellent.  Light and creamy just like the Japanese cheesecakes you get at the Japanese market except even better since it's fresh.3. Chanterelle Egg, Pecorino & Pork Jowl.  This was a good dish, the flavor combinations of the creamy, salty, fatty were just perfect.  The egg was custardy and delicious.4. Sweet Corn & Garlic Chive ""Shortstack"" with Mt. Tam.  Probably cause I love Mt. Tam cheese from cowgirl creamery but these little pancakes were delightful!  And, I just love corn right now...any fresh corn dish will win me over.Don't get me wrong, I am proud as hell a new restaurant in my hometown achieved Best New Restaurant in America on Bon Appetit magazine, but did it really earn it?  Hard to say unless I go and try all the other 9 restaurants on their list.  In my opinion though, nothing there really blew my mind and I'm not really itching to go back anytime soon. Hopefully you will have a better experience and menu when you go try it! 3.5 stars out of 5.Came here on a Tuesday around 6:15 and they said that we would have a table at around 8. We headed to 1300 Fillmore for happy hour drinks (they would text us when a table was available).There's a menu with direct orders from the kitchen as well as items not on the menu that they walk around with to lure you in (prices displayed).Here's a list of what we ordered with ratings:2/5 - Farm egg with bacon, chanterelles, and tomato sauce - Tomato sauce reminded us of pizza sauce. Bacon was flavorful but the overall dish didn't come together well.2/5 - Kimchi tofu pork belly stew - had better kimchi stew homemade. Kimchi was a little too sour for us.4/5 - Fried quail - batter was flavorful and quail was juicy.3.5/5 - Ribs - good but nothing to write home about. Fall off the bone tender.4/5 - Guinea hen dumplings - meat was nice and spiced and the broth was a great compliment.3/5 - Seafood ceviche - Pretty bland. Could have been more citrusy or with some accompanying herbs. A little like bland tomato purée.5/5 - Fig and Lavender ice cream sandwich. Delish! So many flavors going on in every bite. It was like a party in my mouth. My friend mentioned how the lavender notes hit different parts of your taste buds (I usually don't like lavender). The favors were harmonious and really stimulated my palette (sounds cheesy but that's how I really felt). We were glad we got this one because otherwise we would have been disappointed.Overall, such a hyped up restaurant should have every item on the menu special (at least good and not mediocre) and I didn't feel that way. I would suggest waiting for hype to die down or make reservations if you really want to try it. Also everything is pricey and the items that pass by are tempting so if you care about how much you spend I would suggest doing some research on what dishes are good since I felt like it was a waste for some of the choices we tried. Maybe if we lucked out on trying every dish that was good I would give it a 4. State Bird Provisions is everything you think it is but better.  My friend and I planned to get there when they opened at 530 and ended up eating at 7 on a Tuesday.  It's worth the wait and you can grab a drink near-by.Food.  Each small plate is really dumb-founding.  Every single taste bud was satisified.  I've never had such inventive, but simple, and as the Stuart the chef said, food that just made sense.  The tapas style is genius because there's so many yummy dishes that you see and want to try. And you can.  Also, the most inventive fully disclosed dishes I've had.  The chef is happy to tell about each plates ingredients and process.  Amazing.Staff/ ambiance.  Staff= 10 stars.  We were lucky enough to sit at the bar so we had full access to the kitchen and all the cooks.  Amazing to see the workings of this incredible restaurant.  And all the staff talks with you and takes care of you all while whipping up these fantastic dishes.  There's a real sense of community.  Everyone takes care of the patrons and they want to make sure you are enjoying the food.  Ambiance- it's like your sitting at your friend's kitchen chatting.  The experience at the bar is great if you want to socialize.  We sat with a staff member who was taking his night off to eat as a patron and another couple of friends.  All of us shared food.  If you see something and you want it you just ask for it and voila it's there right in front of your drooling mug.Chef.  He's so talented, invented, humble, gracious and just happy to serve amazing.  He was working and coming around to every table and explaining the dishes.  Unreal can't wait to go back again.  And so lucky that it's in my neighborhood! A must go if you're in the city. This review may be a bit biased but what the hell, I will write it anyways.  So I have not been to the actual restaurant but tried State Bird Provisions at the SF Street Food Festival in August 2012.I got to the festival before it even opened at 11:00 am and there was already a line for the State Bird Provisions booth so, being the lemming that I am, I stood in line.  And wow, I am super glad I did.  I ordered the Burrata with Green Garlic Bread and WOW!  Such a simple dish of perfectly baked garlic bread with fresh burrata and a hint of spices and olive oil.  This dish truly exemplified ingredient driven food in my book and I can only imagine what is being made at the restaurant!I can't wait to make a trip up to SF to try the full State Bird Provisions experience! We got in on Thursday night without a reservation.  We stood in line at 5:30 and were told we'd have a table for 4 at 7.  At 6:10 a text said our table was ready!  We had at least:- Sweet corn + chive pancakes with Mt. Tam cheese - Burrata with garlic bread- Avocado with seafood salsa - Dumplings in aromatic broth- Oysters on the half shell- Beef cheek and oxtail curry- Smoked salmon w/tomato and corn- Lamb- A tostada-like thing with halibut sashimi- Ice cream sandwichesBeer and wine A few dishes were delicious, most were good and a few were poor.  I really liked the oxtail, lamb and halibut.  I was told the oysters were excellent.  The garlic bread under the burrata was cold and chewy.  I didn't like the dumplings and the broth was cold.  Odd pairing of ingredients and spices.  A little lavender in the ice cream sandwich.  The concept is great and for a restaurant so highly reviewed the prices are reasonable. Everything is tiny however.  Even the large dishes.  Beer and wine pours are small. We made reservations for three about three weeks in advance, and the only table we could get on a  Friday night was at 9:45pm. Kind of small restaurant for such a popular place. The concept is American food served on a cart, where you eat with yur eyes first.This is what three of us picked out: fried quail with onions & parmesan, almond biscuits with duck liver mousse, steak tartare with shishito peppers, ginger scallion pancake with sea urchin, tomato, corn & salmon salad, soft cooked egg with tomatoes, padrons & guanciale, guinea hen dumplings, tomato-dashi mushrooms with charred eggplant, Japonaise cheesecake with starwberries & candied tomatoes.(see entire menu here: yelp.co.uk/biz_photos/QZ…)My favourite dishes were the quail, almond biscuits with duck liver mousse, & uni pancake. The quail was perfectly fried and the cheese gave it a nice saltiness. The onions at the bottom were amazing too. The duck liver mousse was rich and creamy and paired well with the mini almond biscuits. Everything else was scrumptious. I was not disappointed at all. The process is a little slower...dinner took 2.5 hours, but we didn't mind. I had a great date last night and State Bird Provisions was central to it.  I really liked (nearly) everything about it.  Here's the rundown.Overall Experience: Excellent.  I really loved the vibe in this place.  Simple, a bit rustic with modern touches.  Not too loud but vibrant.  The layering of the set menu with the rotational items they bring by your table was a great touch and made the experience unique.  My only slight nitpick was the service.  The front of the house was warm and inviting.  Our waiter was fine.  Stopped by occasionally but clearly running about, super-busy and not overly welcoming.  Nothing off-putting though...just OK.Food: Excellent.  We had some delightful dumplings in a tasty broth.  Some pork ribs with spice that was unique and truly excellent.  We had ""seafood"" salsa which was a mix of guacamole, tomato based sauce and a mixed assortment of salsa.  It was interesting and good (not my favorite though).  For desert we have the chocolate and pudding.  Interesting and pretty good.Tip: Walk-ins seem to be the way to go here.  The wait was a couple of hours but we'd walked in at peak time on a Friday night.  So, here's the trick: put your name on the list..give them your cell #.  Walk around the corner and grab a drink (and perhaps some small bites if super-hungry) at Fat Angel (a gastropub that never disappoints).  Then, get the text that your table is ready and you're off!  I was trying for reservations here but read that walk-ins works...so did that.  Good move.  They said that half of their biz is walk-ins.Now one of my favorite spots in SF (the kind of place you take out-of-towners). Delish! Scored a last -minute reservation and had an amazing meal. It's Dim Sum with New American food. The food is innovative with great flavors--a lot of the new american restaurant genre is bland and boring--not here!State Bird Provisions deserves the hype.My only complaint would be that the place is pretty noisy, but that's also a flaw of many SF restaurants.--quail--amazing!--corn pancakes--excellent; can't wait to try to replicate them myself--kimchi pork belly--a little fatty for my taste but the flavor was divine.--beef cheek curry, mushroom dumpling (broth was memorable), garlic bread/burrata--all wonderful.--the only thing we didn't like was fish crudo dish that wasn't anything special. State Bird Provisions serves up New American dishes dim sum style. In addition to a selection of small plates that are brought by the table for you to pick from, there are some items you can order off the menu, including pancakes, meats, and desserts. The day I came here, there were 13 tableside small plates choose from. Unfortunately, not all of them made their way past our table in the 75 minutes we were here. I really liked the concept of State Bird. While I didn't LOVE every single item I tried, everything was decently good. Items I liked more denoted with ""**"" below.- Sweet corn + chive pancakes with Mt. Tam cheese **- Burrata with garlic bread- Avocado with seafood salsa **- Dumplings in aromatic broth- Oysters on the half shell- Beef cheek curry with crepes + bok choy **- Cast iron eggs with tomatoes, padron peppers, guanciale- Cheesecake Japonaise **The bill for the above items came out to just under $80 pre-tip.Other notes:* Unassuming exterior and very cool modern interior* Good service* No tables of greater than 4 available* Very close to the Japantown parking garage As my girlfriend most eloquently put it, the way this place runs is kind of like a ""Create your own tasting menu"" joint. Sure, it's like a dim sum place, but the similarities stop with the carts and trays rotating around for your pickings. With that in mind, you should be prepared to pay as much as you would for a prixe fixe at a place that offers it. My gf and I spent about $60 each, and came away more than stuffed.We tried about 6 or 7 things, but here are some of the high (and low) lights:* The State Bird Provisions (i.e. breaded fried quail) was delicious. I was expecting some gaminess to be there, but was pleasantly surprised at how little gaminess there actually was. The breading was crispy and savory. Finger licking good.* Oxtail Curry - To be honest, this was kind of a disappointment. On one hand, the flavor was off the charts. I could eat that sauce all day everyday. Where this dish really felt short was the oxtail itself. I felt like it didn't have enough time to be completely tenderized. It was a little chewy, and as a result was a little difficult to eat.* Toast with Lardo Butter and Chicharron - I love all these things individually, so I couldn't say no when the cart came around. It sounded great in my mind, but in application I didn't see any cohesion there. I didn't think the flavors went well together here.* Cast-Iron Eggs - Although it was pretty rustic, this was a nice dish. I thought the egg was cooked beautifully and its richness really brought everything together. Really tasty.Overall, I think this is a great place to hang out and enjoy some pretty tasty food. The dim sum style service is fun, especially since the folks coming around with the food can be easily understood, aren't rude and are happy to tell you all the ingredients in the dish. Although every dish I had wasn't a home run, I'm still really interested in coming back. I think this would be a perfect spot to eat and drink before heading to the Kabuki for a movie.If you're a beer snob, you'll also like this place because they have a small but delicious selection of craft beers. I've been to SBP twice now, had a great experience both times and will continue to return (even if that does mean booking reservations over a month in advance....the anticipation is well rewarded). Given some of the poor (but uncommon) reviews I've seen on Yelp, it's apparent the concept of this restaurant isn't for everyone. But frankly, I'm OK with a few bad reviews because perhaps it will make it easier for me to get a table. :) I personally like the dim sum concept for the food, though yes, it does mean that the food from the carts doesn't come out steaming hot. But here's the point everyone - most of it shouldn't be served hot anyway. In my experience, the dishes on the cart are supposed to be served cold or room temperature. The items that should be hot usually come out on hand carried trays immediately after coming out of the oven or off the grill. And the items you order from the menu come out immediately as well. I'm sure the staff may have off nights, but so far I've not had any complaints about the temperature of the food.Concept aside, what I like most about SPB is the food. I feel like I'm being taught a lesson in flavor with nearly every bite. This place exemplifies the concept of eating the dish as the chef intended - everything on the plate has a purpose, just go with it and be prepared to smile (or sometime giggle, it's that good). The place is super busy now with all the local and national hype (and I overheard one of the cooks say Monday was one of their busiest nights, fyi), so even with a reservation, we still had to wait about 20 minutes to get our table. But a glass of sparkling wine, a celebrity sighting, and plenty of food eye-candy helped passed the time easily. It also helped me keep tabs on what I wanted to try so I could pace myself through the selection. Try it. If you don't love it, then my apologies, but thanks for making more room for me. :) I've already booked my next visit. If you don't already have a reservation for State Bird, make one now, or be ready to get in line at 5:00 or earlier, 30 minutes before opening for a coveted walk-in spot....in the end the wait will be totally worth it...I stake my Yelp reputation on it :-)I recommend starting with the restaurant name sake and the full order is a must. The quail is coated in what I'm told is 20+ different spices the coolest of which is coarsely ground pumpkin seeds which adds great texture. Who would've thought our state bird was so damn good.The guinea hen dumplings are based on a delicious hen confit and a broth that I found almost similar to Pho with hints of cinnamon, star anise, etc. Well done dish.Kimchi-pork belly with tofu..mmm meltingly tender chunks of pork pair so well with the silkiness of the tofu. Nice twist on a traditional Korea hot pot.Duck liver mousse: well since I can't get foie gras this is the next best thing to fill that void in my pallete. I particularly liked the almond biscuits.Had a bunch of other items but this review is getting a bit long...bottom line they were all stinkin' yummy. Don't believe the HYPE. I did and I'm disappointed, but read on because there are still things that were good here (not great, but good). There are 1 of 2 reasons for this: 1) my palate isn't culinary enough to know what the heck I was eating/why it was special or 2) this place wasn't that great - I'd like to believe the latter.Came here for a special birthday and without a reservation, arrived at 5pm per the yelp reviews and restaurant staff suggestions. We were 2nd in line, luckily not a minute later, because this line definitely grew fast. When the doors opened, we were given seats at the counter (maybe this is just for walk-ins, but the coupe behind us sat at a table and they didn't seem to have a reservation, so it would've been nice to ask us which we preferred since I forgot to ask in the organized chaos of the check in process, somewhat organized, somewhat stressful, somewhat happy because you realize you got a seat!). *ding #1 - don't sit at the counter if you can help it, if you're going to pay 100+ for a meal, it's best not spent crammed between 3 men.*Food started arriving quickly, tapas style, I jumped the gun and ordered steak tartar to be adventurous, not realizing that this may later cause a week of upset stomach. Second dish, also jumped the gun in excitement, said YES to the Duck Liver, forgetting that I actually don't like Liver, but it was creamy and the little buns served with it are quite good, but nothing special. A handful of mediocre dishes came and went, so we ordered from the menu. Had to try the state bird - why you would point out that you are eating the California State Bird by naming your restaurant this, baffles me, but this was very good. Tender and juicy with a crispy exterior - lives up to its expectations. Oxtail Curry - is very odd and not worth ordering *ding2*, definitely a miss. Curry flavor was subtle but this had no ""light up my tastebuds"" quality to it. The raw oysters were very fresh and the seafood salad with toasted chips (tasted a little like salsa) was very good as well.The sole reason for the review and the stars - BURRATA. This was AMAZING and when we had this, I thought the night was taking a turn for the better, but it didn't. The cheese was so fresh and a great compliment to the flaky burrata. Dessert was very yummy too and I may be biased as I love sweets, but the ice cream sandwich is a must try.The bartender was swamped in the beginning which didn't allow her much time to socialize, so yes she was doing her job, but no she kind of wasn't. She wasn't overly friendly nor amused when we asked what certain things are - one of my biggest pet peeves at fancy places when they treat you like you aren't fancy enough. She lightened up by the end of the night, maybe she was just busy. Most of the staff seemed stand-off-ish but at times friendly, so honestly, this also baffles me *ding #3*Long story short: I trusted Bon Appetit and a trusted culinary friend's recommendation, but I was disappointed. Maybe my expectations were too high or they just didn't live up to the hype. Few good items, but not enough to make me come early or make a 60day in advance reservation to come again. I have been meaning to try this place for a while and I finally made it there this weekend. I also managed to score a reservation at a reasonable time which of course always helps! To start, my friend and I somehow timed it perfectly and got probably one of the best seats in the house - it was right where the servers come out from the kitchen so we got first dibs on dishes. Our waitress was very personable and helpful in explaining how the process works. We ordered drinks and also the ribs that are on the menu that do not come out with the servers. Then the fun began! Here are the items we selected from the passed dishes:- Heirloom tomatoes w smoked salmon and sweet corn - Excellent flavors and combination.- Albacore mousse with pickled veggies and chicharones - Ok not one of my favorite dishes- Duck liver mousse w almond biscuits - LOVED the biscuits, the liver mousse flavor was great but a bit soft on the consistency- Quinoa w Ahi tuna - This was one of my favorite dishes and I don't even like quinoa! The flavors are layered and excellent together.- Spicey tomato sauce with egg and chantarelle mushrooms - sounded good but everything just kind of blended together and was kind of one note- Burrata with fried garlic bread - if you are a burrata fan then you will probably love this, it is a bit heavy but really good flavor- Dumplings with hen and shitake mushrooms - one of the just ok dishes, would not get again- Ribs - these were delicious and tender. A different flavor than I have ever tasted before on ribs, and I have had a lot of ribs!- Melon granita with ginger tapioca and berries - we were so full (very proud we managed to try 8 things between the 2 of us!) so we went with the lightest sounding dessert. Not fantastic but a fun and light dessrt which we enjoyed.All of the servers were great and fun to talk to. They checked in on us without being intrusive and we never felt rushed. We really enjoyed the concept and will be back! You know what - f these guys. I ate there 6 ish months ago with a reservation and it was OK - not amazing, good food but nothing blew me away. Last night I thought that perhaps, just perhaps, since their website clearly states that they welcome walk-ins, if we came late enough we might get a seat. Instead we get rudely shoved into a line and have to wait while the hostess does other things, talks to other people who jump said line, and then she comes over to us and says ""uh, no, I'm closing out the restaurant with those last people"". I'm frankly sick and tired of the restaurant scene in San Francisco - it's like you people don't know how to cook your own food. I'm exhausted by the lines, the impossible reservations and the trendytrendytrendy spots. Plow, I'm looking at you as well. From now on, when I go out I'm going to stick to the no-longer-so-hot but still very solid and innovative restaurants. Like SPQR, where we had dinner. And it was delicious, and they weren't rude and stuck up, because they're not the hot b*tch on the block anymore. This place should be Yelp-proof by now, so I'm going to defer to Bon Apetit with regard to overall impressions. I'm writing to the reader who has already made reservations and is thinking about what they might like to order. If you are thinking of going there and you haven't made reservations yet ... well, good luck to you then. Must: State Bird - fried quail over pickled veggies. Signature dish didn't disappointOysters - if raw oysters is your thing. This was the one dish we re-ordered.Ravioli - it's tiny, and served with a tiny amount of broth, but there's a lot of flavor thereMust Not:Ox tail curry entree - You know, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, and worse, it seemed to clash with everything else we ordered.It wasn't the best meal I've had in SF, but it was a darn good meal. Enjoy! I have heard a lot of great things about SBP, so I must say:  The concept is 5 out of 5, the atmosphere is 5 out of 5, but the food is 3 out of 5.  The reason I'm writing a review is I think this restaurant has a good thing going and concept is great.  I believe the owners/employees are open for feedback and will improve.  I will go there again in a few months:  The glazed pork ribs were dry and chewy.  The quail was ok, not good or great, but just ok.  I have prepared quail, dove, and small game birds 20 different ways, sometimes you fail and sometimes you are successful.  Try again, again, and again.I want to see SBP successful, successful to the point that other restaurants start to copy them. I am going to be that 1% to give a contrarian review to the overwhelming positive responses.  In a word: overhyped.  To be more precise:  the place has a great concept (small creative plates served efficiently in a dim sum style).  However, creativity does not equal great taste when it comes to food.  While many of the dishes had ingredients I've never had or heard of, the overall ""taste"" factor was only luke warm.   We had:- The pork belly with tofu and kimchee.  Very tasty but very similar to a Korean tofu stew.  - Garlic bread with buratta:  Salty version of a Chinese bun deep fried with cheese on top.  A bit too salty.- Pickles and smoked albacore spread with crostini:  The spread was very tasty.  Pickles were a bit strong and it had 2 pieces of fried pork skin that was really tasteless.- Smoked salmon and tomato&corn.  Mediocre- Green beans with seeds.  Probably the worst of the bunch.  Green beans were nice and crispy but they served it in a sour sauce with a sorts of seeds.  I did not care for the texture mix or the taste.- Fried eggplant:  Very good and unique.- Sweet corn pancakes:  Tasty and very savory.- State bird 1/2:  Their signature dish which is a deep fried quail served on top of some pickled veggies.  Not a lot of meat and not very good.  In terms of the food, at the end of the day, I just didn't find it to taste as good as all the 5-star reviews.  Most of the dishes were ok-good...just not great.Other than the food:  Service was mostly friendly.  We arrived at 6pm as walk-ins and got seated around 7.  They will text you when your table is ready so you can go wait somewhere else.Decor is very minimal and trendy.  Open kitchen.  Seems to be a draw for hipsters. So many reviews already I guess there isn't much I can add..highly reviewed on yelp and you can find so much written on this place..  I would say definitely try it out because this place makes eating fun and it doesn't hurt that the food is pretty good.This is basically a Dim Sum style/tapas/ hors d'oeuvres kinda place where you have an array of items (usually they say 13 things or so) passed around on trays and carts (average 5-9 dollars?). Then you have some things you can order off a selection from the menu (7-25 dollars but you can choose from half or full order).I loved the: sweet corn and chives pancakes (off the menu), the glazed pork ribs, pork belly w/kim cheeI could pass on the: oysters, seafood salsa, corn thing with salmon and oxtail curryWould of loved to try the: CA state bird with provisions (which I heard was what they are famous for?), cast iron eggs, burata garlic bread, peanut milk shot and ice cream sandwhich..I was too full already.I loved the concept of small plates parading through you because I felt I was able to try a little bit of everything...and that I was content.The place is super small with the open kitchen that greets you up front..it can be a bit crowded with the bar like sitting area surrounding the front open kitchen and people waiting along the side...I went in and was a bit lost to find the hostess.The staff were all warm and friendly..I felt very comfy and at home.This is probably not a good place for a romantic first date but definitely set a warm, casual, upbeat atmosphere if that's what you are looking for.  Great place with friends but maybe not a big group. The place overall is pretty small..I didn't really see any tables that could accommodate more than 4-6..I made a reservation about 3 weeks prior (the only time was I believe 9:30p.m.)...which I actually forgot about until they called me the day of.  I don't know how hard it is to make a reservation now..but I highly recommend it although I did see a lot of walk in's and the wait was about 20-30..but this was already close to closing time.  Since most people probably like to sit and linger longer for all the food to pass by..the turn around time for tables didn't seem fast because we were the 3rd to last seating for the night and only 2 tables left during dinner.  Anyways..make a reservation. However, this seems like a fun place if you were to eat solo..the bar area always looks festive as the kitchen is right there so it seems like there is always someone to chat with if you are feeling social.The pricing is very decent minus the 4 glasses of wine from our bill..the food total came out to be about 70 for 2 persons and we ordered about 6 things off the carts/trays and 2 things off the ""commandables"" menuI also found this recipe off Bon Appetit for the ribs...and I can't wait to try it at home.bonappetit.com/recipes/2… This was the most inspirational restaurant I have had the pleasure of eating at in (probably my whole life) - or a really really long time..... We ate here two nights in a row back to back bc the food was so outstanding and the atmosphere so inviting that we could not want to go to another place for dinner.  I didn't eat a thing that wasn't top notch.  Highlights included a halibut crudo with marinated peppers, cilantro, mint on a wafer thin house made cracker.  There was a burrata cheese garlic bread that was amazing, avocado mousse with poached seafood in house made tomato ""gazpacho"" kind of.....  duck liver mousse with a small almond savory financier ...  Oxtail in a multilayered curry was amazing with a crepe, sand dabs sautéed with hazelnuts and mandarin oranges,  I can go on for a while - we ate the whole menu in two days sans one or two dishes.  We even had some great desserts the second night we dined here, a peanut infused milk with moscavado syrup, some kind of chocolate Panna cotta 2x with passion fruit and a Japanese style cheesecake.  The service was great, super friendly and very attentive.  The kitchen staff were all great, extremely knowledgable, very attentive and helped serve, clear and make our food all whilst being extremely cool and having a good time while they worked.  I wish every restaurant could learn a lesson from these guys (the whole crew) bc this is what going out and sharing great food is all about.  State Bird - u guys rock! This is the best restaurant in San Francisco and I'm seriously considering taking a star off every other 5 star review. We had the Green Beans, Pickled Beets, Duck Liver, Pork Spare Ribs, Quinoa Albacore, Egg Guanciale, Fried Eggplant with Aioli, The State Bird, Burrata, Corn Pancakes, Japanese Cheese Cake and Double Chocolate Pudding. Ok, here we go:Green Beans. These were the best I've ever had. I could eat buckets of these. Perfectly crispy and lightly steamed. There was an amazing sauce that I dare not give away. Get this, it's perfect. Pickled Beets. What can you do with beats. Personally I hate beats but my GF said they were the best prepared she had ever had. Get this, it's perfect.Duck Liver. This is perfection. If you can handle the texture of liver this one is out of this world good. The tiny little muffins it comes with are great alone too, wow. Get this, it's perfect.Pork Ribs were so tender they just fall off the bone, not too tender but just perfect with just enough spice added as not to over power the meat, just right. Get this, it's perfect.Quinoa Albacore. This was so perfect. I'm coming back just for this and will likely have three orders, out of this world. Get this, its perfect and maybe the best thing we had. I say, ""maybe"" because everything was out of this world.Egg Guanciale. This is perfection. Get this.Fried Eggplant with Aioli. The Eggplant was pan fried to perfection. Totally amazing. Get this, it's perfect.The State Bird. We had to try it and you know what, it was wonderful. Just crispy and crunchy enough on the outside while still preserving all the juicy happiness on the inside. Cooked to perfect tender amazement for your taste buds. Get this, it's perfect.Burrata: This was the last thing we ordered before desert and it was too much food at this point but we couldn't stop. Think about it. What if we were never to come back? We had to try it. The cheese was marvelous and the bread was killer. Think pizza bread stick modified to the point where nothing else matters. Corn Pancakes: Outstanding! You have got to try these miniature masterpieces. Perfection. Japanese Cheese Cake: Every now and again you have a food that is so good it redefines the meaning, this was that food. The best Japanese Cheese Cake I've ever had. The tomatoes were perfect. Get this, it's perfect.Double Chocolate Pudding. I can't even put into words how amazing this was so please just try it. If you think you might like chocolate you will love this more than anything. Get this, it's perfect.The service was very nice, extremity fast with special request and vary attentive.TOTAL including nice tip: $145.5299.999% chance I will return. State Bird Provisions has received a lot of hype.  I was able to grab a walk-in table right when they first opened, but had to wait another month before I could make my second reservation!  But man, is it ever worth it.The food comes out on trays and carts.  Most of the time they rotate clockwise, once in a while they mix it up and go counterclockwise.  So, you want to sit in the middle column, closer to the front of the restaurant to get first dibs!  Of course, since the restaurant is in such high demand you are rarely able to choose your table.  If you're stuck in the back (like we were the second time) you can always creepily peer around at what other people are eating (no shame!) and ask your server about the dishes.  There's no rule that says you have to wait for the trays!My favorite dish here so far was only available the first visit - a potato puree.  I could describe it in words and it would not do it justice.  Everything was thoughtfully made.  My best suggestion would be to try everything that sounds good.  And everything will sound good - that's why they come in small plates! You can try everything!  (Don't forget the items only available by ordering off the menu).  The state bird is crispy and succulent, the garlic bread with burrata is fluffy and warm, the farro salad was refreshing with a surprising depth.Wine prices are very reasonable and start around $30/bottle. Why bother getting a $200/person tasting somewhere that will leave you feeling bloated and tired?  SBP really is a special experience that brings the tasting experience and so much more.  The options are brought around on trays, so you can pick and choose the things you want to have, as well as how many dishes you want to have.  Service is excellent and the quality of the food is extremely good. Oh was it worth the 90 minutes at Dosa to meet Stewart and his crew here. This is the new go to place and the line starts at the door at 4:30 and the open at 5:30. Was it worth it? Absolutely! If you can swing a seat at the bar go for it. The kitchen crew are awesome and you get first dibs on everything coming out of the kitchen. Check out the review in Bon Apetit magazine and get here as soon as you can. Thanks for dinner Reputation as a place for foodies well deserved.  Small plate approach with eclectic styles.   Asian influence on some dishes .  Others are new takes on the traditional.   Super friendly staff.  Like the dim sum approach to keeping track of what you eat.  Open kitchen design up front is a fun twist.  Reservation system is a bit harried.  You are likely to wait even with reservations.  Place is also loud.   Way too dim to really see what you are eating.  Just know that it all tastes good. I was here just before they got the Bon appetit honors and San Francisco was in full state bird love fest mood.  I was only in sf for a couple of dinners so needed to really maximize quality.  We ate at Mission Chinese the first night and here the next.  We were lucky enough to get a late reso and got there early eager for a great meal.  It is a great space with a long bar facing a busy open kitchen as you walk in. Chef Stuart saw me peaking around and greeted me before I got up to the main seating area.  He was warm and friendly even though obviously very busy.  We were seated right a way and our server came by to explain how the meal will work.  As our drinks were getting made, the food started flowing.  They ALL looked so good we said yes to almost all of them even though there were only three of us.  Spicy cold tofu salad, yummy, eggplant fries, delicious, but the state bird and savory fried giant ball of dough topped with burrata?  Nothing like I have ever eaten before and I ate at the French Laundry three night before that.  We finished with the ice cream sandos and grilled pound cake which were the perfect ending to a very unique and lovely meal.  I don't think this concept will fly in Vancouver (I can already hear the hmming and hawing and the miserable server holding the tray full of food getting cold, shooting daggers from his/her eyes) but will definitely come back here next time in SF.  The chef really personified the warmth and genuineness of the place as he actually bothered to turn and thank us with a giant smile as we left.  One doesn't get that kind of personal touch anywhere anymore. This is arguably the best restaurant in San Francisco, and one of the best across the country. The gourmet preparations are extraordinary. The method of service of the eclectic variety of small plates is innovative, and the tastes are one wonder after another. Stuart, the cooks, the service, notably Megan, were gracious and warm.We will be frequent visitors...Enjoy This place is an amusement park for your taste buds! Oh did we have fun saying yes to the plates as they passed by on the rolly carts. And the server was not hesitant to help us as foodie noobs. A great experience, but likely a yearly one, since the price for two was well into the triple digits. I didn't realize what a huge deal this restaurant is when I made my reservation.  I called less than a week in advance and they had one available.  I guess I got lucky!  There was a  line of people waiting for a walk-in table almost the entire time we were there.Our waitress was awesome.  The concept of the dim sum style carts/ trays is genius.  A smart way for the restaurant to stack up a bill very quickly - every time something came out, we grabbed it!  The carts/trays were not consistent, however.  For some time there would be a flurry of food coming around and then for a long period of time there would be a lull where we were waiting for more food to come out.  Would be nice if there was a steady flow of food coming out.PROVISIONS:Oysters = Topped with something that reminded me of sauerkraut.  2 stars.blackberry marinated beets with goat cheese = 5 starsguinea hen dumplings with aromatic broth = 3 stars.  Yelp, you deceived me!  Yes I expected 2 tiny dumplings so I was not surprised by the small size but I also expected 2 tiny dumplings of amazing, which I did not get.  They were good but wasn't crazy about them.marvel stripe tomato with sweet corn, smoked salmon = 3 starsduck liver mousse with almond biscuit = 10 STARS.  AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING.  I could eat plates and plates of this by myself.  The biscuit is extremely buttery and the mousse is like eating a delicious, livery cloud.haricot verts, pickled-egg salad, nuts & seeds = 3 starsgarlic bread with burrata = 2 stars.  Most unspectacular of them all!  Where was the garlic?haas avocado with seafood 'salsa' = 4 stars.  Plump, fresh seafood, perfectly cookedkimchi-pork belly with tofu = 2 stars.  Pork belly was very tender and well cooked but this was basically a fancy version of kimchi jjigae... eating this made me want to go home and make my own (better and tastier) kimchi jjigae.sweet corn & garlic chive ""shortstack"" with mt. tam = 4 starschanterelle ""PANtatin"" cured pork jowl, candy cap topped with crispy mustard greens = 2 stars.  Smelled very sweet like maple but didn't taste sweet.  Interesting!  Unfortunately it only tasted ok.COMMANDABLES:CA state bird with provisions = 3 stars.  Fried quail on top of a bed of pickled vegetables.  Not quite sure what they were.  Definitely get the full size.  If you know what a quail is, then you know how small the bird is.oxtail curry, bok choy, french crepes = 4 stars.cast iron pullet eggs, bread salad & tomato with guanciale = 3 stars.DESSERT:cheesecake japonaise, griddled figs in sherry &honey = 4 starschocolate mint ice cream sandwich, raspberries = 3 stars'world peace' peanut muscovado milk shot = 5 stars.  Tastes like a liquid Snickers bar!Include 2 bottles of wine.  Total bill about $300 for 4 people.  (But as you can see we did kind of go all out...)OVERALL:  This was a strong 3.5 stars for me.  I loved the concept and our waitress was great.  However since Yelp doesn't allow half stars, I am rounding down to 3 stars because I don't have a desire to return.  I think it is definitely worth a try and I will certainly consider coming back when the menu changes. apparently, this is a hard restaurant to get a reservation at.... but they do talk walk-in's if you're lucky enough to come at the right time. The space is small, so if u have reservations, u still might have to wait, and there is no room in the restaurant for u to stand and wait.the concept is a bit like dim sum.... lots of small plates to share, some of which come around on a cart, and some you can order off of a menu.  HIGHLIGHTS of dinner were the State Bird dish, named after the restaurant.  it is in fact the State bird of California - the quail.... which i found a little funny that we were actually eating it. but damn, was it DELICIOUS.  it was crispy fried, and moist.  get this!! also, the seafood salsa was amazing.  bits of fish, scallop, squid, avacado and tomato, all mixed up, and eaten with blue corn chips.  really, really good! the eggplant dish was so-so, the shiitake mushroom dumpling was so-so, but the broth it was in was really good, and the pate with corn cakes were meh.  there were lots more dishes (we almost tried the entire menu), but those were the ones i remembered..... the menu changes frequently! non-alcoholic drinks i tried were the peach and white balsamic soda (delicious), and the dragon eyes iced tea (okay).  they also have a selection of wines and beers. the servers are very helpful, and pretty nice.  one server in particular was amazing, but i didn't catch his name.  he's got close shaved hair, and was very nice.  he even gave us a plate of oysters on him!!   great guy!also, if you tell any server (everybody is your server here....) that you're celebrating a birthday, they bring you a little dessert with a candle.  no embarrassing singing, just a nice dessert :) We got super excited, place has a very good vibe when you walk in, staff gives you this warm welcome. An interesting concept with Dim sum service and the ability to order off the menu as well.  I think a lot of restaurants will use this style going forward. - vibe of the restaurant is really good, you can do a walk in if you don't mind waiting an hour or so but luckily there are plenty of places around the corner to get a drink and wait and they will call you. A really nice option as lots of folks are walking in.- Ability to sample lots of small plates is great. but most of the dishes were good but not amazing. - LImited Vegetarian options or just greens in general - but if you want lots of meat this place might be for you. All we could find is s small beat salad and sweet corn cakes. Once again  good but not anything amazing.  - The couple next to us said the best part was the desert and I think they had the same experience - these mini ice cream sandwiches which I would have to agree.  - Service overall was beyond dreadful. While they have a ton of staff there no one knows what anyone is doing. We waited for drinks, water, ordering throughout the whole night. Where it really ruined the night. That is why they get 2 stars vs. 3. I think the food is 3.5 stars but the service was 2. - Overall a fun place, good look, food is good but not amazing. and service was luckily something they can fix in the future. Came here and literally ate like 20 dishes.Very unique. American dim sum with a twist!I love the idea of random small dishes coming around and you just picking whatever you want. I would say they have no more than small tables, so make your reservations!A few of the dishes were just alright, but most of them were unique and tasted superb!Customer service was great. Would be great to come back, if I can get a seat. Hipster Credit: My friend and I made our reservations BEFORE the Bon Appetit announcement.Now that that's settled, onto the restaurant. State Bird Provisions provides a dim sum style service with creative and rotating food. I'm actually surprised that the service model of SBP hasn't been picked up on before, as it seems so.. intuitive. The layout itself is very interesting, almost like a bakery. You are greeted by the kitchen and a long bar, which is pretty unique (unless you're used to Buca di Beppo.). However, there really isn't anyone to 'greet' you, and there isn't a traditional place for a host. In fact, there seems to be so much bustle, I wasn't quite sure who was my host. Making your way past the bar is where the small but not too cozy dining space. I suppose the need to keep aisle space clear for a cart of food gives you a bit more personal space than many other SF restaurants offer. You are encouraged to order a few things from the a la carte menu, and then pick from the dishes that rotate throughout the cart. My friend and I ordered the Chive/Garlic Short Stack and Pullet Eggs in a Castiron pan from the menu, and the rest from rotating carts. I will say that one server in particular took note that I was a vegetarian, and made sure to entice me with particular veggie friendly options, including roasted beets, mini mushrooms and the burrata. One potential negative is that dishes are quite small, and you can often get glazed over for seconds, unless you make a special request. I don't think there was one dish that was AMAZING, but I have to give the restaurant credit for keeping originality alive. Rarely, if ever, does an institution move into SF embracing a forthcoming legacy like State Bird Provisions.Humble shades from the owners and a distinct ethic of allowing the food to thrive leaves guests of this establishment leaving with a sense of wonder. Imaginative, thoughtful, and integrative - the full circle experience at State Bird is one of a kind.We arrived at the early onset of dinner, around 6, mid week and found stools at the bar. The absolute best seats in the house. Front row to the 10 digit wizards.State Bird Provisions is a modern take on dim sum. Small dishes pirouette through the down to earth interior leaving you with a constant strain in your neck. Arriving hungry will leave your first few minutes loading your table like a carb to a diet.Highlights:The fried garlic bread with warm burrata is decadent. Every piece of warm dough clings to the healthy portion of burrata which nests in the middle of the dish as the diva.The duck liver mousse with almond biscuits were a perfect in between. Rich and eloquent, the mousse has a back of the mind saltiness that allows you to truly appreciate the miniature biscuits.We couldn't miss the namesake of the establishment, so a half order of the State Bird was easily ordered. Crisp, well portioned, and a finger fighting plate.Came in with very little expectations, but left knowing that one of the best meals in San Francisco can still be affordable, organic, and up to par with the heavy hitters within the walls of our 7x7 city.By far one of the best restaurants in San Francisco. Go. Eat. Enjoy. my friend and i came for dinner last night, and it was great.  i've been wanting to try it but didn't make a reservation, so i was worried that the wait would be horrendous.  the place is tiny, so there's not really any space to wait.  the host told us that the wait would be about 30+ minutes, so we went to fat angel around the corner for a drink first.we came back, got another drink and still had to wait another 45 minutes or so before getting seated.  luckily we came early, so by the time we sat down to eat, it wasn't too late.to start, the chef gave us some eggplant fries that were delicious.  we seriously ordered everything in sight.  we got the ribs, beef cheeks, salmon, corn pancakes off the menu.  we also got a couple items off the cart.   i was STUFFED by the end of it, but we still had room for chocolate pudding.  luckily the pudding wasn't that big.  my fave dishes of the night were the beef cheeks and ribs.  if you can come w/ more people, then you can try more things.  i like that you can order small or large sizes of dishes so that you can get a taste of everything!"|5|100|0|Routine|This inspection has no violations.|GOOD: no inspection needed
State Bird Provisions 3|4.5|Tapas/Small Plates in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|1051|3|4.184523809523809|" Restaurants of the moment are like farts in the wind: one must be at the right place at the right time to experience their essence. I found it auspicious that Bon Appetite magazine declared State Bird Provisions their restaurant of the year for 2012 and that I happened to be binging my way through the San Francisco restaurant scene.I was not at all daunted by my lack of reservations and you shouldn't be either, unless of course you insist on dining with your coven of foodie friends - Provisions is a tiny restaurant and due to the present buzz getting a seat here will necessitate a lot of planning or a lot of waiting.  I chose to wait, not in the cramped space along the wall, but at Yoshi's down the street enjoying some smooth jazz and bubbly.  The text from the courteous host came much sooner than promised and when I arrived back at Provisions I was promptly seated at the counter.This seating arrangement, which overlooks the open kitchen and the energy and élan of the chefs engaging in their mesmerizing sautéing, grilling, and assembling, can best be described as cozy.  One has no choice but to engage with your neighbors since there is literally no elbow room between diners; hopefully you will be seated next to someone that is equally as engaging as you are.  The small dining room is quite spare and rather boring, the furniture modish and predictable, and the tables nearly as closely spaced as the uncomfortable steel stools which ring the kitchen, and upon one of which my large ass was installed.So why put up with all this nonsense?  The food of course - the impressive, outstanding, brilliant food! OMFG! Yes I am too old for that type of tweeny lingo, but it encapsulates my reaction for what was one of the best meals I've indulged in this year.  The food is sophisticated without being at all pretentious; don't expect engineering marvels which try to emulate leaning towers of food sculpture or Pollock like squiggles of sauce dribbled across plates meant to suggest cleverness and elegance.  Rather the elegance and refinement come from the taste sensations in each bite.  Don't get me wrong, the visual appeal is all there too, but the flavors and the aromas are what distinguish and elevate the food.The way Provisions works is also intriguing.  One can order from the menu but even more exciting is the constantly changing little dishes which are enticingly paraded in front of you by roaming servers on trays or carts where you get to pick and choose which dish most appeals; the only anxiety you will have is that they all will.  These little bites are packed with flavor sensations that will please and challenge your taste buds and blow away any assumptions you may have previously had of what it means to dine at a temple of haute gastronomy.  This style of eating is fun, casual and allows one to sample a wide variety of dishes.I loved the quail, which is described on the menu as the CA state bird with provisions. Yes it is fried, which of course means that I would automatically love it, but it had such a wonderful crunchy bread crumb coating that remained crisp and it was topped with shaved parm; wow this little birdy of a dish really does sing.  Next up, the Guinea Hen dumplings with aromatic broth; wow, just wow! Two little raviolis stuffed with the meat of another bird and then at the last second the server pours over the most astonishing broth of preserved Meyer lemon and over 30 other aromatic herbs and spices.  I can't even describe it; you just have to get it.  I dropped my spoon and lifted my bowl to slurp up the last remaining drop of this heavenly elixir.  To me, the most revelatory dish of the evening.  Then the cumin lamb with scallions, grapes and zucchini. The arrangement was of shaved lamb, like a gyro, but with the juiciness still intact and the flavors of the Mediterranean out front for my enjoyment.  The lamb was sautéed with delicate zucchini, which was still in its fledgling state with several buds of the flowers just about to bloom.  Delicious.I couldn't stop, so I ordered one of the pancakes. Again the description defies what is delivered.  The menu reads as follows: local boquerones, yeasted-sesame pancake, crème fraîche.  What you get is the freshest of anchovies on top of a curiously, light and fluffy sesame covered bready round shaped disc.  Oh yeah, there are slivered radishes atop as well - this is not an afterthought but a textural foil for the rest of the composition. I did have dessert too; I ordered the double chocolate pudding with plums and birdseed crunch.  The plums were served atop the pudding and were a tart counterpoint to the sweet pudding underneath.  Off to the side was the crunch - a chocolate treat reminiscent of a thin rice crispy treat with a nice crunch to it and a lot of chocolate flavor and a textural contrast to the smoothness of the pudding.Stuffed and happy. Thank you State Bird Provisions. I look forward to your next restaurant. Giving this four stars only because I've tried just a few of the menu items. It might very well be a five.Stopped by on a whim late on a Saturday night and got on the list for the chef's counter. Was told it was a three-hour wait. This was just a few days after the Bon Appetit coverage, so I was very surprised that the wait turned out to be only 30 minutes.The chef's counter is where it's at. This restaurant being what it is, the chefs, who double as order takers, are all hip and pretty, and are happy to answer questions about the dishes you're eyeing. They were a little pushy with the special, but did it in a way that I felt bad for them that I didn't want to try the gigantic sardine.Had the green garlic bread with burrata, which will make all other garlic breads disappoint me for the rest of my life. The eponymous bird was awesome but small; next time, I'll get the whole order instead of the half.You go here for the food and the experience. The concept will continue to be copied (they're certainly not the first ""western dim sum"" place), but if they continue to keep the menu inventive, they'll do just fine. 'Sophisticated Dim Sum'I'm a huge fan of the dim sum model that State Bird Provisions is using. They also have a menu which you can order various small plates from. However, what makes this establishment far beyond a tapas style restaurant is that there is a 'cart' going around where you can pick various dishes from. They simply mark what you pick from the 'carts', and everything is pretty straight forward.The overall offering at State Bird is really well rounded and makes you feel that have the ability to enjoy an incredibly diverse range of dishes. The pork and faroe with egg was meaty and delicious. We also really enjoyed the tuna crudo, as well as the tomato w/corn and smoked salmon salad. Our only 'issue' and it was really not a complaint by any means was regarding the ribs and the lamb. The lamb could have been a little bit more tender, and the ribs possibly a little less fatty. That being said, they were so well flavored and accompanied by such tasty ingredients that it was really not a big issue for me. I highly recommend this place for a date or a SMALL group.  It's a fun and refreshing experience and there is such a variety of small plates that any picky eater can find something to satisfy their pallets. Also, I felt that it was a very reasonably priced business model. Each plate is 6-10$ and 2 people can easily get full on 4 plates.This place is fairly small and cozy, so don't plan on showing up here with a 10 top anytime soon!PS- 5 STARS FOR THE FRIENDLY STAFF!!. Even the chefs smile and greet you upon entering! Treating guests in such personable fashion and not trying to be some dis-attached 'foody expert' with patrons is something that can be hard to find at times. I had somewhat high anxiety for a number of reasons -#1.  Securing an online reservation took several attempts. Tip: I made it on a Monday for Friday at 5:30pm of same week.  Wide open.  Lots of times to choose from.#2.  We arrived at 5:30pm when it opened to find a line stretching 20 people deep.  Mixed of folks with/without reservations.  Very confusing. We had to jump past some folks to reach the host.  Finally sat down at 5:50 pm.  I apologize if I inadvertently cut in front of anyone who also had a 5:30 pm reservation.#3.  Once seated, waited again before our server came over.  She explained the dim sum concept and the boarded items.  She took our drink orders and then we waited some more to see what might come by.I like how the dim sum concept has been westernized.  Carts or trays of small plates. You can yay or nay to any item.  The price of each plate is identified so no surprises.  Pros - 1) fun. 2) various food items; freedom to select or not from carts and trays.  3) the ability to order off the menu also.  This is where the state bird offering is.  4) fresh seasonal items 5) yin and yang food ingredients.Cons - 1) an item may not reach your table so then you have to wait to see if it'll come around again during your dining interval. 2) The haphazard check in process at 5:30pm when the place opens.  I know folks w/o reservations are trying to get one of the counter seats but it's organized chaos.We were very pleased with everything we consumed.  The hightlight was the state bird = quail.  We started with 1/2; then order another 1/2 later on. The second time was better cuz we knew what to expect.Nice service.  Friendly staff.$82.00 food and drinks before tax and tip. Amazing food, great visual feast for the eyes and stomach.  LOVED being able to see, pick and choose items as they come by freshly prepared.  Great service.  All of the staff are amazing, kind, friendly and talented. Walked in on a Wed night around 6pm and was lucky to nab a table for 2 right away (after that a line started forming).  Wait staff was very attentive, kept refilling our water and wine and making sure we had everything we needed.  Food I remember and enjoyed: fried bread w/ burrata, avocado w/ seafood salsa, marinated beets and goat cheese,  duck liver mousse w/ almond biscuits, salmon and roasted corn dish, and tuna crudo.  There were a couple more dishes, but I cant remember them, so prob not worth the mention.  We also had a bottle of grenache.  After tax/tip, we spent about $55 pp and were stuffed. Never got around to ordering from the plated menu because the carts were intriguing enough.      Very memorable experience because of the service and the fact that we didnt have to wait hours to eat (as is many people's experiences).  Bummed we were too stuffed to try some of the desserts since the Yelp photos make them look amazing.  Just means I'll have to go back. Fancy Schmancy hipster cuisine. 3.5 starsItems ranged from super amazing (the burrata thing) to not memorable (sorry can't recall :))It was good for a-go but I'm not likely to return unless my husband wants to go (he really enjoyed the food.)The state bird with provisions was good not great and was a small portion although we paid for a large size. Quail is a small bird though...Oh, it took about a month for us to get a reservation for a Thursday night! I did see some people walk-in though.Service was very good. After trying to get in after a show at Yoshi's (Fail), I was finally able to get back and grab a bite.Maybe it's because I was by myself, I found that the service was especially attentive.  I let them know that I wanted to try the qual (State bird with Provisions), and anything else was up in the air.I ended up with 7 item (hey, it's like a tasting menu.  Just better)The quail was really good, as was the cornish hen dumplings.  The farro risotto with farm egg was good, but maybe had one too many ingredients to wow.  They had local sardines (from the day's salmon catch), that was perfect over the potato salad.  The Salmon, corn and heirloom tomato salad, seemed simple but was really tasty!I was going to forego dessert but was told that I really should try the cheesecake japonaise with sherry fis and honey.  At first I figured this was another ""you're trying too hard"" dish, but then I had a bite.  This was perfect.  The cheesecake was light.  The figs weren't too sweet and there was a sprinkling of black sesame seeds over it to give it a hint  of savoriness.  I aslo got the world peace peanut milk.  Okay, it's $2 and it tastes like peanut butter + milk.  If that's your thing, you'll love it.Overall, I think I had two of the line cooks come over and tell me about the food (that's why I ordered som much, I'm sure) and even people that weren't waiting on me were chatting with me (and they had much better things to do).They also have an organization and sincerity, that another restaurant that was on Bon Appetite's list last year (that's in the Mission that serves Chinese Food).  This was a much better overall experience.Make sure to save me a seat at the bar! I do not understand the hype.  The food was somewhat (emphasize SOMEWHAT) good.  It should be amazing if you have to make reservations 3 months in advance.  Some items we ate (that I can remember):- duck liver mousse with almond biscuit- 2 of the pancakes- griddled sweet corn cake, nectarines, peach leaf cream- double chocolate pudding, birdseed crunch, plums Savory,creative provisions. The concept is unique ,the  dishes  truly palate awakening. MUST TRY ITEMS: Try everything :) Bon Appetit named it Restaurant of the Year 2012!  We got to try it before that announcement when it was named One of the Top 50 American Restaurants of 2012!We got there about 5:40pm on a Sat without reservations, the late was 1.5hr, but we were willing to wait this time.  Get your name on their list & they will send you a text & you gotta call them back to let them know you want the table or not.Since we didn't have reservations we got seated at the Chef's Counter - those are for walk-in only.  Stuart, owner, told us to get reservations to call the day you want to go between 2-5pm, maybe they'll be cancellations.There's some dishes on the menu that you have to ask to be made to order, other dishes are on carts or carried on trays.We tried:mendocino sea urchin, ginger, scallion pancake, soy-lime $12 - pancakes with sea urchin on top.  We liked it fine.Cucumber & stuff I can't remember $5 - okCold tofu, cucumber dish $5 - oklamb dumplings - 2 little dumplings in broth $7 (?) - okSalmon & other stuff that looked like cevichePeach pit soda $3 - nothing specialFried quail half order $8 - B. liked it, I took a taste & found it ok, juicy.Green beans, egg salad, crunchy stuff on top $6 (?) - fineSeafood dish w/ chips $9 (?) - B. likes seafood & liked the dish.World Peace Peanut Milk Dessert Shot $2 - tastyDouble chocolate pudding & crunch dessert $8 - tastyOur total before tip $75.95.  Charged it.Make Reservations!  It's The Hottest Restaurant NOW!State Bird Provisions1529 Fillmore St, SF415-795-1272statebirdsf.comHrs: Closed SunM-Th 5:30-10; Fri & Sat 5:30-11 Lives up to the name 100%.  As in, if you like your provisions to be the size that the state bird likely consumes, you will love this place.  - Dim sum style service (although if you peer at the same dish passing by twice, a snarky waitress might just say to you ""you already saw that"", with no accompanying ""would you like another?"")- Quail was exquisitely done, but to say that the portion size was made for sharing is laughable.- Guinea fowl dumpling... fantastic.  Again, ridiculously small portion.  We're talking 2 wee little dumplings here, people.  For $6.  Or was it $9?- They overcharged us for the wine.Left wishing a slice of pizza was on the dessert list.  Won't be back... it would be equivalent to lighting camp fires with $20 bills. One of the best new restaurants that has opened in the City in a long time! State Bird provides a great California-Italian fusion style food in a dim sum format, with amazing service to boot. The dim sum format allows people who love to try everything a chance to do so. The burrata dishes were delicious, pickled beets to die for, and the ravioli so good we special ordered it on our second visit. The service is excellent and they even remembered us from our first visit, including our wine order. This type of customer service is always so refreshing. The only drawback is the reservation system, but for this place I am willing to deal with it. Cloistered in a narrow restaurant space lining Fillmore Street, State Bird Provisions flies high above the San Francisco restaurant scene. They attack your palate with small offerings provided dim sum style as carts and trays pass by your table allowing you to see what they're cooking up that night before committing to it. A couple dishes are offered a la carte including a rotating selection of seasonal pancakes (sweet corn & garlic chive shortstack with Mt. Tam cheese, yes please!) and larger ""commandables."" I took a cautious approach with my dinner at State Bird Provisions as I wanted to make sure I didn't miss out on anything fantastic. The first thing I pulled off a tray was the warm burrata and garlic bread as the creamy burrata was softly melting over a warm, fluffy cloud of garlic bread. This dish remained to be one of my favorites through the night. Everything else I had was really good and several times I thought about pulling another serving of something off of the tray the next time it came by only to be intrigued by another offering. The wait staff was also very attentive even given the style to make sure we were seeing enough things, to ask us about our preferences, and to make sure we didn't want anything else sent out. We closed out with a dessert of a pumpkin seed cake and a peanut muscovado milk shot. If you like peanut butter desserts get the milk shot, it's delicious and a perfect pairing with something else that only sets you back another $2. The creative experience and superb culinary execution makes State Bird Provisions a definite star and worthy of multiple trips especially given the rotating menu and options. Have you heard?  BIRD IS THE WORD... ;)I came here after yelping for new places in SF and from two friends'  recommendations.  The name is cute and catchy. Let me tell you - what a great experience!!! I brought my friend Grace here after work and we luckily made reservations. There was already a long line in front before opening at 6pm. The atmosphere is cute and staff is very friendly. The concept is dim sum style where you pick what you want from trays and carts as well as order from a set menu for other items.We had the ""State Bird Provision"" (deep fried quail leg over a bed of luscious lemony onions), a couple of Kumamoto oysters, seared salmon salad with sweet white corn, potato chips with chicken liver crudo, the sweet corn & garlic chive shortstack pancake with Mt. Tam cream (yum!), seared veggies with roasted nuts and a creamy dressing, a garlic bread puff with melted mozzarella, and an almond ice cream sandwich between chocolate nibbles cookies dressed with the sweetest currants. OMG!!! As my buddy Greg would say... De-Frickin-Licious! :D We also had two glasses of the Nero D'Avola rose, which were perfect. This is my new favorite restaurant! Given the enormous press recognition State Bird has received and the plethora of Yelp reviews, I'm not sure how much I can add, so I'll limit my review to some general musings and tips. (The food, service, and experience was all very good, as evinced by my five star rating.)1. Yes reservations are extremely difficult, but with patience, time, and the ability to be spontaneous, they are quite possible.  For two days straight, I refreshed the reservation page throughout the day and noticed that same-night reservations would occasionally pop up as people cancel.  The second day, a prime time 7:30 spot opened up and I jumped on it.2. I wouldn't get the quail again.  I've had similar type fried quail at other restaurants, and the one here really is not that unique or remarkable.  I definitely understand trying it--it is the restaurant's namesake after all--but there are enough other interesting things to try that I would stay away from the state bird next time.3. Prices are quite reasonable.  The NY times article suggested $70 for two people, sans-alcohol and tip.  Gf and I were ""stuffed"" after $40 pre-tip and sans alcohol.  I say ""stuffed"" because we managed to fit some bi-rite ice cream in us afterwards, but we definitely were very full. 4. The food that is ordered from the regular menu (not dim-sum style) takes a while to prepare.  Order them early so you won't be sitting around waiting for them and wondering how much more of the small plates to order!5. Why did it take so long for a dim-sum styled Western restaurant? So it sounds like I'm a bit of a naysayer relative to many others. Not to say I didn't like it - I did. But it wasn't good enough, in my opinion, to warrant the hype and the difficulty of getting a reservation.  But part of that feeling stems from my not really liking the dimsum format. I really wish all the evenings offerings were listed so I'd know what was coming/available and what to wait for. Without that it's too easy to fill up too fast and regret doing so. We saw things I think we would preferred after it was too late. At least with dimsum you know what's available - here you have no idea. The menu is literally given to you in pieces.  Yeah, it's definitely a different approach, and that's often very cool. But I would much prefer to know all the options before deciding. I will try to go again with my BF who's a much bigger eater (doesn't fill up as quickly) in hopes of trying more and finding more things to love. We had five items: loved two, liked two and didn't like one. I don't think that's a great score for a place that so many say is THE BEST and is hard to get into. Service was fantastic. Atmosphere was good - we sat at the bar which was great. Wine list is cool. Wish they had cocktails. I had heard a lot of buzz about this place and its ""Western dim sum"" schtick.  However, all that matters to me is the food.  SF has a lot of great restaurants so standards are pretty high for something both original and tasty - this place is both.My favorite savory dishes were the ""short stack"" of corn pancakes and the farro/pork belly/pickles, but our cocoa nib/basil ice cream sandwiches capped off the night perfectly.  The other dishes we had were really good as well - and all were not like any other dishes I've had anywhere else.Can't wait to come again. It took us weeks to get in - but mostly because we had to keep changing our dinner reservation for scheduling issues.  So, when we finally went on a Wednesday night - it was with some pent up expectations.Happily, we were NOT disappointed.When we arrived we were warmly greeted by the owner Stuart and his staff and were seated within just a couple of minutes.  The place is small, but hustling and with just the right amount of chatter (energetic but not so loud you have to shout to be heard).We didn't order anything off the fixed menu (not deliberately), just because we were tempted by too many of the dim sum-style, tapas sized dishes that were being shuttled down the aisle by the wait staff.Though all the dishes passed the good threshold - not all of them were standouts or dishes I would order again (as I will definitely be heading back).  The top dishes were the almond biscuits with duck liver mousse (heavenly and so rich), the mouth-watering guinea hen dumplings in an incredibly aromatic broth (this was my favorite dish), the homemade potato chips and truffle aioli, and the  glazed pork ribs with spigarello & togarashi - this last item we didn't actually order - as it's on the menu - but our server had a gut feeling we would like it, and did we!  The meat was super tender, juicy and the seasoning was delectable and reminiscent of cardamon.The other dishes we had were the garlic puff bread and burrata (loved the cheese, but was not impressed with the bread), a scallop, salsa dish and a saute of mushrooms, eggplant, dahl & cauliflower.Oh, and before I forget - don't share dessert - we ordered the double chocolate pudding with pecan crunch and were fighting over the portion.  It was fabulous! Sweet, luscious and perfectly chocolate.Go, sample and enjoy! Wow. My new favorite restaurant. It's all about the food. Had such a great meal and when we got the bill we were shocked. One hundred bucks for two with six beers! I haven't been that happy for that little. We felt a little bit guilty for offering so little what what we got. Wow. Brilliant!  Stuart and his crew shine in this place, serving up remarkable little servings of top-notch gourmet cuisine in the passed-plates style of Chinese dim sum!  Dishes change daily except for ""commandables"" like quail and ribs, which are not to be missed!Reservations are hard to get even a week in advance, and due to the small size they won't take parties larger than four.  There are 10 walk-in seats, for which the line forms a good 20 minutes before opening.  But it's worth the wait!  Welcome to my new favorite restaurant! Loves:-Interior of the restaurant; it's small, but they do a lot with the space and manage to make it feel comfortable and inviting. -Service is very friendly. Sitting in front of the prep kitchen was pretty awesome.-The concept of dim sum with California cuisine. It's a great idea since it gives you the opportunity to try a bunch of different dishes, which allows you to perhaps try things you wouldn't have tried before.-Eggplant: This dish was great balancing game. There was a balance between the soft, mushy interior texture of eggplant and the crispy fried panko? (I'm guessing) bread crumbs on the exterior as well as a balance between sweet, acid, smoky, and savory flavors. -CA state bird: Probably the best preparation of quail that I've had. Previous forays into quail have resulted in poor attempts to eat a stringy, tough to eat bird. This quail was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.-Corn pancake: I am a sucker for sweet corn. Pancakes were very yummy. I am a bit regretful that I didn't try more of them.Dislikes:-Pork belly with kimchi and tofu: Pork belly was tough and overcooked :( . The tofu actually tasted better than the pork belly. I did like the kimchi'd strawberry they had though. -Seafood salsa: Seafood was bland, salsa was nothing to write home about.Okay:-Duck liver mousse: Mousse was smooth and pleasant tasting and wasn't too grainy or metallic tasting the way that liver can be. I really liked the little almond cakes they had with it.-Steak tartare: Good, but not great.I had initially written this reviews as 3 stars, but after recalling every dish that I ate, I remembered that I actually enjoyed the majority of things and so I bumped up my review one star. I think my issue was that I left the restaurant feeling a little unsatisfied, a little underwhelmed. I think I might have been expecting too much in that I wanted every dish to blow me out of the water. I think I was also expecting a bigger variety of dishes to come out via the dim sum carts, but realistically, this is difficult to do considering the cuisine. Food: 4.25Experience: 5 (who doesn't like Dim Sum California food!)Price point: 3.5Overall worthwhile and would return. A fun place for a group to come and partake in an interactive dining experience. The advantage of the dim sum, tapas style is that instead of only tasting a couple dishes off an a la carte menu you get to try 10 or so dishes of smaller portions! Although I think my stomach would have allowed me to try 15 or 20 dishes but my wallet not so much. For that price I would rather do a tasting menu elsewhere.Highlights (5 star dishes) included the Buratta, Fried Eggplant, Marinated Tofu, and PuddingPretty solid dishes (3.5-4 star) were the pancake, quail (although overpriced at $16), and cumin lamb (not as tender and seasoned as I hoped), and ice cream sandwichWord is bon (appetit) Everything has been covered in previous reviews, dim sum/tapas, small creative dishes, and friendly staff. So here's what I had:Garlic Bread with Burrata: Total Heaven. Divine. Perfect.Guinea Hen Dumplings with Aromatic Broth: MehFancy Fried rice with quail egg: YummySalmon Tartar: So-SoCalamari squid lobster thing: No CommentCA State Bird with Provisions: Pretty Damn Good. At State Bird Provision seasonal ingredients are used to create California cuisine served in Dim Sum style. I love the concept, and was impressed by the flavors of the food and quality of the ingredients. I ordered the salmon salad, curry lamb, dumplings, steak tar tar, a farro salad ranging from $5 to $13 and had the nectarine and beets for desert ($3). The food was not warm enough for my taste when served from the cart but when ordered from the menu and delivered by the cooking staff was perfect. The well lit restaurant is brightly decorated with flowers and extremely loud. Something really should be done about the acoustics of the room. I had trouble hearing my friends and the staff had trouble hearing me. State Bird Provisions was amazing! It is like gourmet california dim sum. We tried everything on the cart and each bite was as unique and flavorful as the next. The duck liver mouse, garlic bread with burrata, the pancakes, the state bird provision (quail), the cast iron mushrooms etc. etc....ALL SO GOOD! The restaurant has great ambiance and excellent service. What more could a hungry girl ask for?! Couple of dishes were ok.  But most were too salty or greasy.  Restaurant is very loud due to the concrete everywhere.  They don't do the state bird any justice. Any place south of Geary on Fillmore takes some doing for me, but this place is worth the trip.  Consistent with other reviews, the food carries the day here: interesting, delicious bites to share, passed around dim-sum style.  The food pricing is appropriate, leaving enough flexibility to really sample what the kitchen is up to that day.Highlights for me were the lightly fried eggplant and the mashed potatoes.  The mains we had (pork ribs, signature quail) were strong, but I think I enjoyed the novelty of the sampling more.  Save room for desert too.  Some real thought went into this place top to bottom.Two knocks.  First, the space, which is far too narrow upfront to accommodate the consistant traffic and bar-style seating. Second, the wine list, which on our visit lacked both sub-$40 options and local representation.  To be fair, I'm touchy about SF restaurants that local source everything from their beef to their butter, but utterly fail to sample from the rich, local viniculture.   Harumph! Very solid spot, and surprisingly reasonably priced as 3 of us went, ordered quite a bit, had one drink apiece, and the bill ended up being about $40 per person with 20% tip..  Everyone was friendly and attentive and more than happy to help you with whatever you needed.  I hadn't read any reviews, and didn't really know what to expect.  Turns out it's a small plates type place serving a broad range of california ingredient driven cuisine drawing influence from several different cultures, served on carts that are wheeled around the cozy dining room much like a dim sum place.  The service style certainly adds to the fun factor, and as with any good restaurant, the dish descriptions were equally fun and alluring.  My personal favorites of the evening were the eggplant fried with sungolds and pimenton and the potato, porcini, and hazelnut.  OOH - don't forget the guinea hen dumplings with aromatic broth.  My least favorite dish was the spareribs as they were ok, but a bit charred for my taste (and $20 for 4 spare ribs is a bit ridiculous).Overall a very nice experience and a place that I'd be happy to return to. charming people walking around with pretty trays and carts of small tapas plates is glorified dimsum. it is not a novel concept. now that that's out of the way...i had been wanting to try this place for a long time because i had heard so many great things about it, but i really don't see what the hype is all about (although i DO love that they have a lot of creative dishes made with fresh and organic ingredients). the dishes were kind of hit or miss - they either had little flavor or tons of it. the service was also painfully slow. i honestly didnt know who our table's server was and we had to keep asking for more water and had to ask several times about the tea we had ordered. This place was amazing... definitely a place you should take out of town visitors. I can't remember anything being subpar. The pate was amazing and prepared very differently than what I'm used to. I know their signature was the quail and it was pretty good, but I preferred the smaller dishes to the larger ones.  My suggestion is (as you are walking in) to sit on the left side. Those people get served first because the waiters walk in a circle. We were on the right side and got served last. I mean eventually the food made it out to us, but I think it is much more fun to be surprised by the food than to watch other people get to pick what they want first. Went there the other night for dinner.  Was not a good first impression.  The restaurant is a cross between a dim sum restaurant and a tapas bar.  The melon mint soda was refreshing, and the ice cream sandwich dessert was delicious.  I would highly recommend trying those two.  But the savory dishes weren't as memorable and were somewhat overpriced.  A majority of the dishes lacked flavor, and presentation was decent.  I do not recommend ordering the ribs off the menu.  A full order is $20, which comes with 4 ribs.  If you are going to spend $5 a rib, I would recommend going to a restaurant that specializes in ribs and does not serve ribs where the cow seemed to have been on a diet.  To the restaurant, it would also help if instead of telling your guests ""aromatic broth"", tell them what's in the broth itself. Wow. Was looking for something really special and different for a couple of suburban escapees on date night, and was excited to try it based on the reviews. State Bird doesn't disappoint. The food was delicious and the service very friendly & prompt without being pushy. So good, it inspired me to finally make a Yelp review.As noted by others, the space is small in a comfy way, and reservations are key. When I first checked, there was nothing avail for 2 weeks. The online system through urban spoon is pretty efficient, and after checking a couple of times in the day, we landed a table for that night. I really liked that the hostess called later in the day to confirm and was gracious in taking time to answer some questions. Right when we walked in the feeling was relaxed and friendly. Nothing pretentious here. There are great, detailed reviews from others that cover the food - and it's true, everything we tried was sooooo good. The tuna and quinoa was yummy. I loved the guinea hen dumplings. Also, there's a nice tea selection, which is a good complement to the dishes. I can't say enough about the people though - super welcoming and nice from the minute we arrived til we left thanking the chefs.  It was perfect for a late night dinner after a movie (easy walk from Kabuki), though we might have needed at least one of the larger plates if we were there for a regular dinner. Can't wait to go back and find out.Go and enjoy. Probably one of the best experiences I've had at a restaurant ever.  The vibe from the kitchen and the servers was so nice and welcoming. We sat at the bar and had the best time. Everything was delicious. Get as many items as you can that aren't on the menu. And if it's sounds weird, it's probably amazing. Cool concept and fun, however, it took quite a while for me to actually feel full. Each small plate very unique and delicious. I loved the fresh seafood salad with nachos as well as the ravioli. They only give you 2 small ones so it leaves you wanting more. At $5-$6 bucks per small dish it adds up. My friends and I ended up ordering 2 $50 of Pinot and the experience was cool but I'm not so sure this will be a regular spot for me. Mother of GOD.That was the phrase that I kept uttering/moaning during our meal.  My BFF and I arrived at 7 PM for our reservation.  We were seated at the first table in the middle of the room so all the food passed us by right out of the kitchen.  Prime location!We hadn't eaten since our 11:00 AM brunch that morning so we were primed for a great meal.  However, we ended up getting a SPECTACULAR meal that left us totally speechless and blissed out.1. Fried Garlic Bread with melted Burrata.  it was like crack.  Total Crack.  Couldn't get enough.2. Fried eggplant fries topped with chopped sweet tomatoes and a lovely vinaigrette.  The best eggplant dish I've ever had.  Mopped up the leftover sauce with the above garlic bread.3. Steak tartare on top of a porcini aioli sauce with fried potato chips.  One of those ""I only get once this in a while"" indulgences - phew!  Glorious. . .4. Cumin Lamb with figs, zucchini, pea vines and green onions.  Thinly sliced perfectly seasoned Willamette lamb (sliced off the shank).  Our fabulous server Megan said it was her favorite so we had to order it.  It rocked our world.5. Buttermilk soaked fried quail on top of a lemony onion jam sauce.  Meaty crispy saucy heaven.8. Apricot  & Vanilla Ice cream sandwiches (the almond meal cookie has the toothiness and texture of french macaroons) - pure summer sinful yummy-ness.My BFF and I had such an amazing meal that we would burst into fits of laughter and giddiness from the food buzz we were experiencing.  We were completely besotted by the care/love put into each dish and inspired flavors.We also adored the staff -- they were sassy, engaging and funny.  It felt like Christmas each time they walked by with a new offering.  Ooooh!  Clapping hands and bouncing in our seats like little kids.  After our second dish, we were already plotting  when we were going to come back.  We both felt extremely lucky and grateful for our culinary experience.  Mother of God!  It was soooo. . . good. LOVE IT.  20 courses of solid flavors.  :-Pthe skylight provides natural light for the photo.  +++++ Really enjoyed the fresh approach in this restaurant - sat as a party of four and were impressed with attentive waitstaff despite the novel approach of ""passed dishes"".  The space is simple and appealing, but rather noisy.  As others have noted, the Burrata was popular with all of us; halibut popular with our fish lovers.  Would definitely recommend arranging an evening at this increasingly popular establishment. This is one of the restaurants I've kept an eye on, and it's gotten a lot of good press, but so many times places don't live up to the hype so I'm thrilled to report that this place does.1. Food - Consistently delicious-burrata and garlic bread - generous portion, really good-quinoa and tuna tartar - awesome-some sort of seafood cerviche-state bird chicken - small portion, great chicken, didn't love the 'provisions'-green onion and corn shortstack - highly recommend-farro with egg - this is the only one I didn't loveI may be leaving something off, but almost everything was absolutely delicious. Such unique flavors, combinations I hadn't had before, great sauces, etc. I would have liked to see a salad or two as we felt it was it was starch heavy.2. Service - excellent, surprisingly laid back. I feel like often there are snooty hipster types working at places like that, but everyone was great and down to earth, checked in with us the right amount of time. Even when they called to confirm our reservation, it was nice that they reminded us about Filmore Jazz fest as Filmore street was closed that night.3. Price - our bill came to $76 before tip. My husband had several beers, i didn't drink, and while we had enough to eat, we weren't stuffed. This is one of the cheapest dinners I've had in SF in a while and while I'm sure we could've ordered more, I was still impressed with how reasonable the prices were for very high quality ingredients.4. I would return. So often, even if I have a good meal somewhere, I'm still like 'crossed that off the list', always wanting to try somewhere new. This place I would go back to b/c everything was good but their menu is constantly changing. Also, it's not a big to-do. We were in and out of there in less than an hour for less than $100 for amazing food. Interesting concept for SF. After reading Phil H's ROTD, I knew I had to try State Bird. He's totally on the money about making a reservation ASAP; I looked online and no good reservation was to be had until 2 weeks out. With that said, there are 10 ""first come, first serve"" bar seats, which you might have to get there at 6pm to even have a crack at getting before 8:30pm. My friend and I actually thought the bar seat was the best in the house since we got first dibs on the dim sum items that came out of the kitchen...SCORE!So you might have heard, State Bird's menu constantly changes. When you sit down you can pick some menu listed items and/or you can take your chances and roll the dice with the randoms that come from the kitchen. Each tray brings a new surprise and the wait staff won't spoil the mystery (shhhhh).My favorites were:- burrata with garlic bread *drooooooool*- beets & rosemary nectarine with goat cheese- potato puree with mushrooms *drooooooool again*I can't promise any of these dishes will be here when you visit but I can promise that you will enjoy your meal. After my brother told me about State Bird Provisions I've been wanting to try this place out. I decided to come for my bday with my family. I was so excited for this place I even read up why they named the restaurant State Bird Provisions.Made reservations for 4 at 6pm. Arrived at the restaurant right when they opened and there was a line coming out of the restaurant. After we sat down the waitress told us how the restaurant works, we can order some food off the menu, and some off the carts/trays as they walk around. Similar to that of a dim sum restaurant.We decided to try as much as we could. We had about 12 dishes off the provisions, 1 item off the pancake menu, and ordered everything off the main courses. I was surprised I actually enjoyed about 90% of the things I ate at here. Everything had rich flavors but at the same time was very oily. For dessert had the ice cream sandwiches and the ""world peace"" peanut muscovado milk. I enjoyed both desserts and the ice cream sandwiches. The ice cream sandwiches even came with a candle which was a nice plus since it was my birthday.Overall I thought the food was a little pricey and the portions were pretty small. There are plenty of other nice restaurants I could've eaten at for $250. Even after all that food I wasn't close to being full. Although the food was good, I'm not sure if I would come back as I already tried about 90% of their items already. Small, trendy, comfortable, dim sum serving style spot with excellent, unique items to offer. 4.5 starsFood: 4.4, Service: 4.5, Atmosphere: 3.5Cost to worth it rating: 4 (very reasonable for the quality of food provided)Return worthiness: yesEve award: best accompaniment to burrata Highlights:- Fun presentation: unlike tradition dim sum, every item had personality and an artistic quality to the presentation - Variety: I love having a bunch of different options to try- Burrata: what I called the salty funnel cake. A thick puffy rolled dough underneath the typical creamy cheese. Our favorite of the night. It came by towards the end of the meal and though we were stuffed, we were so tempted to get another.- Liver mousse with mini corn muffins (not the technical description, but what I got out of it): mousse was light and airy and corn items slightly sweet.- Mussels and scallops: mixed on the spot in a tomato base placed on top of guacamole and tall tortilla chips. Scallops were so soft and fresh I adored them. I'm not into mussels, but these were missing that briny fishy sea taste- Eggplant hazelnut zucchini: thinly sliced green vegetable loosely spiraled and put on top a eggplant purée. Hazelnut bits made the dish- Clams and tofu in a kim chee broth: cute oval cast iron/hot pot looking bowl housing these items. Again fresh seafood and the broth didn't overwhelm it.- Ribs: fall off bone HUGE and great flavors- Wine: by class sparkling followed by a red I asked the waitress to serve were both great.Midlights: - Fried green tomato: not bad at all but compared to the other items that were outstanding, via grading it on a curve, this makes it in my midlight category. The cheese sauce it was placed on top of was great.- Pancake: we got the pork onion one which was bit thick and not packing enough flavor for me- Chocolate dessert: was a bit unappetizing on delivery being unevenly chunky and all brownLowlights- With no menu of the passed items, don't know what's coming, so it's hard to save room for what you might like best- Harder with 2: would be more fun with 4. Unless you're like me and just order everything I want even though there's just the hub and I--and he doesn't even eat a lot of things.Was glad to stumble on this spot, thoroughly enjoyed it, and would love to come back Dim sum style in an American restaurant?  Say it ain't so.  That's how State Bird operates.  They bring dishes around in a try or cart and you choose whether you want it or not.  They do describe the dish a bit more to you such as quinoa with tuna tartare with a so and so sauce instead of pork dumpling.  We ordered a plethora of dishes to try such as but not limited to fried quail, fried egg plant, red trout, pancakes, crab meat with potatoes, baby back ribs, cocao nib ice cream sandwiches.  Since there were so many dishes (four of us to share) but we only got a bite out of each one, it's really hard to remember what and how each dish was.  I will say what impressed me was the flavors majority of the dishes brought.  You get loads of flavor packed into each bite which is what made this restaurant good.  The sesame pancakes with creme fraiche was excellent, as were the ribs as were the guinea hen dumpling.  Since it was my brother's birthday, they put a candle for him on the dessert which was cool.  So why is this place four and not five stars?  First of all, I thought some of the dishes were a bit too oily.  Second reason is for the price of each dish, the portions were a bit small.  The meal for the four of us ended up being $250 which is understandable since that is how much a good restaurant costs when eating out in SF.  However it's still rather pricey as the environment is pretty casual.  I think if it was $150 to $200, it would have been much better value.  Anyway I definitely recommend trying it; it's a new concept and food that is creative and delicious. What a pleasant surprise. Was taken here for a late birthday dinner, and even though everyone in our three person dinner party was at various degrees of sickness, we were not going to give up our dinner reservation.New-American tapas served dimsum style, with a few menu-order-only items. It is a very novel concept and I was already intrigued.We ordered (using the best of my memory):1. Tuna Quinoa Tartare: excellent, the crunch of the fried quinoa was a great contrast to the fresh and delicate tuna, would order again2. Fried Eggplant with Aioli and fresh tomatoes: another great dish, perfectly battered fried eggplant, the aioli was a good creamy contrast, and the tomatoes were a nice pop of tartness, would order again3. Mini-almond muffins with Duck Liver Mousse: I thought the muffins were tasty, but I didn't care too much for the liver mousse, it just tasted like sweet whipped cream to me, I could skip this one next time4. Fried State Bird (off the menu): My favorite dish of the night, perfectly fried and succulent, served with a broth and thin slices of cheese... sooo good5. Shittake Mushroom and Duck (?) Dumplings/Ravioli: Tasty, but I didn't think it was a standout; I could do without this one next time too6. Beef Tartare with Housemade Potato Chips: Superb; we actually thought the chips stole the spotlight of the dish since they were so delicate, thin, crispy, and perfectly salted; the beef tartare went very well... although truthfully the ratio of chips to beef is like 2:1, which though not balanced, we didn't mind so much7. Kimchee Pork Belly: The pork belly was great, the kimchee portion I didn't think was spicy/picked enough to really be called 'kimchee' and didn't go that well with the pork; still worth it for the pork belly alone though8. Fried Garlic Bread with Burretta: Eat fast or the cheese will solidify; decadently good; it was like a garlicky-savory donut9. Whipped potatoes with porchini mushrooms and hazelnuts: Also a standout; the crunch of the hazelnuts wents exceptionally well with the creamy potatoes, and the meaty mushrooms gave some nice heartiness; loved10. $8 Dessert #1, Sweet Corn Pancake with blueberries, ground pumpkin seed, and cream: recommended by our waitress and super good11. $8 Dessert #2: Vanilla Tapioca with Peach granita: also recommended, so refreshing for a bunch of sick people, and the vanilla flavor really stood out in the best possible way, maybe my 2nd favorite dish of the nightThe service and staff was so friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. One of them (the manager?), Emily, who recommended our fabulous desserts and was especially accommodating, was the highlight of an already great meal. I'd give her a 6th star if I could.I will definitely be back and bring guests to State Bird Provisions for the great food, unique experience, and excellent service. The name is what threw me. I heard it was good, very good in fact, but that name made it sound so trendy in an Audubon Society kind of way that I thought I'd wait and read the reviews. Then of course, the New York Times praised it to high heaven a couple of weeks ago, so it was time to go. By sheer luck, there was an open table available last Thursday, so Jamie W. and I decided to forgo the Soup Company and splurge a bit on a school night. It's a surprisingly modest-looking place, smallish, in the struggling Lower Fillmore area, but what immediately strikes you is the open kitchen and prep area where chefs Stuart Brioza and Nicole Krasinski and their staff were busily preparing all their specialty dishes in full view.I knew almost immediately that this was going to be good. To experience a wide variety of their special delicacies, Brioza and Krasinski smartly decided to take a tapas approach. You can either order à la carte off their plank menu which gets stashed under the table, or from a cart or a large tray dim sum-style, where various small dishes are offered in the $5 to $8 range. Or you can do it like us and order both ways in order to try as much as possible within one meal. A lot of tempting choices, but we knew we had to tackle their signature ""Commandable"" dish, the $16 CA State Bird with Provisions, which is appropriately a crispy spiced quail piled atop onions stewed in lemon and rosemary (see photo).It had been so long since I had fried chicken that it was the perfect bite to have at that moment with the puckery onions a nice counterbalance to the crispiness of the quail. It was over all too soon. The next dish was a bit more exotic, the $14 Cumin Lamb with Scallions, Figs and Zucchini, stir-fried and casually flavorful, it was easy to devour (see photo). Complementing the two protein-dominated dishes was the $12 Cast Iron Mushrooms, Eggplant, Dahl and Cauliflower, a hearty veggie mix simply executed and perfectly savory (see photo). Throughout the meal, the cart would stroll by with all sorts of delectable items or a waitress with a big tray would present another trio of dishes. It was all becoming quite overwhelming, especially on a school night.But we wanted the full experience and  grabbed the $5 Guinea Hen Ravioli in Duck Broth, which was just a couple of bites for the both of us but still quite a treat (see photo). We also tried the $6 Ahi Tuna Tartare which was mixed with Quinoa (see photo). The contrast in texture and flavor was nice, and it was almost like having a Hawaiian mini-poki salad. Even with five dishes under our belts...literally, we still felt a need to try their $8 desserts. Both were splendid. The first was the Sweet Corn-Coconut Cake with Blueberries and a dollop of Buttermilk Cream, a homespun treat that wouldn't be out of place at a county fair (see photo). The second was even better, the Cocoa Nib-Verbena Ice Cream Sandwich, cut in quarters, with Blackberries (see photo). The perfect ending.FOOD - 5 stars...incredible variety, great batting average on flavors and a sense of culinary adventure uncommon even in this city...and I didn't feel stuffed at the endAMBIANCE - 4 stars...casual and not too noisy considering how busy they wereSERVICE - 4 stars...attentive and informedTOTAL - 5 stars...truly unique and the tapas approach lets you try more than you would expect for a little over $40 per person Thought the quail was outstanding. all of us agreed that everything else was underwhelming and a tad too salty. Can you say yum? Brilliant concept + fabulous food = amazing experience. Just go - it will blow any other restaurant away... Meh. More like 2.5 stars. Whimsical concept, liked the idea of dim sum for California food. We tried 5 of the ""floating"" plates. I found the dishes innovative but unfortunately the flavors were quite forgettable. The pork belly with kimchi for example - have you ever had kimchi with absolutely no heat? or any pickled flavor? or pork belly with no crisp whatsoever? It was cabbage with fatty pork. Oysters were blah. Burrata on garlic bread - which is a dish even I couldn't mess up - was a huge disappointment. Didn't have any salt (which it needs) or olive oil (which helps it), and the garlic bread had no garlic. The pancakes with Mt. Tam were wonderful - and tasted just like warm Mt. Tam cheese. On the plus side you can start eating as soon as you sit down which is wonderful if you're hungry. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Note for anyone considering this for a date spot: do you want to be interrupted every 2 minutes by someone carrying a tray of food describing the contents therein? F*ck. Yes.Tapas / dim sum, only with New American cuisine? Winning.There are two ways to order:  the hot stuff (pancakes, most meats, delectable desserts) are made to order. The rest is carted around like dim sum. Vegetarian must-haves:Sweet corn & garlic chive ""shortstack"", with mt. tamGarlic bread with burrata Shaved squash with charred eggplantMarinated vegetable egg salad, nuts & seedsI can't wait to go back! Came here last night (Tuesday).  Had reservations thankfully as there were already people gathering to get in.  I was VERY excited to try this place with all the rave reviews, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations!!  Everything was so unique and delicious, and I really liked the set-up of menu PLUS dim sum style. Was difficult to not get every item sent around.Favorites... simply delectable:- Tuna tartare w/ fried quinoa, tomatoes, greens and aioli - Sweet corn pancakes with Mt. Tam cheese - Porcini mushrooms over whipped potatoes and hazelnut crunch- Farro with a slew of things you mix together (can't remember, but it was my tablemates' favorite)- Beef tartare with porcini aioli and porcini dusted potato chips- Dessert: ""ice cream sandwich"" YummmmmAlso good:- burrata with fried bread- squash/zucchini over an eggplant pureeWouldn't get again:- Guinea fowl dumplings- Ribs off the menu (fatty)So much more I want to try - will be back SOON! Please sprint to this restaurant.  Clever, inventive, and every bite of everything I ate was extraordinary. Excellent service. 3 1/2 stars. Served like dim sum style. You can also order off the menu for certain items they don't walk around with. Some of the food was a hit and miss. I think I expected much more because of the hype, but I am really glad I tried it. oysters on the half shell-they were fresh, but I had betterwhipped smoked trout, peas & mint-way too many peas, don't taste the mint, and the whipped trout you can't really taste. I did like the very crunchy crutons that came with it.tuna tartare & quinoa with bonito-rosemary aioli-very refreshing. I don't usually like quinoa, but went really well with the tuna to give it that crunchduck liver mousse with almond biscuit-love, love, love. The biscuit was so moist and to add the liver mousee just made it even tastiergarlic bread with burrata-eat quick cuz the cheese gets hard, but this was goodhaas avocado with seafood 'salsa' -gross. all you can taste is salsa from the jar. kimchi-pork belly with tofu & clams-very comforting. I wanted more.Things we ordered off the menu:sweet corn & garlic chive ""shortstack"", with mt. tam-so good! What isn't good with corn and garlic, but wish it was a little more crispyCA state bird with provisions-fried perfectly. The batter was so good and the bird was tender. Must try this!cumin lamb with scallions, dates & snap peas-I dont eat lamb, but my friends said flavor was good, but way too oilycast iron mushrooms, eggplant, dahl & cauliflower-colored pickle cauiflower with smoky mushrooms, which was really good, but the egg plant was blah and very soggy. No room for dessert. Staff was friendly and it was fun trying new things, but I wouldn't come back. My new favorite restaurant. SBP is creative, inspired, interactive, and fun. In my opinion, it represents all the best qualities of what San Francisco dining should be and is an example of why SF is such a great food city. The space is sparse and unpretentious. The service attentive but casual. And the food was thrilling and inventive. Sure, not every dish was perfect - but when you are out there on the edge trying new things, I don't expect bull's eyes every time. I would say 70% of the dishes were outstanding, 20% very good, and 10% were so-so. There are definitely some must tries if they have them on the night you are there: the garlic burrata bread (transcendent), the seafood ""salsa"" (chock full of perfectly cooked mussels and scallops), the ricotta sauerkraut pancakes (sauerkraut salt!), and the zucchini with smoked eggplant and fermented garlic (an incredible, unexpected combo of flavors). We also really enjoyed the pickled, fried cauliflower in the cheddar-beer sauce. We will skip the duck pate and almond biscuits next time (the flavors just didn't jibe for us) as well as the smoked trout spread with favas (ho hum flavors). The granita with tapioca and figs for dessert was excellent. I won't be recommending this spot to my vegetarian friends - it would be pretty tortuous to let all those interesting meaty dishes go by, but as for me - we are booking our return trip for next month tonight! Wow what an amazing experience all the way through.  We had a 5:30 reservation which was pretty early for us but we were out of there and heading home at 7pm which was nice.  The decor inside is pretty cool and minimalistic but we really liked it.  It's pretty small inside but they make the best of the area for sure.  We had so much food I'm not sure where to begin.  Everything was really tasty and the tuna tartare was my favorite. We also had the duck pate cornbread, burrata garlic bread, preserve wonton with mushroom sauce (my wife's favorite), puree avocado tortilla with a scallop and mussel salsa (loved the salsa), tuna tartare with quinoa salad (again my fav), smoked potato salad, CA state bird provision (of course we had to get that here - not much meat on this dish though), sauerkraut pancake (awesome but make sure you use the salt), pickled cauliflower with cheese fondue, nectarine with feta cheese and for dessert we had the vanilla saffron ice cream sandwich with blackberries and the double chocolate pudding (so smooth) and a chocolate crunch and raspberries.Delicious meal and service and we'd definitely come back. This place is fan-funghing-tastic!  Wonderful ingredients, smart balance of them and perfectly cooked and well seasoned.  I am a huge supporter of this concept and place.  The chefs efforts are appreciated within the community and it shows.Ideal for sharing, tasting, conversing and enjoying what real food tastes like. Right as I rode up on my bike I realized I had forgotten my bike lock. Shat! Luckily, the kind folks at State Bird Provisions are awesomely nice and let me stash my bike in their storage hallway while we dined. What a wonderful first impression!Then, from start to finish it just kept getting better and better! The service was amazing - everyone we encountered was engaging, funny, generous, and knowledgeable about the food and wine. And the food itself, mmmm... we had a few items from the set menu, and then enjoyed picking several of the dim sum style goings arounds, and all were wonderful. The worst dish we had was good, and the best was incredible. And everything was reasonably priced and in a cool atmosphere. I hope to support this place by visiting again soon, and telling my friends! Highly recommended! LOVE this place! It's not fancy and it isn't very cozy, but the service and the food make up for it.  Plus although bustling it isn't ear-splittingly loud. I've been twice and have loved both visits.  The State Bird (quail) is perfectly fried in a crunchy batter with an interesting pickled onion side.  I also really liked the fried green tomatoes and the trout and the green onion burrata bread. It's really fun to be able to sample several things and still leave room for dessert.  The flavor combinations are new and different, and they also surprise you with different textures. The wine list is small but quite interesting and they have Abita beer on draft! I'm so happy I am walking distance to here... This place is full of deliciousness!  My date and I made reservations a month in advance and I'm glad we did--it's hard to get in here on a Friday night.  It's ""dim-sum"" style, where 12-18 dishes are walked around throughout the night on trays/carts and you can order off them and there's also a menu with other stuff you can order from.  All the plates are small, but meant to be shareable.  Date and I ordered 3 items off the menu, which came out hot and yummy and 5 items from the cart, lukewarm and yummy.  With 2 drinks and dessert, our bill came out to $80.  I was still a little hungry, but I'm on a diet so I guess it's okay. :)I will say that the cost and fun of eating here is way better than eating at one of those schmancy fancy restaurants with 10 courses @ $180/pp.  Here, you get 10 for $80 total and the menu is equally exciting.  I only give 5 stars to places I definitely feel like I would go back to and I'm definitely looking forward to returning. So, the non-foodie Oldman surprised me again! He whisked me away to dinner to celebrate my birthday. Again, I wondered if he was stalking Tyler Florence and found a new TF place to try. No! This place is certainly a horse of a different color. Wouldn't shock me if they start serving horse, or unicorn with a side of cosmic muffin in the near future.The earliest reservation on a Monday night was 9:30pm. Or, take your chances and walk-in and wait. So, he decided to take a chance. As the taxi dropped us off in front of a very nondescript section of the block, we walked up to a pretty tiny looking place... FULL of people, already chowing down in the dining room, or lined up against the wall, waiting... yearning, longing to get a table. We discovered that the wait would be 45 minutes (for silly chance-taking people). So, we lined up against the wall and waited. The more we waited the more intrigued I became. You see, waiting for a table puts one in perfect view of all the hustle and bustle of the kitchen. I couldn't take my eyes off the fast-paced, yet loving way all of the tender little morsels were being prepared. And the more I gazed, the more I salivated and the more antsy I became. Then I started to get a little jealous of the couple standing at the 4-""seater"" counter. Screw it, my inner princess-wanting-a-table gave into the Olman's suggestion and we swooped in on the other two spots to get our grub on!I tell ya, standing at that little counter is THE way to go. The lucky 4 willing to stand will reap the rewards of attaining the FULL menu. You see, when you choose the dining room, you will receive a smaller menu (don't worry, you may see something that strikes your fancy as it floats by your table, dim-sum style). But, standing at the counter will not only give you the dim-sum option, but you may now put in your request from the FULL menu... damn, I felt like a rock star! And, my mouth felt like an Iron Chef/porn star!What I dined on. Read it and weep (this was in late April, so I'm sure the menu is totally diff). I'm getting verklempt. Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - Hey, I saw the word LIVER and visions of not being able to dine on foie gras (legally) come 7/1/12, made me want this even more! I know. My cold heart was only thinking about my stomach. And, it was wonderful. Thank you to the fatty duck. The almond biscuits reminded me more of tender little Madeleine cookies (my favorite- probably kin to a cosmic muffin).Kimchi-pork belly with tofu and clams - served in a mini cast iron pot. Interesting and very tasty combo!Pancakes! Mendocino sea urchin, ginger scallion pancake, with soy-lime - I have been wanting to try Uni for quite a while now, but I've heard stories of funky uni and I was kind of hesitant yet excited. The nice guy (which I'm going to assume was one of the owners) talked me into it. It was buttah! Like foie gras of the sea, atop a savory pancake, drizzled with the delicious soy-lime holy syrup.Green garlic bread - just get it. And, just as I was thinking this would be the next item I wanted to request - poof! Magical chef offered it to us. You see, standing up will also give you first dibs on plates headed to the dim-sum cart! And bam! That's how Mary had her little lamb. Well, I'm going to order that lamb dish next time seeing howz I don't really care for lamb, but I'm sure this place will have me going out of my way to silence some with my fork.I highly recommend. You'll swear you've never had this much fun shoving stuff into your mouth. Holy Crap! I loved this place. Are they tapas? Are they dim sums? Such high energy! I love the DIFFERENCE of the place. The servers were ecstatic and so positive! Excellent chardonnay choice! Try theMushroom dish (it's in a small skillet w/ eggplant) OMG!State Bird w Provisions (quail...yes. YUM!)Simmered cherry dish for dessert!There's so much.What it is is that there are dishes, like the quail, which you can order. I suggest don't pre-order anything. Just do dim-sum style and everything will come to you...pronto. Pace yourself or you will get too stuffed too fast and be out of there too fast! That's fine if you short on time, like I was. I was trying to get to the Symphony! No problem.But getting stuffed kinda crimps your thoughtfulness and comfort! Oh, Yoshi's is just down the street and there's a parking garage across from Yoshi's...as the area is still a bit sketchy.In few words, Go Forth and Have Fun! Overall, very flavorful unique dishes, but a bit $$ for the small portions. I was hungry in just a couple hours and had a second meal even though I feel like I ate a full dinner.Tried:Lemon lime basil soda - pretty on point!Calabrian spiced tofu - tofu tasted like cheese, probably wouldn't recommend this dishBoquerones pancake - soft buttery savory sesame pancake was delishCA state bird - fried quail leg - very small but tasty and fried skin was light and crunchyCoconut ice cream sandwich with almonds and blueberries - one of the best understated items on the menu - *would eat again for sure*Green garlic bread with burrata - cheese was amazingly soft and one can't really go wrong with fried garlic breadMushroom guinea hen dumplings with an aromatic broth - i really liked the texture of the mushrooms, the guinea hen, and the broth was full of flavor (my dining partner wasn't so impressed)Fried green tomatoes with a creamy cheese sauce - great sauceMmm..typing this out makes me salivate, but I think the portions are too small to even share with one other person. You each need your own dish. Simply put, State Bird Provisions is one of the best 'new' restaurants in San Francisco. Believe the hype, it really is that good. Ignoring the cool 'dim sum' system of choosing food,  the unpretentious surroundings and attentive but unfussy service - and concentrating on the food.... The food here is fun and different. Interesting but uncomplicated small plates of flavorful California cuisine with a definite Asian influence. There are dishes here that I haven't tasted elsewhere, and they mix up the 'dim sum' dishes on a regular basis.  That's not to say every dish is a 'hit' but best dishes are absolutely outstanding, and at a non 'fine dining' price point. As I mentioned the food isn't revolutionary.. but has the same extreme emphasis on ingredients and taste as you'll find at Frances. Of course, it's difficult to get a reservation - but go now before they get their first Michelin star and it becomes impossible to get a table within three months! surprised by many of the reviews.  this restaurant is different to put it simply, and absolutely tasty to boot.  while one shouldn't expect the normal wait service or food fare of other establishments, one needn't be scared of having something so out of the realms of the typical dining experience.  to accomplish this while still managing to have a unique and flavorful taste is pretty amazing.convincing dishes: squab dumplings, crisps with horseradish creme fraiche and roe, cumin lamb (typically despise cumin), burrata fried bread (though slightly over-salted, still a fab dish), chocolate pudding (typically do not favor, but this case it was delightfully textured).not that i'm familiar, but this restaurant is exactly my type. Tried out the food here last night. Fun spot and for trying small dishes. They serve about 12-14 small dishes per night (we only saw about 8 circulate in the hour we were there) and several made to order dishes on the menu.  I thought all of the dishes were tasty, but I really liked the sauerkraut cheese pancakes, the quail (state bird), these little sweet corn breads with pate. I like that you can sit down and immediately start eating (just like dim sum)! Overall, food was fun and interesting, service was great. I would come back. Two people for dinner had about 6-7 dishes and we left quite full. Had dinner here tonight and absolutely loved it!First off, when you walk in, everyone (including the owner and head chef) greets you and wants to help take care of you. We were very early for our reservation, and Mary the GM immediately went back, found a table for us, and sat us. As was mentioned in other reviews, it seems like everyone there is really excited to be there; super inviting!As for the food, it was stellar! We especially loved the sweet potato salad, the pork farro with soft egg, the pork ribs, and the lemon blueberry ice cream sandwich. Half of the time, we didn't even know everything we were eating; just that it tasted really good.I liked the ambiance a lot, too; the pegboard wall, concrete wall, and small cafeteria-type feel is kindof the point, and there still manages to be an ambiance! Definitely recommended! Loved the industrial ambiance, loved the food, loved the philosophy. The prices add up though for sure (typical tapas). They win points for having cheap beverage options for sure. We sat at the bar, which was fine, but the service staff didn't pay us as much attention for that reason. I think our server was also playing host, and he didn't seem to have time to give us menus or take our drink orders/give us our bill. I enjoyed it, but it probably won't be a repeat destination. So I was on a first date with a super cool chick (SCC).  I wanted to take her to a fun and memorable place, a regular restaurant simply won't do.  Unfortunately, it is nearly impossible to get a Fri evening reservation.  The rumor was show up at 530pm and they have ""places put aside for walk-ins"".  I have a feeling that it's the counter, not a good idea if you want to impress your SCC.  The advice I got from the person who answered the phone was to check back during the week as cancellations occur.  I bookmarked their website and daily checked the reservation, lo and behold, one week before my date night, a 630pm table for 3 opened up (I only had two people, but I am a big eater, so I took the table for three!).  I got no issues from the hostess about just the two of us and my SCC got a kick out of my antics of getting us a table.The food was pretty good.  I don't remember if any of it was cooked, but there was a lot of food that tasted like cerviche.  They bring around 10 different dishes on trays and offer them up.  You can also order off the menu to enhance your culinary experience.  After about three hours of good laughs and good food, we finally finished.  It was about $70 for two but we didn't get alcohol.  Very good value for a fun experience, not the type of place that you would go to regularly to have a hearty meal, but certainly a place to go for a fun experience and a nice night on the town!  Enjoy! Not worth it... Ah, those hip places with lines outside and reservations weeks in advance. What else could I do but reserve a table and wait for my 6 pm dinner?Very interesting idea -- you are presented 3 food choices with each cart or tray. It would work amazing if the food had yummier look. We decided not to focus on the small dish size and try everything, but vegetarian option - not into vegetables. Well to be honest out of everything I ate I was not impressed with anything. - felt like the food was lacking flavor and ingredients.  I left this place $120 lighter and still hungry...  I'd love to give it another try, but later when they will figure out the menu.... First, the food is 100% amazing. Chef/Owners Stuart and Nicole take a daring approach to flavors and marry them to create tasty and visual masterpieces that dance on your palette. Everyone at the restaurant is great and the service, though somewhat unconventional, is engaging and fantastic! The whole experience at SBP really draws you in to a world of culinary bliss that makes you feel like you are a part of something special. Cute idea, cute ambiance, just plain cute. Not so great for a vegetarian, but they did have some options. We had wine and with three people, the bill came to about $50 person, plus tax and tip. Not unreasonable for a unique experience, but I was hungry a few hours later! This place was great.  Food was tight and the service was attentive but not overbearing.  Beer and wine only so a cocktail accross the street is a great way to kill the wait time.The service style (dim sum passing )  works great.  Overall big fan and I will return to try more items. Great food.  Really.  A lot of attention is given to the ingredients, preparation and presentation.  I had the red trout and asparagus and then several items off of the cart.  The cart is a cool concept because you can grab more food based on what looks good without having to judge from a menu's description.  Immediate gratification... The food is amazing. We tried virtually everything and loved it all. Superb quality, great flavor combinations, and creative presentations. Unique, fun dining concept. Makes for a really fun, engaging dinner out with friends. The service was terrific as well, especially for a new establishment. One of my new favorites in San Francisco. Can't wait to make it back for their brunch. This is he best restaurant for new american cuisine in the City. The ribs here were amazing as was hen dumplings the pork with egg and farro was fantastic the tofu was good the burata with fried peppery dough thing underneath was great and the ice cream mini sandwiches were excellent and the chef was great to chat with. My new goto spot. SBP is a Western style dim sum with servers pushing a cart or carrying different trays of dishes with the price listed. A few times, the servers almost dropped their trays on our table which meant the trays are too heavy or beware of putting your hands on the table. Out of 8 dishes, only 3 were memorable with the pairing of flavors, ingredients, and texture. Recommend the kimchi pork belly, the CA state bird with provisions, and the chocolate walnut ice cream sandwich.Unfortunately, since 3 out of 8 dishes ranked well amongst us, that's a 37% success rate. Definitely room for improvement. Overall, good idea, poor execution. Ill keep it simple. Everyone who worked in this place was super nice. not over the top kiss ass nice. Nice like i would want to hangout with them. even the people in the kitchen made friendly eye contact. The guy greeting us, who i guess was the owner/chef was incredible. checking on us while we were waiting offering us a drink. not that we had to wait long. took a chance while we were walking home, no reservation, and we were seated before we could get our drink order. had to uses some restraint to not order everything, as it all looked great.loves:, Garlic bread burrata, pork belly, seafood salsa, duckliver mouse.So so's: oysters (but iam a firm beliver you shouldnt F with them anyway) sliced duckBad...nothing. it was all good and i cant wait to go back and work the rest of the list.I had beer my better half had two different wines that were suggested based on her tastes and they were both excellent. 2 people, 7 tasting plates, the signature State Bird,  2 deserts and two drinks each and still just over $100 by a couple bucks, so its pretty cheap in my book as well. Gald we were walking home. needed it! Wanted to give this place 5, but the service has some kinks.First, the atmosphere -- love the decor, two walls and a ceiling of pegboard.  It feels surprisingly warm and welcoming, and for a small space, not at all cramped.Our dedicated waitress was absolutely lovely (I think her name was Sarah?) and on the ball, as was the gentleman at the front expediting, who still made time to chat with us. The kinks come in the dim sum service.  We were seated right at the front of the restaurant, but were often totally ignored by the cart and the passing trays, even when our table was totally devoid of other dishes.  Meanwhile, food would be offered to tables where several plates were already being enjoyed.  It kind of felt like we were in a service blind spot.  I recommend asking for a seat near the back, they seemed to get more attention.Ok, on to the food:Of the commendables we had1) the uni pancake     --very generous serving of uni, the soy lime sauce was a great pairing, and the garnish of pea shoots and bean sprouts was a great textural contrast.  We were fans2) the short stack of guanciale pancakes    --not super bacony, well balanced, love the maple flavor of the candy cap mushroom powder.  Total breakfast for dinner and very satisfying.3) the glazed pork ribs   --good, but boring.  They're pork ribs.  Tender, meaty, nice sweetish glaze.  The cooked bitter greens with it were lovely. Of the circulating items we had1) the duck mousse with little corn cakes  --super creamy mousse, not aggressively flavored but definitely duck liver.  The corn cakes were moist and sweet.  Would get this again in a second.2) the smoked trout mousse with croutons, fava, and mint  --the mousse itself was a bit salty, but paired with the unsalted croutons and fava, it worked, since both offset the salt well, but it wasn't amazing.3) the smoked duck breast  --gorgeously tender duck breast, perfectly seasoned, with delicious little bits of potato.  Also a winner4) the guinea hen ravioli with broth.  --the ravioli itself was piping hot with a well seasoned filling that tasted like it had a healthy dose of five-spice.  Sadly, the broth was tepid at best, which detracted from the ravioli.  Maybe they should drop the broth? It felt unnecessary.5) the pork fried (rice? farro?) with pickles, greens, and a poached egg --tasty, but felt like it was lacking salt.  The pickles were a nice touch though --the contrasted with the texture of the egg and the flavor of the rice/farro well. Definitely did not blow we away. 6) the fried green garlic dough with burrata  --Um, it's piping hot fried dough with yummy yummy cheese.  Get this. Dessert:1) Macaron Japonaise -- almond and rhubarb.  Sour.  Not my favorite.2) Ice cream sandwich -- you may be turned off by the portion size but don't be deceived.  These are delicious but SUPER rich.  That portion is more than enough.I know this sounds like a lot of food but some of the portions were fairly small, which I loved because we got to try so much!  Two people, 4 glasses of wine, and all of this for $145 (after tip).  Definitely worth a trip back. After waiting a month for our reservations, I was very excited to come here for dinner.I went with 3 other friends. We brought our own wine ($20 corkage). We split everything offered plus the fried quail & two of the pancakes.Everything was fine but a little tepid. The fried quail was just fried quail, nothing incredibly exciting or enlightening. The pancakes were OK, I liked the one with guacinale the most. The galic bread with burrata was pretty tasty too. Most of our dishes were lukewarm. Everything aside from the aforementioned was forgettable.The ambiance of this place could use some work as well. I felt like with the hype & prices they command, they could at least make their tables un-wobbly and make it feel less cafeteria-like on the inside. Part of eating out for me is the ambiance and intimacy of eating which there was very little of here.We all left hungry after paying about $30 per person. My friend couldn't eat many of the dishes due to a shellfish allergy (they put it in almost everything). I probably will not return here. I wonder if they will continue to stay in business after the hype has worn off. State Bird Provisions is one of the hottest restaurants in recent times.  Reservations for a 8pm spot took one month.  It's been reviewed by practically all the local critics and highly praised at that.  So naturally, my expectations were super high.Although good, I don't think it quite measured up to what I was hoping for.It's a Western-cuisine dim sum joint with many items brought by on carts or trays (the one big difference is that the servers are extremely well-versed on all the dishes and eager to impart this information, unlike the ""take-it-or-leave-it"" attitude at traditional dim sum restaurants).  A select number of items are also available on the menu and brought by only upon request.  A quick recap of dishes:- Duck neck dumplings - quite good.  First dish of the night. Arguably one of the best.- Homemade kimchi in a broth with a clam and tofu - rather bland with surprisingly little kimchi.  Disappointing.- Duck liver mousse with almond biscuits - biscuits were a bit too sweet and the mousse didn't have that much flavor, although it offered a nice savory balance- Oysters with pickled kohlrabi - didn't like this at all ... way too salty and the pickled taste was overpowering.- Whipped trout mousse with peas and croutons - the server raved about this one ... but in all honestly, it was just alright.  The most interesting thing about this dish was the texture of the peas (or fava beans) - tasted more like edamame.- Quinoa tuna tartare  - unique interpretation with crunchy uncooked quinoa on top of the softer cooked version that was mixed in with ahi tuna.  One of the better dishes of the night.- World Peace peanut muscovado - served in a large shot glass, this was yummy (basically peanut milk)- Macaron japonais with rhubarb - nice savory sweet combo but just ok to me.I can see how some might rave about this place and others would be disappointed.  I think this time around, I was in the latter boat. This place is amazing. I took my best friend here for her birthday last Friday.  I booked the reservation through UrbanSpoon ten days beforehand and barely snagged a 10p reservation.  Not an ideal time for dinner, but glad we went anyway.  I did receive a text around 9:30p that the table was ready but we already had obligations.  This place was easy to find and the front is not pretentious.  The open kitchen was casual and people seemed to enjoy working there.  Nobody was stressed because they cook one dish and split it between three plates.  If you order an entree off the menu, they will have the two leftover plates and go around the tables to see if anyone wants to try them as well.  This is ingenious since you get to try a lot more dishes (I love variety) and each dish is something I've never tasted before.1)  Quinoa tuna tartare - we almost passed on this since it was the first thing offered in person on the tray, but we decided to try it.  They had uncooked quinoa sprinkled on top that gave it a nice crunch and the rosemary aoili wasn't overpowering and was fresh and perfect.  This was one of our favorite dishes of the night and was quite inspiring (I'm adding quinoa to my tar tar recipe!).2)  Guanciale and ramp short stack with candy cap powder (and balsamic vinaigrette) - this was pretty good.  The flavors were sweet and salty and the pancake gave it substance so it was to my liking.3)  State Bird with sour provisions - fried quail with a white sauce that was a bit sour for the both of us.  We didn't finish this dish.  It was a flop, kinda like when you're watching a movie and the characters state the movie title in a cheesy line.4)  Braised beef and beet salad with bone marrow sauce ($18!) - It came with four very well executed beef cheeks that were tender and separated with little effort.  The fat from the bone marrow set off the lack of fat on the clean piece of beef.  However, the beets could've been cooked a little more and the salad was a bit flat for me.5)  Whipped trout with fava beans and croutons - This was served in a Korean side dish dish (if that makes sense).  That's why it reminded me of home.  But these flavors did not.  I would skip this dish.  Good for one teaspoon just to taste, but that's about it.6)  Pork farro with ramps and a soft egg - this is their version of bi bim bop.  Loved it.  The greens really set off the fatty and savory pork and the fatter, shorter rice grains were a perfect texture and size to offset that of the pork.  7)  Green garlic bread with burrata (mozzarella) - pretty good but might get you really full.  I wish there was a place that served this dish!  The bread is the shape and form of a cinnamon roll with no cinnamon though and the mozzarella is soft and liquid-like on the inside of the glop of cheese.  There are spices on top that make this dish phenomenal (reminded me of the spices on the Mediterranean bread at Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder in Lincoln Park).8)  World Peace peanut muscovado milk in a shotglass - unfortunately, I ate the ice cream sandwich portion before I drank the milk so it just tasted like lukewarm milk to me.  I recommend drinking this BEFORE you dabble in any of the other desserts.9)  Strawberry granita (grainier than a sorbet), small, white and clear tapioca balls and hard, candied dates - I love dates but not in this dish.  The dates were hard to chew and got stuck on my molars.  The granita was pretty good, but would pass on this one next time.10) Chocolate walnut ice cream sandwich and dulce de leche - this was my favorite since the chocolate was a bit unfinished and tasty.  It came out in finger-like portions and was very good.  Order it! I had the Snap Dragon Iced Tea and it was nothing but regular iced tea, not spiced or anything special.  I recommend the Lemon Basil soda, which was pretty good.The service was excellent.  The Indian gal took care of the bill, but most of the time it was the waiter in the paisley shirt with the curly longer hair or the younger, tall guy with brown hair in all black.  The younger guy with brown hair (wish I got his name to put on this review!), was great with his recommendations and was super friendly (not to mention really cute). Definitely would come back (especially since the menu changes)! 3.5 star rating.First off, service here was wonderful and the concept is a twist from Chinese Dim Sum restaurants.  You are able to order things off a short menu (made to order) or else you can pick things off of the trays and carts that is being circulated around by the staff.I came here with a friend and we got many dishes.  The two standout dishes would be the green garlic fried bread with buratta and the state bird (quail).  Both dishes were made perfectly.  I loved just how juicy and wonderful the quail was and the fried bread and buratta was heaven!  We also got many other dishes from the cart and also ordered the short rib salad with bone marrow dressing and I found that they were okay.  Though the dishes were unique, there wasn't anything special about the flavor.Overall, a nice place.  I wouldn't mind going again since the menu changes and the food is pretty solid.  I just found that some of the dishes were quite overwhelming after hearing such a hype about it. The State Bird is a Quail....!Yeah right, like you actually knew that before. But I bet we can all agree that the state bird is pretty tasty deep fried served with stewed lemon onions and freshly shaved parmesan. Then there's the sea urchin, ginger, and scallion pancake. Not to mention the chocolate creme fraiche ice cream sandwich.The concept here is nice, the service is very nice, the names of the dishes sounded inventive and outstandingly nice, and the rest of our food was... well... um... nice. While everything looked visually appealing and delicious, there was just something missing at times. For instance, the kimchi pork belly with tofu & clams (in broth) tasted a bit disjointed. The pork belly did not fit in with the rest and was better eaten separately. The cumin lamb was ordinary and standard. The pork ribs had a bit of sizzle that tickled the tongue, but at that point I was looking for nice things to say.With the hype and fanfare, I thought everything would be on point. I suppose it's still new and things often grow and change. With the state bird, uni pancake, and ice cream sandwich beckoning for a second trip I'll be back. I was interested in seeing how this place was executing the ""food on a cart"" concept. It obviously reminded me of having dim sum. But these days the dim sum trend has moved away from the chart concept. Overall the concept may be a fun/different gimmick, so I'm interested to see how things turn out. The food was solid. The pork belly and kimchee dish I had was a bit under seasoned. The most creative restaurant i've been to in years!This is a theme park for foodies.Every waiter, server, chef, etc. is excited to be here.  That says a lot about what's coming out of this place.... I've eaten here 5 times and am just getting around to writing a review.  Instead of listing all of the dishes I've eaten, I'm gonna stick to what I think will happen if you eat here (based on my experiences).It's ""dim sum style"" service.....I really like this concept.  Considering the chefs have Michelin Star backgrounds, you can basically tailor a very sophisticated tasting menu to your personal desires.  Feel free to pass on dishes that don't sound great to your tastes...you won't regret it because you could never eat the entire menu.  So, pick well and enjoy.  On this topic...save a little appetite for dessert.  Their pastry program is insane!!!  I lean toward savory but holy sh*t, they knock it out of the park with their desserts.  We've had friends licking bowls....a little embarrassing but booze does bring out the dog in most of us.  I digress...On to cost...there are a few approaches you can take here.  If you have a Fillmore show or movie to catch...you can nail a few dishes and a beer and get out of there lightly scathed since most options cost between $4-$8.  You can also go in a small group (4 works well) and order 2 of everything that sounds good to the group and hit their wine list.  There are lots of interesting wine options under 40 bucks.  This is where the value really is, considering the experience.  The last time we ate this way, we had a couple hour food journey with lots of wine and only spent about $60 per person.  Now compare that to Commonwealth, Sons & Daughters, etc.  I have a hard time separating them when comparing food only.  Albeit, the atmosphere is a lot nicer at the aforementioned restaurants but I don't really rank atmosphere as high when dining out (personally).Alright, I'll put the pom poms down but I really like this restaurant and will go back again soon. The perfect mix of creativity, skill, and laid back classiness can be found here - AND (unless you are a hopeless glutton) it won't cripple your piggybank either!Although reservations FAR in advance are required for a table, showing up early (I arrived approx 40 mins and was first on line outside - sorry for the nose-prints & drool-stains on the window, SBP!) and getting a spot at the chef's bar was by far more enjoyable I think (more on that later)..It seems their ""Provisions"" menu (the part served dim sung style) is always evolving, so what follows is likely just a sample of what to expect:-- Avocado, guanciale & pomelo (bite sized bits - a nice introduction!)-- Halibut tartare & quinoa with bonito-rosemary aioli -- haas avocado with seafood 'salsa'-- duck neck dumplings in sauerjus-- pickled veggies, smoked potato & egg-- green garlic bread with burrataPACE YOURSELF with the dim sung, it's easy to just grab each item the first time it comes around, but that may leave you full faster than you anticipate. The last item there (burrata) was the most enjoyable to watch being prepared; it was in fact a fried garlic bread dough in the shape of a doughnut with the burrata served in the middle. DELICIOUS!I couldn't stand one of the flavors in the pickled veggies and egg (my personal taste, not their mistake), and when the gracious server inquired about my barely-touched-plate, they took it back & removed it from my bill.  THAT is the mark of a restaurant that cares.  The server was so helpful and patient in explaining each dish, the pride in their creations were blatantly evident without being pompous. The ""Commandables"" menu are items you must order and are then promptly cooked. I enjoyed both the pork ribs with spigarello & togarashi as well as the sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancakes. STAND at the chefs bar - not only does this grant you first dibs on the dim sung cart (don't fear, table dwellers - all the dishes are equally perfect quality, choosing last doesn't mean a loss of quality, but choosing first DOES mean you're guaranteed to get stuff before it runs out. They DO keep going around with stuff though, so don't despair!) but standing and watching these careful artists at their work is entertainment enough.  I wasn't even thinking about the burrata until I watched this delicious dough fried up, and after the liberal shower of Parmesan grated that followed, the only thing keeping me from reaching over and just snatching one were the sharp knives in the chefs' hands. Aside from being first-dibs or watching creations, as the pace of the evening slowed down from the hectic prepping and a la carte orders, the staff turned around and were open to conversation. THIS was my favorite part of SBP - upon finding out I was traveling alone from NY, a few staff easily opened up and told their own stories of living/working in the city. The conversations drifted from the demise of Brooklyn (goddamn hipsters), to the Picasso(?) tattoos on their arms, to the thoughts and inspirations behind the selections available that night. During the course of the conversation, I put the fate of my dessert in their capable hands and was not steered wrong. -- milk chocolate sesame crunch with clementine cocoa jam -- chocolate-coconut 'ice cream' sandwich, pecan strudel--pineau des charentes (DELICIOUS butterscotch taste) I love the concept.  I love the funky artistic design (including state birds in the bathroom).  I love $3-5 local beers.  I love going in not knowing what you're going to get and being surprised by interesting combos - some whoah!, some oh cool, yum. Overall, my favorite thing was the textures. Creamy cold burrata on crisp outside chewy inside green garlic roll was my favorite.  I also love the ""standing chefs counter"" where you can stand and eat if you don't want to wait for a table.  Fun short night before a show at the Fillmore. San Francisco dining has coalesced in recent years into a drab monoculture that is an unhappy medium between overpriced American comfort food (thanks, Thomas) and overpriced, oversimple ""French"" country food (thanks, Alice).  The invariable Fried Chicken with Escarole and Guanciale for $25, the odious term ""house made"" prefixing every menu item, the Seasonal Disorder that requires us to eat all the same ingredients in their time -- this is religion, not dining.So I seek to find places that break the mold, if not entirely the orthodoxy.  State Bird Provisions is one such.  Their offerings do suffer from some of the city's nervous ticks about eating; witness the inexplicable obsession with overpriced ramps.  But in general the menu is innovative -- starting of course with the unbelievable, crispy fried State Bird.  It's far more delicious than the not-so-down-home fried fowl dishes elsewhere.Please do not miss the fried green garlic bread with burrata or the silky duck liver mousse with almond biscuits; certainly try the eel special if they have it; do not skip the pork-fried farro with a soft egg.  All of the desserts are great, especially the ice cream sandwich that impressively even outdoes Miette's excellent version.As if the excellent menu were not enough, State Bird Provisions also has a compelling Tray and Cart service: a bit of a ""Dim Sum""-style experience without the terrifying spectacle of Chinese ladies wielding kitchen shears.More impressive than the impeccable cart service is the entryway to the restaurant where the conviviality and sheer beauty of the food come to life.  Although they have sacrificed some curb appeal in placing the kitchen up front, entering a restaurant and seeing the freshest oysters with pickled kohlrabi being loaded onto carts more than compensates aesthetically.State Bird Provisions is substantial and necessary in a dining culture that is slouching towards high-end Chain Restaurantdom.  We need more restaurants like it. Had dinner here tonight. The concept is nice. The servers were nice. The food was...not so nice. The pancake special for tonight tasted mostly of pepper. I bit into a whole peppercorn and that's all I could taste. The trout dish (which was on the menu) was so salty that it overpowered all other flavors....and basically, that was the theme for the evening for the 6 things we got: each dish had an ingredient that dominated and the food suffered due to it. So did our taste buds.I really wanted to like the meal. My friend had to make a reservation a month in advance so there was much anticipation, but also, when we arrived, everyone who worked there just seemed so nice, so I feel bad for writing this 2 star review, but the food really was disappointing. Maybe it was an off night or we just got the ""wrong"" things, but a truly great restaurant is consistent and not ""hit or miss."" I'm glad others had a great experience here. I wish I could say that I did, too. Welcomed with a smile even w/o a reservation. Chefs seem so happy and food was delicious. Pastry chef is adorable and so are her desserts. I had a coconut cake that gave me goosebumps. Concept is neat. Said yes to everything, filled up and during dessert saw all these new dishes come out. :-( my recommendation - take your time and pace yourself,  you never know what might be coming out next! Very interesting concept. Dim sum style in a hipster restaurant atmosphere. Came here on a Thursday night with reservations and there were people waiting for a table. The place isn't large though and there are some counter seating too.So the positives...- Excellent atmosphere- The concept is unique and it made for an interesting experience- There were new food combinations and texture with the small dishes that worked and was enjoyable to taste- Overall good service- They are tapas/dim sum/small plate style I know, but felt the price was a bit high for amount...for example, the kimchi pork belly w/clams was good, but there were 3 or 4 clams and 2 or 3 pork belly in the dish for $9. could have had a few more clams/pork. We had heard that the ""CA state bird provisions"" was their specialty. Cooked well as meat tender and juicy and outside was nicely crispy. However, the ""full"" order had 2 small legs for $16.Overall, I enjoyed the dinner and the experience. I really liked ""Quail with Accompaniments"".  Sorry, I mean State Bird Provisions.Our server was actually the chef owner.  I didn't find out until the end of the evening.  I am always impressed with the food knowledge of servers in high end SF restaurants, but he really impressed me with his food knowledge and enthusiasm.  Someone who is so passionate about his business that he would actually get THAT close to the customer is really inspiring.  Obviously, the service was amazing!!!I love state bird provisions because like Bar Agricole, Bar Bambino, Mission Chinses food, and a few other restaurants, it seems to stand out among the crowd. Every SF restaurant seems to have the same format and the same style of food.  I love cal cuisine, yummy salads, etc., but SF has about 100 of these restaurants.   I like places in SF that try and branch out and be bold and different.  State bird provisions has a very unique yet simple decor.  It has an open kitchen.  It has a dim sum style format.  And it also has standing chef's counter.  All of these things are very unique, fun, and a welcome edition to the SF food landscape.  The crowd is not Marina (which tends to be a bit yuppie), or Mission (which tends to be a bit hipster).  The crowd is just the right mix of normal urban food lovers.The food is simply amazing.The portions are small, but well priced. You get the opportunity to try many different flavor combinations without going broke or feeling cheated.  The food had was an ode to Korean, Swedish, Southern Chinese, Northern Chinese cuisine.  It also had very compelling Modern American/Italian/Cal influences as well. Other people have made specific comments about the food, so I will defer to them. If I had one negative about the restaurant, it is actually the unique format.  I like that it is unique, but dim sum format doesn't work for high end cuisine.  I think of food as an experience or a work of art.  One should contemplate and savor their food.  Pacing is very important to achieving these goals.  At a dim sum style, you see great food pass by and you just want to grab it.  Next thing you know, you have 5 amazing dishes on your table that demand attention.  You don't have time to really focus on the flavor combination of one dish because you have four others in front of you.  This is a minor gripe and can be easily fixed by exercising some restraint. If you have been on the fence about this restaurant, it is time to take a risk and try something different! I highly recommend this place. Came here for a google sponsored event.  This was a very interesting restaurant.  First of all this place is easy to miss.  Very small entrance and a narrow dinning room. So look carefully when looking for the entrance. Second, the food was a combination of spanish tapas, asian and american cuisine.  Just a very diverse menu. The service was great and they have a very good wine selection.Dinner:-duck liver mousse with almond biscuit (Yummy creamy goodness! Must order!)-tuna tartare & quinoa with bonito-rosemary (not bad. nice and light)-sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancakes (it was ok.  I prefer the langos at bar tartine.  Its a nice carb to have at the table though)-kimchi-pork belly with tofu and clams (reminds me of a soon du bo tofu soup)-beef short rib 'salad', radishes & bone marrow  (oh! so tender! I wish this dish was bigger!)-glazed pork ribs with spigarello & togarashi (nice portion of tender meat slides off the bone ribs)Dessert: we ordered all the dessert on the menu but the one that really stood out was the 'rocky road ice cream' sandwich.  Perfect dessert! Chocolate and Ice cream.  How could you say no. I had wanted to try this place for so long that when my BF had a family emergency, I scrambled to find a friend so I could keep the res.  Glad I did: love the concept of dim sum-style food; the vibe (waiters seem like they are having fun, and are competent too).  Only a few of the dishes were stellar, but none was bad, and the total ($96 pre-tip and $34 of it was for wine) surprisingly low.  If it weren't for their ridiculous UrbanSpoon reservation system (c'mon, there is a reason why OpenTable is the standard: it works)...I'd be a regular. Met the fabulous Bella W here for a belated make-up dinner. It was pouring rain with thunderstorms so it just added to the excitement of the meal. Made reservations but had to wait 20 mins. Kind of a downer but we made small talk with the chefs and they made waiting tolerable.On to the food. So we had the following:kimchi-pork belly with tofu and clamsduck neck dumplings in sauerjusmoked duck fingerling potato saladasparagus with pickled egg gribiche, nuts & seeds'green garlic bread' with burratapork fried farro & ramps, red wine braised turnipand a smoked trout dish which was actually one of my favorites. The first two (kimchi pork belly and duck neck dumplings) were my least favorite. The flavors in the first one didn't really pair well (and the pork was a bit overcooked) and there was anything that stood out about the dumplings except maybe the dough.The rest, however, was amazing. Really well executed and we had some helpful servers to give us the lowdown on the food.Looking forward to taking the lady here and some friends for a fun night out.This is a creative way to serve food and I hope it catches on. Really interesting idea and executions. First the easy stuff. The waitstaff was mixed - the servers bringing food were great, our actual waitress had a bit of an attitude. Also, does anyone else wish they replaced plates and silverware more often? They only did for us when we got to dessert. Oh, also the portions are really small. I tend to eat a lot and was in no way full after trying almost everything they offered.Recommendations:State bird with provisions, obviouslyDuck neck dumplingsGarlic bread with cheese (I forget the kind)Tuna tartare with quinoaTroutAsparagus with lentilsTortilla ""salad"" with seafood soup (surprisingly generous with the seafood)Tapioca and ginger beignetsmeh:Smoked and creamed troutAsparagus with egg I loved this place. I had heard only about two sentences about this place before we got there and I hope by adding another good review I'm not making it that I will never get in again but I can't hold in my pleasure of this gem.Our server started surly (but cute surly) at first and warmed up like a cab left to breath, we loved her by the end of the evening. The tap pilsner was a great way to start our meal and the Barbera was bargain as we finished up. The dim sum concept works great with small plates as sometimes it's hard to judge quantity, I'm surprised no one has thought of this sooner. Interesting concept and ingredients.  Many unfamiliar flavor profiles.  I liked, but not necessarily thought everything was delicious.  Loud industrial dining room.  Fun throwback hip hop music.  Servers are on point and quite friendly, even the kitchen staff greeted and bid us farewell.  Recommend:-Ricotta pancakes, savory and quite good.-Duck dumplings, I wish there were more, my favorite of the evening-Clams, pork belly and kimchi, comforting, could have used more seasoning-CA state bird, liked the batter, thick and tasted healthy, succulent meat-Beef cheek and bone marrow salad, deliciously fatty-Jasmine blossom tapioca and ginger 'beignets', tied for 1st place, so good-Choco Szechuan  pepper ice cream sando w/pecan streusel, everything came together for a perfect bite, kind of hard to eat though, b/c the streusel is placed on the plateAlright:-Tuna tartare w/quinoa, the bonito and rosemary were almost nonexistent, which made it almost bland-Smoked trout, the croutons were rock hard, I don't even remember the fish-Pork fried farro, ramps and farm egg, too much acidReally reasonable pricing for this sort of dining, 7 savory, 2 desserts and 2 glasses of wine for $119 including tip and tax. Had dinner tonight at State Bird. Not impressed. Exceptionally dull interior, very nice people, some good food but a total mishmash-- the dim sum dinner concept just doesn't work for me. I really like this restaurant,. but more for the experience than the food. 3 stars for food5 stars for service and creativity of presentation==4 stars totalWhat I liked:- The staff was friendly and accommodating. Our waitress spontaneously suggested alterations they could make in dishes which she thought we might like. - They do a dim-sum style service, where they walk around with small plate dishes on a tray or cart, with a price card standing in the middle. You can decide what looks good at get it immediately- The dishes were creative and tasted good.All in all, it was a very fun experience.On the slight downside: - We had to wait 25 minutes past our reservation time. I do understand that they're busy and popular.- The attractive looking dishes coming by made us eat a bit more than we would have otherwise... clever idea, that dim sum style service!- Everything tasted good, but not over-the-top great. I'll definitely be back at State Bird Provisions and I hope to be able to give them that extra star!Cost: $65 for two, including wine, dessert and one or 2 extra dishes we ordered from the carts! I'm on the fence between a 3.5 and a 4, but since the flavors were awesome and unique I just rounded up.DISCLAIMER! Do not come if you are starved, as the portions are small and it is easy to rack up the bill, especially when things are brought to your table and you're like ""why not.""  Yes, it is completely like dim sum style, where food is brought to the table and you can decide if you want it or not.  Unlike dimsum style, the plates range $7-$10, and each plate is made to be shared among maybe 2 people at most. Must haves and highlights:-Duck liver mouse -STATE BIRD WITH PROVISIONS - the best damn quail I've ever had-Fry bread with burrata cheese and fresh cracked pepperEverything else was just meh...however the clams with pork belly and kimchi really tasted like home cooked asian food. It had great clean flavors. But for 2 clams, and 2 pieces of pork belly, not worth the price when my mama can replicate it. I've never seen a restaurant like this one before! The idea is very clever. American food served like asian dim sum. It's like eating a surprise every time! Waiters and waitresses walk around with whatever the chef makes and you decide if you want to try it or not. If you're an adventurous, experimental fat foodie like me, you'll like this place. The search for the restaurant itself was quite an interesting experience-- it's very discreet and hidden off to the side. Definitely give it a try =) Saturday night was fun and yet, still home by 10!  Met some new friends out for an early dinner.  Prior to this, we weren't sure what we wanted to do or where we wanted to go, but we'd been itching to check this place out since the guy is an office neighbor to the ol' ball n chain.  Gathered up his old co-workers/my new friends and decided to check his new place out.I rarely really know what to expect from a new restaurant.  Whether it's been open for  years or fairly new, I may check yelp or just go in with a fresh palate.  I went for the latter and was pleasantly surprised.  The whole dining experience is exactly like dum sum.  Rather than delicious Asian treats, this was like really good tapas with the freshest ingredients.  In fact, even the fried stuff still tasted clean and light.  We basically decided to get one of everything, some beer, and a bottle of wine.  Price-wise, we ate great for 4 folks and I paid less than what I paid when going out to Range for just two folks.  Hope that gives some perspective for the frugal little man that lives in your wallet.Check this out.  I say go early, get a great meal, hang out in the hood or Japantown.  Maybe even check out some karaoke at Festa (just posted a review on that lil gem). Creative American food served dim sum style... Yes please. Overall my wife and I had about 12 different dishes, they were all pretty good, although none were spectacular. Some highlights of the night:  financier with duck liver moussetofu saladbraised beef and bone marrow saladtuna tartareSmall portion dishes means trying out more different flavors which makes dinging out more fun. I thoroughly enjoyed what Stuart Brioza and Nicole Kransinski have brought to SF. The staff here is also was warm and delightful. I will definitely be back if I can get a good reservation. Highly recommended. You think it's a tacky idea at first, but then you realize that it frickin' works. First off, let me be clear that I write this out of love.  (It takes a lot for me to actually write a Yelp review.)  On food alone, SBP is my favorite new restaurant in the City, and I think one of the best food experiences in the city period.That said, after my last experience, I'm convinced they have some service issues that they really need to correct.  We arrived for a 9:30 Wednesday (the only reservation you can generally get within a few weeks) and waited until around 9:50 to be seated.  Not a particularly big deal, but it would be nice if the host would at least acknowledge it, given that they must know 95% of their 9:30 reservations are because people HAD to book then, not because they wanted to....The real issue was once we sat down and our server proceeded to VERY casually (many older patrons would probably say ""rudely"") explain how because it's late, a few carts will still come around but we should probably just order the stuff we want.  After you've waited 20 extra minutes on an already late reservation, that's a pretty big bummer for the server to basically imply they're winding down, so just forget the primary concept of the restaurant and order.... If you need to start closing up at 10, that's fine.... but don't seat people then and treat them as an afterthought.  Just cut off the reservations at 9.I think part of the issue is that at SBP, the service is always very casual.  My first two visits, this was part of the charm, because it really adds to the fun/whimsy of a blowoff.     Again, i love the food.  All three trips have offered new, exciting stuff that just isn't happening anywhere else in the city.  But regardless of how great the food is, I left feeling embarrassed for the people at how non-chalant they were about pretty crappy service.  I'm sure I'll be back, but I really wouldn't recommend doing the late reservation... and hope the staff isn't reading too much of their own good press to hold themselves to a higher standard than what we experienced the other night. I liked, but didn't love it. Nice industrial space. Some of the food was better than others. The highlights were me were the ice cream sandwich, the lamb, the green garlic bread, and the quail. Found the food a bit greasy. The ribs were not special.The banshee wine was good. I'd go back, but wouldn't fight for a seat! I am disappointed I didn't like this place more. I loved the concept of small dishes and tasting a little of everything. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a WOW dish here.*duck liver mousse with almond biscuit $5 (2 of 5) Not complimentary to my taste buds. I was really surprised this savory and sweet combo was a failure. Each component was great. Duck liver was smooth and light. Almond was light and delicate. But when I ate it together, I didn't like it.*kimchi-pork belly with tofu and clams $8 (3 of 5) I expected a more savory taste from the pork belly or a seafood blast from clams, but neither tastes shined. This small pot of goodies was quite mellow. In fact, I think stewing the contents with the kimchi vegetable chemically made it more bland.*sm. duck, celery root & date salad $6 (3 of 5) Smoke Duck was savory and tasted like strong piece of ham. But I didn't favor too highly with the date pairing. I guess I am just not a dates kind of person. Again, sweet and savory, but not to my liking.*CA state bird with provisions quail (3 of 5) Was like skinny version of buttermilk chicken. Tasty, but not very filling. Delicate dish, but a lot of work, for very little meat.*glazed pork ribs with spigarello & togarashi $10 (3 of 5) It was ok.I really wanted to like this place more. They pushed out little dishes like at a dim sum restaurant and marked up your bill with the different priced items. So cute, but the dishes were just not to my liking... Go right now. This may be my new favorite restaraunt.  Went in for brunch today (no reservations accepted) and was absolutely floored.  Plenty of veggie options. Nested egg (poached egg nestles in green garlic bread) and polenta custard (with hazelnuts, strawberries, yogurt) were absolutely phenomenal. Side of yukon potatoes (a nice-sized portion) and the painperdu (think haute french toast) were equally tasty.  Really nice people work there too. After a spate of bad reviews which I have been forced to write, I am pleased to announce that my last visit to the culinary temple which is State Bird Provisions is unequivocally given the highest marks.  Fancy?  no  Amazing art on the walls?  no, unless you like simplistic mural size yarn art.  Truly unforgettable flavors?  yes!Yes, yes yes!A great approach to small plates dining, emulating the dim sum cart form of service in a fashion which is approachable and pleasant.  Our experience took us through a variety of tastes and textures which were creative from end to end.  Presentation on creative plateware, simple yet attractive plate up arrangement, intoxicating, alluring aromas and spot on delivery with sumptuous flavor.Stuart Brioza and Nicole Krasinski both formerly of Rubicon, have really knocked one out of the park at State Bird.  Aptly they named their signature dish after it, which is a wonderfully coated delicious fried quail served over onion confit, and garnished with shaved Parmagiano-Reggiano.  Love starts here...But the love does not end...The onslaught of flavor comes forth with some wonderful little courses, there is so much to mention.  It just keeps coming.  You'll have to find out for yourself just how good it is, but trust me, rather than me listing out each course exhaustively, just go try it.  Though good luck with getting a reservation these days, its a little tight.    But trust me, if I say the best dish that I had was cured tongue with pickled veggies, then you know the rest is going to be unforgettable!Let the lovefest begin! The only word you need to know here is ""YES"".""Would you like some of _______?"" say the servers as they walk by your table with little plates and bowls full of steamy goodness which are not dim sum.  YES.""Would you like to order ________  off the menu in addition to the things you're ordering straight from the trays?""  YES.""Would you like me to bring you another bottle of ___________?""  YES.""Since you're here celebrating 2 birthdays would you like to order every single dessert on the menu?""  YES YES and YES.  I came, I ate, I drank, I left carrying a 5-month old food baby and I spent the next day in a food coma... so much wonderful, delicious, rich, tasty, unique food.  So much red wine.  And what about that little $2 World Peace peanut muscovado milk dessert drink?  I think it was one of the most refreshing things I've ever tasted.  I loved the novel concept here and believe I did it up right by coming as a party of 4 (enabling me to taste almost everything).  The restaurant itself isn't much to wow over but  I was having such a great time that mattered not a bit.  With a YES attitude, I tried every damned thing on that menu + everything that walked by my table give or take a few people on their way to the restroom.  Great concept, great execution, great food, great servers.  YES, YES, and YES. 2 words to describe this place: creative and delicious. Each dish we had was exploding with flavors and 'mmm's'. My advice: Drink all the broths!You've probably read from other reviews that they come around with small dishes like dim sum restaurants although you can order ala carte off the menu as well.Really creative spot with just really good good creative food.Amazing desserts as well. I love earl gray and they had an earl gray panna cotta. Real good. Not too sweet and just the right amount of tea flavor.Might be my new favorite place to spurge for some really amazing food that ! wont be able to find anywhere else.FYI - my friends and i (party of 4) made a reservation at 6:30 Monday about a month and a half ago. It's busy and the buzz of the town right now. Hopefully you wont have to wait that long but if you do- it will be worth it. Expectations ran a little high when it took a 30 day advance booking to get an 8PM slot on a Monday, but glad to report that this place is well worth the effort.Wine and beer, with both lists looking quite interesting.The quirky dim sum thing is not overdone and felt pretty natural.  The warm and friendly service helped to make it work.  The mains you order, then they pass small places now and then in case you want some immediate gratification.  Even the mains seemed designed to share.Dining here felt special and fun.  It certainly helped that the food was consistently stellar.My friend and I sampled the garlic bread with burrata, halibut with toasted quinoa, duck neck dumpling, fried quail (the state bird), short ribs, smoked trout salad, roasted asparagus with some other veggies made into a sauce, cacao soda (think cream soda), and the coconut chocolate ice cream sandwiches.I was stuffed, might have skipped the smoked trout salad in hindsight, but it was all great.  Cost was about 120 out the door for two. In the beginning, I was attracted to this place solely for it's dim sum cart concept but after my meal here, I would say the food is going to bring me back. It was unique, creative and delicious. There were a few dishes that missed the mark for me but overall it was a great meal.Kimchi clams w/ pork belly ($8), sourdough pancakes ($6) and the smoked trout w/ creme fraiche are the dishes I would NOT order again. However, the fluke tartare ($6) was amazing and so was the little bite of avocado wrapped with guanciale ($2/bite). The duck neck dumplings ($6), duck salad ($6), garlic bread w/burrata ($8), fried quail ($8/half order), trout with hazelnuts ($9/half order) were all great as well. For dessert, we had the earl gray panna cotta ($4) and the poppyseed profiterole ($4). Both were great. We also had the peanut milk ($2) something I would not order again. It literally tasted like milk and peanuts. I couldn't taste the muscovado. There was just nothing special or unique about it. Some items required ordering off the menu. I would get rid of the menu and serve everything off the dim sum cart. I think the menu took us away from the unique ""dim sum"" experience.The staff was nice and service was good. Few dollars here, few dollars there adds up very quickly. It does take many dishes to feel full so the meal doesn't come out cheap but it's fun and well worth it. Our meal came out about $120 for the two of us, no alcohol but including tip.The menu changes often so I'm looking forward to go back! Hipster service by people who act as if they know they'll be working somewhere else in a few weeks. I went here for brunch the first weekend they stated serving brunch. I loved the quail signature dish and my friend's toad in the hole was also pretty tasty. I'd like to go back for dinner to try out more dishes. I thought it was a good compromise for foodies with non-adventurous friends. They have things like bone marrow and kimchi cocktails for the adventurous and simpler things like mimosas and eggs for the non-adventurous. yummy.  but dropping in for a later dinner (only 9:30) meant that there was no more tray/dim sum service - i missed out on the novelty factor and two of our dishes arrived lukewarm.  the ones that didn't, however, were delicious.  outstanding, even.  the cast iron lentil dish comes to mind.  don't go late.  i wouldn't again - but will most likely return.....at an earlier hour and be more particular about getting things fresh out of the kitchen! We really enjoyed it.  Had about 15 dishes between wife and I.  All were unique.  None bad.  Majority of them stellar.It won't be everyone's favorite, but it is one everyone should try.For us, it was a real treat and we will return..  Bill for plenty of food, two glasses of wine, tip, and tax $170.  For everything else, there is master card. EXTRODINARY!! Yes I dared to do a walk in with no reservation, on a Saturday, after heeding the advice of the reservationist on HOW to get in without waiting weeks or getting a 1030 crappy reso. Nicole, the reservationist said the best bet is to show up before opening at 6pm and most likely I will get a table at one of the tables they keep for walk ins. We get there at 545 with 7 pl in line. I quickly hopped out of the car while the hubby fought for parking in Jtown, while I braved the freezing cold and torential wind chill to get some (hopefully yummy food) and waited amongst other foodies in line.The door promptly opens at 6pm and the entire line rushes in, orderly, but obviously anxious to see if they can get a table. The couples in front of me were able to score tables, and then they cut it off at US! NOOOOOOO....The hostess kindly told us it would be a 90 minute wait, OR we could take one of the 4 ""stand up"" only tables at the kitchen/bar. Basically they have 4 placesettings in a bar like area in the entrance to the restaurant that faces the open kitchen.  No seats..We walked over, and thought it was abit akward but hey what the heck we got in!!Unbeknownst to us, this was the best decision ever.....not only did we get first dibs on the carts coming out, we got to see everything the cooks and sous chefs were making, plating, etc. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY Chef Stuart Brioza YES FORMER RUBICON CHEF himself served us!!   That was such a special treat and he was the most polite and took his time (with a packed house) to explain to us the menu and the house specialties.we were so excited to be able to talk to chef himself about each dish, and he was equally excited to talk to us about all of his creations. Since we were eating practically in the kitchen, we got to see them plate everything and put it onto the dim sum cart before it rolled out to the main dining room. As we were eating, i told the hubby this is the best seat in teh house!! the main dining room, albiet nice, but it was small and DARK. I wouldnt have had such a good time eating there really as you can barely see the food and just being in that open air kitchen and seeing them cook and then serve you was just so special and unique!Almost everything we had was very, very good, and each dish was special and creative in its own way. All the flavors in each dish was uniqe, and this is very hard to do when you have so many small dishes on the menu. We basically had all the must eats on the menu, and were stuffed. we had:Oysters on half shell- really fresh kumamotos wiht house made vinegrette. at $2 a pop so worth it!Steelhead caviar chip n dip- chef said they cure it in house and make everything fresh. This was my favorite. The steelhead caviar had a nice pop to it and not overly salty at all. IT was perfect and I could eat this all day long!Fluke tartare, quinoa, with bonito rosemary aioli-this dish was refreshing and interesting. Between the bites of the raw fish, ,the toasted crunchy quinoa and the aioli, you had a mix of textures in your mouth. It was like a party in your mouth!Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit- oh so good. SO GOOD. YUM. THey make the mousse in house  and also have a pastry chef making the little biscuits. Mousse wasnt too salty or overpowering while the hint of sweetness in the biscuit complimented it so nicely. The biscuit was more like a cake like thing. I could eat them all day too!Pickle plate- beef tongue, potato and veg pickles- oh man this dish was very tasty and interesting. They pickle the beef tongue in house, so tender and flavorful, with the slightest pickled taste. The veggies -carrots, potatoes were also pickled and oh so good. This was probably my 2nd fav dish. Green garlic bread with burratta- Anything burrata I do love. I saw the pasty chef making the green garlic bread fresh. It looks like a pretzel, they fry it, then pile up some fresh burrata on top. Great hung over snack!Ca State bird with provisions- basically the deep fried quail. I was talking to sous chef and we saw him making this dish and he said it was their specialty. We tried to find out what mixture he used to fry it with- something with flour, ground up pistachios and some other things. It was light, crispy, flavorful, and very tender and moist.-- did I mention he was also cute??!! We admired the rest of the night all of his fabulous creations like two little food groupies on crack.Beef cheek salad, radishes and bone marrow- I had high expectations for this considering it said ""bone marrow"". The presentation is great, and chef comes by to pour you the dressing out of a little ceramic thing that looks like bone marrow. The beef cheeks were cooked perfectly while the greens gave it a nice texture. I was expecting more flavor, the hubby loved it. Milk chocolate sesame crunch, clementine cocoa jam- were stuffed but chef convinced us otherwise! duck neck dumplings/ sauerjus-soo good. DO IT!!Cant wait to go back! Wow! This is a true neighborhood gem - truly incredible. As other reviewers have posted, small dishes are served dim sum style. There is also a short menu from which additional items can be ordered. Our favorites were:fluke tartar - knock your socks off good.sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancakes - whoa, dude. amazing.coconut cake - tasty little treatLove the owner too - he greeted each guest at the door and gave off a happy energy. Will be back again and again! What an interesting, different concept... delicious tapas served dim sum style!  Except, they don't use the loaded dim sum carts normally seen in chinese restaurants... the servers walk around with the tapas on a tray, and are gracious enough to explain each tapa and answer questions.  Each dish we had was great, I can't specifically remember each item ordered but we did have some stand out memories:  the CA state bird with provisions (quail, i believe) was perfectly cooked, moist, flavorful, amazingly executed.  The bone marrow dish was great- I totally f'd my s when the waiter poured the bone marrow straight out of the bone onto the flatbread... I can't remember when was the last time I got that excited when a dish was served.  All dishes had beautiful presentations and amazing flavors- I love it when restaurants take ingredients that normally don't work together and create something harmonious- this is what State Bird Provisions does best.The 'world peace' peanut muscovado milk was amazzzzzing- at a whopping $2 i highly highly suggest trying this.  Literally a liquid peanut butter cup, I could have drank a whole glass of this deliciousness if possible! Yay for State Bird! My first visit was a proper sit-down meal with friends of the owners so we got some nice extras from the kitchen and the food and company were fantastic- the crispy duck dumplings in sauerkraut jus were amazeballs as well as the braised pork belly and trumpet mushrooms, but we confirmed State Bird a total win on our second visit when we took a visiting friend there and the food was so delicious that we didn't even notice that we'd been eating fully upright on our feet at the standing bar for 2 hours. Duck dumplings and state bird sublime again, check. Green garlic bread with burrata, glazed back ribs, seafood salsa, and mandarin aspic with avocado, OMG. Earl Grey panna cotta, sesame crunch with chocolate/orange jam and peanut milk divine. But the rosemary 'ice cream' (semifreddo) sandwich, holy shit. My mouth was so ecstatic from getting to try so many creative combinations of flavors that I kept involuntarily clapping. Watching the kitchen staff do their thing from the standing bar was really cool too. Totally agree with the reviewer who said that eating here is a great chance to get a wonderful tasting menu at an affordable price. No wonder a crowd was waiting patiently to sit on a rainy Wednesday night- none of us wanted to leave! First things first: if we can't pluck the state flower why can we eat the state bird? Mr Valley Quail you need to get the lawyer that the poppies got. Anyways, dim sum/tapas made in San Francisco isn't a new concept, but it's the Western style of dim sum that State Bird Sanctuary serves. It's quite cozy and the wonderful dishes are coming right from their kitchen as fast as they can. With all the animal bits and pieces (duck neck, pork jowl, trout flank) this place is probably not good for vegetarians. On a mission to start trying the hip, hyped restaurants of the moment.  SBP seemed like a good place to start.Ended up with Wednesday 9:30 pm rez. Arrived early but were seated pretty much at 9:30. There is nowhere to sit if you are waiting for a table. We stood against the wall with 6 other people.  The guy at the front getting drinks was very nice.  He had me try 3 different wines to find one I liked.Once seated, I was alread starving, and so  grabbed the first thing that came around- duck neck dumplings with a sauerjus(?) sauce. It was tasty. The sauce was odd. Definitely sour. Interesting combo, but one that I'm not sure worked for me.  I was so hungry I hardly tasted the dumpling. 2 per order. I tried more sauce on its own. Kind of like creamy sauerkraut juice soup. I liked it but there was so much sauce/broth in the bowl, it seemed like a waste, since there was no bread or anything else with which to eat it.My friend got tuna tartare with quinoa and bonita flakes. Odd. But she said the more she ate, the more it grew on her.  The combination of textures was interesting. Crunchy, soft, chewy.  To me the prevalent flavor was the bonito flakes.Next up was the shaved veg salad with a sort of ceviche salsa. yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG….  The rock shrimp in the salsa were fantastic. But I wanted more of the seafood! The shaved veggies were baby root vegs with the greens attached. I was a little confused- I don't usually eat carrot tops. In fact, I've read they can be poisonous. But I ate them. Mostly tasted the salsa. It was good, but I sure would have loved a bowl of the seafood salsa.I was very excited about the kimchi/porkbelly/clam/tofu stew. yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG…. It sounded great! But I was not thrilled with it.  Why? Because I didn't consider that it would be spicy, and having never had pork belly before, I was surprised at how little I like it. Why is pork belly so popular?! It's basically like the chunks of fat on pork chops that I avoid. Not the food's fault, just not my thing.  It looked great, though.My favorite dishes were the green garlic bread with burrata and the sourdough pecorino ""pancakes"" (tiny, blini size things) yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG…. Both were tasty, carby and cheesy. I'd like a giant version of the pancakes. And maybe a garlic bread thing to myself. Dessert - yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG….  Neither of us could understand the rave reviews about the peanut milk.  A tiny glass of peanut flavored milk. You know, there's a place on Divisadero near Haight that has had a sign for their homemade peanut milk for longer than I can remember. Perhaps that's where I've tried it before.  I've had it somewhere. The peace milk struck me as completely unspectacular. What is the big deal?!The tastiest was the coconut/custard thing with candied hazelnuts. Oh yeah! I would have liked a bigger piece!Milk Chocolate sesame crunch with citrus struck me as much darker than milk chocolate. It was tasty, but too dark for my taste.My unrefined palate says- interesting mix of food, many little tastes, but perhaps combinations with which I wasn't blown away.All that said, the presentation was fantastic. Really nice looking dishes. The service was also great. We both couldn't get over how friendly everyone was. Like they took happy pills. Nicely un-San Francisco.And I was surprised at how full I got from what did not appear to be a large quantity of food.FYI- I asked before going if the 9:30 rez would mean getting a reduced selection of the dim sum style food and was told it would not. But the food carts began to dwindle about 15 minutes after we were seated. I asked and they said they were slowing down for the evening. They did say we could order anything from the passing menu if we wanted, but admittedly, I was already kind of full by then. I'd definitely go again, but would go less hungry so I could be more discriminating in what I choose and more aware of the flavors of what I was eating. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner tonight, and this restaurant may just be one of the top 3 best dinners I have ever had in my entire life!  A little background: my career has been in hospitality and I have had the privilege to work with the finest chefs in the bay area so my critiques have been critical (although I will not blast it on Yelp).  I take all my reviews seriously.Food: Extraordinary.  The reinvented tapas style menu with carts is refreshing, the conceptual design of food assembly was clever and fresh, and the integration between education and social interaction was great.  The poached egg paired with smoked bonito flakes and beans was a fabulous play on textures and flavors: the mild soft egg integrated perfectly with the smokey bonito flakes, the crunchy cheese topping and the hearty texture of the beans.  The house made chips with creme fraiche and caviar was playful.  CA State Bird Provisions is a must have, as the delicate breading was fried to perfection and the texture of the bird itself is plump and juicy in a bed of sauerkraut.  And the trout was a knockout too: the kishus and hazelnut danced in my mouth with the smooth brown butter, but it did not overshadow the fresh taste of the trout.  We ordered a total of 8 tapas, but I am not listing everything because I will end up writing a novel.Service:   Top notch.  Sarah, our server, was on point at all times, and the nuances and attention to detail she had was amazing.  When she noticed we didn't have any plates of food on our table toward the end of the meal (we were waiting for more carts to come out), she expedited a few custom items for us.  Water in bottles were refilled without asking, she was consistently checking on our table without being overbearing, she was knowledgeable about the food preparation and ingredients in all items served that evening,  Candice was another food runner that noticed that she has come around twice to us with the raw bar and asked us was there anything else I haven't tried yet that she can grab for us.  Finally, a cute curly hair brunette with a neck scarf (don't know her name) who was also a runner remembered that I declined a dish that was with raw seafood (I'm allergic) and came back to me on several occasions with other non-raw fish items for me to try.  In conclusion, for all adventurous foodies out there, this is the place to be.  You will be blown away by the experience in more ways than ten, I guarantee it! Brilliant idea to pass around meal items so guests could 'eat with their eyes' first. Excellent food too - I was most impressed with the: fluke tartare, smoked duck salad, fried quail, peanut muscovado milk, and milk chocolate sesame crunch. And STUART BRIOZA IS PURE GENIUS!!! No matter how hectic it gets, he and his staff interact nonstop with guests, and let you in on the wonder of each item you choose. Their passion and sense of service melted me. Bravo! Hidden little gem!  A local to SF told us about this place (we were visiting from DC).  All I kept saying the whole time was ""holy crap this is amazing.""  The staff were super laid back, friendly and not pushy at all!  It was a very pleasant, romantic relaxed dinner.  Very pleasant and we can't wait to come back!!!! A  real fun place to  have dinner ! Dim Sum like trays or carts come around with small plates. You can also order off the small regular menu.All is fresh and tasty and has a fun surprise element in it. We especially loved the fluke tartare and the trout with kishus and hazelnut.One of the best I have tasted.I am not a fan of quail but here it is done nicely with delicious and light breading.Only small items need improvement, like ricotta pancakes. They had a slight bitter aftertaste as if the cheese was maybe a bit burned on top ? Couldn't figure it out. Otherwise the plate was great.And the dumplings were just  a bit on the bland side.But again nothing major.For dessert we had earl grey panna cotta which was delicious.Corkage is $ 20., we brought our own wine.We had a very nice dining experience here ! State Bird Provisions (or SBP as our group of foodies call it), is a nice change of pace restaurant. Yeah, it's 'dim sum' like but without the crazy, pushy servers and customers. First impression was great. SBP was a clean looking (and smelling) place. The servers were friendly and attentive. I also liked the fact that the customers were giving off positive vibes and smiling. Whereas in a typical dim sum place, I always feel like cattle -- get herded in, grazes, get herded out -- and the customers are usually pushy and competitive.We had some of the homemade chips and pancakes - yum! Also had a salad that was freshly made. We had a light meal (with ice tea) and it was very pleasant. Will definitely come back to try the more substantial dishes! Provisions is a really fun place to have dinner. They take a different approach to the restaurant experience by placing the kitchen at the forefront of the restaurant so you can see all the action! The fact that the food comes by you dim sum style is great too - you don't have to think about what to order and you can see exactly what you are getting. It takes the pressure and guesswork off so you can relax and let the friendly staff take over.  There is one thing that could use some improvement - certain dishes don't make it all the way through the dining room. So depending on where you are seated you could have last dibs.Overall, a fabulous place for a casual yet sophisticated meal and a whole lot of fun! Needless to say, everything we tried was terrific and I would go back many times over. Very solid restaurant. Had the potato chips with creme freche and steelhead roe.,Braised/BBQ'd ribs, some pancake deal, this is pointless, read the other reviews... The food was very tasty, but the problem for us was portions.  We spend $120, had three glasses of wine, but were starving by the time we left so we got take out chinese.  The pork ribs--$20 for two ribs? Ridiculous and in fact outrageous.   Dont go hungry or prepare to stay hungry. Great food and great concept! Excellent service!!! Great Great Great!Everything about this place is Great!Great Ambiance, Great Food, Great Location and a very enjoyable experience.This is a unique restaurant that puts it's own signature on the Dim Sum approach to food.Hosts bring fresh, hot and cold dishes around to the tables for guests to sample various dishes.Each dish is prepared fresh and the menu rotates, and portions of the menu are constantly changing, so you can  be sure to get a fresh and different delicacy on each visit.I LOVED the Duck Neck Dumplings. I hope the chefs' keep this one as a regular staple on the menu!!! Move over Yank Sing.  It's finally happened.  With the use of fancy ingredients, cute stationery, and hip decor, you can now watch your money drop out of your pockets with each stamp on the check while your hunger pangs laugh at you for even trying.  State Bird definitely puts an interesting (read: western) twist on dim sum.  I don't think we did a very good job ordering.  There was a dish with sesame seed encrusted goat cheese and tiny little vegetables, that while absolutely adorable, was somewhat bland.  Then there was a dish with potato chips and some kind of a salmon and dill dip.  I can appreciate that everything, including the chips, were probably made in-house, but aside from that, it felt as though it was another thing we could've thrown together on our own.  Finally, we ordered a dish with three rounds of some kind of meat (turkey? chicken? I don't remember) that came with (I think) a braised cabbage and prune.  It was a tasty combination.Our server and everyone who walked by were intent on reminding us that we could order off the menu at any time from any person.  Perhaps we should've followed their persistent insistence.  Next time, for sure. We were excited about this concept.  Small plates on carts.  While we could see the work that went into each plate we found most of the dishes missed the mark of something remarkable.  The deserts were something to return for. Only wish there was more to each plate. As much as I want you to read this review, you need to do me a favor first and open up another window and make a reservation at State Bird Provisions. Go ahead, I'll wait. Trust me, it's a good idea to do so now while there are still reservations to be had...if my dinner last night is any indication, a seat at SBP will be a hot ticket in no time. While being listed under tapas, the cuisine at State Bird Provisions is more like Hipster Dim Sum (Hip Sum?) You have the option of ordering off a set menu as well as picking items off trays and/or a cart being wheeled around the dining room by a friendly, knowledgeable staff. We ended up trying at least 10 different items and left stuffed to the gills. Highlights included duck neck dumplings, beef cheek salad with a bone marrow dressing, homemade potato chips with trout roe, duck prosciutto, pickled veggies with beef tongue, duck rillette with the most amazing financiers and pork belly & clams w/ kimchi stew.Yes, I listed a lot of highlights but truth be told, everything was fantastic. Actually, the one item I wasn't over the top excited about was the fried quail - it was good but I was glad we ordered the half portion, the hip sum items proved to be the stars. Oh, we also had some great desserts, definitely leave room! (and at prices ranging from $2-$6, it's easy to order a few to split) State Bird Provisions may be my new favorite restaurant in San Francisco (sorry, Frances) It's easy to create your own 10-12 course tasting menu without breaking the bank, and the atmosphere is incredibly hip and laid back for the quality of the food being produced. Good stuff, I'll be back soon! State BirdThis place is what happens when dim sum meets tapas meets hipster -- but in a good kind of way, with custom made, reclaimed teak, welded blue, red and wood carts pushed by the chef and sporting $6 provision size dishes that circulate the restaurant floor all night like a Jersey boy looking for a hot play. And these provisions are good! I actually stood at the kitchen counter, which is an excellent way to enjoy your meal, so long as there isn't a long line of folks standing right behind you. At the counter, you get time to watch your chefs make your food, admire their craft and craftiness, and even get to throw in a word or two in between plates running in and out of the broiler. It's a real experience and not just a meal; a sort of Disneyland for the culinary senses. When it came down to food, I had the crudite with goat cheese and toasted sesame that was quite fresh and refreshing, although not particularly accented one way or another. This I followed with the duck rillette with almond biscuit. Now, this is where you need to pause for a moment. Reading this dish's description you might find yourself very underwhelmed. I mean, what's the big deal about duck rillette and almond in particular? It's not like ducks and almonds grow on the same tree or feed from the same terroir after all. Well, think again. This combination of rillettes with a financier like ""biscuit"" is absolute genus. Whether accredited to Stuart (the chef) or not, I give him full credit for making them and making them oh so well. This is quite possibly the best preparation of duck rilletes that I've ever had. The secret, I'm told, is in the use of duck fat instead of butter to plump up those financier biscuits. And, it tells. These things are so rich and so perfectly matched to enliven the otherwise lean rillettes. The one-two flavor punch is just to die for. I applauded them -- with my hands, as did another patron as she was leaving for the night. Truly, there were accomplishments worth an ovation at this place.This stellar dish was followed by two dishes which did not particularly overwhelm my culinary sensibilities. They were good, but somehow they did not move the needle for me far above just nice. These were the duck neck dumplings in sauerjus, which are a kind of gyoza/pierogi inside a small soup made of sauerkraut juice, and the cauliflower, lentils and sunchokes, which was a curried dish that seemed to neither scream lentils, nor cauliflower, nor sunchokes and yet still managed to stay mildly nice. But no worries, this was just a short plateau in what picked up again into a nice crescendo: the sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino and ricotta pancakes and the green garlic bread with burrata. Ok, the pancakes I am just partial too. They're fried cheese pancakes. What can possibly go wrong with that? Nothing. And although I don't recall a strong taste of sauerness, I did like the seasoning quite a lot and especially the ground coriander that appeared all over the plate (idiot alert: i may be wrong about it being coriander, but that's how I remember it now). This dish was fine enough on its own, but then I saw one of the chefs roll out a fresh roll of green garlic bread, where the green and the garlic are mixed into the fresh dough which is then -- gasp -- deep fried. Oh boy, now I was getting short breathed with excitement. Fried dough with fried cheese?! oh, dear lord. And, the lord did provide. What a wonderfully fun dish. Served freshly fried, the burrata cheese is nestled inside of its bread roll like a puppy in its crib, and you ""just wanted to eat it,"" as my sister is ought to say of puppies in cribs. And eat it I did. Nomnomnom good.But that wasn't all. Oh, no. To top off my savory dish extravaganza, I took the half CA state bird: a deep fried quail with pepitas on top of a lemon-onion concoction that all put together is like a mad twist on chicken piccata meets the deep fryer minus the waffle. Deep brown in color and tender and juicy this dish was just pure success, and I am honored to have shared in it. What a great recommendation from the chef, who had been guiding my selection throughout the night. Another great perk of standing at the counter and not being a lazy bum at a table (I'm venting a bit for not having wanted to wait 30 mins for a table to open; it's acceptable. Look it up in the Yelp rule book). And so, my meal ended, but not the fun. Dessert. It has to come. I mean, it has to, right?And come it did. Twice. A truly multi-orgasmic finish to an already stimulating meal is what I got when I ordered the ""world peace"" peanut muscavado milk and the warm cornmeal custard, walnuts and huckleberries desserts. Yelp is limiting how much I can write about it, so you'll have to go try these on your own. And, if I was living in San Francisco, I'd be telling all my friends about this place, because without doubt the bird is the word. Word. I really wanted to like this place, but I was pretty underwhelmed.First off, the format is cool in theory - small plates come around a la your typical dim sum restaurant. i get it, you're trying your best at shifting some paradigms. that's fine. However, one big difference is that when the dim sum steam cart comes around, the food that is presented to you is actually hot because, well, it's coming out of a steam cart. At SBP, the ""hot"" dishes that come out are often times just room temperature, because they've been hanging out for a little bit before they get to your table. Sure there are dishes that don't need to be hot so those make it to your table at the temperature you'd expect. I can get over the dining experience issues, but the food is where this place fell flat. With a few exceptions everything was pretty lackluster. Of all the dishes we had, the standouts were a fluke sashimi with blood orange vinaigrette and a dessert consisting of creamy polenta with huckleberries. Both were superbly executed.beyond that, the flavor profile of many of the dishes seemed, in the words of my wife, ""rounded."" I'd describe them as muddled, unfocused, and even downright bland at times (pseudo-casear salad - i'm looking at you). I know it isn't fine dining, but i expected a lot more from the kitchen, given the hype. For the record, duck pate does not work well with cornbread. Bone marrow in dressing on a beef cheek salad comes across as a ham-fisted. The texture of a hazelnut does not add the right kind of flair to a mushroom salad. Many of the kitchen's decisions just seemed clunky. A for effort but C for execution.And If i'm paying $20 for FOUR pork ribs, i expect them to be the best ribs i've ever had. Sure, they were falling off the bone, but to me, they were rather dry and poorly seasoned. I'll head down to Texas and get a bucket of them for that price and be a much happier customer. To their credit, the staff was awesome, service was great, as was the booze selection. i know i fall in the small minority on my assessment of SBP. I can accept that. Maybe I just hit it on an off night. However, with all the other tasty options available in this city, i don't think State Bird Provisions will be getting another chance to send me home with $100 less in my pocket. OK, so we wanted to try this American dim sum place. It ended up to be quite an expensive meal and we were not even half full. The idea might be cute but half of the dishes we ordered were just ok.  The beef tongue, the beef cheek salad, tuna with Quinoa, chips with their own dipping would be the only dishes I recommend. Their signature dish was over rated. The quail itself is very tender but the batter was way too thick. Only go there if you want to try something different but not necessarily looking for a nice dinner One of my favorite new places. It's fun, different, new style (American Dim Sum) and super creative.We went with friends and we able to try a bunch of dishes, and here is my list of ""must haves""Tuna Tartare & quinoaDuck Rillette with almond 'biscuit'Beef tongue, potato and veg pickledDuck neck dumplingsCA state bird with provisionsTrout with hazelnuts, and brown butter (!!)Ricotta cavatelli with wild mushroomsand my need to try list:Sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancakesdesserts were playful, and my top pick is the Warm cornmeal custard, huckleberries & walnuts, while the milk chocolate sesame crunch and clementine-cocoa jam was awesome as well. spiced butter cookies with carrot jam was refreshing from the common overly sweet desserts.we got here for super late reservations, 10:30, but everything was still available. we were given the dim sum menu with the regular menu, but did get to see the cart pass by. for 4, plus at least 9-10 drinks, price was really reasonable. Eating here is like going to a friend's house for dinner, a friend who can cook and has a fancy kitchen.  These guys are like mad scientists producing delicious pieces of art...lots of layers, texture and flavor.  I've come here a handful of times and each visit feels like the first, sometimes they take former dishes and reconstruct them as a new experience the following week.  That's why I love coming back here, that and their passion that leaks through (from the chefs to the servers to the diners).  Oh, and also (if you don't mind standing) the best ""seats"" in the house are to the right of the Chef expeditor...it's the standing bar in front of where the cookin' is happening so you'll get first dibs on what comes out.  It also feels like you're hanging out at the counter of your friend's fancy kitchen.  Casual and yum!*note*  also admire the asymmetrical ceramic plates Chef Brioza made during his break between Rubicon and SBP...a true artist! This was my favorite dinner restaurant in all of San Francisco. I loved the concept of this restaurant (maybe because I'm a huge fan of dim sum and I get more excited when I can physically see the food I'm about to order in front of my face). My recommended dish would be the braised ox tail flat bread that came around on a tray (not on the menu). The pork ribs were also a favorite at our table. It can be on the pricier side (I think we spent about $100 including tip for just the two of us - but we kind of splurged since it was somewhat close to Valentine's Day) but if you pay attention to how many dishes you're consuming you can stay way below what we spent. I recommend trying the desserts too. A lot of the time desserts can be an afterthought but we went in knowing we wanted to try at least a couple and thank god we did. My favorite dessert was the pear ice cream sandwich. Seriously. Try this place if you're in Pacific Heights.God I want to go back to San Francisco. Awful, awful dining experience. There was not one good thing I got out of dining at State Bird Provisions. I'm going to try to keep this story short, for my sake, because I really don't wish to relive this horrid occurrence any more than I have to. I know that State Bird just opened about a month ago, so I'm really trying to avoid sounding overly harsh, given that the staff is new, blah blah. I can forgive things like slower seating or minor mistakes like that. But what happened was not minor. Our easy-peasy short two-item order was somehow lost between our table and the kitchen (distance of 30 feet, no joke) Really? REALLY??? I can hardly think of anything worse than completely omitting an entire table's orders.So there we sat, the boy and I, 45 minutes later still waiting for our plates, being bullied (by our own hunger, not by SBP staff) into ordering dish after unsatisfying overpriced dish of their so-called ""dim-sum-inspired-a-la-carte fare"". What a crock. I hate to admit it, but it was this exact (seemingly) fresh idea of trollying around small plates that lured me in the first place.I finally watched in astonishment at the chef sitting down to eat his own dinner, and noticing that most of the kitchen was shut down. Oh my Gee Ohh Dee. Asked our server how much longer our plates would be. She comes back and tells me nonchalantly ""Your ticket was never put in, oops."" No apology, not comps, nothing. WOW.To boot, I actually ordered the quail- the ""State Bird with Provisions"". Cue Alanis Morrissette's ""Ironic"", if you please. Tell me, how can a restaurant overlook a ticket for a homonymous order? If that's not dropping the ball, I really don't know what is. The question looms: ""Where can I possibly eat after this ethereal experience?""I woke up dreaming of all the intricate, well-balanced, shining flavors I experienced last night over what felt like an extremely decadent dinner. First off, the service was exemplary. We were mainly in the capable hands of Sarah, and she was friendly, professional, intuitive... (She even asked at the beginning if we had any food allergies. ) Sarah paced our dishes in a way that placed the strongest, heartiest fare toward the end so we could really taste the subtleties of the earlier dishes. The timing at which the dishes arrived was perfect too!  (Again, intuitive.)We started with provisions delivered by cart. Before being seated, we were very curious (and skeptical) about the concept. When the cart first arrived, we got it!!  To be able to see the colors, the presentation, experience the aromas at the time of ordering was a total treat. We started with: oysters, trout tartar with quinoa, green onion flatbread with cheese, duck neck dumplings in sauerjus...The oysters were perfect: the flavors delicate and balanced, with a bit of daikon and reminiscent of Japanese flavorings.The trout tartar with quinoa had delicate, layered flavors and the most amazing texture...Green onion flatbread with cheese: Had such a nice undercurrent of a citrusy flavor (like lemongrass??) That just kicked it to the next level.The duck neck dumplings were probably the star of round 1. Not to be missed!!Next, we really couldn't decide what to order off the menu as it all sounded amazing. Soooo, we ordered almost everything: chicories, sourdough-sauerkraut-pecorino-ricotta pancakes, state bird (quail), trout with garum butter, glazed pork ribs, ricotta cavatelli dumplings, beef cheeks with radishes and bone marrow...It sounds like a lot of food, right? It was! My dining companion is a sous chef so we decided to go in for the full experience. :-) It was totally worth it!chicories: tangy, bursting, balanced with the almonds, dates, yogurt...The panckaes: I was actually not too psyched about the pancakes. When they arrived, however, they blew my mind!  We ate them ""Mmmmming"" and ""Mmmmming"" when my dining companion realized it was evoking a childhood comfort for him: perogies!!! He was right. State bird (quail) - the breading was perfect, the tangy onions served as the bed for the quail were divine!Ok. You get the point.The star dish for me: the ricotta cavatelli with wild mushrooms & spinach.  Wow! Wow! Wow!  the mushroom flavor stood strong as did the flavor of the perfectly-textured cavatelli. My favorite. Desserts:milk chocolate sesame crunch with clementine cocoa jambeer begnetsrhubarb crisp with rosa gardenia ice creamThe desserts were as innovative as they sound. The begnets and the sesame crunch took the prizes from our table.All of this plus beer, wine, a pomegranate spritzer ... still reasonably priced for a nice dinner out for 2.  It also made for a great date: discussions of the food, sharing the experience, discovering the nuances: great date spot!Make a reservation. They are busy! This is why I live in San Francisco. I just wished I still lived in this neighborhood and I'd be here twice a week. Fantastic food, attentive but not intrusive service, and downright reasonable prices. Such an interesting concept and a great way to try lots of different offerings at a restaurant. I recommend everyone go to this place before the Chronicle publishes a glowing review and it becomes impossible to get in. This was the most enjoyable meal I've had in 6 months, in spite of a tour of Bay Area Michelin one-stars over the past year. My gf said the dishes were hit or miss, and I must admit we had a couple that were not so great, but I was impressed enough to write a review. And any place worth reviewing always has something like 863 Yelp reviews so it's seriously easy to skip writing one.First, the dim sum concept is brilliant. The problem with tapas is that I always feel ripped off, even at fine places like Bocadillos or Ramblas/Locanda. You don't know what you're going to get, and you spend a small fortune to get your fill. But here you get to see the plate and its price, and hear its description before you take it. It is a perfect solution. It helped that the prices were very reasonable.Second, the execution was great as well. The service was friendly and attentive, and the dishes inventive and tasty.I didn't take notes, but my favorites were the kimchi pork belly clam stew, flatbread with ox tail, and duck prosciutto with dried persimmons. Also excellent: quinoa, marinated mushrooms, and goat cheese with vegetable crudite. The radicchio beet salad reminded me of cole slaw -- not necessarily a bad thing, but did not do justice to the fresh beets. And I thought, exactly as another reviewer remarked, that the sourdough pancakes from the menu were doughy and undercooked.I'm sorry I missed the fried quail and will certainly return to try it. hit or miss place. a nice ambiance, attentive service, reasonably priced dishes but only a half of the dishes were as good as we had hoped. I wouldn't call it hyped up but it's not worth 4.5 stars based on my experience.its dining concept is different; more like an upscale, contemporary American dim sum place? we had about 12 dishes and about 6 were very good and the other 6 left us hanging. for a sucker for pork belly, it hurt my soul sharply that they didn't execute two pork belly dishes quite well. however, their quinoa + halibut dish, duck rillette, trout dish, dark chocolate-pair desserts were really good. I would definitely come back and try different menu but for now, 3 stars feels right to me. Great food, loved the waitstaff, and a cool ambiance. Every time I return I'm surprised by the menu in the most pleasant way imaginable. Wow, best food I've had in SF!!!! Now I hope they'll try my cooking. Good luck and all the best wishes,Michelle 02.09.12    bookmarked 02.01.12I was being a daredevil yesterday.  I walked into SBP without a reservation, right when they opened.  They were all booked up.  People were lining up to get seated.  We got ""snuck in"", if we promise to leave within an hour so the table can be vacated for the people who had the foresight to make reservations.We wasted no time, and picked the small order of the CA state bird with provisions (fried quail) and the small order of glazed pork ribs with spigarello and togarashi.Then comes the fun part.  Dishes come out in carts or trays, just like dim sum.  And just like dim sum, they mark the dollar value to the back of your check, and tally the total afterwards.We picked the halibut tartare and quinoa with bonito-rosemary aioli (which, by far, was my favorite dish of the night); the duck neck dumplings in sauerjus; and the braised oxtail in seven-pepper flatbread.Wash it down with a large strong amber ale (that they have on tap), and we were good to go.Absolutely fabulous concept and experience.  I am utterly surprised that this has not been done before, and I can't wait to go back with a larger group to try even more dishes over a bottle of wine!Total damage for two: $55ADORE. good wine list, good food, interesting ordering method. passed like dim sum for some of it, and ordered off the menu for some of it. I'd pass on the crudites - it's just some weird-looking veggies likes romanesco with a plop of goat cheese, but everything else is quite good. And order the state bird, obviously. Kind of loud because it's all hard surfaces inside, if you're old and care about that sort of thing. Worst dining experience ever I'm the bay area. Poor service, forgot our order and below average food What happened!??Its really embarrassing when you talk up a great new place to friends and colleagues and go for a second visit and it falls kind of flat.  I had an outstanding experience when I first came here. My second visit with a friend felt like I was at a different restaurant.     Most of the dishes we had on my first visit were not available.  The dishes which were available on the menu last night were OK at best.I couldn't wait to come back after my try.   After my second try, I just cannot recommend. At State Bird Provisions, it begins the second you walk through the door. You are greeted immediately by the kitchen and its staff, followed by a member of the incredibly friendly waitstaff, and then (if you are lucky), your well-appointed table. Everything at SBP feels intentional and refined without being stuffy or highbrow.For $80 including tip, we enjoyed 6 dim-sum style plates offered by tray/cart (including heavenly Drakes Bay oysters), 1 item from the standing menu, and two desserts in addition to the two beers we ordered while waiting for our table (reservations highly recommended as we lucked out on getting our spot and this place's popularity is soaring for good reason).All of the dishes tasted uniquely well-balanced--the menu here is an incredibly thoughtful fusion of local ingredients, distinct flavors and a wide variety of styles.This is a great place to go with folks who share a sense of culinary adventure an an appreciation for quality ingredients and service.Our new favorite restaurant! While promising, some super groups just never quite pan out: Soundgarden + Rage Against The Machine (Audioslave) = eh.Sammy Hagar + Joe Satriani (Chickenfoot) = um, seriously?New Kids On The Block + Backstreet Boys (NKOTBSB) = actually... that might be the exception. I love terrible pop music. Secretly, I'm hoping one day for a Biebas duo to hit the road (Justin Bieber + Nick Jonas).  Well, when I heard the news of a fresh concept combining new-American fare with dim sum just steps from my 350 square foot studio apartment, I was intrigued to say the least... and after being open for roughly four weeks, I was able to pop in and experience the magic of State Bird Provisions first hand. Suffice to say from the gaggle of glowing reviews accumulated already, you don't need me to reveal their gustatory super group concept won't soon be the Power Station of San Francisco eateries.Upon original speculation, I envisioned this place to be exactly like a dim sum restaurant with rolling carts chock-full of odd looking mystery vittles that you hope don't make you incredibly ill hours into the night. However, while that's certainly a staple standout of their dinner service, it's more of a fun attribute to a brilliant static menu. Still, fun, and incredibly uncommon. They encourage you to order roughly half of your menu items (small, tapas style) from the physical scribe, then treat your taste buds to a handful of the passed plates that do, indeed, arrive at your table by way of a four-wheeled tumbrel. It's really fun, and certainly a unique way to enjoy a night on the town.Spanning both the physical menu and the passed plates, you'll find items like Drake's Bay oysters in the half shell, vegetable crudite with goat cheese & toasted sesame, marinated halibut with yuzu-jalapeno vinaigrette, marinated mushrooms with vanilla-parsnip & hazelnuts, kimchi-pork belly & clam broth, glazed pork ribs, and at least 10-12 other courses appealing to any kind of eater. They even have one or two dessert items making the rounds throughout the dining room, and it's about as challenging as solving a Rubik's Cube to let the sweet treats drift off into the distance. I don't have as much of a palate for sugar, otherwise I'd have gobbled up those sacchariferous digestifs faster than a bee stung stallion.Changes of pace are nice when you've grown tired of the usual dining routine, and if the quality of taste and ingredients rivals a clever, outside-the-box concept, you're in for a real treat. In Lower Pac Heights, State Bird Provisions is that treat, and one I hope to indulge in far too often. SBP opened New Years Eve 2011/2012, not quite seven weeks ago, so they still have plenty of room to grow and develop their menu. The food style is Asian/California/Italian. (Somewhat like the late-great-Oritalia on Fillmore.) SBP has a rather unique concept: A very abbreviated printed dinner menu, supplemented by small courses on carts or trays wheeled or carried by a friendly and knowledgeable staff to the patrons' tables. These latter plates are not listed on the menu, but the prices are clearly displayed on the carts and trays.Next time I go I probably won't order immediately from the printed menu, but instead take my first courses from the carts and trays, and possibly add some menu selections later.What we ordered from the printed menu:* Sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancakes... $6* Char-grilled chicories with yogurt, dates & almonds... $6* Halibut with hazelnut and mandarin... $18* Ricotta cavatelli with wild mushrooms & spinach... $16What we took from the carts/trays:* Raw vegetable and fruit with whipped goat cheese... $6 * Mushrooms with parsnip puree... $6My comments:The four small pancakes were fine, although they would have benefited from a dab of some interesting sour cream concoction on top. Also, the sauerkraut must have been cooked into the pancakes but it was not apparent in the flavor.The chicory greens were very good, if a bit acidic from added lemon, vinegar or vinaigrette. (Cooking these in the open kitchen may have contributed to the slight smokiness of the room.)  The halibut was dry and flavorless in an unpleasantly acidic (again), very minimal, sauce.The cavatelli pasta was a laughably small serving. Tasty, but the mushroom-to-spinach-to-pasta ratio didn't include enough pasta, and was not satisfying at $16.The raw vegetables were fine and the whipped goat cheese was very good.The mushrooms and parsnip puree needs work. The cooked mushrooms should have been warmed (they were cold) and there was too little puree.Wine list is short but good (we had only one glass of Beaujolais) and the hazelnut apricot linzer bars (which were comped) were tasty. SBP needs to offer some heartier dishes. Also, for diners who might not be enthusiastic about the unusual flavors of some dishes, they should offer a few standbys with a more comfort-food orientation. They grill chicory, why not grill other vegetables and maybe potatoes with a romesco sauce (they like nuts at SBP)? Dial-down the acidic elements and offer dishes with more rounded flavors. Olive oil, anyone? How about some bread and butter? Most importantly, increase the serving sizes - we both left hungry having spent $81 including tax and tip.In the end, I do appreciate what they're trying to do and applaud their effort. The staff was very good. I will probably go back.Oh, yeah. Music choice was not so great. They're in an historic area of great jazz and vintage SF rock. Go for the jazz and leave Johnny Cash to the BBQ joints. Spent the day with friends who live in the Bay Area and had dinner with 5 others.  Food was great loved the fact you could see the VERY clean kitchen when you walked in and out.  The staff and Chefs greeted you when you walked in and ALL thanked you when you left.  You know they love food if it tastes that good. Dim sum style for casual upscale american food.Love the concept, liked the food, but they still need to work out some of the kinks with operations. Perhaps sleeker dim sum style food carts would improve the flow.Really enjoyed the variety of food and especially the deep fried quail Definitely go with a group of 4-8, so you can try all the dishes. I'm pretty stoked off of this place. My hood has been in dire need of a decent place to eat for far too long (the Fillmore is the ONLY place in SF with every possible fast food option in a half mile radius). Provisions is delicious AND affordable. I've been three times, each time with a friend and shared 4-5 plates, a couple beers (great beer selection including Stone Levitation Ale for only $4 bottle) and the highest bill was around $40.The food is very good.The interior is also a pleasant surprise.I'll be very happy to see this place stay consistent and in business. When an innovative restaurant opens up within a 3 minute walk from my house, stays open until 12, and takes reservations, I'm bound to give it a few extra brownie points (hence the 5 stars instead of 4). This place was definitely a win with a wonderful tapas concept and ever-changing menu. The small dishes fairly priced for the most part and had a few stand-out dishes:1. Braised Baby Carrots (really stellar, I hope this stays on the menu always)2. Farro with Wild Mushrooms (off the menu)3. Marinated Wild Mushrooms4. 7-Pepper FrybreadOn the negative side: I was not the biggest fan of the Grilled Chicories and the oysters were a little unexciting. A friend also found the duck dumplings pretty average.The service is wonderful and the waiter was very accomodating to my vegetarian needs offering variations of existing dishes so that I could try them. Can't wait to come back and try some new dishes! Warning: There is no such thing as super sizing here. After a weekend of super indulgence at ayce shabu shabu and then buffet the next day, this place is exactly what I needed. Everything we had here was amazing. State bird, pork belly with kimchi , marinated wild mushrooms, duck dumplings and an amazing salad with bone marrow. This place is definitely pricey for the amount you get. But well worth it! Came here with a girlfriend on a Saturday night ~10/10:30pm, past the dim sum-style serving time. We simply ordered from the menu.Our waitress was pleasant and very helpful in answering some of our questions about the menu. We ended up having:1. CA STATE BIRD WITH PROVISIONS This is a whole deep-fried bone-in quail. The provisions were lemon-stewed onions with shaved Parmesan. The bird was quite moist and delicious. It is a bit difficult to share as the bird is not deboned - you'll have to split it with some creative cutting. Best to eat with your hands to get all the delicious meat off the bones.2. MARINATED WILD MUSHROOMS w/ vanilla-parsnip purée & hazelnutsThe mushrooms were extremely flavorful and had just the right amount of tang. The hazelnuts gave the dish the right amount of sweetness and a nice crunchy texture combined with the soft mushrooms.I also had a glass of Temperanillo, which was very good. I enjoyed the ambience of SBP as it was equal parts rustic and modern. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. I'd recommend SBP for some quick bites as one of a few stops on a night out in the Fillmore neighborhood. Probably not great for a filling dinner but certainly a cozy, low-key date night nibble. What do you mean it is tapas dim sum, oh.. yeah, it is just like that.Small plates coming down the isle. While you can order some other larger dishes from the menu. Sort of I can get my chicken feet from the cart, and order my chou mien from the menu.Everything is fresh, quintessential of new California cuisine. Standout dishes are:* Quinoa with small bits of red snapper and chrysanthemum: I couldn't say enough good things about this small creation, the favorite came out so unique and balance. My favorite.* Cavatelli with dungeness crab & tomalley butter: wow, please give me more! So light and fresh, the bread crumb added such interesting taste.* 7 spice bread with ox tail, sun choke sauce, and lentil: who thought about this?* Buckwheat bao (bun) with lemon cream: a piece of heavy that is only $5.I like the layout of the restaurant, completely open kitchen in the front. Everyone is friendly, the chef was near the door when we left, and chatted with us a bit when I complimented him on the dishes (I rarely do). Such humble man!Only complains are the place is noisy! It only died down after about 10:30pm. I could also see that if you are sitting in the back, you are in trouble! Cause all the deliciousness won't make it back to you. There is no good waiting area, but they actually can take your cell number and text you when your table is ready. Service is friendly, you can tell each staff knows the dishes well. Considering the quality of the food, this is a bargain place. We had a few drinks and about 10 dishes for two of us. $100 tips included.And open till midnight, heck ya!Visit this place before it gets publish, and the mobs swarm in. State Bird Provisions is a shining example of why I love the food culture in San Francisco. The entire restaurant experience here is top-notch; definitely one of the best dinners I've had in the city. State Bird Provisions introduces a dim sum-style ordering process to unique, fresh, and flavorful concoctions, all of which were absolutely delicious.The large open kitchen in the front of the restaurant is definitely a nice welcome. You see a dedicated league of chefs preparing a countless number of intricate and interesting dishes. There are a few shared plates on the menu, and plenty more that they bring around the room on trays and carts. I love this process because you can see the food before you decide to take it, and you can ask questions with the dish right in front of you. I've never seen anything like this before at an American restaurant, and it really is genius. Be aware though: you will probably end up spending way more than you expected to, because it's pretty difficult (at least for me) to reject any of the dishes they bring around. They all looked phenomenal, and the vast majority of them were.----------------------------A group of 3 of us had the following:Serrano Ham w/ Persimmon: Fresh & tasty. I could eat these all day.Pan-seared Trout = Excellently-cooked trout.Beef Cheek w/ Bone Marrow Vinaigrette = Delicious. The Bone Marrow vinaigrette is incredible and the Beef Cheek was nice and tender.Flatbread with Oxtail and Curried Lentils = Warm & flavorful. Loved it.CA State Bird w/ Provisions (Fried Quail) = This was my favorite dish of the night. The fried quail was PERFECTLY fried and the meat was unbelievably moist. This is how poultry should be fried.Cavatelli w/ Dungeness Crab = Interesting flavor that really grew on me with each bite.Kimchi Pork Belly w/ Yuba Noodles = Very good take on the Korean flavors. The kimchi flavor is faint, but works very well in the broth. Pork Belly was nicely crisped.Duck Confit w/ Cornbread = The cornbread is phenomenal. The duck confit was good, but I wish they utilized something different with cornbread (ideally something like foie gras).Duck Neck Dumplings = Little dumplings that had a distinct duck neck flavor, but the dumpling skin was a little too doughy. Still good, though.Clam Sliders = The bun for the sliders were great, although I wish the clams were hot instead of cold.Goat Cheese w/ Vegetable Crudite = The goat cheese was great -- not too overpowering but still had a strong flavor. Goes well with the vegetables.Grand Total: $61.00 per person, including an ice-cold IPA (and tax & tip).----------------------------For a brand-new restaurant, State Bird Provisions blows many SF establishments out of the water. It serves up incredibly fresh, unique, and tasty dishes at decent prices. Make a reservation now and be prepared for an amazing night out. SBP is a brilliant new restaurant! There are so many great things to say about it that I don't know where to start!!! From start to finish I had an amazing experience here! The staff is highly trained, friendly and truly cares about their guests! I have some strange allergies (wheat, potato and peppers) and after letting our server know this fact I found out that she made sure to share the info with everyone who was passing food so that they could help me avoid anything that would be a problem. SO impressive!!!!And now for the FOOD!!!!! Holy Moly!!! The food was ridiculous!!!! We tried just about everything that was passed around. Favorites of the evening: crudite of mini vegetables and soft goat cheese with sesame seeds & cardamom, duck liver pate with almond cookies, glazed pork ribs with spigarello & togarashi, and the coconut-ginger-cardamom baba with hachiya persimmon. The oysters on the half shell were fresh and tasted like the sea. There were just too many delicious options to sum them all up here! The menu changes on a weekly basis so be ready to be surprised! Everything is fresh with a flavor profile that will knock you socks off. It is a bit pricy, so bring three friends with you and split the bill! That way you can all try even more items off the carts and trays! Go...EAT!!!! The idea is genius and the execution is well done.  Not every dish that comes out on the cart is 5 stars, but every dish is inventive and daring.  The atmosphere is lively, wine list is small and cheap, and the experience is fresh.  Don't miss out."|5|100|0|Routine|This inspection has no violations.|GOOD: no inspection needed

The former Chef from Michelin starred Rubicon has opened his own place.  A small plates format at a great price point.  And for that price you get really, really wonderful food and service. The format when I dined was akin to that of a Chinese dim sum restaurant.  Many smaller plates that didn't require warming were wheeled around the restaurant for patrons to pick and choose.   A small group of larger but still modestly priced dishes that require the immediate attention of the patron are ordered ala carte and come directly to you from the kitchen.   It worked surprisingly well, although I think they may have trouble getting people to leave.  I was tempted to stay to see what would come out on the cart next.  I started with mushrooms that came with parsnip, vanilla and hazelnut.  A lovely way to start as the earthiness of the mushrooms was contrasted by the parsnip, vanilla and hazelnut. Next, char-grilled chicories that came with yogurt,  and dates.  A great plate of food as the grilled chicories had taste and texture that paired perfectly with the contrasting yogurt and dates. A larger plate of glazed pork ribs with spigarello and togarashi was sublime.   The braised ribs had a bit of char.  The spigarello had a touch of acidity from some lemon that cut the fattiness of the heavenly ribs. Next a half order of fried quail.  I don't particularly care for quail.  But this was different.  Great stuff and the signature plate of the place.  And for good reason. I finished my meal with braised carrots that were wonderfully sweet.  Some slightly bitter winter greens were a perfect contrast to the carrots.  It's places like State Bird Provisions that make San Francisco a great food city.  Yum.  Yum.  Yum. There were maybe two dishes that were just ""good"".  Considering we had seventeen tick marks on our tab at the end of the night, that's an awfully good record.  Outstanding State Bird (of course) and really yummy lamb belly.  Lovely service and pretty presentation.  One of the ladies recognized me from the Rubicon days!   Even waiting by the kitchen for our table was super fun.  Pretty loud and crowded, I hope this place will be around a long time. We wanted to try this place first weekend they opened.  When we got there, we thought it was closed because we didn't see any patrons from the sidewalk looking in.   All the workers, including chefs are at the front where the kitchen is(very Chinese).  The diners are all in the back, away from street view.  The food are served up dim sum style where servers bring the dishes around and you point to what you want.  The server explained what's in the dish and then marked a line on a piece of paper that keeps count of how many $2 to $12 dishes you have selected.  When you are done eating, the host will take the sheet and come back with your total, plus tax.  All along, you should be able to see how many dishes and your total(if u can do quick math while stuffing your face). They have some really delicious items there.  As much as we ate, there were still so many dishes yet to try.  Favorite was their signature dish, the quail.  Their meat items are quite good.  This is not a dimsum place nor a Spanish tapas place.  The dishes are quite eclectic and creative.  The workers are young hip and friendly.  Did I mention the dishes they served up were tasty?!  Dining here takes time as you have to wait for the food to come around, but it really is great to sip on wine and chat as food settles before the next dish arrive.  You get to see the food item before you buy.  The clientele is also quite eclectic.  We welcome State Bird Provisions to our block. For such an interesting food place a proper review should start with the food:  wow.  Three dishes were amongst the best this hedonist has ever tried: fabulous crusted lemony quail, brilliantly vibrant (I think tuna) tartar, and a non-earthy, redolently citrus-tasting mushroom dish, an unexpected elegant winner.  The sturgeon caviar with potato chips, if not totally new (at least if you've been to Swanson Winery's Napa Valley Salon) was at least completely DE-lish!, underscoring I think this restaurant's sense of humor and self-confidence.  Hey, I even loved the seared calf tongue served in room temp blood red (beet, as I recall) sauce.  Sense of humor, for certain, and roundly beautiful.Dwelling on that a tad more, I liked the food presentation.  Tiny plates are offered on a tray, reminiscent of a dim sum style.  So cool to be able to look over everything.  Kind of a fun ice-breaker for dates too, actually.  I came away feeling the chef really knew how to incorporate a sense of art--textures and colors as well as flavor-- into the meal.A plus or a minus, I can't tell, but an important detail:  from the outside you would never know this is a restaurant.  In fact, I walked by twice even though I knew the address.  I scratched my head, and took a shot, still thinking ""this can't be it...""   The entrance looks like it's a catering operation from the outside.  Diners essentially walk past the kitchen to a small secluded dining room, a spartan SF-chic-space composted of unassuming peg board, cement and stone tones.  The tables are unadorned.  The food and friendly nature of the place make the experience as a result.  As a really huge bonus for foodies:  the wines by the glass are well-considered by the owners, inexpensive ($7-11) and lovely.  We enjoyed several as the night progressed, using them as wonderful compliments to a round-robin of sophisticated flavors. I could not wait to try this place ever since it starting receiving press in the Chronicle.  It did not disappoint.  I loved the idea of the concept, and I loved it in practice.  I don't want to order off a menu ever again.  Unlike a dim sum cart, they only put a few plates on a tray, so nothing gets cold.  The servers do a great job describing the dish and answering questions.  We sat in the back and were initially concerned that everything would be snatched up by the people in front.  That worry was quickly alleviated as the staff expertly gets things to every table.  The benefit to this style of dining is you might try things that would sound boring on a menu.  For example, the first thing we had was a grilled chicory dish.  I would not have ordered it off of a menu, but it was awesome.  Every dish except the rye bread & red beet dish was really good (I did not personally like the sauce with the beets).  My favorite dish was duck dumplings with a ridiculous broth poured over them.  The broth was SO GOOD.  Nothing that comes with a broth/jus should be missed.  The pepper bread with oxtail was awesome.  We just cut it in half and picked it up and ate it like an openface sandwich.  Cutting it up would leave too much gravy on the plate.  The quail was awesome on its own, but the lemon stewed onions take it to the next level.  In the end, we only had room for one dessert, the chocolate sesame crunch.  It was really good, but really sweet -- so one dessert was fine.  I cannot wait to go back. Maybe one of the best openings in 2011. Of course they waited until NYE. We got one of the larger tables in the back on opening night and they didn't disappoint. While most people were out doing fancy cut throat NYE ""special menus"", we opted for the reputation of two chefs coming back into the game. Turns out the ex Rubicon gang came back with many of their past co workers so the night started off with a staff that mostly knew each other in some way or another. The long corridor with the reception at the front of the kitchen line was not something I expected. I knew where the place was but still did a double take. The combination of industrial space, cafe, and dim sum style service makes for an interesting mix. Things come out on trays in carts, etc, etc. Being the gluttons we are, we had two (yes 2) of everything that was offered:crudité with goat cheese & toasted sesametofu with lime, ginger & fennelpickled wild mushrooms with root purees & hazelnutschicken 'salad' with buddha's hand & celery root curdsourdough kraut ricotta & pecorino pancakes'pain au poivre' with oxtail mushroom gravycarnitas stuffed squidrye bread & red beet 'viennoise' with horseradish-ale creamsmokey-grilled chicories with urfa-yogurtfried quail with lemon stewed onionsfragrant spiced shrimp with yogurt whey & pomegranateroasted carrots & braised jammy greensmeyer lemon chocolate croquettes with blue bottle coffee sabayonmilk chocolate sesame crunch, clementine-cocoa jamdrunken cherry caramel chocolate mistakechestnut buckwheat profiterolepeanut muscovado milkwarm fig cinnamon swirlsHow's that for a spread? I think we put some fear in the line and front of house as we just tore stuff down non stop. The bonus? everything was delicious and intriguing. The flavor and ingredient combinations are thought provoking while tasty. I think the Fillmore area just got a huge boost and I know where my de facto before shows around the area is now. StatebirdSF certainly ended the year with a bang! (See pics)Review #1095.Inventive items without a menu boundary. State Bird, as the owners used to hike along the peninsula and saw the quails walking around, was the name.A tribute to California and bay area especially with lighter taste that pleases the local healthier crowds, a focus on using ingredients that we are all familiar with but with an interesting twist.Interesting concept-- tapas serving in dim sum tray style as they walk around with freshly made food on scene. The space has a fusion of post 1906 earthquake brick exposed walls on 1 side, sound proof look-alike wall on the other. A very high ceiling and deep space for an eatery.The utmost important dish with the battered fried quail which was very delicious, juicy and delightful. All other dishes we tried, such as duck rillettes, steak bites with a fried egg and vegetables, full on fresh and lightly grilled vegetables with goat cheese, properly cooked pasta with crab meat and peas, duck confit on baked slightly sweetened dough, dumplings, etc etc. All were good with lots of tones in them.For the desserts, the very fine powdered peanuts with milk pouring over it was my favorite as it was very light in liquid but silky in taste. The chopped nuts and raisins in Ganache chocolate sauce, an unplanned put-together dessert in the owner's kitchen in the past, has become a hit and was lovely delicious.Also a simple but good list of wines (for food and dessert), tea and BB coffee are a good balance for the varied plates.On a strip that is filled with mostly Asian eateries, a couple bars and a few music venues, here flies the State Bird Provisions. Owner Stuart enthusiastically described his childhood hiking and seeing quails along the way was a nice touch to this new place. This will be a place where you will find different dishes at every visit. YAY FOR MENAGE A TROIS!Do you enjoy inventive New American cuisine?Do you enjoy Tapas style dining?Do you enjoy yum yum Dim Sum?If you answered, ""YES"" to all of  the above, then you will love State Bird Provisions.SBP is discreetly located in the FillMo'. Having just opened on NYE, it's still without any signage. However, you can't miss it being next door to the glowing neon signs of Won Mi, a Korean restaurant that I personally banned myself from after nearly taking down a wall of banchans at 2:30 AM. Um yah, we won't even get started on that one. :XSBP's menu consists of inventive and adventurous American Tapas flawlessly executed with fresh, seasonal ingredients seamlessly paired together creating culinary mini-masterpieces with well balanced flavors and textures. There is no set menu. Each night, about 14-16 dishes come around a la dim sum carts/trays. See something you like? Point and get it. In my case, this is why I LOVE dim sum aka The 'SEE'food Diet, I get to eat EVERYTHING I see.F O O D*Prices: $2-12/dish; most were $6-$8*3-4 dishes/person is sufficientAn average of 4 STARS, below are the dishes we sampled last night listed from my most favorite to least favorite. *BRAISED OXTAIL in 7-Pepper Flatbreadyelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG… The STAR of the night, the warm, crisp, and fluffy flatbread was generously filled with savory tender shreds of oxtail. The light smearing of yogurt sauce gave a delightful layer of creamy tanginess. *FRIED QUAIL w/ Lemon Stewed Onions yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG… Deliciously crunchy on the outside and succulently moist in the center, the fried quail was lip smacking good. The citrus from the onions added a ray of sunshine while the parmigiano-reggiano gave a savory saltiness.*TROFIE PASTA w/ Dungeness Crab & Pancettayelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG… A perfect rendition of a pasta surf and swine, the al-dente twisted pasta married the sweet crab meat with a scrumptious crisp, fatty richness from the pancetta bits. *PORK RIBS in a Pork Brothyelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG… The carniwhore in me rejoiced with these ribs. The subtle smoky ribs were crisp around the edges and tender on the inside. The broth was like an au jus imparting a layer of briny saltiness.*BEEF TONGUE PASTRAMI CROSTINI w/ Bone Marrow Sauceyelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG… The holy grail of all crostinis, the beef tongue pastrami was delectably smooth and salty. The bits of bone marrow added a burst of beefy richness while the acidity of the red onion marmalade helped cut through the richness.*RYE BREADED BEETS w/ Horseradish Kaleyelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG… I loath beets but this dish made me a beet convert. Nicely coated with rye bread crumbs, the beets were fried to a robust golden brown and then lightly smeared with the horseradish kale sauce. Crisp, tender, and sweet, the beets were wonderfully delicious with a light nose tingle from the horseradish.*BRUSSEL SPROUTS w/ Squid & Mandarin Orangesyelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG… Crunchy brussels sprouts with tender squid tossed with sweet vibrant oranges made me miss the rare summer days in SF.*FARRO w/ Wild Mushrooms & Parmesanyelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG… Reminiscent of risotto, the farro grain was tender with a bite. The wild mushrooms and parmesan added an mouth-watering earthiness and a salty creaminess.*DUCK NECK DUMPLINGS yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG… My least fav dish of the night, the pan-fried skin was too thick and very doughy which hindered the taste of the duck neck. The broth was also very salty.S E R V I C EConsidering they've only been open 10 days, the staff operates just as flawlessly as the food. They're warm, genuinely friendly, and knowledgeable.We got a chance to chat with co-owner, Stuart Brioza (Rubicon) who was a cool cat. The immense passion he has is emanated in the careful and artful preparation of the food and the attentive service of his staff. A M B I A N C E / D E C O RCasual and inviting, SBP's open kitchen is the highlight of this 40+-seating restaurant. As you're waiting to be seated, your eyes and your nose will be tantalizingly teased on what's to come. Dimly lit and not overly noisy, it's a great place to take a foodie on a date.P A R K I N GDifficult street parking on weekends. There's a garage 1 block away across from Yoshi's; $3 for the 1st hour, $1 for each add'l hour. SBP is a living testament that a Menage A Trois DOES work! Honey, don't knock it till you've tried it... Came with 5 other girlfriends for dinner last night. Great concept (food served dim sum style), but that also means that the food is lukewarm once it arrives. They need those real steel dim sum carts that hold in the heat. Portions are quite small too. We had to wait awhile for food to come by and it was also intermittent. We stopped midway through the meal b/c everyone was kinda disappointed with the food. The food wasn't bad at all and was well prepared and unique w/fresh ingredients. None of the dishes stood out either. We didn't get to the dessert, but they looked tasty. We ended up going to Sophie's crepes to fill our tummys. Friendly service. There's no sign outside the door, so it made it difficult to find! In short, the food here is executed at a very high technical level, with friendly staff, and flavors & techniques you have likely not seen before. As far as food- be sure to grab 1-2 plates of the oxtail & pepper bread-- the braised meat lining the fried bread is an experience. Ask how the bread is prepared.Oh. Oh. And the pork ribs are excellent. Braised then grilled goodness.The staff touted the fried quail as the hallmark dish, but the idea felt kitschy, the appearance clunky, and flavor under-whelming.Chicories- unfortunately these were inedible...beyond sour & burned.As far as service & timing, you need to bare in mind that SBP has opened very recently AND re-invented a style of dining, their timing will be ironed out in coming months. That being said, it would have been nice to have received more attention from the wait staff in between dishes.  First-month diners are worth listening to: they've likely anticipated your opening for weeks, if not, months; and likely know more about your concept than you think.As far as additions, a full bar would be nice, of course license permitting.  For what they do carry,  I didn't really get the wine program. I'm always curious to hear the story behind the wine list & why specific wines were carried. Didn't get that.SBP is for the SF diner seeking a new experience, but with seasoned staff, and intricate flavors. You'll also need to be patient, show up hungry & not mind the Reagan-era dining room interior. Everything was delicious! The flavor pairings were all great and my 5-person group pretty much tried everything that wasn't solely a vegetable dish. (We weren't in a healthy mood.) The unique dim-sum serving style made the eating process very leisurely, but if you come hungry you'll probably not appreciate it as much until you've gotten a few dishes in you. However, that said, use the time in between dishes to really savor the flavors and textures! Savory must-try's: - pickled wild mushrooms with root purees & hazelnuts- anything with duck- 'pain au poivre' with oxtail mushroom gravy- bone marrow bread- the state bird provision (fried quail with lemon stewed onions)Sweet must-try's: - chocolate croquettes with rosemary-meyer lemon sabayon- milk chocolate sesame crunch, clementine-cocoa jam, coffee cream (it was like a refined Krackle)For all those tea drinkers out there: try the white chrysanthemum tea! It's really light and went well with everything. The price of the dishes were a bit on the more expensive side, though, and after all was said and done, our bill came out to be about $170, including a pot of tea and 2 big bottles of beer, excluding tip. For the price each of us paid, I personally would have liked to walk away feeling very stuffed, rather than feeling contently filled, but that's just me wanting to feel like I got a great deal. Last thing to mention is parking, which is hit-or-miss on the surrounding streets. I would recommend driving around the block once or twice just to see if you get lucky, otherwise you can always use the Fillmore parking lot which is just one block away. We paid $5 for 2 hours there, which isn't bad at all. This is one of those restaurants you need to go to now before it gets yelped to death. The clock is ticking! Think Dim Sum-style California fusion dishes.Each dish come out in multiples of about four on a tray to be selected by various tables. Dessert comes out on a quaint cart which really needs to be a little narrower and allow rotation in all four wheels: in other words, not designed for functionality.The oxtail, Bone Bread (pretzel-roll) with marrow sauce, and the beet salad are my favorite, and most of the rest of the things we tried (and I think we tried everything except the sardines on toast - we were full, not uninterested) was solidly good and interesting. A few dishes were pedestrian in design, although executed well, and only one seemed to be showing off its outré ingredients.Deserts were similarly inventive and rather good, especially the fig arugula.We were there on the second night of operation, and we hope it does well. The number of cooks in the open kitchen as well as the number of servers seem prohibitive for long-term success; we assume they have run the numbers and know what they are doing. I had New Year's Eve dinner here with some friends...a group of 5 of us.  This is a new venture from the chefs from Rubicon.  After talking to our server, it sounds like a lot of other staff followed them also.  When you walk in, don't be confused by the open kitchen that dominates the front of the restaurant...walk a little further in, & someone will help you.  So, you get a menu for drinks, then they leave a ticket at your table.  The meal works dim sum style, meaning they will bring trays/carts of the food around, and you pick out what you want as they come around, & they mark the ticket with a hash mark.  Oh, they do tell you what the dish is, unlike dim sum, where you generally have to ask if you don't know.We were the gluttons who ordered two of every dish that came out (17 savory dishes & 4 sweet) so that everyone at the table could try everything!  We thought there were only going to be 10-11 savory dishes, but they just kept on coming...Here's their menu from online.  We pretty much had all of the savories & then some that weren't on the list (pork ribs, caviar & chips, chocolate cherry mistake).  We didn't have all of the desserts on the list, so I deleted those.  crudite with goat cheese & toasted sesametofu with lime, ginger & fennelpickled wild mushrooms with root purees & hazelnutschicken 'salad' with buddha's hand & celery root curdsourdough kraut ricotta & pecorino pancakes'pain au poivre' with oxtail mushroom gravycarnitas stuffed squidrye bread & red beet 'viennoise' with horseradish-ale creamsmokey-grilled chicories with urfa-yogurtfried quail with lemon stewed onions  (yes, they serve their namesake here; makes sense, doesn't it?)fragrant spiced shrimp with yogurt whey & pommegranateroasted carrots & braised jammy greenscrispy chocolate croquettes with rosemary-meyer lemon sabayonpeanut muscovado milkclove spiked fig cookiesEverything was spot on...I had lunch with one of my friends who was at that dinner today, & we were talking about how the every dish was solid with innovative flavor combinations.They offer wine & beer, & tea.  Our group actually didn't have any alcohol & did our drinking later in the evening.Décor is simple, minimalist...the wall we were sitting against was a pegboard.Service was very good...staff was pleasant, professional, yet friendly.There's a single room unisex restroom at the back. Located on the west side of Fillmore, between Geary & OFarrell.  The storefront is narrow, & there's no signage (at least not on the night I went), so I walked right past it at first. Support this establishment. Expect to be surprised by tasty food and service. Love it. I give them points or stars for attempting the whole dim sum restaurant theme.  It's different and it may actually work if those carts they ""cart"" around were actually filled with food.  Dim Sum calls for choice and they need a huge selection of small bites to make the masses happy, or maybe just the Chinese folks.  This one cart I saw pass by had two desserts on it, pathetic.  The same cart with the same 2 desserts passed by maybe 3 more times.  The ribs which came out a bit later as we were wrapping up our meal was delicious!  Now if only that stuff came out in the beginning.  Very attentive staff who will give you a description of each dish as they make a stop by your table.  Sitting in the back, may cause you to get the rejects dishes, unless they have some system implemented already.  The space is small, and we were lucky we got a table for 2.  Do yourself a favor and make a reservation.  It's definitely worth a try! :) The food was amazing,,,so many different items yet they all married well.  The concept is fun, dim sum style plates arricv at the table and you decide if you want to indulge or wait for the next wave of food to come around.  I think they are still working out a few kinks with service but everyone was very nice and knowledgable.  I love the quail, i remember the quail from Rubicon.   We had some fun dishes, the calamari was so tasty and the homemade bread with bone marrow sauce was yummy.  I can't wait to go back to see what else they come up with.  Good luck guys,,,so happy you are back on the scene. Amazing. You'll be addicted. The quality of a 5 star restaurant for good prices.I wasn't kidding about the last point. Stuart and Nicole used to be the chefs for Rubicon (in downtown San Francisco). Rubicon was owned by Drew Nieporent, who owns Nobu in New York.Tip: the desserts are a must try.The only caveat is I'm not sure the dim-summing thing is going to work out. I wish I could just order my food tapas style. I was looking forward to trying this restaurant based on some of the recent press I had read.  Walking into State Bird, it felt so warm and cozy. We were greeted by a friendly staff that made us feel like we have been friends for a while.  We tried almost everything on the menu and were excited by the idea of not knowing what was coming next.  All of the food that we ate was awesome and the prices were very reasonable.  Our favorites were the Quail, the tofu salad with grapefruit, and the Chocolate Cherry Mistake.  We are definitely going back real soon. When you walk in to SBP (as I'm sure it will get nicknamed) you see a pristine kitchen with a wonderful open kitchen to greet you. We were sat immediately and shown our wine menu, carefully tucked under the table. American/Californian Dim Sum is the concept and wow - it really blew me away. A tray of morsels, or a cart comes by at just the right time offering you little plates of gems. We tried everything that came around. Fresh greens with tofu (that I thought was fresh cheese, it was so tasty), Bone marrow and housemade bread stick, wild mushroom farro risotto, the State Bird (buttermilk roasted quail) with provisions of lemon onion confit, these amazing shrimp with a whey pomogranite jus, duck pate with corn financier and so many other things. I can't really write about it because my mouth keeps watering from lasts nights masterpiece! The dessert......well if you have never had Peanut milk, get here fast. I have a feeling it will be one of the most popular things they offer. I can't forget to mention the Rye bread Beet 'cake', it was stellar. The wine list was carefully chosen and beautifully presented. I chose a glass of Cava and a glass of Picpul. My tea was Pu-ehr and I have to say I was very impressed with the selection of tea. No one serves Pu-ehr like this.  The prices are exceptionally reasonable and the service is top notch. Each chef in the kitchen have worked at the top respected restaurants you all read about. I can't wait to go back to SBP for more yummy goodness. Felt so lucky to be invited by friends of friends to the soft opening this weekend and have literally been licking my lips ever since.  Great concept:  dim-sum style service makes dining not just more fun but also WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get).  For example fabulous lamb orzo bowl was my personal favorite but so rich and savory that one bowl sufficed for all three at our table.  Their Rye bread and red beet 'viennoise' with horseradish ale creation was quite possibly the single best bite-of-beet I ever set tongue to -- and hey,  I'm a foodie from beet-growing Ft. Collins in Colorado, so I know my beets baby.  Likewise the signature fried quail (our CA state bird) with lemon-steamed onions was unforgettable.  Crudites and wild-mushroom creations showcased the freshest local produce possible.   Opened with a surprising and satisfyingly glass of dry Picpoul from France; finished with perfectly-brewed Blue Bottle coffee served in a French press.  Our unanimously-declared favorite dessert (we couldn't help but sampled several) was the aptly-named ""Drunken caramel cherry Mistake"" -- which the chef discovered by happy accident.  Huge beautiful butcher block prep table as you enter sets the atmosphere for some serious cheffing.  Tables spaced widely for easy conversation (no bench-style seating with couples crammed together like quails).  Hurry up and grab a table before the line starts snaking around the corner! Came here for their soft opening tonight and things were looking good! The concept here is dim sum style. They'll bring plates of small plates on a tray or cart and you can pick whichever one you want. They'll place the dish on your table and will put a hash mark on your bill according to the price. Their signature dish is the ""state bird with provisions"" as this dish is deep fried quail with lemon stewed onions. The pickled wild mushroom was one of my favorite. This dish is full of flavors and texture (hazelnut is the crunchy when you eat it with the mushrooms). The spiced shrimp is also full of flavors - definitely a must!Their tea selection is very good also. I tried their ""dragon ball"" ice tea and their white chrysanthemum tea. Both were very light on flavor - which is my preference when it comes to tea. Their dessert selection is very nice. The combination of ingredients and flavors are very unique and it works. My favorite was the chestnut buckwheat profiterole and the bittersweet chocolate croquettes. The peanut muscovado milk was better than expected, probably because I've never had peanut milk as dessert before! The portions are small so you can definitely order 4-5 for 2 people. The price is also decent as they range from $5-$8 for the items we ordered tonight. You can definitely order all the items on the menu while you pop open a bottle of wine with a group of friends for the night. The staff is so friendly there that you will end up being there for hours! The open kitchen is located as you enter the door so you can see everything being made fresh right then and there. Come give this place a try before everyone else finds out about it!!!"|5|100|0|Routine|This inspection has no violations.|GOOD: no inspection needed
Rickybobby 0|4.0|American (New) in San Francisco, CA|$11-30|381|0|4.081967213114754|" Must try the pork fries! They come with an American flag, so you feel real patriotic. Only tried the short rib lasagna, in addition to the fries, and it was delicious, so I am sure everything else is fantastic as well. Definitely try to arrive early; it can get quite busy and there aren't many seats available. The sandwiches are delicious and huge! Mann sweet potato taters. The atmosphere is awesome and quirky. Also loud but that's part of the fun. It's communal seating and there's a projector overhead usually playing old Jackie Chan movies as well as music in the background. One night everyone starting singing along, it was awesome! This place was originally in the mission and the owners still do the same kind of cooking as they did then. However parking at this new place is horrendous! ! Definitely try the small streets. Impossible to find parking on Haight. When you walk in its like a house and the seating is kinda strange. We walked in and there were people waiting but since we tracked down the waiter guy he sat us down first. It's just weird they don't have some sort of host or waiting list cuz you can totally cut the line if u come. Just stand nearest to the inside. Food wise we got the lobster mac and cheese, pulled pork fries, and new burger. Lobster mac and cheese is as good as I remember but I wished it was more cheesy and less saucy. Pulled pork fries is waffle fries and lots of pulled pork. I Wish They Did F Have The Nacho Cheese Sauce Though. It's a bit overwhelming and guilty eating it. New burger is basically the bacon beef burger with an egg on it. Overall, homey feel with oily yet delicious food. Typical SF pricing. It is easy to be delicious when you deep fry everything and coat everything in butter, mayonnaise, oil, etc. Ok so the nacho fries are phenomenal! And so is the buffalo chicken sandwich but like I said before it's a given because everything is coated in lard...delicious lard. Yummm. Good for my body if I lived in Antarctica.....and was a whale. Those nacho buffalo pork fries... ...Sorry! Got distracted. A buddy/coworker of mine took my girlfriend and I out here as a thank you for letting him stay at our place. ANYWAY, so my buddy took us here for food and it was probably the best thank you anyone could have given to us for our hospitality. I'd go back and cheat on my diet again for this place. psPerson who shall remain nameless, if you ever stumble upon this yelp review... i was jking! and if you don't, I SUPER wasn't. Pork fries are out of this world, as were the biscuits, tater tot were average. I loved the cafeteria-style seating (Acutally ended up sharing food with the folks next oto us) Still as good as ever ... but the prices have gone up noticeably one year later.The crawshrimp grits w/ scallions and bacon (pork belly) is still my favorite dish but now it's $16.  The sweet potato tots are $6.  The spicy BBQ pork ribs ($16) is still a steal though as you get around 8 pieces of succulent ribs.  Also enjoyed the short rib lasagna.Be sure to leave room for dessert ... the vanilla ice cream sundae with cinnamon toast crunch cereal, bourbon caramel and roasted apples is huge but we devoured it no time.Love the really casual vibe of this place and the waitstaff is super attentive (never had to ask for refill on water).  Still one of my favorite spots in the city. The city, especially Haight, has some bawm eats, with great service. If you feelin for some unique comfort foods with good community service for dinner, here ya go.  This place is one of them local goodies!This corner restaurant is great for all crowds of all sizes. Their tables are large, clean finished picnic like tables, where different parties can sit together and share a meal. I love this kind of seating because it promotes community interaction since y'all are sitting at the same table, not all separate. Just get off your phones peeps! Talk with the peeps right in front of you!The menu changes here and there depending on what they have that day. The usuals that I go for include the sweet potatots, craw shrimp and grits, pork sandwich, and the bacon beef burger. The tots are golden orange goodness, balls of sweet potatoes fried to perfection with ketchup and ranch dippings that compliment the sweet tater flava. Forsure must get this as a group appetizer - they give so matz! The craw shrimp grits is heavy with crawfish and shrimp, it's so wonderfully overwhelming. They do not skimp on the seafood. The sauce with the grits is seafood tomato savory amaze balls. Yes my descriptions are weird, That's what happens when your mind is blown by the flavors. The pork sandwich and the burgers are great if you finna get a sandwich fix. Hearty heavy heaven. Not for the faint of heart, because you might get a heart attack from al the love in the food, and the unhealthiness. Doesn't taste unhealthy or greasy. But you know it is.The service is great, they treat you like you're a friend stopping by the crib for a bite. I always feel welcome and accommodated. Can get packed because the establishment isn't the biggest in the world. Also would suggest taking pub trans because parking can be a pain. The only downsides to having a spot in this area. Very highly recommended! Hipster chic meets fake Southern. I would give it 1.75 stars but that's not an option. Food mediocre and one-note flavor in each dish. The ribs came out lukewarm and the mac 'n' cheese tasted of seafood not lobster. Biscuits are good - but not the real deal. Slow but nice service. Perhaps someone should actually visit/come from the South before opening up a southern-themed restaurant? Very tasty comforting food. Don't come here if you're trying to eat healthy. I would give 5 stars but it is a little pricier than I think it should be. Last time we went my wife was really pregnant. This time we had our nanny watching our ten month old daughter while our heart and arteries were screaming.Same Rickybobby, but slightly higher prices. Slightly higher in increments, but not percentage. Beers were $4 when they opened, now $6. Entrees are now edging up to $16.Food is still tasty, but is basic home food that will lose it's luster if the prices continue to edge upward. Service actually stood out this time as this waiter was just on it. The IPA floweth and never went dry until the end. That said, knocking it down a star as the value side of the equation is trending downward. Okay Yelp, now you've done it - there's too long a line outside to get in on a weekend! We had to go to our second choice, nearby. Had the beef and bacon burger and the truffle fries for dinner. Communal seating was fun - met a couple from Seattle in town for the week.Burger was excellent - I'm planning to go back there again and have another. A tad overly salty, but delicious.Truffle fries on the other hand, I'll avoid. Found them way too salty. I finally tried this place the other night and it was pretty good.  Everything on the menu carefully crafted and flavors paired well.  I ordered the potato pancake with crab.... I was sort of disappointed in that it felt a little bland or was missing something.  The crab could have used some citrus or flavoring and the pancake could have used some sort of sauce.   The crab waffle fries were unbelievable! I want to get this as my entree next time.  I also tried a bite of my friend's short-rib lasagna and it was great! Excellent food if only the service was half as good. We stopped by last night. After waiting an hour for our table we say around for another 15 before we had to flag down our server (who was outside in his phone) to place out order and ask for water.  Not only was our food served haphazardly, resulting in some getting their food when everyone else was finishing, but our server literally threw the plates on the corner of the table. (I guess it was up to us to pass it along.) Very disappointed! I looked forward to eating here for months and months, hearing from my trusted foodie friend and fellow burger connoisseur Philip that this place had the ""best burger in SF"".  Usually this type of hype leads to disappointment and heartache (or heartburn) but this time, there was redemption!My friend Ryan and I went all out, splitting the Pork Fries which were waffle fries covered with pulled pork, cheese sauce, buffalo sauce.  They kind of looked like Southern Nachos, and they tasted amazing.    We then each couldn't think of a world where we'd share a burger and split a third item so we each got our own beef bacon burger (american cheese, house mayo, ketchup, onion and pickles on the side).  Now this is not just a burger topped with bacon (we've all been there, done that) but this is a burger with ground beef and ground bacon mixed together.  The taste is something quite ineffable, like food sex in your mouth.  If not the best burger in SF, it's up there in the upper strata with Zuni's and Marlowe's burger creation.Service was solid and while the place was pretty full on a Wednesday, we didn't really have a wait for our table. Ridiculously good food that I can only assume is also ridiculously bad for my waistline. Everything I nibbled on was insanely good from the pork fries to the short rib lasagna. Don't go here if you're on a diet as there isn't a whole lot on the menu for people on a reduced calorie diet. But for everyone else, the food is off the chain! Kudos to this little hidden gem in the Lower Haight. Definitely will be recommending RickyBobby to friends and tourists alike. LOVE this place. CrawShrimp Grits are Off the Hook! Bacon Beef Burger is delicious.Duck Confit Potato Skins sneak up on you. I thought they were just ok while eating them, but found myself craving more for the rest if the night.The menu here is very creative and very well done and they change it up.Service is great!Seating is restricted so expect a line. Literally stumbled into this joint on New Years Eve when my party was trying to kill some time and fill our bellies before an alcohol laden night of festivities. Only goes to show that a little spontaneity goes a long way :) First thing I noticed (and loved) was the communal dining aspect of the restaurant, which is pretty much comprised of a few long benches/tables and a menu written up on the wall. I've always liked the idea and feel of communal dining and this place executes it well. It took a little while for the server to get to us to take our orders but that's ok. It gave us a chance to absorb our cool surroundings... like the projected picture of the fireplace on the wall furthest from the menu wall. Like I said, cool ambience. My party ordered the sweet potato tots which were delicious. Perfect little bites of crunch and carbs. Yum. We also shared the crawfish grits which were pretty good. I'm a bit of a grits fanatic (and a little bit of a rhyming one too...u see wut i did) and the ones here were solid and CLOSE to the level of amazing that is Brenda's grits. CLOSE. which is still saying a lot. My party didn't end up ordering a lot but the rest of the menu looked really good so needless to say, I'll be coming back here soon! We had been to the Broken Record back in the day and was not a fan, BUT I figured this was a much better set up and way closer to my house, so how could it be a waste?We arrived at about 6:15 on a Thursday - parking was a bi-atch, so we looked for ""Construction parking permits"" and found a spot 2 blocks away.  We got right in, but was apparently the last table to get right in - a small line formed after us.I will say right off that I am a loud person, I don't mind loud restaurants, but this might have been THE loudest place I can remember eating at, I had to say everything 3 times to my bf across the communal table, annoying, the communal tables are fine, but if you sit across from your partner the tables are too wide making conversation difficult.We split the Duck Confit potato skins ($14), the bacon burger ($12) and the cauliflower gratin ($8).  It was all good, the burger was my favorite. I though $8 was a bit much for a small portion of the piping hot gratin.I was sad the 2 dessert offerings did not include the much hyped pie. Our choices (we didn't get either) was a key lime panna cotta and an ice cream sundae with warm fruit.The total was $34.  I wanted a glass of wine but house wine was $9, though it looked like a generous pour.The couple at our table got the stroganoff (which we had debated over the burger, and I am pleased we went with burger, as the stroganoff had a ton of yellow and red peppers in it, I could see and smell them.  Now, isn't stroganoff known for mushrooms, not peppers? My happiness that this place exists can't be contained in words.  This place can get extremely packed since the seating is pretty much just seat yourself communal tables. So either come early to beat the rush.. Or actually, just come and wait because this place is amazing.  They were playing Child's Play the last time I was there--already had a great time without the food even being served.I stopped by with 2 friends and we each selected a dish.  Unfortunately, it was already about 8pm on a Saturday night and they ran out of short rib lasagna.  Already disappointed, we settled for our second choices... Which made us totally forget about the short rib lasagna because everything else was incredible.First, Pork Fries, crisscross fries excessively topped with cheese, buffalo sauce and pork (and the US flag).  Spicy, filling and serving size was more than enough. Shareable. Then the beautiful Spicy BBQ Pork Ribs came out, served with a side of bacon potato salad. And I love potato salad, so I tried to tear that s**t up.  Again, more food that we can handle.  Then to climax, the Lobster Mac and Cheese--SMACK.  Upon touchdown with my palette, I wanted to stand up and shout because it was extremely rich and superseded anything I could think was possible.  I want to recommend it to everybody who gets the opportunity to stop by this place.  We didn't even finish our food, but definitely got our money's worth.Our server was a little too personable, like in your face friendly.  I ain't complaining. I came here for my friend bday and bacon burger because of yelp reviews.1-great customer service2- The burger I ordered  was overrated, it didn't satisfied me. The bun was big but when I lifted up the bun, my patties was small, like double cheese burger from mc donald.  My burger wasn't really hot or warm and salty.  Had to add ranch just to blend in the taste. It was really disappointed.  3-sweet potato tots was good.As yelp mentioned about the space and seats, yes they are small and crowd.  It didn't matter to me.  I only care about the food that they serve. Probably not gonna come back, not worth for me to drive up there and long wait for seat. I love Broken Record.  I believe that before I really knew anything about Broken Record or Rickybobby that I had just had a few drinks at the BR.  (I hear that there's some interesting history realating to both, but I'll leave that to the more informed minds out there.)  Along the way, I heard about the food - and then heard about Rickybobby in the Lower Haight.  Then, for about a year, I wanted to go.  Big plus - This is located a heck of a lot closer than hauling down to Crocker-Amazon.  Finally, my buddy and I made it.  Much like the BR, the menu is full of gems and you want to order it all.  BTW - We went on Friday night, and it was jumping.  We ordered the Potato Skins with Duck Confit.  We also had the Pork Fries.  The beer we drank was good.  I would have liked to have had a few other things on the menu.  AND - I still didn't get to try the Sweet-Potater-Tots.  :(   Overall, I would like to know the proper classification for this style of menu.  Really top-notch.We also had a nice dessert from the house.  Berry Panna Cotta.  Yum.  The service was extremely pleasant, and I loved the communal table seating environment.  Although, it does lead to ridiculous food envy.  Go.  ***Oh yeah - It's no longer BYOB.  I would have figured anyway, but I notice a lot of the reviews mention this. A friend and I beat the dinner crowd by about 20 minutes last night, thank goodness! This place gets busy. We started with the pork fries- which could have passed for a shared meal. It was a hearty helping of sweet potato waffle fries, pulled pork, cheesy goodness and buffalo sauce. Needless to say, we finished the plate. Then came dinner. I ordered the beef and bacon burger and will never look at bacon burgers the same again. As the nice waiter told us, it's about a 1-1 ratio of bacon and beef mashed together into one patty. He wasn't kidding on the ratio. My friend ordered the spicy bbq pork ribs and while I didn't try them (I was busy with my burger, thanks), she couldn't stop raving about 'em. The guys working the restaurant were friendly and seemed to be really on top of their game. Our guy knew the menu, made great recommendations and their timing between the appetizer and our main dishes was perfect. I can't wait to go back and try the dessert(s)! Four star food, one star seating. The lasagna was absolutely wonderful. The lobster mac-n-cheese was a little different from what I expected - but when I took a bite, I gasped; it was so delicious.  I'm not a sweet potato fan, so I was skeptical of the tater tots, until my date made me eat one. I think I ate half the plate of them, they were so good. The ranch dipping sauce was excellent. I can't say enough good things about the food. It was outstanding. The dining experience, on the other hand, was less than comfortable. Instead of one communal table amid a sea of ""normal"" restaurant tables, every table was communal. Some fat people sat next to us. The dude's gut was pressed into the table. Every time he coughed, laughed or twitched (which he did a lot), I could feel the table shake. The whole situation put an unpleasant damper on our enjoyment of the amazing food.  I would have been much happier with delivery that night.  So, F-U, owners, for not giving us even the option of sitting by ourselves.  Two stars, and we won't be back. Nice wooden decor and interesting food and good beverage choices. Really enjoyed my ahi tuna soba noodle bowl. There's a duel headed cow head hanging in the restaurant that's pretty cool. The food was sooo good! I really enjoyed this place. It's busy busy busy though, we had a little wait. But the food was worth it. The buttermilk biscuit was the best my friends and I ever had! I know it's just a biscuit but it was so delicious. We got the crawfish grits-amazing! The lobster Mac and cheese was really rich but delicious as well. And the pork fries were killer! Also, I forget if it was steak lasagna, but that was scrumptious too! Crawshrimp grits. If there's anything that will give me a foodgasm, it's this. After the first bite, my nipples instantly got hard. Then I got a second bite with some cheesy grits in the mix. I actually lactated, popped a boner, and felt tingles on my taint all at the same time. I just kept eating until I was soaked in sweat and wet dreams. Rickybobby, you definitely tickle my pickle. I'm coming back with lube next time. lobster mac n cheese was yummy and lots of lobster.    the crawshrimp grits was a little fishy, but addition of spice helped it.  that was a little so -so at the restaurant, but as a leftover the next day was quite good.  The drumsticks were okay, but the flaky biscuit with honey butter was a winner.  We all took bites of the biscuit and then later dipped the waffle fries and chicken in it.  delicious.  The pulled pork waffle fries were tasty also.     We loved the vanilla ice cream sundae with the bourbon sauce...   not bad for 2 adults and a 5 yo old.  yummmmmm....     i'd love to come back for the bacon beef burger.... This was our 2nd trip to this restaurant - we came back for a reason!First trip: I got the burger (dripping, delicious, and served with pickled veg) and my husband got the stroganoff (full of flavor, juicy meatballs) and we split the sweet potato tots (crispy and downright hard to stop eating!)Second trip: Tots again :) I think that these could really benefit from a better sauce to dip in other than just ranch or ketchup. Maybe just a spicy ketchup? I got the ribs (holy moley - tangy, spicy, sweet, tender -get these!!) which come with potato salad (my husband was wild about the salad, as for me I thought it was nothing special). Hubs got the special which was a potato pancake with crab on top (very yummy - it was accompanied by a citrusy salad w/ beets, a very nice flavor combo). It's always been busy when we've come - but we've gotten seated within about 20 and they'll get you beers while you wait! A bunch of dudes work here and they're pretty friendly despite running from table to table.Unless you have 5-6 people on your party the seating is at communal tables. I'm a fan of communal seating at places like these. Bottom line: come HUNGRY (or take it home), don't be a vegetarian, and expect to wait a bit at least on weekend nights. This place was on point! Original, fast, friendly, delicious, and a unique atmosphere! I ordered a large serving of the lobster mac and cheese, and my date ordered the bacon burger with sweet potato tots! All neatly plated and so sooo flavorful! The staff was quick and very helpful! Our waiter Thomas was so sweet! We'll definitely be back soon! :) On a first visit here, was very pleased with the service, and the food was excellent.  It also hit like a rock - a lot of cheese, a lot of bacon, a lot of deliciousness. Will definitely go again, in about six months, once I've had a chance for the rich food to settle. One of my (75) New Years Resolutions is to write more Yelp! reviews, so here goes.I went on a Saturday ""night"" for dinner at 6:30 pm.  I was starving and my boyfriend doesn't like it when I'm hangry, especially when I'm hangry for a burger, so he acquiesced and we grabbed the early bird special. (Note: there is not actually such a special, for you literalists out there).  At 6:30 pm, the place was already packed.The Skinny (or, more appropriately, The Fatty):I got the bacon and beef patty burger for $12.  It comes with not one but two patties, an excessive (read: perfect) amount of american cheese, and a bun.  I really could've gone for a little tomato/lettuce action to cut the savory richness of the burger, but the kitchen didn't have any!  They had lettuce which they graciously brought us, but there was no tomato to speak of.  I liked the burger, but it was definitely gluttonous.  I got very sleepy halfway through the meal.We also got the basket of truffle fries with parmesan ($9/basket) which I thought were a biiiit overpriced given the fact that I could barely taste the truffle.  Next time, I'd go for the smaller size - I think it's a ""side"" as opposed to a ""basket"" - for $6. I liked the vibe/space a lot.  Wood tables with benches, good for groups (if you go early to get a spot), definitely hipstery but not pretentious.  Super friendly and attentive staff.  If you're a vegetarian, maybe think twice. This place was really good. The burger, the ribs, all the fries and the grits were all tasty and SUPER filling. The burger is probably my personal fave. Would only take away one star because I prefer places that are maybe A LITTLE less heavy handed. That said, if you want to be full and have some great and flavorful meaty and deliciously satisfying food, this place will do the trick.The atmosphere is laid back and fun and the seating arrangement is fun for groups. Menu is relatively limited (you may not want to take your vegetarian friends here), but it's a good thing, because it means you can't go wrong no matter what you order! Go. Order everything that whets your appetite. That's what we did and it was an experience. Definitely on the pricier side, more expensive than some of the outdated yelp photos. On the upside EVERYTHING TASTES GOOD. We asked the waiter what was good and he told us that everything is good and he was right! So feel free to try it all! The portions are a tad small and the service is slow but the food was definitely worth it. The beef and bacon burger patty is supposed to be a 50/50 blend of beef and bacon but I honestly couldn't tell. The crawshrimp grits, lobster mac and cheese, burger, and sweet potato tots are all recommendable. Just eat everything, oh my god. It took my a while to finally get here ... but I made some shake and bake and BAM, lord baby jesus ... I ARRIVED.1. I'm very glad they moved here! Parking seems to be a lot easier when coming here for dinner.2. Their Menu seems to have expanded JUST a bit.3. service here - still just as awesomenow onto the FOOD:1. pulled pork fries - wow these are really good! I thought i would feel all nasty from something that looks and tastes heavy but you really dont!2. crawfish grits - same delicious crawfish grits that have changed since the old days from broken record.3. lobster mac - still the same delicious hot and cheesy lobster mac! I really liked how they tried not to change anything at all and it was just mainly a nice move to a bigger spot. It is a bit farther drive for me now but I dont mind since it's a bigger spot with more places to sit. Oh they have servers now too. big ups! I enjoyed my chicken and tator tot dinner but I don't understand why there is constantly a line for this place. The food was great! The menu is full of wonderful choices (its almost hard to choose). The service was quick and friendly. The seating was a bit liberal and kind of tight (communal seating). The price is a little high but not completely unreasonable. We will go back but not your everyday kind of place.Completely unrelated to the food or experience but the projector image being all crooked drove me crazy, haha. A quick keystone adjustment would fix this (seconds with the remote). :] YUM! My boyfriend and I love this place, plus it's in the neighborhood!  The staff is always super friendly and the food is delish.  The wait can sometimes be a bother, but we just hang at a local bar while our wait time dwindles.  If you're considering, you should definitely check it out! I was really excited to try this place because I heard a lot about how the old chefs from Broken Record started this joint.  I ordered 5 things to share with my friends and they were all pretty good!Truffle fries - yum, perfect fries with parm cheese!!!!   Fries were crisp to perfection and they do not skimp you on cheese and fries.  big ol basket of delicious fries and parm cheese.Lobster mac n' cheese - i've been waiting to try this since I heard of it!  Full of flavor with chunks of lobster mixed in with some spinach and corn.   It was something I really wanted to try and it was flavorful, but it was definitely too salty for my tasting.Pork fries - this one was the winner to me!!!!!  very crisp waffle fries topped with tender pulled pork, cheesy goodness and some green onions!  every bite was delightful and i'd definitely get this again next time!Beef and bacon burger - soft bun with a patty and bacon+cheese!  it was better than your average burger, so if you're craving a burger, get it, but if not, there are a lot of other choices to select from.Pork sandwich - it was a lot like a chicken parm sandwich because of the breading, but it was more like a fried/baked porkchop.  It was tasty and a unique sandwich that many places do not have.  All the food went great with a pitcher of beer.  The prices are a little high, but all the ingredients and the food seem very fresh and home-made. =) I came here for my sister's birthday on a Tuesday night around 8:45. Our server Michael was awesome overall, but more so for offering to bring out a little cake that I had brought for her (totally unexpected, I was just planning on giving it to her to take home). Michael even put candles in it. However, while we were eating the cake, we could hear people in the open kitchen making fun of us for singing happy birthday. Like literally cursing and calling us names. I can understand that Rickybobby does't want to be one of those restaurants where servers are always bringing out birthday desserts and singing, and yes it was a little cheesy,  but we were only three people and there was literally only one other table in the restaurant and the whole thing took like 25 seconds. We all just felt really uncomfortable afterwards, and it ruined my sister's birthday dinner. Michael, you were great, thank you. The drinks were good, the food was fine, the mac & cheese had a velveeta-y texture, if you like that, and all the shellfish was an odd red color (I presume because it was fake even though the dish was $16). Kitchen people, you ruined my sister's birthday dinner. Know that if you have an open kitchen that faces the restaurant, people can hear you make fun of them. I hope people read this review and decide not have to special events at your restaurant. Wasn't having a good day and needed a pick me up for the cold winter Wednesday. We hadn't been to Ricky Bobby for a few months and wasn't expecting much.First, was a little shaken, that more than 50% of their small menu. Didn't expect to be as happy with the dishes. None the less, ordered the following and was blown away with the new item menus.* Duck Confit Potato Skins $14 manchego, ranch, truffle oil (5 of 5) Baked potato cradles chunks of duck confit. I loved the ranch sauce. They could have used sour cream, but ranch with the dill pieces mixed with the duck and potato even better. * Lobster Mac n Cheese $16 crab, corn, spinach, lobster bechamel (5 of 5) Cheesy goodness with strong shellfish flavors and meat chunks. Love the bits of corn for subtle crunch and sweetness when taking mouthfuls of cheesy bow ties.* Portabella Mushroom Risotto $13 eggplant ragout, burrata, fresh basil, chile oil (5 of 5) Was expecting them to mess up on risotto. Nope. They did such a great job and I absolutely love love love the burrata in the middle and the fresh basil. I don't know how they do it. Everything tasted soooooooooooo good. All the new dishes were mind-blowing perfect. No complaints. And I can't pick which one was better.I walked out of the restaurant, warmer and happier. My tummy was so happy. Thank you Ricky Bobby for being so innovative and caring how things taste. It totally brought some light into my bad day. Nice little place with awesome food.  Crawfish grits oh so good!!! Pretty freaking delicious.The Burger with Avocado wasn't disappointing. I'll rank it as my best burger in San Francisco so far (been here for 6 months). Still kind of expensive, $13 for a burger without fries, but it's worth it. This is a happy place. The menu is strictly comfort food, with 1-2 dishes for those not looking for a heart attack anytime soon.We had the burger, italian wedding soup, and grits. The burger is like a double decker with american cheese and ketchup and whatnot, which kinda just reminds me of a nicer mcdonald's burger.. bc I don't like american or ketchup. The soup was amazing and chock-full of goodies (pancetta meatballs! kale!) so quite filling. The ""crawshrimp"" grits had broth on it, which combined with the cheesy grits becomes this like very rich Southern flavor explosion. Sweet potatots were a big hit but I preferred the truffle parm fries, so thin and crispy. Wish the parm was like the fresh stuff they put on the soup, but eh.The grits came out after everyone had finished the other entrees, so they comped that and offered us free drinks and dessert, which was REALLY nice of them. The pumpkin pie was quite spice-y, which some of us liked more than others. The ice cream with cinnamon toast crunch was surprisingly kick-ass. So simple and yet WHY haven't we done this before?! Learn something new every day.No reservations, but the 4 of us sat down immediately on a Saturday night. The food was delish but I was a little disappointed they did not have much on the healthy side. They had a broccoli dish but it came with cheddar cheese. We got the wedge salad to split and it was good but not much to it. We also split the pork burger and the sweet potato tots and both were BOMB. The service was also really great and polite yet casual. So um, since I couldn't find the answer in any of the Yelp reviews on here, I guess I'll ask my question here. Is there any relation of Rickybobby to Talladega Nights? If not, I'd be a little bit disappointed. Anyways, here's my ballad to Rickybobby.Praise baby jesus the food here is amazing (okay that's the last Talladega nights quote I'll use, I'm sorry). They have a bacon burger where the pretty much grind up bacon and mix it in with their ground beef and make a patty out of that. Food like that shouldn't exist but oh my god I am so glad it does. It made the whole burger taste like one huge piece of bacon and there is nothing at all wrong with that. Their pork fries are of the ""once you pop you just can't stop"" variety of food. Sweet potatertots taste...kinda exactly what you'd expect it to taste like so nothing all too exciting there.Now I'm supposed to take off a star here because their waiter called my friend out on not hearing our drink orders correctly, but I just can't do it. It tasted too good to give anything below a 5. I really want to come back here, especially for their dessert menu. Last time I was here they had pumpkin pie with pop tart crust, and they had a Cinnamon Toast Crunch milkshake. Seriously? Are you trying to make me fat? Well that's okay I'll let you make me fat if you serve me stuff like that. So I'll be back soon so that can happen. Everything here is BOMB.COM!Shared the crab melt, sweet potato tots, biscuits and gravy, shrimp and grits, and pork fries.Good 'ol comfort food at its finest. Service was on point.Would definitely come back when I want to PIG OUT! nomnomnom :) Soooo happy I finally got to try Rickybobby. Went to broken record only to find out the kitchen moved. I was determined to find out where they moved to and when my friend told me their new location, we made it a mission to come try. We came here right when they opened so there wasn't a wait but the place filled up fast! By the time we left, there was a line. We ordered the crawfish and grits, beef lasagna, and sweet potato tots. I was really looking forward to trying their lobster mac and cheese but it wasn't on the menu that night. Out of the three, my favorite was the beef short rib lasagna. The crawfish and grit was good too but a little too soupy for my liking. Will come back to try the mac and cheese soon! SQUISHED. Not cramped, SQUISHED. There's not enough room here! Too bad for my two friends beside me, cause I love the intimacy caused by the lack of space. It makes laughter that much more contagious, no? Regardless of your space requirements, Rickybobby serves up some seriously good food. If you're looking for real comfort food that is comes in good portions, this is it. The American food here is top-notch and makes me want to come back, but the twist on Asian food keeps me on my toes!Spicy BBQ Pork Ribs with Bacon Potato Salad - SO GOOD. Came with 9 ribs, each with likely more meat than you're used to have on a typical rib. The meat falls off the bone and the sauce is just delightful and finger lickin' good. The accompanying potato salad solidifies the dish as one not for those watching their weight.Scallop Noodle Bowl - Really interesting. The seriously Asian style bowl cracks me up, but it's what's inside that makes me happy. The cold soba noodles with tasty scallops is a bit strange juxtaposed with the other dishes, but still good! A bit pricey for how much you get though.Sweet Potater Tots - It's not as special as the other dishes, but the tots can be a great appetizer! A must have for those who love sweet potato fries.Pork Fries - This is the dish that you THINK you can replicate, but will never achieve (okay, maybe not for the real driven folks). You have a fork, but what you want to do is eat with both hands. It comes in a well sized portion, and you gotta love the flag of Murika' on it. *SALUTES* Any restaurant that uses the word ""DRANK"" for their menu's beverage category header is already scoring major points with me. Then throw in Sweet Potato Tater Tots and a Pork Tenderloin larger than my first car ... and now you're just after my own heart. It's really, really loud here, so not exactly conducive to intimate dinner conversations, but with this caliber of naughty but nice comfort food staring at you, there shouldn't be much call for a lot of unnecessary chatter, anyway. Stumbled across this place while looking for a good casual dinner in the Lower Haight.The burger was good. As expected from a hipster-priced burger.But the Sweet Potatertots were amazing. These would bring me back.Looking forward to trying some other things on the menu. Some yummy, fried things. The few times I came here, I can easily say that the food...IS AMAZING.Constantly changing their menu and reimagining bar foods with a classy upscale upgrade has done wonders for my tastebuds.  I got to try the Beef & Bacon Burger (though a staple, the other two orders outshined this guy), Crab Melt with mozerella (you definitely feel at home with this classic but your mouth thanks you for the bonus seafood upgrade), and scallop noodles (basically soba but on crack since you'll get a crunch here and a bit of a spicy kick with each bite/slurp - probably my favorite for this trip).Food greatService greatThough it says yes on yelp for take-out, this is not true.  Keep in mind that once you win the war on parking in the streets of SF, you must sit down to enjoy your meal. Sweet potatertots and biscuits and gravy? Yes, please!  Came here on a Friday night, was seated promptly, and enjoyed a lovely meal of comfort food. It's definitely a lot of food - but those biscuits and gravy were just as good the next day, if not better! Went here for some grub on Halloween Night and left extremely impressed.Tried the Squash Salad, Sweet Potatertots and Drum Sticks. Everything was delicious. Price point was reasonable and the service was great.Can't wait to go back and try everything else on the menu. A friend brought me here for dinner and I did not know what to expect OMG, the food was so damn good!!! I felt like I probably should run 10 miles the next day but it was so worth it! Pulled Pork Fries: Delicious grubbinessCrawfish Grits A-MAZ-ING!Bacon Burger: Delicious!Highly recommend! - be prepared for a wait- loud when crowded- you'll have to share a table with someone else if you have a party of less than 5- awesome sweet potatertots- spicy shrimp grits is delicious- big portions! good atmosphere.  friendly service.  it got packed as the night went on.the burger was one of the best ive had in a long time.  brioche bun was light and a little crispy.  the patties were thick, juicy, and meaty.  but they werent so big as to induce beef overload.  most importantly the patties are equal part beef and bacon.  this combination is awesome.  the chewy saltiness of the bacon breaks up the meatiness of the beef.i didnt try anything else, but everybody was very satisfied with their meals. the food does not taste good. i'm not sure what the rest of yelp is eating. it is overrated as hell. the costco drumsticks are not good. i also had a bad experience with the service, but i can handle bad service. it's when someone thinks they are doing everything right, and has an attitude that the customer is wrong, is when i get a bit offended WOW! I been hearing about this place and I finally tried it! Boy, this place is the spot to eat, drink, and catch up with friends. What I ordered: +Crab shell tacos 2 for $14+Potato tots $6+spicy bbq ribs with bacon potato salad (RECOMMEND) $15 +Green flash-IPA $6 The food was absolutely delicious! The atmosphere was lively and definitely a great place to grab a beer. I wish they had the lobster macaroni and cheese but they said to CHECK BACK IN A MONTH. The service was excellent, and the tables are pretty much open. It's a sit down place, but if the table is larger than the group, be prepare to share with a stranger. No complains on this place. Great food again and great vibes. I'll be back! When I think of tater tots I think of gross, greasy, clumpy pieces of crap that my school served me. The sweet potatertots were delicious enough for me to change my opinion about the tater tots as a race. Seriously, it must be like Vicodin because I was popping them into my mouth and not giving a damn if my friends had their fair share and as if I just robbed some dealer off the street and eating them before the cops showed up.My friends and I showed up right when they opened 6pm on Saturday and managed to nab seats quickly. Besides the tots, we got the Beef and Bacon burger and the crawshrimp grits. I thought my grits were alright, definitely could have used a friend to help me eat them as they were quite cheesy and heavy. And that beef and bacon burger is amazing. This restaurant is the bomb, and I need to get my butt up to lower haight more often to experience the beauty of Rickybobby. Service isn't too bad to boot and despite them having a huge waiting line, I never felt rushed. I'm a fan of an establishment that takes on one of the mure turbulent corners in the Haight and says, I'm Ricky Bobby, ""Hey, it's me, America!"".  But, and here is the but ... I'm gluten intolerant.  Soy sauce is a silent killer for us gf folks so naturally I asked about it on the chicken drums  Our server seemed a bit bro and haughty, which seemed fitting for a place called Ricky Bobby.  After heading to the kitchen our server comes back with ...   ""I just spoke with the owner / head chef and this is what he said ... straight out of the owners mouth.  I don't know if soy sauce is in it and I don't know what the f@#$ gluten free is""Poor service for me guarantees a missed opportunity and a lower score.  But, I go back a few months later and our server was much more accommodating and the Portabella mushroom dish was fantastic.  So, R-bobs goes from a 2 to a 3, and I will be back, but not soon. Loved their food when they were at broken record, and still love it at this place. The pulled pork fries and sweet potatertots are killer. The tots are only served with ranch and ketchup now, but ask for a side of spicy mayo to go with them (they used to only come with that). The bacon burger is awesome, too. It's huge! My only thing is that the bacon really stood out more when they were at broken record.. Now you can barely taste it :( it was still really good though. The wait time was a good 30 mins and service was a little on the slower side since there were only two servers and a full house, but I'm not gonna take any stars off for that. I definitely plan on coming back. My first time eating Rickybobby's food did not disappoint.  As I'd learned from reliable sources that the fare at this relatively new restaurant located on the eastern edge of the lower Haight corridor deserved very high marks, I stepped up into this place expecting my socks to be knocked off.  Suffice it to say that I walked out an hour later barefooted, losing both socks ANd shoes to Rickybobby.I have been eyeballing this place for awhile now, but have found it totally packed every time I rolled by.  On a lark, and because I thought everyone would be watching the A's game, I decided to try my luck.  I was rewarded by finding Rickybobby half full.  Most of the community benches had space available, and I felt lucky to be there.  I walked in and sat down. My eyes roamed the space and loved what they were seeing.  Community tables of dark varnished wood, high ceiling, giant photographs of a flock of pigeons, a juicy hamburger, a horse in mid stride, a bird in flight - all high definition images, and beautifully hung.I swear the two servers must be twins, both in appearance, height, and helpfulness.  Rickybobby is a causal restaurant, so expect a friendly, casual serving attitude, but also conscientious, prompt service.  My modus at new spots is to ask the server for their best/most popular dishes.  He immediately recommended the crawshrimp grits, so I ordered it, along with draft IPA.  The big diner porcelain bowl arrived quickly.  I lifted a warm spoonful, took it in my pie hole, and was transported to seafoody, pork bellied, buttery gritsy heaven.  Its  delicious combination of richnesses won me over immediately.  I couldn't put this food away fast enough.  I required a larger spoon, I said to myself.  But the bowl was hella huge for my appetite!  I ate what I could, and packed the rest for lunch the next day, where it was just as good if not better, as I mixed it with pasta for a leftover gourmet special treat.People floated in as the evening matured into night.  I like the crowd.  People both local and visiting from faraway lands.  I like Rickybobby's size. You can look about and see the faces of every person eating there.  That creates a friendly coziness and feeling that you're part of the local community.  I find this just as valuable as the great new flavor experience I had that night.  I know I'll eat at Rickybobby again.  Perhaps when the Niners play their first playoff game.  They'll do better than the A's, I'm confident. There isn't a damn thing on this menu that I haven't tried and I friggin love it all! Jesus- the pork tenderloin Sammy blows my mind each an every time I have it. That spicy mayo sauce or whatever it is just does it for me. The sweet potato tots are a classic. I wanna buy them in bulk to store in my freezer so that I can have them everyday. Craw fish n grits!!! I usually don't like seafood of any kind but I can't help but be obsessed with this delicious dish. Staff-awesome. The two cooks who own it- amazing. F$&@ing love you guys. This place has an awesome vibe. Nice open layout, dim lit, and good music. Started with the pork fries, smothered in nacho cheese and buffalo sauce, the dish is dripping with ridiculous flavor. Had a bit of the beef bacon burger, which was excellent, and then focused my attention on my biscuits and gravy. The biscuits and gravy is comfort food at its best! Tastes like an amazing chicken pot pie that leaves you leaning back in a state of hibernation. I will definitely be coming back to explore more of the menu. Rickybobby changes their menu often, and a lot of their food is really, really good (sweet potatertots!) - however, there are a few dishes that just don't seem to work for me personally. To be fair, I generally eat a pescetarian diet so I like to try a lot of the seafood dishes before I try anything else.1) Their salmon salad a few months ago was doused in a mayo-based dressing. I felt like all of the vegetables couldn't speak for themselves covered in so much dressing.2) Ahi tuna noodle bowl was just okay. Tuna might have been slightly over cooked.3) Shrimp and oyster po boy is pretty tasty - out of all the seafood dishes I've had there, this is the way to go.This is definitely the kind of place you go to for good 'ole Amercian classics. So, if you're a meat eater, you'll probably have a lot more luck here. Definitely a place you go to, to indulge in all the stuff that is so bad yet so good. Parking seems like it could be a pain in the butt in this area but we got extremely lucky and found one a few buildings down. Went in and got seated right away. I was happy there wasn't a wait cause I was hungry!Staff is very friendly and the guy who took care of our table was talkative and asked genuine questions. We sat at this high table with stools which wasn't too bad but I probably prefer a regular table next time.We ordered the BBQ ribs with buttered toast, chicken drums and the shrimp and oyster po boy. The BBQ ribs were the best thing we ordered. So much flavor and goodness in each rib. The buttered toast was just a bonus that went well with it. Chicken drums were good but nothing special in my books. Tasted very Asian influenced and something I've had before at home.. And the shrimp and oyster po boy... Supposedly what DDD featured on foodnetwork and sadly I wasn't impressed by it. It honestly tasted like a sushi roll in a bun. I think it's the avocado mixed with the fried seafood that made it taste that way. I did round up my rating due to the friendly staff and good ribs and I know they change their menu every few weeks so I will be back to score some delicious lobster mac and cheese I once had at broken record. I'll be back! This place is yummy to my tummy. The restaurant is actually pretty big, but the way they have set up their tables doesn't allow for maximum seating, which means this place runs out of seats fast! You do have the option for take out, but that really just takes out all the fun from dining in and enjoying the dim-lit atmosphere.Here's what I tried and my take on the dishes:Pull Pork fries: the fries are too crispy. curly fries need the perfect ratio of crunchiness and this one missed the mark. The overwhelming mountain of pull pork made this appetizer more like a heart attack disguised in food. Definitely share, please order only one plate for a party size of 6+.Truffle Cheese Corn: I'm a sucker for corn cob!! It had a bit too much cheese (it was literally coated in Parmesan cheese), but I'm in love with corn so I give this 4 stars!Shrimp Grits: super super good! The texture of the grits could be odd for some people, but the flavor was amazing!!! I don't know what it is, but every single component in that bowl was harmonious and just works! I was too full to finish at the restaruant, but it was so good that I had to finish my leftovers the second I got home. It was too good to be left for tomorrow.I. WILL. BE. BACK!!! i always make sure to go on a 5 mile run before coming to rickybobby for dinner because i know i'll leave feeling like a lard.sweet potato tater tots are TO DIE FOR.  i don't know why i bother order anything else because they are everything to me.  yes... i know, it's a little dramatic.  whatever.shrimp grits are also amazeballs and come with a lotttt of shrimp.  if i had to compare them to other places that you can get grits in the city, though, i'd put the shrimp grits in between brenda's french soul food (da besttt) and straw.  most of my friends typically order the beef and bacon burger, which i've also tried.  it's a solid choice if you're a burger lover, but i highly recommend trying the other items on the menu as well (lobster mac & cheese).it's one of those ""i haven't even left but i want to come back"" kind of places (:oh... also service is great.  it helps that the waiters are pretty freaking attractive. This place is legit.  Definitely tasty comfort food.  I wolfed the bacon burger on my way home.  Fries were amazing too.  But what else would you expect from the guys from Broken Records.  I only figured out they had closed for Burning Man after trying to go 3x in a 2 week period. Really like what these guys are doing here.. Basically two dudes messing around with bold flavors and having a grand time doing it. The burger wasn't my favorite I've had in the city but all the grub was very solid (tots, braised and glazed drumsticks, key lime pie). I'll come back to sample more goodies. YES! YES! YES!  This is one of my favorite spots in the city... and I get AROUND!Great vibe - chill, open, friendly ... I love the decor and big tables.  The servers are friendly, to the point that you feel like they are seriously your buds!  Now... onto the really great part ... the FOOD.Burger here is #1 or #2 in the city (Kitchen Story is right up there).  AMAZING beef & bacon patty, juicy, and PERFECTLY seasoned.  YUM YUM YUM!!  Try their Pork fries if you are lucky enough to go on a night when they have them.  Chicken parm sando is also amazing... And any place that serves sweet potater tots or a caesar salad made with authentic crunchy romaine is a WINNER.  This place has it all, plus amazing desserts!  I heart Rickybooby OMG Crawshrimp Grits.  Must eat. Actually tried my first meals with the chef back at Broken Record for the first time. I didn't know/realize that they left after the last time I went to Broken Record and it was a completely different menu and taste. So, I decided to take the drive out on a busy Saturday night w/ the bf to try out Rickybobby. Needless to say, the chefs did not let me down once again!We've tried the sweet potato tots(which I fell in love with when they first stirred this up back at Broken Record), tasted so good I even burned my mouth from eating them the minute they were set on the table! Also had the biscuits and gravy, which in one word...AWESOME. Everything that was served went well with the biscuits. I wasn't expecting it to have so much flavor and assuming most of the flavor would come from the meat (or fattening of the gravy). Crispy toasted biscuits with their own kind of gravy and different meats...mmm I'm getting hungry just writing this again!Also grabbed an order of the pork tendo sandwhich, which was delicious as well. A little bit too spicy for me with the mustard, but that's cause I'm such a pansy when it comes to heat. It still didn't stop me from stealing more bites out of the sandwich from my bf!Beer selection is cool.Overall, it was a great experience. However, the only con I can get out of this place was the weird seating. They're set up with 5-6 large tables, which would be awesome with a group of friends and whatnot, but if you're just here with your significant other or with a buddy, you'd be waiting in line sharing the large table with a couple other strangers seated next to you. I think theres only about one or two small tables (maybe) that seat 2 or 3 peeps. Then again, I came here on a Saturday night when it was busy. Really one of the best meals I've had in a LONG time.  I was a fan of what these guys were doing back when they were running the kitchen at Broken Record.  Now they've got a place of their own and they have kept a lot of the same favs as before, plus a few new exciting dishes.THE ORDERCrawfish Grits - 5 out of 5 - Shrimp broth, cheesy grits, house pork belly and ample amounts of crawfish.  The grits have a nice cheesy texture, but the real standout is the overall flavor of crawfish, and considering everything that is in the grits thats pretty impressive.  The pork belly is a nice touch.  It add a lot without distracting from the crawfish-ness of the dish.Biscuits and Gravy - 5 out of 5 - Mashed potatoes, peas & carrots pulled chicken & sausage gravy.  Excellent balance and flavor.  The biscuit was soo flaky and so moist... even without the gravy.  The sausage gravy has plenty of flour and the peas and carrots added a much needed balance of veggies.  s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com…Meatloaf Wellington - 6 out of 5 - Creamed corn & pasilla pepper sauce over meatloaf cooked inside garlic puff pastry.  This is a serious wow dish!  This is probably the best meatloaf dish I've ever had...it really does take meatloaf in a cool new direction.  The meatloaf itself is cooked perfectly and is amazingly flavorful and moist on top of the garlic puff pasty.  The sauce is nothing short of amazing.  It's was so flavorful that i literally took a spoon and ate the leftovers like soup!  s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com…Lobster Corn on the Cob - 6 out of 5 - The star of the night for me! Small chunks of lobster,  lobster butter, lime, basil & white truffle mayo, parmesan.  I have been dreaming about this corn on the cob every since i ate it.  The chunks of lobster are buttery and salty which plays nicely with the sweetness of the corn.  The dish is greasy and over the top but damn..wow...so good.  s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com…Key Lime Pie - 5 out of 5 - I'm really not a fan of key lime pie, but damn Rickybobby did something amazing with this.  The keylime is sweet without being overly sweet and not veering into too tarty.  The blueberry syrup really helps add a nice brightness to the dish without taking anything away from the key lime flavor.  Just amazing overall balance.  yelp.com/biz_photos/rick…OVERALLWhat Rickybobby does is deceptively simple.  They rethink and reinvent everyday dishes and ad an upscale and gourmet twist without ever getting pretentious.  The prices and ambiance are very welcoming and a breath of fresh culinary air.  I can't wait to come back. My first time in the Haight was actually here at Rickybobby! Came here with three friends about two months ago, and ordered just about half the menu:* Beef and Bacon Burger - While good, I still find the burgers at places like Super Duper, the now-long-closed Thermidor, and Box much tastier. But the ones here are also much better than a lot of other places I've been, so, if you want a burger, get a burger.* Crispy Pork Tendo Sandwich - That said, if you just want meat in a bun, get this instead. I was a little skeptical upon first seeing it, but, not only was it not nearly as bland or as dry as it looked, it was actually quite tasty! Still a tad on the dry side though.* Sweet Potatertots - I'm a little biased here, because, while I like sweet potatoes, I still prefer fried potatoes to be of the regular potato variety. That said, these were fried _just_ right, so, if you like fried sweet potatoes, give these a shot.* Pork Fries - Uhhh yes get this. Basically, pulled pork over curly fries. Delicious (though a bit too sweet after a while).* Crawshrimp Grits - While I usually enjoy grits, I wasn't a huge fan of this for some reason. I suspect either because I found it too cheesy, or, more likely, too soupy.* Biscuits and Gravy - Also just okay, for the same latter reason as above, with it being a bit too soggy for my preferences.A solid 3.5 stars. If you're in the area or nearby, definitely give them a shot. Especially if you're with a (small) group and can order a bunch of things! That said, the serving sizes are massive, so don't order too, too much.***Accessibility Info***Venue - Not accessible, unfortunately, with a handful of steps to get past. That said, if you don't mind being carried, the (predominantly male) staff was more than willing to help out.Bathroom - Didn't try, so no real comment, but I'm pretty sure the bathrooms were down another set of steps. Our rating is an average (rounded-up) for the members of Gentlemen's Burger of the Month Club.  Individual member reviews below:After much hype, it was... the worst burger in recent memory.  First of, I ordered my patty medium rare and it came medium well.  The toppings were terrible.  I'm pretty sure the ""cheese"" was Kraft singles, which wouldn't quite dissolve and just would cling to my gums.  The bun was a small step above Wonder Bread (although nicely toasted).  The only redeeming quality was the beef and bacon ground together, but it was just too much meat given there wasn't much else besides ""cheese"" and mayo.  Plus it didn't help that I felt rushed by the waitstaff to get out of there.  If you like crappy ingredients and a lack of condiments, then you might like it.  Personally, I expect a lot more from a $12 burger.1 out of 5- Paul L.I'll give this burger a 'Good, not great'. I really should have fasted for the better part of the day in preparation of the double patty with ground up bacon. I did not, which left me choking down the final bites. Overall the burger was flavorful, and the cheddar cheese (no options as far as I can tell) was surprisingly tasty--the bun however was a little chewy and the bread to patty ratio was off (too much bun). I'd recommend it for a burger if you're in the Haight anyway, but not worth an out of neighborhood journey.3.0 ouf of 5- Cameron E.This is a man's burger - big, ground with bacon, and proudly featuring american cheese. as long as you know what you are getting into, it's satisfying and perfectly cooked.  that said, i am unlikely to have it again. both of my experiences left my stomach feeling pretty wrecked, and i strongly believe this burger could be improved by replacing the ""american cheese"" with something that actually is cheese.3 stars out of 5-Jamie H.The evil geniuses at RB have crafted the perfect burger-homage to America: an obesity-encouraging double bacon-beef patty, a McDonald's-style toasted brioche bun, ketchup and mustard-mayo, and American cheese, of course.  Love it or leave it!4.5 out of 5-Chris P. FYI - Rocky Bobby is closed for maintenance until 9/17. Come by on Tuesday for some kick ass sweet po-tater tots! Rickybobby has been open long enough that everyone should know you don't *have* to go south of 280 to eat their food. They're in Lower Haight, just three blocks from the N. C'mon folks, get to it! Their portions are big and they come out fast. The burger drew me there, of course, when inconsiderate behavior on a Muni train led to me to exit a crowded N. I ate the crap out of that beef and bacon burger. Seriously, it didn't stand a chance. And then I ordered more - that menu isn't the deepest, but it's one of the loveliest. Pro Move: Order an appetizer if it looks good. Some are big enough to be entrees. The ""crawshrimp and grits"" was a spicy dish and came with pork belly. Usually bacon is added but not here. It's tasty though not as creamy as I'm used to, which is fine. Southerners have been conditioned to mixing concrete when eating grits. The biscuit with (lobster) gravy became a tribute to open-face sandwiches. Everyone working there is laid back. (Actually, most of the other diners are too.) Just ask someone where you should sit; they'll be pretty flexible. It's more about politeness and basic operational sense because after all, picnic tables are made for sharing. You'll see some interesting art on very high walls, and perhaps an ironically funny movie playing on the big screen. Then you'll start eating until you're ready to roll out - almost literally. Ate with the chefs back when they were at Broken Record. I was missing their sweet potatertots that I looked up where they went.Their setup is pretty similar to their old apot, but no outdoor tables. The tables are large bench 6-seater tables. You end up sharing the table with other people when it gets busier. Parking wasn't really open around the neighborhood around 7pm when we got there. We ended up parking over a block away. No wait once we got there and the service was very quick. The place was really loud, I was yelling to my Boyfriend in front of me and to the waiter. The lobster griddled corn was really salty for the minimal lobster pieces that was on the cobs. Lots of butter! The cobs were sitting in a puddle of butter, but made it possible to dip the corn back in dish.The crawshrimp grits was very yummy. Never really had a dish quite like it. The bowl was a good size for one person, but can also be enough to share if there is other food to go around. The sweet potatertots! Oh how I've missed them! They came out really hot and tasty. They were so hard to stop eating even when I was stuffed. My craving was satisfied.Definitely going to come back to try other items since their menu doesn't stay the same. Wished they had the mac n cheese! HOTDIGGITYDAMN DELICIOUS!!!(5 stars and a meteor shower)One of my ""favorite places to eat in SF"". When I had a foodgasm over and over and over again, it's definitely worth to trust my judgements. BR vs RB, RB wins!!!!- FOOD, exquisite- PRICES, decent- SERVICE, average- AMBIANCE, small with community tablesStill on my ""find creative and delicious eats"" binge. Place is the new BrokenRecord as the original chefs left and brought RickyBobby. Been to BR and loved it, came to RB and LOVED IT MORE. CRAWFISH GRITS ($14) - spicy shrimp broth, cheesy grits, crawfish, and pork belly. OMG SO GOOD it is literally off the chains. Everything combined well. The heat was the perfect kind of heat, spicy but a good amount. plenty of shrimp and crawfish. The porkbelly really put a the HOTDIGGITYDAMN in the dish and really enjoyed this. At BR their grits didn't have the pork belly, but at RB they have plenty of it!!!! WOW. The portion was huge, glad I have leftovers. BEEF & BACON BURGER ($12) - angus beef and bacon ground together. burger size is pretty large. angus beef and bacon ground together sounds so unhealthy but delicious. almost every other person in the joint was ordering the burger.FRIES (for the side $3, add truffle oil and parmesian $2) - just ordered the SIDE (not basket) to share and the portions were huge, enough to share. Skinny fries, good crunch, plenty, and SO GOOD with the truffle oil and shaved parmesian. yum.KEY LIME PIE ($6/slice) - whipped cream, blueberry syrup, strawberry poptart crust. I love key lime pie but the blueberry syrup WAS JUST WAY TOO MUCH. the key lime pie itself was just fine but to add the syrup was beyond too sweet. perhaps they should server the syrup on the side to not ruin the pie.WINE ($8/glass) - nothing special about the wine. the white wine was actually better then the red as the red wine was a bit bold at the end. Will I be back? OH HELL YAH!!!! Maybe like every week?! lolJABA APPROVED. Until the next review... Cute waiters. Yay! And super friendly The wait to be seated is not bad like how it was the first time I came here but still better to come earlier. Parking can be annoying.

Overall LOVE IT!!!!!!!! i like pork.  i like french fries.  i like pork fries.i like watermelon.  i like salads.  i like cashews.  i like feta.  i like watermelon salad.i like bacon.  i like burgers.  i like bacon burgers.  okay, i'll stop.  that was so obnoxious, right?  desserts were awesome too.  service slowed down a bit, but everyone was super nice, and we made it to the stupid movie on time.  i'm really liking this joint, and can't wait to go back. The food is so overly sweet and lacks any balance in tastes. I wish the chef or somebody who works with the chef would explain to him/her the value of acid in food. Sweet is great but so is salty, bitter, hot, sour and umami!Grits - Really salty and underlying all that salt was a bunch of sugar. We initially liked it but after going back to it when the other food arrived it was meh.Sweet potato tater tots - Fine but jesus the only thing to eat with a already sweet food is sweet ketchup and a sweet tasting ranch. How about some mustard or an original sauce that counter balances the sweetness of the sweet potato. There is mustard available but yeah it's a honey mustardTender Pork Sandwich - could have been good but omg so fracking sweet!Drum sticks - Great deal and the first couple of bites are great but then it's just too sweetHamburger - The reason I came because I had heard that it was a epic burger. Nope. It's two small patties and so sweet. The home made pickle spears were great but how about putting them on the burger to balance out the sweetness?We had a couple of other items. I don't recall what they were. My brain was traumatized by the amount of sugar in the food.I really only want to give this place 2 stars but they are newish so giving them the benefit of the doubt. Here's the deal. I want to like this place. Some of the menu items are very good (I can't get enough of the chicken drumsticks).But. The service is *so* astonishingly awful, every time I come here,  I never want to come back. It usually takes about 2 months to forget how bad it is, and I return but sure enough, I'm reminded and the cycle starts all over again. So... That happened. This place really lives up to the hype- No problems finding parking on the street.Service was great- waiter was very friendly and nice and clearly liked worked there. He offered great menu suggestions-Watermelon Salad which is served with lettuce cups and feta. Very messy but very yummy-Lobster corn - really awesome. Comes in two pieces so perfect for sharing. I normally eat corn on the cob by twisting each kernel off individually and eating it (Yes, that's how I actually eat corn this way) but it was so good that I ate it like a normal person because I wanted to eat it faster.-Crawfish Grits- Delectable! Super huge portion and yummy. The bacon is a nice touch.Food came out quick though we got the salad last which was weird.All tables are big 8 seater picnic tables so get ready to make new friends.Get here early! We came in 12 minutes after they opened and almost every table was full. Ah, the infamous RickyBobby...for those of you who don't know, here is a little background info: the chefs at this place used to run Broken Record (popular dive bar/restaurant in the Excelsior District in SF), but then something happened and they all packed up and left......and that was how RickyBobby was formed. They all left Broken Record, and started up RickyBobby.  So, not surprisingly, the food at RickyBobby is very reminiscent to that of Broken Record's. My friends and I visited RickyBobby on a Friday night, and it was pretty packed. We put our name on the waitlist, and we were told that it would be about an half an hour wait....so we decided to hop over to a bar about a block down the street.  After 30-40 min, we were finally seated inside with our table of 4. We ordered a variety of different foods: tater tots, pulled pork fries, crispy pork tenderloin sandwich, ribs, etc. The tater tots came out HOT (just don't put them in your pockets like Napoleon Dynamite) and they were delish. The pulled pork fries were crispy and full of flavor. The ribs were sauced well and just literally fell off the bones. I would definitely describe the food here as gourmet bar food :)  Oh yeah, they also serve alochol (beer) here now as well!  This is a nice place to come chop it up with some friends on a lazy weekend or before heading out to any lounges and/or clubs.   The only downside is that parking here sucks. (street parking in the Haight area? GG) We ate everything on the menu! Everything was damn good heart attack food! Memorable, Burger was Juicy and Flavorful, Pork Curly Fries, those fries stayed crunchy and not soggy perfect! Just go, it's ll good! Great comfort food! I had the biscuits and gravy....OMG! to die for..it tasted like chicken pot pie..very hearty and delicious. We also had the tater tots, grits, watermelon salad and smore sunday...Everything was tasty. My favorite was obv the biscuits and gravy I devoured it in mins. I will def go back when i crave that home cooked meal. FINALLY!  A friend and I decided to catch up over good food and I've been dying to eat here.So parking is horrible?--  Took the bus.  check!Long wait?--  Arrived at 5:55pm and was first in line.  check!Bad service?-- Not this time!  check!Sweet Potatertots- basketful, 2 dipping sauces, light and fluffy with a lil crispCrawshrimp Grits- OMG.  I didn't think I would like grits but these were aMazeballs.  Thick and creamy and the pork belly added a nice touch to the dish.  Onions w/ mushroom turnover- Crust was nice and flaky, onions were cooked perfectly.I was kind of disappointed that the famous lobster mac and cheese wasn't on the menu but overall, the I was pretty satisfied.  I'll definitely be back for the burger and hopefully *crosses fingers* the mac. After coworkers recommended Broken Record and then seeing the triple D review, we were out to go to Broken Record. Then, I heard that the chefs who were on the triple D episode had left BR and opened Rickybobby. So, why settle for imitators and go with the originators?The place is on the corner of Webster and Haight. Street parking wasn't bad and we got in around 8pm. The wait was around 5-10 minutes. The folks after us got seated shortly after even though the server said it was a 20-30 minute wait.We ordered Crawshrimp Grits, oyster po boy sandwich and sweet potatertots. All were delicious. The grits was rich with flavor and the pork belly was a nice compliment to the creamy grits and shrimp. The po boy had a nice kick and had a hint of wasabi even though it doesn't say on the menu. And the potatertots? Tasty.Will go back again and try the other dishes! As for BR, we might go check them out still. Actually, BR is closer to where we live. So, we made a special trip out to Rickybobby to enjoy our first time with this righteous grub! I was a HUGE fan...especially of the duck salad. Then their menu started rotating and since have not been such a fan of all the items. The restaurant has community seating which they will seat you in a very odd configuration with your party which I wasn't a big fan of. Their food is very creative so I will definitely give props to that!Unfortunately, we don't eat here often anymore because of the inconsistency with menu items & reliability of everything on the menu being great. Followed these guys from the broken record. The food is phenomenal...my fav. Is the Rib dip. But I have never had anything from them that was not just dead on tasty...just wish they were open for lunch and into the night for us Vampires...The three guys in Blue... Visiting from Dallas, I saw the great reviews so I gave it a shot.  I ordered pork fries and regular fries (since I already had a big lunch a few hours before. The pork fries were delicious, especially with the vat of cheese and buffalo sauce they give you. The regular fries were good as well. I liked the truffle oil they added. I didn't like the fact that there menu was limited, and they already had a few items marked off the board. Overall, I would go again, but be warned, this stuff is not healthy. I have mixed feeling about this place.  I think the dishes they prepare are great, but the service/wait is lackluster.  Here are my gripes about the place:- How hard is it to have a sign-up sheet for a table?  I hate how the host try's to remember who got there in what order.  (Hint: stay at the restaurant to wait).-It takes a long time before the server takes your order.  The menu is limited and I've been staring at it long enough while I was waiting for a table.  I don't totally blame this on the staff.  It's busy.-They need another server.  The whole night, the two waiters I saw were super speed walking.  If they have another server, I think it would help alleviate the craziness.On the other hand, once you order your food, its smooth sailing from there.  The food comes out quickly, the wait staff is courteous and asks ""how is your food"", and the check comes right away, when asked.I came here on a Friday night and I don't know how other nights are, but be patient and you'll be rewarded with good food. I was visiting from Hawaii and my cousin took me here for dinner.  The Beef & Bacon Burger lives up to the many positive reviews I've read on here.  And the sweet potato-tots were delicious as well!Definitely would love to hit this spot up again when I'm in the area! If you want a casual place to fill up your belly with all kinds of amazing fried/diner-style treats, look no further. Ricky Bobby is the place for you. They have everything: pork fries with cheese and buffalo sauce, beef and bacon burgers (grounded together) and corn on the cob with melted butter and chunks of lobster. And just when you think the fun is over, knock-knock who's there? It's Black George Washington! This hot-spot is sure to answer the question, What?!? Plus it has outdoor human parking cones... (That thing where two jacked midgets paint themselves orange and you have to parallel park between them). Ok, maybe I got carried away, but you get the idea. Delicious (not-so-healthy) food priced right with a super friendly staff.  It's worth going just for the burger alone.Hella-yum. Everything I had here was amazing! Pork fries, sweet potato tots, sandwiches, ahi tuna- u can't go wrong! Save room for dessert!!!! Best s'mores pie ever!!!! When I first heard that the boys from Broken Record kitchen was no longer going to be there, I got depressed.  When I'm depressed I like to eat at Broken Record....Then I heard they were opening up their own joint in the Haight!  Happy to hear that they were not completely gone, but  I wasn't sure if the were still going to be the same, quaint yet amazing kitchen it was before!Here's my original review: yelp.com/biz/broken-reco…I'm glad the food is as amazing as ever!  You can't go wrong with ANY of the dishes!It's got a different feel now, with the whole wait to be seated instead of fighting for the little booths in the back of Broken Record.  Parking got worse imo but overall, still one of my favorite places in the City!Highly Recommended! Waited 45 minutes. Kitchen lost an app. Fine. By the time the server came around to tell him we were ordering our entrees anyway. We ordered two burgers. Kitchen brought one but not the other. Inexcusable. Waiter tried to make excuses -""have you ever worked in a restaurant before!?"" Why yes, sir, and we never lost two orders at one table. Thanks but no thanks-this was the worst service I've experienced in the two years living in SF. Beware! FOOD:1.) Burger = wowsa. goooooooood.2.) Grits = omg soooo goooooood. so flavorful. reminded me of jambalaya SERVICE:goodATMOSPHERE:Kinda small, kinda casual, simple plain hip, with mostly big community tables so it's interesting sitting so close to other people Incredibly food! Bacon burger was great and the pork nacho fries were incredibly good (and some of the best pork I've ever had -- and I live in TX and am obsessed with pulled pork there and carnitas in CA)! We didn't have room but ordered the s'mores sundae for dessert anyway and the bruleed marshmallows, chocolatey brownie, and chocolate ice cream made it heavenly!!!! It is NOTTTTT good for you. It ISSSSS worth it.Want food that makes your tummy smile, a fun atmosphere, and very casual (but professional) service? Want to not have to make too many hard decisions? Want to order a 'drank' instead of a drink? (The appropriate answer is yes - and this is the appropriate spot to point yourself.)I knew when I walked in and saw the two-headed cow thing and a giant homage to a juicy burger that I'd probably like this place. The deal was sealed when a server/host combo dude apologized that we'd have to wait ten minutes and offered to bring us drinks himself in the meantime. Initially I was disappointed to see a small menu, but once I got a chance to read it - and everything looked amazing - I was glad I couldn't agonize too long. We started with the sweet potato-tots and they are everything you want them to be: served hot, crispy and slightly salty on the outside, soft on the inside and just a maybeee hint of cinnamon somewhere. Liked the house ranch sauce, too! Someone else started with the watermelon/feta salad, which was unique as it was served almost in lettuce wraps, like a hand-held version of a salad.Two friends couldn't resist the burger, and man was that thing HUGE and juicy. (We're talking two burgers worth of burger huge.) Someone else had the pork curly fries as their meal, and not only were they quite pleased to have it served with a flag on top, they were also very satisfied with the cheesy, porky mass. I had the ahi tuna soba noodle bowl - it had avocado, corn, tomatoes, and a creamy sriracha sauce (among various other tasty ingredients). The fish was fresh, the texture was incredible and the portion was pretty large and I ended up taking some home. One note: the tots actually took awhile to come out since it turns out the kitchen forgot them - and our server comped them off the bill as a result. Props to the restaurant for making sure we were happy. The little things make such a big difference.Check it out, ya'll - ya hear? Big fans of the broken record. Happy they opened their own spot. Happy that they moved to a more central location but parking is difficult as well in lower haight so it's a catch 22. Different than broken record because unlike ordering direct at counter you need to check in with the host and wait for a communal table. Came on a Friday night so we expected the chaos and bar crowd. Half hour wait and shockingly we received free beer while we waited. Huge plus! Great service and appreciated how apologetic they were. Love their burger- it is very salty so drink lots of water after- it is loaded with bacon and American cheese in the patty- pretty amazing and it is a double patty. We ordered the drum sticks which weren't my favorite. The pork fries were tasty. Short ribs and drum sticks were more in the sweet Asian inspired side than on the BBQ savory side. Their menu does change so hopefully they bring back more broken record specialty items like the short rib! We will definitely be back- since the burger is divine. Perhaps it should be called RichardRobert.That is all. Although the current menu doesn't have tons of veggie options, I had and loved:+ Watermelon Salad - butter lettuce cups, feta, cashews, rice wine vinaigrette - the vinaigrette was truly out of this world, and made the dish!+ French Fries with homemade ranch dip were good (but then, when are french fries NOT good)?Wish I had room to try:+ Sweet Potatertots+ Griddled Corn on the Cob - which I saw everyone and their uncle trying and it looks simply, fantastic!+ and a side bowl of the grits (plain) - because the smell of them wafting my direction from my friends Crawshrimp Grits entree was overwhelmingly tempting!Also fun tidbit, they seat you at communal tables, which seems awkward at first, but really isn't and makes for a cool new way to dine! I'm all jacked up on Sweet Tater Tots & I wanna get at the Beef and Bacon Burger like a spidermonkey!!-The crawshrimp grits (buttery goodness) is loaded with seafood...then topped with Pork Belly. NOM!-The sweet potato tots are always piping hot and crispy. Dip it in dat ketchup son!-The pork fries (I always seem to miss this when I go, but apparently the owner? chef? of Broken Record opened up Ricky Bobby) are bomb. Waffle fries. Good. Pork. Good. Magic Cheesy Sauce. Good. -The Beef and Bacon Burger is ground beef, combined with ground bacon....to make the ultimate juicy burger patty known to man. Eating it reminds me of Marshall's HIMYM burger speech....""Just a Burger? Just a burger. Robin, it's so much more than ""just a burger."" I mean...that first bite--oh, what heaven that first bite is. The bun, like a sesame freckled breast of an angel, resting gently on the ketchup and mustard below, flavors mingling in a seductive pas de deux. And then...a pickle! The most playful little pickle! Then a slice of tomato, a leaf of lettuce and a...a patty of ground beef (AND BACON!!!!) so exquisite, swirling in your mouth, breaking apart, and combining again in a fugue of sweets and savor so delightful. This is no mere sandwich of grilled meat and toasted bread, Robin. This is God, speaking to us in food."" My dad recommended this place after seeing on Triple D that someone left a restaurant and decided to open his own-- hence our arrival at Rickybobby.Pros:-Excellent service. Although we did come at opening (6pm) so there weren't many people, the servers frequently came by and asked us how we were doing, if everything was to our liking, refilled our waters without asking, etc.Cons:-We lucked out of parking, but I could tell this neighborhood could be difficult.-There are only 8 tables, 6 of which are big picnic sized tables and they appear to do community style seating. Not necessarily a con, just something to note.MUST GET:- Sweet Patater Tots ($6): OMG delicioussss. Good amount too, served with ranch and ketchup. However they don't reheat well at home, so you must force every tot down while you are seated at that table for most satisfaction- Crawshrimp Grits ($13): First time with grits and have to say we all LOVED it, especially with the shrimp broth. Everyone at the table agreed this dish had the best flavor.- Ribs and buttered toast ($12): Had a great smoky flavor without the artificial barbecue taste. Not your typical rib flavor. Tender meat that just came off the bone.WILL BE BACK TO TRY:- Grilled corn on the cob- Pork Fries I love this place so much I crave it when I am en route to the city and I go back every time I'm back in the Bay Area.  My go-to dish is the crawshrimp grits.  It not only satisfies my hunger, but it provides this sort of culinary experience I don't really get anywhere else. I am a bit bummed the lobster mac is no longer on the menu but I don't really think about it when I'm enjoying pretty much everything else I order.  The pork fries and corn on the cob are also great additions to a fine meal.  And to end it, you can't go wrong with the peach and strawberry bread pudding.  Actually you could go wrong by not ordering this.  This is seriously the best bread pudding I've ever had.  The staff are great too, young, energetic, and it seems they like their jobs.  Who wouldn't though at a place where the food is just simply amazing?!?! Yum Yum Yum~ from the people who brought you the food @ Broken Record comes RB with even more delicious food n drinks~ everything here is good~ only 2 downfalls the wait n parking other then that this is an awesome place to get your grub on. Sweet potater tots, ribs, and crawfish grits. If I could, I'd eat here every other day.And that garlic bread that came with the ribs: superb.Great service, lots of big community tables. Gets a little stuffy though. Pleasantly surprised that this place was so good -- comfort food galore -- it's easy to fill up on things. Had the crawshrimp grits which was really delicious, as well as the pork fries (those were pretty amazing too) It might be a little dangerous to have this restaurant so close to where I live. If I were a health-nut I would probably not be able to eat here very often or at all. Honestly, if you come here and do not order a burger you are doing yourself a disservice. I am always on the lookout for a great burger and Rickybobby delivers one that ranks amongst the best in SF.Throw in a beer and the pulled pork fries they were serving (smothered with cheese and buffalo sauce) and you have yourself a gut-busting fantastic meal.They were really busy the first few months that they opened but things have slowed down now and you should be able to walk right in and be seated most nights. Completely surprised.As hidden gems go, the gold of a burger Rickybobby shelters couldn't be any more hidden among the shops dotting Haight.The bacon burger served with a generous portion of beef is straightforward. Stacked properly, and unfazed by the euphoric illusions of what a ""SF Burger"" should be.It's a return to basics, but holding back at no cost. Every layer is bright, seasoned and most of all, capped with gourmet bread ends that lock in the bite.Having traveled the burger trail within our 7x7 box, Rickybobby's burger stands with the best. At price point, ingredients and amount.Served with a side of sweet potato tots, this neighborhood venue is a welcome door to the people in your neighborhood.Communal seating with smoothed benches; future friends abound.Bring the crew. If you have a policy of not taking to-go orders, it would be helpful to post that before someone  travelled to your place of business to find out the hard way.If you don't have such a policy, but choose to simply not take to-go orders when you get busy, that's your perogative, but you can expect to piss people off from time to time. I've had my eye on this place ever since I got word that the Broken Record guys were moving their famous food to the neighborhood, and they do not disappoint!Everything was delicious. While I was pretty bummed that I couldn't have the lobster mac & cheese, I tried their lobster biscuits and gravy.That was delicious as well....but I couldn't help but wonder what is ""seasonal"" about the lobster mac....if I could get lobster biscuits & gravy? Last I checked cheese and pasta were year-around staples....and lobster was obviously still available....This place is a great addition to the neighborhood and most likely would've received 5 stars if I were able to try the star of the show...the lobster mac!In other words, it is very important to check their website for the current menu if you've really got your mind set on something. Don't waste too much time drooling over their yelp photos, because before you know it those items will no longer be available! Oh man.Seafood gumbo was amazing.  All perfectly cooked fish, nice consistency, perfectly cooked rice, just all around delicious.  I would have liked some fresh herbs, but I cannot complain.  I love that they serve Louisiana hot sauce with this.The green tomato bruschetta is great.  Toasty baguette, dressed green tomatoes, burrata olives, and smoked salt.  A big big portion, perfect for sharing with 3-4 people. The biscuits and lobster gravy was outstanding.  Came with picked lobster, peas and a super fluffy biscuit.  So amazingly delicious. The crawshrimp grits are excellent.  Rickybobby is the place for comfort food. Nice and simple.  Burger was juicy and cooked well somewhere around med to med- rare.  Bun held up well to the juice.  The fried softshell crab sando was the bomb.  Not fishy smelling, very meaty and the avocado aioli complemented the sando well.  The tots were great and I loved the ranch and the housemade ketchup.  Good beer, good service, nice quaint little spot.  Has the feeling of a place I would hang out at often.  Would like this place to be here in Tampa. I gave the place a second try, cause it's so damn close to my place, and this time the waiter was great and the food was too.  Sorry we got off on such a bad start Ricky Bobby.  With any luck you fired that waiter who so thoroughly screwed up my initial experience.    You know was they say about first impressions, it's just that your food is so charming. I literally love everything about this place. I've been waiting to go here ever since I heard that the kitchen from broken record moved, but I just finally got around to it last week. The decor is trendy... you aren't given a menu but instead look up at the board (their menu changes frequently- likely the reason behind not giving out menus). You will likely be siting in close quarters with srangers... not my favorite thing to do but totally worth it in this case.Everyone we interacted with was super friendly and helpful. My ""date"" and I ordered the pulled pork curly fries with buffalo sauce and cheese, the bacon burger, and the chicken drums. All of them were phenomenal. I was blown away by the burger, being a bacon lover. The chicken drums were great, but a LITTLE sweet for my taste. Either way, everything was delicious and extremely innovative, and I will be back more than once to try other things from their menu. Stopped in last night after a couple drinks at Toronado. My party got the beef and bacon burger and an order of pork fries. AMAZING. The burger was cooked well and juicy and the house mayo was delicious. The pork on the fries was tender and juicy as well without the fries becoming too soggy. They had just the right amount of spice with the buffalo sauce and cheese. I wish I'd taken a photo. There weren't a lot of beers though, so don't come to drink.The servers were also very friendly and we were seated within 5 minutes. My water was always full and the place was clean and comfortable. I just wish I'd had room for dessert because the table next to me got one and it looked tasty. Wow! I've been wanting to try RB for a while and finally did Thursday night with a friend. Had great timing. We got seated immediately at 7:30 The place was more than half full and filled up quickly. Burger, griddles corn on the cob, watermelon salad were all amazing! Favors were perfectly balanced. There was a slight bite in the burger. Not sure what it was. Guess ill have. To go back ...  The one thing that was def good but didn't quite deliver like I hoped was the lobster gravy and biscuits. Big chunks of lobster to be sure so that wasn't the problem. The flavor was just a bit flat. Hey, if that's as bad as it gets, all is good. Service was awesome too. They were busy but def attentive. Please tell me that the chocolate pudding pie is ALWAYS on the menu. House salad and prawn sandwich are amazing. We went on a Saturday night when they were short staffed, but we couldn't tell. Service was great. Food was great. I love this place. This one is hard to write.The food? Absolutely amazing. The service? What service? We dined on Friday night around 8PM. I understand that it can be busy. But our server only came to us 3 times - once to take our order, once to check on us after our plates were empty, and once to deliver the check. If you don't like being around people then serving probably isn't for you.And the food order was totally out of whack. One entree came out. Then about 8 minutes later the next. And then when our plates were empty out came the fries, and at that point we barely ate any because we were full and who the heck brings fries when a table is clearly done with dinner?We so wanted to love this place - the food speaks for itself and is amazing - biscuits with lobster gravy blew my mind - but the service was so bad that we won't be coming out of our way to come back. I previously put out an A-ok review but I need to bump it up since I was there again last night and had a profoundly improved customer experience.  The wait person actually greeted us with open arms!  A much better vibe.  Congrats, guys! Based on 4.5.I had a ridiculously amazing meal at Rickybobby's.Beer list is honestly sup-par. Don't come expecting to be blown away.Food wise, I talked my partner into getting two main courses and splitting an entree, which I am very pleased we did otherwise I might have sung a different tune as I left.Pork Fries- So delicious. Basic curly fries with well cooked pork belly, hot sauce, and a really tasty cheese sauce. They didn't last long.Burger-  it was very good and well worth the price. the meat quality was really choice. I wish it were just one wide patty instead of two really thick small patties. Either way, the salty bacon mixed in with the beef was great.Chicken parm- AH! This by far made up for any parts of the burger I though was mediocre and we almost didn't get it! The fresh basil was perfect, the chicken moist and the breading crispy. The sausage put on top added a nice spicy note to the flavor. Plus, the cheese tasted like it were cooked under an oven slighlty to allow it to brown in a few places. It was a perfect sandwich.Portions are sizeable! I'd have been perfectly stuffed with splitting an entree and the pork fries with another person, but am more than content to have ordered as much as we did because the bill was more than reasonable at the end of the meal.I'm already planning another trip to try the asparagus with hollandaise and cured salmon before it is out of season! Hey Ricky you're so fine you're so fine you blow my mind...Hey Ricky Bobby!  Can you say yummy?!  I've been a fan of Broken Record for years, so was ecstatic when I found out that RB was opening in the city.  Food that's guaranteed to give you heartburn, but totally worth it.  Overall:  2 thumbs up!  Finger licking good.  Could have been that we were just starving after finishing a long hike, but hey- good is good.  Ambiance:  You don't go here for the ambiance, but the food.  No real ambiance...just a bunch of long communal tables and a menu board.  Food:  Let me give you the lowdown.  We went on a Saturday and there was a limited menu, but it didn't disappoint.  Must have:  Pork Fries (waffle fries base topped with pulled pork, Frank's red hot, etc....need I say more?).  Pretty darn good:  Chicken Parm sandwich, Burger with Bacon, Strawberry-Peach Bread Pudding.  OK:  Drums, crawfish grits (grits were good, but not a huge crawfish fan...a bit fishy tasting), chocolate pudding cake.  I was looking forward to the walnut pie, which I've had a Broken Record, but they didn't have it that night.  Poo!  I'll have to go back.Drinks:  Beer and such.  Pretty basic selection.  I wouldn't drink a lot because you need to save room for the food.  Service:  OKTips:  Get there right when it opens (6pm) if you don't want to wait.  Don't be afraid to ask the host/waiter if you can squeeze yourself in a spot at the tables. One word: Yum!  Although I don't eat red meat or pork on a regular basis, when you're presented with the option of having a burger with bacon mixed in, how can you say no to that?  Was it delicious?  Yep!  The sweet potato tots were just as tasty.  And to top it off, I shared the buttery crusted, moist, and not too sweet pecan pie (a la mode, of course) with my dining mate.  I can't wait to return with my son!Oh, and the communal seating was cool until the white folks didn't want to sit next to us Black people.  It's 2013 AND you're in ""progressive"" S.F.  For real?! Amazing!!   Do not hesitate, just go.  You will be telling all your friends afterward.  Any age, any taste and even vegetarians will love it here. These guys have the uncanny ability to take comfort food to an unbelievable level. The place is clean, the staff is nice and the owners make all the food themselves right there in front of you.   I am not going to recommend any one thing over another because it is all great -beyond great.  However, if you are a vegetarian, you must order the duck salad (without the duck do course).   It is hands down the best salad I have ever had.  You should also be sure and save room for dessert especially the bread pudding if it is offered.   We can't wait to go back again and again.  If you don't want to wait, arrive at 6pm.   However don't be dismayed if there is a wait as it will give you an opportunity to see some of the incredible food being served to help you narrow down what you want to order as that is not as easy thing to do when it comes to ordering time.  Enjoy! I'm really happy to see this place to transplant itself from their former location in the back of the Broken Record somewhere a bit closer to where the action is.  It's also not a bar.  However, everything they make is absolutely fantastic, and I want to come here again and again. Dem grits.I'd probably spout ""dat lobstah mac'n'cheese"" too, if it was on the menu. But it ain't. Sigh.My friend and I convened at Rickybobby on a Monday night at 7:15 PM. It was fairly unoccupied, only a quarter capacity, though the place picked up around 8. The layout is comprised of numerous long tables with wall seating and a few small tall round tables in the back.First things first: the menu is on the wall, high above the kitchen counter. So don't make our mistake of waiting around for menus. You ain't gunna get one.We ordered the SWEET POTATERTOTS with ketchup and ranch for $6 (s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com…). Maybe I'm used to sweet potaterfries, or I was underwhelmed by the seemingly meager portion size...or perhaps I was disgruntled by my burnt tongue due to my overeagerness...but I just wasn't wowed by these potatertots, in spite of the ridiculously adorable name. Maybe it was the fact that the flour detracted from the already-subtle sweet potato flavor, or that sweet potato, even if laced with cajun spice, is easily overpowered if eaten with the ketchup and ranch sauces. They have a nice crunch, though.But dem grits. Phenomenal. CRAWFISH GRITS, $13, is the combination of crawfish chunks, shrimp, pork belly in cheesy grits swimming in a spicy shrimp broth (s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com…) that will have you wishing you were born in the South next to the sea. The freshness of the seafood is wonderfully paired with the zesty broth and the mushy grits, and the shredded cheese and chopped green onions only make it better. As my friend put it, it's like clam chowder but with an extra punch of texture.Our waitress was incredibly sweet and very prompt, which only made the dining experience that much better. At $12 a person, Rickybobby is a place of note with great ambiance, service, and food. And...dem grits. Good selection of food items, a few sandwiches (including the bacon burger), some salads and a few other plates.  It all looked and tasted good.  The chicken parm sandwich was outstanding. Just wish they would give you a side with the sandwiches. Good for a very causal night out in the neighborhood. Friendly service! We FINALLY got around to visiting, after wanting to for soooooooooo long!!!They did an awesome job with the low key decor, communal seating and beer selection.  Our waitress provided friendly and competent service and the food did not disappoint.We had:1. Burger, cooked perfectly as medium.2. Duck salad.3. A couple of Pilsners and Blue Moons.4. Tatertots.5. Chocolate bread pudding.The meal was delicious, the service was spot on and the vibe was cool.The only recommendation would be a better hood/ventilation system, so we don't come out of there smelling like fried burgers......but then again, is that really a bad thing?Good times in the Lower Haight!! I've wanted to visit Rickybobby for so long now, and I was surprised this restaurant is more of a casual joint than a sit down restaurant. There are a couple long tables that can be shared, and they serve a limited menu on weekends.I came for the burgers, which were ridiculously juicy and the pulled pork waffle fries. I think the burger is one of my favorites here in SF, but with so many popular burger joints it's tough to compare. The pulled pork waffle fries though are definitely stand out. After all the hype of this place, I was expecting to be blown away but left feeling disappointed.6 of us came here around 7 on a Friday night and put our name on the wait list. We were seated about an hour later(not too bad). They have 4 long banquet tables so be prepared to share with out customers.Our server just seemed annoyed the entire night but I know it was a busy night. We ordered the sweet potato tots and the pork fries. The sweet potato tots are OUT OF THIS WORLD delicious! They come with ketchup and ranch and we devoured two baskets. I'm a vegetarian so I couldn't eat the pork fries but they were also gone in a flash.For dinner, I had the crawshrimp and grits. The portions are very generous but I left feeling empty. The grits were just loaded with butter and pretty much coagulated together instead of being creamy. They really lack flavor. The crawshrimp just tasted...off. They were very fishy and rubbery.  The best crawshrimp and grits i have had was at Brenda's where the grits and creamy and cheesy instead of gelatinous. I am now on a mission to go back there to get my shrimp and grits fix.Everyone else at the table said their food was pretty solid. From the chicken parm sandwich, the bacon burger, the seafood gumbo and the cheddar biscuit with lobster gravy. I would go back to have the cheddar biscuit with lobster gravy as well as the tots.There are some fun bars in the area as well so  you could definatley make a night of this. Grab a drink at Maddog, do some people watching then head over to RickyBobby wow, i died and went to food heaven eating here. seriously! amazing service too. i don't even know how many times our water glasses were filled. we were given clean plates as soon as they saw we were done eating our appetizer. let's get down to the real business though: the food. appetizer: pork fries. PORK. FRIES. not just regular fries either, some goddamn waffle fries! who doesn't love waffle fries?! and smothered in a delicious, creamy sauce with pork all over it? oh yeah. it even came with an american flag. AMERICA! seafood gumbo: SO MUCH SEAFOOD. oysters, shrimp and scallops, all fresh. no frozen cop outs. i probably had ten oysters in my bowl and that's not including all the other seafood. really good, home cooked flavor; like you know it's been simmering on the stove top for hours.crawfish grits: again, SO MUCH CRAWFISH! i felt like i tasted an entire stick of butter in that one bowl of grits but in the best way possible. we all know grits without butter is not grits. plus, MORE PORK! there were little cubes of pork sprinkled on the top and ohhhh my, yes. biscuit and lobster gravy: you get one deliciously homemade baked biscuit topped with tons of lobster and the most decadent gravy you've ever had. it had fresh peas in it and it was oh so good. i wanted to try their bread pudding but i was so full from my gumbo i felt like i was going to enter a food coma. i'm definitely coming back because i NEED to try everything! :) The ambiance was comfortable and casual.The service was prompt and friendly.The food was unique, delicious and noteworthy. We ordered: + Duck Salad, complete with delicious fresh strawberries and crunchy crumbled pistachios. The dish healthy, yet hearty. The strawberries gave it an added sweet kick, and somehow the duck and lettuce complemented each other nicely. So good.+ Seafood Gumbo, with corn, rice, oysters, shrimp, green beans, and sausage, it really hit the spot. It was hearty, warm and so tasty. It was slightly spicy, but nothing too crazy. I'm a lightweight when it comes to spices, but really enjoyed this dish. I highly recommend it. What else can I say? I definitely recommend Rickybobby. The burger is the way to go.  Didn't love the pulled pork sandwich.  Seating is tight--the table next to you is almost part of your table....the wall art was interesting.... Since moving to San Francisco last July, have been to probably 75-100 different restaurants. Rickbybobby by far is the best food I've had in the bay area. It might be casual bar food, but who the hell cares. What matters is that its hella good. I had the pork fries, chicken drums, and chicken parm sandwich with basil. All to die for. I am a from North Carolina and lived in Georgia for many years. Unlike many of the other faux southern/americana restaurants here in the city, somehow Rickybobby has managed to outdo the authentic. You won't find a place like Rickybobby in the South thats for sure. So glad I discovered it and its right down the street from me. Rickbobby provides good, filling comfort food at affordable prices in a fun, lively dining environment with good service.We had:* Chicken drumsticks (big drumsticks, totally filling, good and tender)* Crawfish grits (lovely melding of flavors of the crawfish, grits, mushrooms - mmm, totally filling satisfying - I would order this again in a heartbeat!)* Sweet potato tots (a mountain of these arrives with two sauces)*  Hamburger with bacon (the bacon in ingeniously ground and mixed into the ground beef, totally filling)*  Beer - but of course!Tables are shared, there are no reservations, get there early and be ready to order lots and get full, really really full (and satisfied!).  We couldn't finish everything, but we happily took home leftovers, which yummy too!  I can't wait to come back! Here is what I ordered:Crawfish Grits:  This is one of their staple menu items.  Most of the menu is on a rotation.  This one is like a protected tenant in San Francisco, it isn't going anywhere.  Must try at least once.  I get it every time.Duck Salad w/strawberries:  It was ok.  I liked the strawberries with the salad but just wasn't anything to write home about.Seafood Gumbo: Meh.Special Mention: Lobster Mac n Cheese: I had this when they were still at Broken Record.  They told me it will be back in a few months.  Few months needs to hurry up because Truffle Mac n Cheese just isn't cutting it.Let me know what you guys think!  This is like a facebook status right?  Like and comment please!P.S I like how ""hipster"" is a checkbox for how you would characterize a place. Y'all, this place has some authentic southern dishes. Fo' reals.CRAWSHRIMP GRITS! Best I've had since living in Georgia. It's perfectly soupy, very flavorful, and not overly filling. Tator tots are a must.It does get a bit crowded though. Be prepared to sit closely with people, but the grits...they're worth the wait :) Gutbombs all day. I had a burger with bacon bits in the patty which actually works quite well. The days of bacon strips falling out of your burger prematurely are OVER. Sweet tots are delish. Waited almost an hour to be seated on a weeknight -- too popular! Wanted to try the food from the original chefs of Broken Record.  I liked that the restaurant was in a nice side of town in Lower Haight.  Though I was disppointed that the Lobster Mac n Cheese was not available since I was told it was seasonal I tried the the beef-and-bacon burger ~ $12, brought over from the chefs' former menu at Broken Record with ground bacon mixed into the patty and topped with American cheese wow it was one of the juiciest and tastiest burgers I have eaten. The sweet potatertots ~$6 were divine, as simple as it was I loved dipping into the ketchup and ranch sauce, simple could not get enough of it.  Also tried the crawfish and shrimp grits~ $13 placed in the bottom of the bowl and covered with a rich sauce with plenty of chunks of crawfish and shrimp. It was topped with cheese and bits of tender pork belly.  Dish was tasty and very rich so it is good for sharing.  Seafood gumbo ~$8 was ok too.  I wish I had room for dessert but was too stuffed.  So maybe something to try next time! We waited for a few months to pass after Rickybobby opened and the crazy crowds died down to finally try it.  We were able to go in on a Friday evening and have a seat within minutes...even though there were numerous seats open right away.  I guess the server/host felt he needed to have us wait anyway.  Weird.We went to town and enjoyed crawshrimp grits, the beef and bacon burger, sweet potatertots, chicken drums, beers, and the pecan and walnut pie.  We were more than full when leaving and ordered one or two many plates.The service was mediocre but the food great.  I'm not sure how soon we'll want to go back and that's why we tried every tempting item while there. We lined up at 5:50 on a Saturday night and were the 2nd party to be seated.  Get here early if you don't want to wait.They did a really good job of polishing up the space after Rotee left.  It's a much more inviting environment.  The service was great and the restaurant has a nice chill vibe.We ordered the bacon/beef burger, fries, sweet potato tater tots, salad with jack daniels salmon, chocolate pudding pie and pecan and walnut pie.  The two standout dishes were the sweet potato tater tots and the pecan/walnut pie.  The other dishes left a lot to be desired. While I miss the BYOB option from the first few open months, the food keeps you coming back. Once every few weeks or so the BF turns to me and says he's craving the burger. Yes, that delicious ground beef and ground bacon burger. It's quite tasty. I'm personally a fan of the pork/shrimp w/ grits. The chicken drums are pretty nice too. We've eaten here on countless occasions and service has never been an issue, if anything is always super nice and trying to be accommodating while it's always slammed in here.  It's good, not expensive, and in the neighborhood. What's not to like? I don't understand the hate. Service has been good to me. Food has been the same, GOOD.Things you should order and send me a thank you comp for later:crawshrimp grits - i lurrrve me some grits. I don't like the wait at Brenda's. Wait at Rickybobby isn't bad and I lurrrrve their grits. Chunky and smooth at the same time, savory w/ a little bit of kick and a plethora of crawfish and pork belly. I'm allergic to shrimp but I still order this because it is worth the itching. bacon beef burger - genius. the bacon is ground up in with the beef. monster patty of a burger. doesn't even need to be seasoned because the bacon just adds the right amount of salt throughout your burger. oh, DO toss in the pickled onions (they come on the side) into your burger. perfect amount of sweetness and acidity to balance out the meaty burger.I need to come back for the lobster mac and cheese because it has been off the menu. I totally don't get the hype about this place; there's absolutely nothing special about it.The service was friendly enough. No real complaints. (Granted, it was also around 7 on a Tuesday and they were hardly that slammed.)When the food started coming is when things went a bit awry. The inept kitchen pacing others have cited is a real thing. I ordered the bacon burger with a side of fries, my friend ordered the chicken parm sammy, and we split the asparagus. For some bizarre reason the ""side"" fries arrived first--literally dropped on our table with total indifference by another server. I didn't question it because, well, I'd read other Yelp reviews of this place. But then fifteen minutes (and two apologies from our server) later our starter and the two mains arrived all at once. As for the food, there was nothing horrible or exceptionally good about any of it. The fries were completely generic and oversalted. The asparagus dish had overcooked egg and had these huge, crudely placed chunks of pancetta on it. It was... ok. The burger has ground bacon in it, which I guess might seem clever until you eat it. Guess what? It tastes like... a bacon burger. It was well cooked and tasted just fine, but, again, there's absolutely nothing special about it. It's basically a double cheeseburger with bacon in it instead of on it; not amazing enough to justify charging 12 bucks for it. My friend had similar ""it's ok, I guess"" comments to make about his meal.Honestly, considering other options in the area, I doubt I'd really come back to Rickybobby. What is hotter than wasabi? Joe Cool brought his date to Ricky Bobby!The former owner of the popular Broken Record has left the Geneva location and has opened a new location in Haight Street. Despite being a much smaller location, I like the move. And the new location is also closer to my crib. The owner also took a few of the popular items from the old location to his new location. One item he took is the Bacon beef burger. The $12.00 burger is made from locally-owned and grass-fed Niman Ranch with Zoe's Bacon bits in the beef patties; thumbs up to this cheese burger. Burger: yelp.com/biz_photos/rick…Another patented item that the owner took with him is the Sweet potater tots. For $6.00, the basket has round sweet potato cut up and shaped like tater tots with a side of homemade ketchup and a creamy ranch sauce. This side is still one of my favorites. Side:  yelp.com/biz_photos/rick…My date ordered the meatball stroganoff. For $14.00, the pasta dish has wide egg noodles cooked al dente style with diced pancetta, chunks of meatballs and a hint of paprika smothered in a creamy sauce. The pasta dish had an overwhelming amount of cream on the sauce. But the pasta dish is still pretty good. Pasta: yelp.com/biz_photos/rick…We also each added a pint of Anchor Steam with our meals for $6.00 a glass. There are many things that are missing from the Geneva location in this new place. Hopefully the owner will add more unique items later on. I am a fan of this place! The food was really tasty, I liked the communal tables, and I can not wait to come back and try the rest of their menu. I will say, it has become increasingly acceptable for restaurants to bring food out, as it is ready. I came here with 5 people and everyones food came out at different times. Probably 7-10 minutes between the first plate dropped and the final person to recieve their food. This really bothers me. I am sure it is challenging for the kitchen to time things correctly, but surely most other places can accomplish this. Why should you not be held to that service standard? We waited for the everyone to have their food and my burger was cold. The burger really was delicious, wish it came with fries. Amazing food. Chill ambiance. I first experienced the deliciousness when the chefs were posted in Broken Record-- oh but I vow to follow them anywhere! The CRAWFISH (or Crawshrimp) GRITS with whatever fixins of the seasons is so rich and scrumptious, full of buttery grits, juicy crawfish tail meat, and pork belly (or sausage or chorizo or whatever salty meat they are throwing in). And that shrimp broth they cover it in totally complements it all, however, it really isn't that ""spicy"" it says on the board menu, more like a cajuny kick.The BEEF & BACON BURGER is to die for too (quite literally as all the food here is definitely not heart healthy)!! Ground beef and bacon perfectly cooked and simply stacked into a great burger inside a nicely toasted bun sans sesame seeds.I do like the SWEET POTATO TOTS even if I'm not the biggest fan of sweet potato fries/chips because they are usually too sweet. I think what makes them great is the house ranch that comes with it.We tried the MEATBALL STROGANOFF, a seemingly recent addition as it was not here a few months ago, and it was delicious, but not my absolute favorite. The beef/pancetta meatballs were crumbled into the stroganoff sauce and tossed with the pappardelle. Meatballs that evening were flavorfull but a little tough and the pappardelle was al dente, but maybe a little too al dente? Sauce was yum but I wanted more to match the thickness of the pasta.I usually chug a few beers before coming, maybe grab another tall can or two at the store at the opposite corner if there's a wait. I just think this food is that much better with a little buzz going, plus $6 for a beer is on the steep side. Service is straight forward, nothing that exceptional or traumatizingly terrible when I've gone. Do expect a wait on the weekends. I don't mind paying the $13 average for the dishes even if there are communal tables and the service is just that, yadadada as some complain. I just love the attitude of the food and how it satisfies my rich-food cravings. This is SO DISAPPOINTING! Sadly, this is just another one of the many overly-hyped, poorly run, bland restaurants to pop up in the City lately. This is a mediocre fast food place masquerading as kitschy cuisine. Everything has a cheap/penny pinching feel to it. From the bare-bones design to the terrible location. Cheap, uncomfortable wooden benches and awkward stools. Plastic baskets. Tiny metal ramekins of store-bought ranch dressing. Toothpicks as forks?Here is what we ordered:Beef and Bacon Burger $10 (Yep. Bacon flavor, that's about it. Under-seasoned.)Chicken Parm Sandwich $10 (No flavor at all. Maybe they should add bacon.)Sweet Potatertots $6 (Strange, pasty little orange pellets. Imagine rabbit droppings.)French Fries Basket w/ ranch $5 (Cold, boring, frozen shoestring things.)Nondescript red wine $8 (Might as well; it's not as if you will be offered water.)Green Flash IPA draft $5 (At least it was cold.)Everything was under seasoned, flavorless, tasteless, and in the case of the Sweet Potatertots, just plain disgusting. A lot is said about the bacon in the hamburger meat. And? Yep, it tastes like bacon. That's it. No seasoning, no depth of flavor. No culinary skill. Just goes to show you can start with quality ingredients and ruin them with banality and carelessness.Others have mentioned the ""forgetfulness"" of the staff. We totally agree. The food comes up randomly as they get to it, often arriving cold. We had to ask twice for side places, and a knife & fork (sorry, gang, a toothpick is NOT a proper dining utensil.) And not once did anyone ask if everything was okay, or if we wanted another round of drinks.Hey restauranteurs, here's a tip: If you hire incompetent hipster staff and servers, your sales suffer. They are just throwing away potential sales and tips. Maybe the place was just having a bad night? We'll never know. We ate and got out as quickly as we could. What a major disappointment. We won't be back. Tasty tots and bacon burger I have mixed feelings about Rickybobby. Came here last night and the things I loved about this place were:-We were seated quickly-Bacon Beef Burger --- great tasting, and the bread was crispy on the edges which i love!!-Tots were good too!The negatives:-Im pretty sure our server was stoned outta his mind which is fine but dude you gotta be able to hold a convo and speak to your customers-The gumbo was just a-ok a little on the 'soupy' side and not as hearty as Id like-It took foreverrr to get our check and change...about 15 minutes. OK.I was so excited when the Broken Record guys brought their kitchen to my hood.  I never made it out to Broken Record, but heard good props from foodie friends.  Then the dudes open Rickybobby 2 blocks from my house.  More good web reviews ensued at the lower Haight location.  I couldn't wait to check it out. But you can't reserve a seat.  You have to show up before opening and stand on the street and hope to get in.  This seems like a smart marketing ploy for a very popular established and greatly successful, trendy SF place.  It seems inconsiderate and pretentious for a try-out.  I am not a big fan of communal tables as a mandatory seating format.  I understand the potential profit benefit for small venues, but if I am paying SF prices for SF food, I really would prefer my party's own table not to be a picnic bench shared with whoever sidles in.Dining singly, I felt awkward being placed in a corner of a table that could seat 10, even though I was there waiting when the doors opened at 6pm, and there were very few of us waiting.  Again, enforcing pretentious formats.  ""Our food is so good you must bend to our will to eat here"".  If the food I was served was amazing enough, perhaps I would have had a dining experience that overrode my staid dining conventions and converted me to RKBB's vision of what dining should be.    Well hush my mouth and knock on wood, my seating experience could not have been better.  Seated across the picnic table from me shortly after myself was a guy and his mom who was excited to show her this cool SF spot that he had already enjoyed.  Long story short, we ended up exchanging menu tips and reviews and engaging in friendly ways that would never have happened in a more traditional table arrangement.Thank you RKBB. I no longer fear communal tables, picnic or otherwise.Too bad the food, which I had high hopes for, failed to impress while the social experience exceeded my expectation.I ordered the gnocchi special, and the dish was hugely disappointing on every level. Any good restaurant serves pasta on heated plates.  Pasta cools too fast to serve on cold plates stealing the heat from the dish.  Mine was room temp at best when it arrived after a long wait.  Since I was one of less than ten folks who waited on the sidewalk for about 1/2 an hour to be seated, I thought the kitchen would be prepared for service when they opened.  They were not.  The lazy service standards, given the 2 star food and picnic table seating,are not excusable. Turns out rickybobbie is not a parody of a bad southern motif, as was the movie, but just a very bad try at an SF joint.       .  The ""gnocchi""  were way too dense. Good gnocchi is light and pillowy, never leaden and pasty like the awful ones they served me. They may sometimes or even usually serve much better food than they served me.  I hope so. I only know what I was served was awful.  A goodrestaurant NEVER serves awful. And this one did to me. We ate at Rickybobby before it was cool to eat there - at least in the sense that we beat the hipster crowd by getting there at 6:30.   By 7:30 Friday night, I could barely see the sunlight through the thick forest of skinny jeans.  (I should have taken an artsy, heavily filtered Instagram of that.)Luckily, the friendly and slightly apologetic staff was amazing at taking names and offering drinks.  $6 for an Anchor Steam on tap was pricey but great for the wait.-  $6 Sweet Potatertots - A bit over-salted, but damn, they were good and stayed crispy throughout the whole meal.  We couldn't stop eating them even after we were full.- $10 Beef and Bacon Burger - Bacon and beef met and did the nasty in the patty.  It was that much of a hot damn mess with the cheese.  I needed a cigarette after that burger.- $12 Lobster Gnocchi (Special) - A few medium-sized gnocchi, but the lobster, pea, asparagus cream sauce was delicious.  Be sure to get something like the tots to dip into the sauce.- $11 Crab Bisque Dip - The bay scallops were swimming in a sea of crab.  A bit salty, and the the tomato-garlic crusty bread was just ok, but the tots were better for dipping again.Sadly, now that Rickybobby has become hip and cool, I can never go back again.  Darn, my ironically confusing, trendy sense of taste!  :P Bomb as always- but add a more functional space then it's more bomb than ever!My service was great.  But I came earlier in the evening, so as the space filled, I can see how people claim it's touch-and-go.  BUT I DON'T GIVE A SHIT!  The food is great, and I got what I needed. Plus, for the record and at the record (teehee, get it?): before this location opened, I used to haul ass deep into a dingy bar, stand in an annoying line, and wait for over thirty mins. to get my grub.  So, JUST SHUT UP AND EAT GRITS!But I gotta say, the changing menu kills me.  I miss that sexy lobster roll! Man, I've had so many thing on this menu (and stopped by sober, drunk, and in all sorts of states) that I'm actually kind of surprised that I haven't already reviewed this little gem!I've made it out to Broken Record before, and definitely enjoyed the food out there.  I didn't quite enjoy my surroundings as much, so being able to NOMS the same noms, but not feel the dingy-ness is pretty nice.  The Beef & Bacon Burger (or the triple B as my friend tried to refer to it as) is pretty delicious.  But it can't be all that, because, y'know... I mean, It's not like I get it EVERY time (that's what friends are for!)Also, I don't know what happened to my stomach! I can't eat as much as I used to... Or the portions are really that big.  One order is typically good for sharing with a cohort, so long as there is beer and a dessert included in the meal as well.  Alternatively, both could order separate entries eat a bit of both, then take stuff home and eat dessert! (totally the best way to go about things)All things are good, especially the burger, the (seasonal) lobster mac 'n cheese, and the grits.  Also good is the short-rib dip sandwich.  All the tings, really, are good, hahaha.Also, the lines are epically long.  I mean, having been there during non-rush times and rush times, I'm pretty impressed by the service.  But, camping out for 30-40 minutes to get my name on the list and make sure that people are able to hustle over from whatever bar they're kicking it at...But Sweet Potatertots....But. Ok, still worth it. Mmm delicious!I came on a Friday night around 8:50pm. Two of my friends had already been camping there for me for about 40 minutes already. It took an extra 15-20 minutes or so to get seated.They actually let us order beer while we were waiting, that was pretty nice.For the food, I got the beef and bacon burger, while my friends got the short rib sandwich and the crawshrimp grits. We also got the sweet potato tots to share as well. I tried a bit of my friends' dishes. Wow, all of it was really good! Everything is very filling; one friend was totally stuffed, and the other friend had to box up her short rib sandwich.My burger was juicy and bacon-y and delicious! The short rib was wonderful with the au jus dip, although the dip doesn't taste like much itself. I was skeptical of the grits when I saw the description but it was quite good. I'm not actually a fan of sweet potato fries or large quantities of tots though. The tots were pretty decent in spite of that.Service is good, although seriously they need more staff..Too bad there is no more mac & cheese; I wanted to try that. My friend and I had a fantastic time at Rickybobby last night.We arrived there around 7:15 on a Friday evening, and there was already a wait. Fortunately, their sitting system is very functional, we were seated promptly. I feel very fortunate to live in the Duboce Triangle where great new restaurants are just popping out these days!Food-sweet potato tots ($6) :: really, really awesome! the tots were just sweet enough to taste the ingredient, and came with a huge portion. crawshrimp grits with pork belly ($13) :: I will eat this dish every day, period. chicken drums ($4/each) :: It doesn't say 2 drums per order, so don't order more than one order if you don't want more than 2 chicken drums per table. It was really nicely marinated, and again, HUGE!bacon beef burger ($12) :: ohhh my god. scrumptious! Service-the service here was great. They weren't wasting anyone's time and I found it very efficient.Ambiance-very vibrant, funky and loud! it's a gastropub after all. you will share the table with lots of people, might as well make some friends!I will recommend this place to anyone (maybe not to vegetarians)! It was a purely delightful dining experience. Me and my bf love this place. We're ecstatic that this funky, tiny, inventive restaurant has landed in our hood. The food is phenomenal; I won't go into details because most the menu changes, and everyone else has already gone into some detail, anyway. Suffice it to say that anything you order will be memorable. Really fantastic. I'm knocking off one star because of the service. There just didn't seem to be enough servers; our server seemed totally overwhelmed. He got the order right, and the food arrived after a reasonable time, but I wanted another drink... just couldn't get his attention. For drinks or the bill! Had to forget the drinks, and had to wait about 15 - 20 min for the check. My advice to patrons: order your drinks two at a time, and give the staff a break (they're doing their best!). My advice to Rickybobby: bring on some more servers so that you can avoid customers getting pissed off over simple simple requests.It's unbelievable what they've managed to do in that tiny little space. We're absolute fans, and we'll be coming back and back and back. Decided to try RickyBobby out on a random Wed. night right at primo dinner time.  Of course it was jam packed, loud and hot.  We were seated at a crowded table with a pack of bro's who couldn't stop fist bumping each other and rocking our table around.  Needless to say, my grouchy husband was not amused and I knew I would get an earful for dragging him out of his comfy chair to eat dinner at this rowdy restaurant.  Flash forward to our food coming out and the entire evening changed.  Our meal was beyond spectacular!  We shared some heavenly chicken drums, an epic bacon burger and the MOST AMAZING crab and asparagus salad (with truffle aioli).   I will definitely be back as I can't stop dreaming about that crab salad (oh man, I want that salad right now!). I don't remember the last time I walked away from a restaurant so full and happy. A perfect place for a night of good food in the neighborhood without breaking the bank. My friend got the house salad with the addition of Jack Daniel's salmon for an additional $5 well-spent. It was a huge piece of salmon cooked perfectly. Super moist, and went with the salad really well. A healthy salad this isn't, but let's just ignore that diet for one night.Their crawshrimp grits practically changed my life. I'm not sure I've ever enjoyed grits so much. Imagine the creamiest grits, swimming in flavorful broth, topped with both shrimp AND pork belly. Rich dish alert!Then, my life changed yet again when the sundae came, and had three scoops of ice cream the size of my fist (which is at least an average-sized fist). This all sits on a bed of crumbled chocolate-macadamia cookie bits. It was way more than enough to split three-ways with my friends.I foresee many more grits-filled nights in my near future. I was really sad when I heard the two chefs left Broken Record as the food was AMAZING!  But then I found out that they branched out and opened up Rickybobby!  Yay!  Prior to my visit, I heard mixed reviews about the food.  I was told certain items that used to be available at Broken Record were no longer offered at Rickybobby or that it didn't taste the same.  I still wanted to give them a try as everyone has different buds.  Therefore, I'm trying really hard not to be biased in writing this review.We ordered:-Beef and Bacon Burger $10 - I don't eat beef so I don't know what this tasted like.  However, I was told that the burger at Broken Record tasted a lot better even though it's the same chefs that made the one at Rickybobby.  -Pulled Pork -  I thought the pulled pork was delicious.-Sweet Potatertots $6 - not as phenomenal as Broken RecordIn reading other Yelp reviews, it seems customer service wasn't that great for them.  However, that wasn't a problem for us.  Our server was friendly and the food came within minutes after ordering.  Overall, I feel Rickybobby failed to achieve the charm of its original name - Broken Record.  The food here was okay, but not memorable. Menu is solid; definitely on the heavy side, but had a couple gluten-free options. Fun laid-back vibe and nice staff. Easy comfort food. Were seated right away at 9 pm on a Saturday. Came in on a Tuesday around 6:10pm ( they open at 6pm). The place was maybe 40% packed. My friend and I wanted a table, but we asked and they told us we had to share with other people...how awkward. That knocks off one star, but other than that, the food was good. My favorite was the $6 sweet potatertots with ketchup and ranch yelp.com/biz_photos/rick…. The $14 meatball stroganoff was also a hit, especially the meatballs yummm yelp.com/biz_photos/rick…. I did not really like the $12 short rib dip yelp.com/biz_photos/rick…, it was just okay...I wouldn't get it again. I would probably come back if I'm in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. hell's yeah! sweet potato tater tots, yummy burger and other items that were so good I can't remember what they are right now. Probably the worst customer experience I've ever had in the city. It went beyond simply ""Bad Service"" and into the realm of being disheartening to think that people with such bad attitudes could ever profit in this city. Plenty of places to get similar food. I'd recommend any of them over this.I've had nothing but good experiences with the Broken Record. I wonder where this one went wrong. Super delicious food at a reasonable price.  I'd had the burger and sweet potatertots (both really good!) when they were at the Broken Record, so I tried the crawshrimp grits and house salad this time.  They were great, so now I've got to start trying all the other stuff, even though it's hard to pass up their burger.  I like the setup at the new location too.  I didn't have to wait long, it's got way more space than at the BR, and the big photos they've got up are cool!  Highly recommended. Super happy that our wait was only 10 minutes on a Thursday night!First, I must say.. food portions were HUGE! I wish they had a larger selection of their savory foods (I remember the selection being slightly larger at Broken Record). Not to mention, their lobster mac n cheese was not available. I actually looked forward to trying that out. My friend and I ordered:- Crawshrimp grits: extremely extremely FLAVORFUL! Yes, every spoonful of it. The fried pork belly pieces gave it a crunchy texture, which was extremely pleasant. They were generous with the shrimps and crawfish- Beef & Bacon burger: the meat patty was thick. Very juicy and infused with bacon bits. Very CREATIVE- Sweet Potater tots: generous portion. It could feed a family. They were served extremely hot and very crispy. Went well with my beer. Overall, I enjoyed this place alot. I wish they had more seating. I had to sit with my friend and two big boys on a bench. We had to put our purses on the floor, which was sort of a turn-off (- 1 star). They should install bag hooks underneath their tables.Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Broken Record more.  I will definitely return for the food, but not quite for the ambiance. This place is great for a cold night. I gave rickybobby a try about a month ago with one of my friends. We had both been to broken record and loved the food ... so we were highly anticipating a popup from the same restaurant. Broken record was sort of... uhm... ghetto... lol... like a Mexican taco shop late at night in san diego... GET-TOE... lol but this place was SO different ... nice and clean... classy.... a little reminiscent of the dining room at hogwarts school of wizardry ( you know, where harry potter's from??)  When we walked in, we were quoted a 30 minute wait time, we were seated in 10 minutes It was AWESOME. the seating is very 'open' in that ... its like finished cherry wood picnic bench/table and you share a table with other parties. Its great if you're party is outgoing. I went with a friend who is, so we had pretty good conversation with the people around us. They ended up ordering all the things we had recommended ( they had a party of 4, vs our 2) it was a very different and fun atmosphere. I would give it about a 4.5 because, luckily we got seated next to outgoing and openminded people. While we were waiting... I was crossing my fingers and praying that we wouldn't get seated next to the couple showing WAY too much pda... imagine how awkward that would be? The food is delicious. The poriton of sweet potato tater tots is ... more than enough for a party of 5 ... and we had 2 people... I think we barely ate half. but they're SO good... dude... SO delicious. We were fatties...we ordered 4 entrees... yeah ... for two ppl LOL ... we had the half and half burger... it was delicious and juicy. then we had the duck salad... the dressing is housemade with real citrusy fruits... blood orange, tangerines,... really bright colors! it was very much on the lighter side, which is perfect if you're taking a gal that's dieting *wink wink*. hehe then theres the crap dip ... its more like a soup... i liked it but it was 'OH EM GEE"" amazing... probably 3.5 out of five... overall, fun place to go with a party of 2-4 :) ... get the burger. This is one of my favorite spots in the city.  Definitely the BEST burger I've had, and I'm a big fan of the crawshrimp grits. The atmosphere is casual and lively - a great place to go for excellent food without snobbery. I was so looking forward to trying this place and it was everything I had heard and more.  The tots were so amazing good, got the bisque and the asparagus.  I can not wait to go back for everything else on the menu.  The only down side....it is blocks from my house and my jeans are already tight!!! OKAY YUM. Ate here for a friend's birthday last Saturday and let me just say, although you can almost feel disgustingly bad about eating here, who really cares??? So delicious. It's communal seating, which I find to be meh, but our group of 6 had our own table so it wasn't an issue. The menu is on a board overhead and filled with so many hearty, home-y comfort foods. Their sweet potato tots would have ruined my appetite if I hadn't decided to share my chicken Parmesan sandwich with my friend, and thank goodness I did. Our table shared the tots, wings and lobster/crab asparagus, which was so good, I ignored my slight allergy to shellfish and savored the hell out of it. Two of my friends ordered the house salad, which was scrumptious. My sandwich was good, except I found it strange that it was comprised of chicken AND sausage...I ate around that part, because frankly, I was a little weirded out. The cookie sundaes were absolutely to die for. We had one of each. I'm really not a nut-in-my-sweets kind of person, but this was such an exception (and I just ate around the walnuts). It's a really great, unpretentious place that projects movies on the wall while feast on scrumptious, comforting food. There's no reason not to try it. The food at Rickybobby is super tasty and delicious, something I already knew having been to Broken Record before. They definitely did not disappoint, but the food can only take them so far if they do not focus on the lack of service at their new venue.I came with a group of approximately 15-20 people, we understood the wait would be awhile and decided to have a few drinks down the street until our time came. They were accommodating, but unfortunately had to split our party up to seat us, which we were okay with. At this point, we were starving and a split group was not really our concern, we were more than happy to be seated. After taking our order, giving us our drinks is when things began to get a little ugly...1) We split the checks by table, to make things easier for the staff. Well, with each table's order the food came out at different times. For example, my table ordered their tots, burger, some other item, then Chicken Parm. I did not receive my Chicken Parm sandwich until everyone had eaten their food. NOT ONCE did the staff update me to let me know that the kitchen was backed up (I would have appreciated the heads up at this point), they did not check in with the table, refill our beverages and see how things were going. I had to catch the staff's attention and ask about my order. Sure, I received my Chicken Parm for free .. but at what cost? I'd have rather paid if it meant that I would get it along with the rest of the order. If they had taken the time to inform me that my order would take a little longer for whatever reason, I would not have been as upset because they were considerate enough to acknowledge that I had not received my food yet.2) Each table ordered tots (4 tables total) and ordered at the same time. One table did not receive theirs until their food came, when everyone else had devoured their orders of tots. Their Chicken Parm came out late as well, probably at the same time as the tots.3) Another table, also ordered Chicken Parm. Which the staff did not even put in to order to the kitchen and my friend ended up cancelling the order and not eating for the rest of the time. How is this appropriate service?The food is great, don't get me wrong, but the staff needs to work out the kinks. This won't be the last large group attending this venue, so they need to figure out the organization so things can run a lot smoother in the future. I'd love to go again and see an improvement, there is a lot of potential at Rickybobby. No issues with service. Got share plates and silverware without asking.- Bacon burger was very bacony and had two patties. 4 stars.- Short rib dip is like a French dip but wih short ribs. 4 stars.- craw shrimp grits. 4.5 stars. Will get this again.- cold delta asparagus with crab. 5 stars. Best dish of the night.- mushroom lasagna. Wish it were short ribs lasagna. 3.5 stars.- cookie sundae. 3 stars. Was hoping for soft chewy cookie but got crispy crumble instead.- pecan walnut pie. 3.5 stars. Not too bad. Will be coming back for more.Tip: Get here early. Love this place...  Went there last week for the 3rd time and absolutely does not disappoint.  Large portions of incredibly delicious food (as a Southerner, I'd consider this the definition of ""comfort food"").  And you can pair anything on the menu with a cold Green Flash IPA they're serving on tap.  I'll be back.  Very soon. So the food here is pretty delicious. I liked it a lot.Where it falls short is the service. I recommend you ask for the bill when you order your food because after we finished ordering food they never came back. Never asked how it was or if we wanted more drinks, and it was impossible to get their attention, since it gets pretty busy. You'd think they'd have more staff on a Friday night.Probably better to go here with a small group of friends than on a date as they have no 2-person tables. I thought I would like this place more than I did. I've been to Broken Record a couple of times and found the food to be tasty, interesting, and well-priced. This place seemed to fall a little flat. The whole thing was just a bit disjointed. Either be hipster, trendy, causal or divey. Picking all of the above is not a great way to run a restaurant. Plus, for a small place (seats maaaaybe 30 people), service was super slow. Management really needs an extra person working the floor on a Saturday night. As for the food, the sweet potato tots taste exactly like the ones you gets in the freezer section at the grocery store. Which isn't to say they weren't yummy, they just weren't interesting. Neither were the dipping options to go with.The burger was pretty cool though. I don't usually like bacon on my burger because the texture is hard to deal with - either too crispy, or soggy and chewy. Grinding it in the burger like this gives you the flavor without the pitfalls.All in all, decent, but not quite what I had hoped for. i like the cookie sundae the best,  the chicken parm sandwich second best, and the beef and bacon burger third best. Definitely a haight neighborhood gem. Good food, shows movies (not talladega nights...sorry to disappoint. we were too), cute communal tables.We got the duck salad, braised&glazed chicken drumsticks, and sweet potato tots.  You get tons of tots (and the $2 basket of fries is ample too).  And to our pleasant surprise, the Chicken drumsticks comes in sets! (so if you want 4 drumsticks...just order 2). We left super full and fairly buzzed for less than $35 a person! There is no room in my life for bar food, lines, or Talladega Nights, but I will always make space for Rickybobby.  I will not speak in encomiastic cliches about the burger-- a Proustian carnivore's fantasy--nor eulogize the sublime hybrid that is the sweet potatertot.  I will not even mention that I long considered lobster mac-and-cheese its own species of abomination until I tasted the version here, refined and delicate as the ocean is deep.  What I will say is that the chef is a poet when it comes to salad (no simple feat) and that you must, must not dream of skipping dessert.  Immerse yourself in the pigeons on the wall; do not let them near your cookie sundae. This place has amazing food - my favorite is the Chicken Parm Sandwich which I am still dreaming about!  The chicken was perfectly crispy but also still very flavorful and tender, went perfect with the basil, chili oil, and parmesan cheese.  The buns were amazing too - soft and warm, but toasted on the bottom for the perfect crunch.Crab Bisque is really satisfying as well, and sweet potato tater tots were a hit with my table. One thing I ordered in the past that was not so great was the bacon burger. Even though it was reviewed by Michael Bauer and people on Yelp love it, my boyfriend and I thought it was too bacon-y. It was too heavy and took away from the regular taste of a burger, in a bad way. Line can be a pain, depends how picky you are on where you sit, since the tables are communal, and sometimes the middle seats (6 spots to a table) open up. One time my bf and I waited 10 mins (Thurs night), but the other day for a table of 4, we waited 45 (Friday night). Also ambiance is super loud - be prepared to shout across the table! The walls are covered with large photographs of scenery, burgers, etc, it's very special. Service is interesting. Waiters are decent. However I think the kitchen staff is a little nuts! I guess drama was going down and therefore our food came out later. Not sure what they were fighting about, but when the music was turned down at 10:30, you could hear them going at each other. It was awkward...we looked at the group next to us and gave each other shrugs wondering what was going on.  Hopefully Ricky Bobby fixes those kinks because their food is de-licious!  Anyway can't wait to come back to try that Shepperd Pie - it was gone before we arrived. I love me some Ricky Bobby. Whenever I go with my friends, which is often, we order a little bit of everything from the menu and share it all family style. I just can't choose one of the amazing dishes, so having a little bit of everything is perfect. This place is great for those nights when you want to hang with friends, drink good beers and eat delicious food. So.... every night. My faves: Chicken Parm Sandwich with the basil, mozzarella and sweet chili oil. The Burger. Ground fresh WITH bacon. Enough said.Crawfish and Grits. A little bit of the South in SF. The french fries (one order easily feeds a group of 4) with the homemade dill/ranch dipping sauce. I mean, I could go on, but then I would just be listing the entire menu... Sometimes there's a wait. It's true. The last time I was there on a Saturday night at 8PM we waited for 25 min. But we had beers while we waited and it honestly didn't feel that long. And once we sat down, the waiter was super attentive and our food came out quickly (and deliciously). Overall this place is pretty unbeatable. Amazing menu, good prices, and great atmosphere (love the movies playing on the wall). It's definitely on my short list of go-to spots in SF. Just saw all the one-star ratings for RickyBobby and it looks like Yelp has become an outlet for the mentally-disturbed.  Not sure what all the personal grudges are about, but bottom line is this place is awesome.  Go and eat the food and drink the beer and judge for yourself instead of listening to idiotic rants.  Everything on the menu is great and I've always been treated well when dining there. Most Delicious. Get here. I was visiting friends in San Fran a few weeks ago, and they suggested we check out the new hotspot, Rickybobby.  I live in New York City, so I have very high standards about food/restaurants.  My friends and I wanted to try everything on the menu, so we shared our dishes.   The burger is a MUST order - it was cooked to perfection and was one of the best burgers I ever had.  Also, make sure to get the short rib lasagna and the grits.  They will not disappoint.  RickyBobby has amazing food and cheap beer - I cannot ask for anything else.I also liked the low-key atmosphere of the place.  Long wooden picnic-style tables gives the space a very comfortable feel.Next time I am in SF, I will definitely be returning to RickyBobby! Definitely love that Broken Record has branched out their bar food and opened up Rickybobby. I heard since then, the menu at the original Broken Record has changed. All their original goodies are HERE.Love the LOBSTER MAC & CHEESE. Seriously, who doesn't love this combo... big chunks of lobster in deliciously baked, crispy topped cheesy mac. YUMYUMYUM. Just like Napoleon Dynamite... Gotta love the Sweet Potato Tots! Along with everything else, it's just great food .. My girlfriends and I always suggest coming back all the time.There is a wait for the picnic bench seating here at Rickybobby, but it does move pretty quickly, maybe about a half hour wait time around 8pm?(-) The parking around here is HELL. I know every hipster would question why I'm even driving to the Haight anyway but.. if you drive, ya better come prepared with a rabbit's foot and a lucky charm to find a spot.PLUS.... I swear, it's BYOB?! IF SO, THATS AWESOME. If I'm wrong, hey.. just save the drinks for later :) haha I love it! Happy to have it in my hood! It's strange to me that it has any negative reviews. Everyone was nice that worked there. The food is yum! The only problem is it is so popular that there can be a bit of a wait. The seating is a little strange. But, it doesn't bother me. I actually thought the pricing was pretty reasonable fro such delicious food. I suggest getting there at 5:59 so you get seated right away when they open their doors at 6:00. And order the lobster mac & cheese! Yes please! I heard about the recent rash of bad reviews due to one persons experience.  This is unfair and it happens all to often on yelp, so I want to set the record straight.Food Delicious, if you like real American food not dressed up with gimmicky ingredients this is your place.  Classic american dishes are executed well and consistently, so when something new shows up on the menu I always try it.Burger: Bacon ground into the patty, American cheese, locally made bunGrits:  Shrimp/Crawfish, creamy grits(not gritty), porkbelly/house sausage, shrimp brothDrumsticks: Soy/teriyaki marinade, slow cooked and juicyAlso try: Chilled Asparagus w/ Crab, Pulled Pork anything, Chicken Parm, Soup/Sandwich combo. Don't forget the desserts they know their way around with chocolate.ServiceRickybobby is casual place to eat and the service fits the ambiance and food.  Although I have eaten there multiple times I don't know if they recognize me but I've never been put off by anyone.  In all the staff is helpful, genuine and fun to interact with.Abmbiance It is a great place for groups, a date or a meal before a night of drinking.  You are seated at communal tables so you can decide what to order by what your neighbors are eating or hell you can start a conversation too.  It can get a little loud but that is fitting for the environment, there usually is a movie playing on the wall And... I've got a new go-to!  I understand that this place is famous for its burgers (and deservedly so), but that's just the tip of the iceberg.  Chilled delta asparagus with warm crab & lobster salad & truffle aioli was absolutely killer!  Also shared the short rib lasagna and immediately wished I wasn't sharing it.  Everyone in our party agreed that our high expectations were exceeded.Atmosphere was also top notch.  We had a little wait on a Saturday night - not a big deal as we were able to sit up front and order beers.  Wait staff was super nice and attentive.  Unobtrusive movie projection, great beer selection - sign me up for seconds, thirds, etc. The food is absolutely amazing!!! I've tried most of the items on their menu, and I feel that no matter what I order, it always comes out tasting like I've discovered my new favorite food. Some of my favorites are sweet tater tots, crawshrimp grits, and any salad I've had has been awesome. Also, I've had their home made ice cream... wow!I have taken every friend here that comes to visit SF, and they have all been completely satisfied with whatever they've ordered.  My friends have tried the beef & bacon burger, chicken parm, chicken drumsticks, and the pecan & walnut pie.I've been to Rickybobby several times since they opened a few months ago, and I must say that it's by far my favorite restaurant in SF. Keep it up boyz! Rickybobby, you're my hero.This place is the best tasting food in SF, by far!  Every time I go there, I order something different and try to think of something I've ever tasted that is better than what I'm eating:  impossible.The family atmosphere is a mature version of the amazing conversation we used to have at lunch in school, the beautiful and fascinating photography mesmerizes me, and the kindness of the staff makes rickybobby my favorite destination.One complaint: I never have room for dessert, so I had to order the pecan pie with homemade ice cream as an entree one time.  Oh, and also -- I'm drinking more beer than I should -- rickybobby, you're so sly putting only delicious beers on your menu.  You sneaky dog, you. Best neighborhood joint anywhere.  The burger kills it every time (as do the grits) but lately I've been into the portobello sandwich and the new asparagus.  When I eat these underneath their two-headed cow I don't wish for their meat, which is among the best in the city at any price.  The restaurant feels like a biergarten, but for food.  You eat genius local fare with your elbows on the communal table and each time you do it you are thankful Rickybobby lives here with you.  The guys who run it are clearly passionate and incredibly talented.  Seems like they could have sold out long ago but it is clear they are in it for the community. I'm not feeling particularly prolific right now, so let's just get to the facts:1) The short rib lasagna is the most delicious thing you can ever put into your mouth. 2) The sweet potato tots are delicious, but the orders are HUGE. One order for a table of 4 is more than enough3) They were showing Beverly Hills Ninja on TV, followed by Thrashin4) Josh Brolin was REALLY hot in 19865) The service staff was all incredibly friendly, but our particular server seemed a bit overwhelmed. 6) Served us a Chimay w/o a glass. It seems strange that he'd forget, seeing as when we asked for a glass, he brought out a Chimay chalice. 7) The restaurant was balls hot. 8) The prices are incredibly reasonable9) I'd go back in a heartbeat. Awful!!  Spare yourself the frustration and disappointment of this ""thinks they're hot but they're not"" place on Haight. Too many other places offer the real deal - good food, service, and decent prices - but not Rickybobby. Scan ALL the reviews and beware. (Even Broken Record, whose cult following must be trying to help out this new place, has reviews about food poisoning, unsanitary kitchen practices, and rude service.)  I wouldn't go back if they paid me. Can I give this place zero stars?  Please, please do not dine at Rickybobby!  The people who manage and work here are incredibly rude and offensive.  They think they can treat customers poorly because they've got 55 five-star Yelp reviews?  I can't imagine that trend lasting long.There are so many great places to eat in San Francisco - run by hard-working, polite and just plain nice people.  Why should we patronize a place that treats its customers and neighbors with vulgarity and spite?  Please do not seek this establishment out - and definitely keep walking if you happen upon it. Wow, these guys are real assholes. - food:  tasty, guilty pleasure- atmosphere: loud / comfortable- staff: adequate - price: reasonableadditional info:- our real rating for this place is 3.5 2 chicken legs per order not just 1 for $4!! The lasagna was really good and enough for 1 with nothing else. They seemed like they were very generous with the food portions (big basket of tater tots, a lot of salmon on the salad, 2 patties on the burger) but gave you the smallest plates. The communal seating was okay but annoying if you were a group over 2-4 since you would be waiting for others to leave. The line was what made me not sure if I'd come back. The burger (bacon cheeseburger) reminded our table of jack in the box. STAY AWAY!!!!!    Restaurants that treat patrons poorly - reflect very poorly on themselves.  Ugly people work here and own it. Do yourself a favor - stay away from this restaurant and spend your money in a restaurant that will treat you with class - Afterall, people who are paying to eat there don't expect to eat with their hands - and not be given proper serveware.  Waiters are obnoxious - owner is so far into himself that he wouldn't know what a good restaurant is if it landed on him. Rudest service ever. Place was mostly empty. Walked in. Sat down. Got barked at to move tables for no reason. Not asked in a polite way. Shouted at. Walked out. I won't go back. They should figure out why it's called a service industry. *** since writing this review I have received vitriolic messages and mentions in reviews in response to writing about my experience. Some I imagine are the result of staff pandering to friends for reviews, and one instance was a shocking profanity and insult laden message from someone who works there (see the photo I posted).  This much hyped business is a disappointment to many long time neighbors, including myself, who had high hopes for the highly touted chefs opening a business in our hood. Shame on you, RickyBobby. Good luck when your lease is up for renewal, may it go the same way it did at Broken Record. -----------Scenario: My neighbor and I who live across the street go to RB to 'eat for sport'.  We tell the server we're neighbors and excited to eat there, ordering a salad, two mains, and a dessert to share.  Ten/fifteen minutes goes by and the server puts a bowl of grits down between us with one spoon.  I asked if we were getting our salad first, waiter's rudely responds ""We don't do that here, but we can take the grits and reheat it for you after your salad"" and walks away.  I go up to the line/kitchen/bar to ask for more silverware and small plates from the other waiter and ask ""May I have some share plates and silverware please? Do you guys not course your meals here?""  Waiter's rude response ""We don't serve food to share.  You should have checked us out on Yelp first"".  hen he laughs at me.  I tell him I have lived in the neighborhood a long time, seen five business in this space and have never been treated so rudely.  My neighbor and I leave the place, as we do so the waiters facetiously yell at us across the full restaurant, ""Thanks for coming, have a great night, we hope to see you real soon"".  Wow.  I'm shocked.  Later that night I'm walking my dogs, see my other neighbors leaving the place and they wave me over because they wanna see my puppy.  Waiter #2 comes to the door and harasses me, tells me my friends had a great time, and then starts bashing me to the staff inside the restaurant.  Wow.  My neighbors walk away saying ""that guy is a douchebag, the food wasn't that good, and we had to ask for silverware"".  At this point owner/chef James comes out to talk to me.  He tells me ""Food is our priority here""  Neat James, way to reinvent the restaurant wheel, who would've thunk it?  I told him that in order to eat the food one has to be served, this is the restaurant service industry.  And is reheating my shrimp and grits really about the integrity of the food?  Telling me to check out Yelp before I walk into the new restaurant on my block, that's about the food?  The owner didn't get it, kept harping on about 'the food is the priority not the service' blah blah inflated ego blah, oh and they were so successful in their last location (why did they leave then?).  No real apology or acknowledgment of atrocious behavior.  I talked to a few other neighbors.  Consensus is that we think they're such jerks, why would we waste our time and money tasting their food?  There are yummy places to eat in our neighborhood with attentive staff, better and more varied menus and better drinks and hard alcohol.  Go there, enjoy our hood.   RickyBobby is not indicative of this neighborhood, or even the amazing world class talented San Francisco food scene. One of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco! Everything on their menu is oh so delicious! There is usually a wait so what I recommend is be at their door right when they open for dinner service so that you can get a table. I would recommend anything on their menu! Especially, their sweet potato tater tots!Their service is great and I love the relaxed vibe of this place. For a place that's located in the Lower Haight, I would have to say that this place is still somewhat of a hidden gem. Prices are reasonable and it's not too loud in this restaurant. I'm writing this review based on a brief, but very negative experience at this restaurant. My boyfriend and I went in to order some dessert to go. While it was certainly busy, we stood there for about 15 minutes without anyone even addressing us. We went up to the counter to get the host's attention at which point he said to my boyfriend ""hey bro, what do you think you're doing back here, there's a list"". Where this list was and how we could get on it is still unclear. We mentioned we just wanted  takeout, and the host sneered and said that they ""just weren't doing that right now"". After that we stated that we didn't want anything cooked, just a slice of pie to go, his comment to which was ""can't do it bro"". This is an incomplete review as I've never actually dined at Ricky Bobby. However, as a food enthusiast and long time San Francisco resident,  I can assure you there are hundreds of other wonderful places to dine where you don't have to put up with such an offensively poor level of service. I think the entire interaction would have been at least a neutral (though pie-less) one if he hadn't approached in such an offensive manner. Great meal. Casual eating area, with long benches. We got seated across from each other in between two other couples, so don't expect much privacy.I got the burger, she got the shrimp grits, and we shared the sweet potato tots and a half slice of the pecan walnut pie. The burger was huge -- think a double at most other places. The bacon (ground and distributed through the beef) really comes through, which I didn't expect, and the sauces on the burger are great too. Didn't have much of the grits, but the pork belly on top was very well cooked. The tots were awesome, a tough crunchy battered shell and light and fluffy on the inside. The pie was equally tasty, and the vanilla ice cream that was served with it was very good and creamy.My only complaint was the lack of service, and the servers wore whatever they felt like -- some with jeans and graphic tees, some with collars, etc. Made it hard to tell who to flag down to get some service, since our ""waiter"" came few and far between.Even with that, it was one of the better meals I've had in a while, and very fairly priced (entrees ~$12, burger with no sides was $10). I'm not a hater but man was that awful.  Chicken pram - fatty w dark meat, mushy crust, no salt, too little sauce.I'm not going to go over the other items my table mates let me try and their reviews.Why this place has a cult following, I do not know. And I understand food and the restaurant industry. I was sad to part with my cash on this one and that's a rare, rare feeling. Pretty decent food. I came here a while back but there was a power outage right after we ordered. They offered to give us free beer and burgers for the hassle. The atmosphere is very different with family/picnic table style seating where you sit with other patrons.Went back last night with a couple of friends to try their menu and I gotta say it was pretty bomb. I ordered the sweet potatoe tots and the short rib lasagna. Both were excellent. They put a twist on all your favorite comfort foods. The tots were great with a hint of sweetness and the lasagna was savory and delicious.I'll be back to try the other items on the menu... Broken Record's dishes brought to the Lower Haight! I liked the setup of the restaurant, with the long benches and tables lined across each side of the room. The restaurant was busy when we got there, so we had to wait a couple minutes for a table, but there is a small waiting area in the front. Our group ordered the sweet potato tots and the lobster mac and cheese as per usual. No complaints here. Cool spot! FYI- They no longer have lobster mac and cheese on the menu.  Major bummer.  But the rest of the items were ordered were great.  Got the sweet potatoe tots, grits, lasagna, and chicken.  All were really great.  The burger looked monsterous but delicious (we didn't order it but the eaters seated next to us had it).   They said it has little pieces of bacon to make it juicy.  Not a fan of the communal tables though. I wanted to try this place ever since I heard the kitchen inside Broken Record moved here. The food here lived up to the expectations I had of Broken Record.Service - very fast. We got our food within 10 minutes of ordering. We were lucky and were seated right when we got in. There was a small wait after us but not bad.Atmosphere - loud, communal seating. This might not be for everyone but I did not mind it at all. It gave the place a very lively feeling yet still comfortable. I loved the chalkboard menuFood - ordered the chicken parm sandwich, shepherd's pie (special), crab bisque dip and side of fries. Everything was good but I have to highlight the crab bisque dip. I may be a bit biased because I love clam chowders - this dish was lick-the-bowl-clean delicious! Lots of real crab with chunks of scallop... mmmMy next visit will definitely involve the lobster mac and cheese (it wasn't on the menu when I first visited) and the sweet potatertots. Lobster macaroni and cheese? Sweet potato tots? Seriously, what more could I ask from comfort food?The lowdown: listen, this place is delicious. The prices are reasonable, the portions are good, and it's all served to you fresh piping hot. My only word of warning is that the place is small and fills up fast- we got here before they opened their doors one night and it was packed within about 15 minutes. So get here early or be prepared to wait- it's worth it! Went here with my friend on a Thursday night for dinner. Dining is communal - we waited for about 5 minutes, worth the wait though. The menu is pretty simple and on chalk boards at the front of the restaurant. My friend and I each got the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw and a side of sweet potato tots. The pulled pork was delicious and the tots were phenomenal.  This is a great local spot for dinner and drinks with some friends on a weeknight I finally got to check out the former kitchen of Broken Record and the food did not disappoint.  We had the short rib lasagna, chicken drums, crab bisque dip and the sweet potatertots and it was all delicious.  Plus, Rickybobby takes credit cards!Downsides are that there are fewer vegetarian options on the menu now, the tables are largely communal and the service is possibly even slower than it was at the Broken Record.  It is also possible that the wait times at the Broken Record just seemed shorter because I was always sipping on Four Roses from the tap while waiting for my delicious food to arrive.  Either way, I went on a Wednesday night at 8pm with a party of 4 and still had to wait 30 - 45 mins. to be seated and our food probably took another 30 - 45 mins. to arrive once we ordered.  Definitely be prepared for a wait when you go.Though the vibe is not quite the same,  Rickybobby still offers the same creative, comfort food at reasonable prices, especially considering how fancy the food is.  I hope to see some of my old favorites (ie. Duck Confit Potato Skins, Ahi Tuna Wrap, and Grilled Fontina Cheese & Crab Sandwich with Tomato Soup) on the menu soon! This place was really unique. I loved the atmosphere and the food but I wish they had more tables. We just missed the 6 o'clock seating time (when they first opened) and had to wait about an hour to get seated. Luckily the food made up for the wait. We got the pulled pork, the lobster mac n' cheese, the bacon burger, and the sweet potato tots. I REALLY loved everything but the sweet potato tots (and I had such high hopes!) The sweet potato tots weren't as sweet as I was expecting them to be and they were chunky because they were tator tots, but I wasn't a fan of the texture and I could only really enjoy them when I doused them in sauce.  HOWEVER, the lobster mac 'n cheese was so well flavored with sharp cheeses and good chunks of lobster. The bacon burger with the bacon ground into the beef was one of the best burgers I've ever had. The bacon gave it a new saltiness and the burger was cooked really well. Lastly, the pulled pork was a solid juicy pork. I will definitely go back and get my burger and mac 'n cheese but next time I will go right at 6 or expect to wait at least an hour. First off...parking is horrible! Ricky Bobby is located in the heart of Haight. All the hipsters with their Vespas and fixies took all the parking spots. I circled for about 20 minutes on a Friday night.  The wait wasnt that bad..ORDER THE CRAWSHRIMP GRITS!!!  Broken Record has a better menu.. I wanted to check this place out after hearing great reviews about Broken Record before the chefs decided to move and open up Rickybobby.At around 6:30 on a Saturday they said it would be about an hour wait but it ended up being a little over half an hour.Here's what we ordered:5/5 Sweet potatertots - Well fried with spices that really complimented it.      Short rib lasagna - Only had a taste of my friend's but the meat was nice and tender5/5 Crab bisque dip - It counted as a chowder to me since I could eat it with a spoon but it would probably be a dip for the more health conscious ;) Very flavorful with the fresh seafood including scallops.5/5 Crawshrimp grits - Amazing. Every bite was delicious. They give you plenty of crawfish already shelled which beats buying craw fish by the pound with the shells at the Cajun places.5/5 Chicken parm sandwich - Breaded chicken WITH sausage in the sandwich. Genius.4/5 Beef and bacon burger - The bacon wasn't too overpowering and complimented the meat well (I'm not a huge bacon fan either).Really well made food and you can tell that there was a lot of thought put into the dishes. They have large tables so you might end up sharing with another party. They even play movies on the wall which is fun. Very comfortable food (you can easily have a favorite) , very hipster but the food and the people are solid. Won't say it's mind blowing but enough for you to come back and try everything on the menu.  Priced well considering what they use,  but  the space is small. Hope these guys stay long enough to expand. I'm only rating the food. The service, eh, not so good. That definitely needs some improvement. Not really sure where I'd put this place...3.5, but a lot of that has to do with the weird service and environment.Came here with a large group of friends - some of the group came at 7PM to get a table for such a big group. No reservations, so they had to wait a long time. I got there at 7:30 and it was still a 30 minute wait...so we wandered down the street to get booze while others waited. In hindsight, we should have just ordered a beer there. You can do that while you wait...but you have to drink in their teeny tiny waiting area. I almost wonder if they should make the waiting area entirely outside, and take that remaining space for diners. When we sat down, most of us knew what we wanted...and the waiter came at a normal time. Though...if he came 5 minutes sooner, we'd still know what we wanted. Each of us ordered food, and a beer. We thought the beer could come earlier...which it didn't. We sat for a good 15 minutes waiting for the food, and had to request the beer come. I got a Chimay which comes in a BOTTLE, and it took 15 minutes. Yeesh. Beer came about the same time as food. My Chimay came after my entree came.  I guess they had to run out to buy Chimay from the corner liquor store??I ordered the crawfish and grits...SO GOOD AND SO FILLING. If you want the most bang for your buck, I'd suggest this. Though I'd like a bit more of the shrimp broth its served with. Note to the weary diner: there are NO SHELLS for you to peel or choke on. Had a bite of the short rib lasagna - it was ok, but not really amazing. There's good chunks of the ribs in there, so you know.  There's not much lasanga to it, so if you wanted it to be filling, it might not work.Finally, I had some of the sweet potato tater tots..which I kind of wish they served earlier as appetizers. They were good (with ketchup and ranch on the side), but I'm not sold on sweet potato taters. I think I'd opt for normal tots. Save the sweet potatoes for fries, ya know??We were seated near the door, so we had all the people waiting and conversing on the side while eying our food. It was a REALLY SMALL space. Forreals. ONE bathroom, so go either before or elsewhere. I saw that line go 5-person deep. I have a personal bias - if you know there's a line, you use the bathroom for only 2-3 minutes. The boy inside when I started waiting took a good 10 minutes. Awkward... After being sick for over a week and having to cancel my birthday dinner, I was due for a good meal.  My friend took me here for a one on one post b-day dinner, but now I really wish we'd had a bigger group!We originally went based on a recommendation from my roommate and, after seeing the photos of lobster mac & cheese, we were SOLD.  The ambiance is super casual, with no reservations, several parties sharing one table (about 6 people per table), and a seasonal menu on the wall.  I wouldn't suggest going here for a date, unless you're ok with sharing the experience with the strangers sitting at your table.  It can also get *really* noisy, so intimate conversation is nearly impossible.While we were crazy bummed to find out that the lobster mac & cheese was seasonal and temporarily off the menu, in hindsight I'm glad it wasn't an option because I not only loved what I got instead, I kind of wanted to marry it.  Like, forever.We ordered:Asparagus & Leek soup - mild, flavorful, with a thick swirl of creme fraiche and crispy bread crumbs.Sweet Potatotots - GENIUS, enough to share with a table of 3-4, served with ranch & ketchup. Short Rib Lasagna - big chunks of meat & really flavorful.  The only complaint was that it was a little too salty.Crawshrip Grits - ok, this is what I got.  Remember I wanted to marry it?  I meant it.  Absolutely a superstar of a dish!  It's spicy, savory, and completely fulfilling.  The grits are thick (like mashed potatoes), topped with tons of crawfish, spicy broth, cheese, scallions, and PORK BELLY.  Divine.  Just a really really good well balanced dish.The price point is excellent at around $6 for soup/sides and $12 for entrees.  Just be prepared that entrees don't include ANY sides, so you'll have to spring for the tater tots to go with your burger or sandwiches. Okay, I'm trying REALLY hard not to be super biased and write a less than stellar review because I was so disappointed the lobster mac and cheese was NOT available when I came here.*deep breath*Oh, who am I kidding. This place tries, but fails to achieve the charm of its original moniker - the famous Broken Record out in the middle of Nowheresville, San Francisco. Rickybobby is very much in the middle of Somewhere, given that it's in a nice Lower Haight location that boasts a number of cute shops and restaurants. However, the food here is good, but not really memorable. There are a few interesting dishes - such as the short rib lasagna - and a few old favorites - such as the sweet potato tots - that lend to a solid choice, if not a standout place for dinner. The portions are very small for what you pay so that's definitely disappointing. I did like that they project old movies on the wall, but you really can't hear anything with the clamor of the room, so it's really more for decoration than anything else. OK so I hit the lower Haight and got into Rickybobby.  The place is small with communal seating.  That's not really my thing.  But the people nearby were nice so the seating was OK.  And to sum everything up in a nutshell, the food is OK but the pricing is low.  That takes the sting out of any plate that isn't manna from heaven.I started with a salad of little gems with grapes, manchego cheese, pine nuts, brioche croutons and lemon dressing.  This eight dollar salad was the high point of my meal.  Complex.  Tasty food.  Their vaunted burger was just OK so far as I was concerned.  The smokey taste of the bacon ground into the burger obliterated any taste of beef.  But this ten dollar double burger was filling, no doubt about that.  Finally, I decided to try out their soup: a six dollar bowl of asparagus and leek soup that came with creme fraiche and green garlic breadcrumbs.  This would have been vastly improved if it had arrived more than barely lukewarm.    Service was enthusiastic and the place had a nice vibe. I agree with some of the reviewers... Hipster paradise! But I am writing this review over a week after I visited and I am still dreaming about that burger! Words fail me... Unreal... Beef and bacon burger... Our table had the pulled pork and chicken parm as well... And days later my fellow diners were still on about my burger... Was fantastic! I thought the prices were good... But then we didn't have any alcohol which probable helped...Small menu, busy but worth the visit... Checked this place out because we wanted to be around Haight-Ashbury, and also because of the reviews on Yelp. Went last week, 2/12/13, and wow, talk about crowded. Seating is hard if you want a little bit of space from the next party. The bench seating is good for groups of 4+ though. Service was good, even though we had to wait a bit, our hosts made sure to serve us some drinks during our wait. Added bonus, they were playing Stand By Me, with subtitles during dinner :) What we ordered:Drinks: Green Flash IPAAppetizers: Sweetpatater tots, with ketchup and house ranch: ok, not as great as it sounds. I kept expecting the saltier potato /hash brown taste.  Entree 1: Beef  & Bacon burger: bacon ground with the beef...ahhhmmaazzing! It's like the bacon flavor was evenly distributed throughout the whole patty. Definitely made it more tasty. Served medium-rare, and very juicy. Would order this again. Entree 2: Lobster Risotto cakes, *night's special: cakes were a little dry and tough, not nice and crispy/flakey. For being the night's special, expected a little more in flavor. Regretted not ordering the crab bisque. The person next to me ordered it, and it looked delicious! Looked like  a large bowl of creamy tomato sound with lots of toasty bread and bits of crab. Mannnn I should have went with my instincts! Fun spot to dine with a group of friends. They do not take reservations, however there are plenty of bars to wait at nearby. They also tend to overestimate the wait and usually it's about half of what they actually suggest. The food is a fun play of traditional American classics. Highlights are the crawfish grits with pork belly and scallions. Beautiful cheesy lumpy consistency and huge portion. Also fan of the sweet potato tots and burger infused with bacon. For dessert, go with the strawberry sundae atop a pistachio pound cake.  The dish I wasn't crazy about was the lobster risotto cakes. Filler/sauce was yum but the cakes were over fried or the oil just wasn't fresh. Again, fun unique spot to hang with friends, fast service and good prices. 3.5 stars.Good food, just a tad overpriced.  I tried the pulled pork sandwich because the chiles and daikon just sounded like they would complement the pork so well.  Sure enough, it was more complex than the bacon beef burger but I found myself getting bored after a while and regretted not ordering the burger or just going down the street to Memphis Minnie's for some smoked pulled pork instead of Rickybobby's less flavorful slow cooker pulled pork.  But man, those sweet potatertots!  Heavenly!  Next time I'll skip the entree and just eat a basket of those myself.One of my issues with this place though is that it is so loud.  Not sure if it's just the acoustics in this room, but I can barely hear the person sitting across from me! I can't say one bad thing about this place! stop what your doing and go now! It was the most delicious meat and fried food party ever, buy a green flash and have some tots yo! If I ate meat this place would be a 4. Service was great, we were there from 6:30-8:00ish and I'd say the timing for both food and drinks was perfect. Just when I would start to wonder when my drink was coming , -bam!- there it was. For the folks complaining about hipsterness, I'm not really sure what you're talking about, there is 5x more attitude at Broken Record(which I like) than this place. The food: Tatertot thingies were pretty good, the pear salad is a little odd : the massive pair + the blue cheese bread pieces, the ice cream dessert we should've passed on but didn't, fresh strawberries por favor! So it's the same as BR but a little more dressed up. Spice up your veg. menu please!!! Rickybobby is just another semi-decent-hipster-SF-joint where you have to line up forever to get a seat at any given time. First glance, there is no reservations, no to go, and the seats are communal. These communal seats are not very convenient considering one side of the bench seats are up against the wall. If you get seated in the middle of the table, then you will have to ask strangers seated next to you to get out so you can get out. I find that kind of bizzarre for communal seating and a little to intimate for comfort. If you go there with one other person, you will be elbow to elbow with the party next to you and they WILL hear all of your conversations. Food wise, overall I'd give it 3.5/5. +Burger - 4/5 juicy, nicely greased buns and cheese melting and stretching deliciously.+Crawshrimp Grits - 5/5 sooo good. Soupy seafood broth with crawfish, shrimp, egg, green onion, topped with perfectly cooked pork belly bits. +Sweet Potatertots - 3/5 disappointing. I've read reviews saying these are heaven if you like sweet potatoes. I love sweet potatoes but i didn't think there were thatgreat at all. In fact, I prefer regular run of the mill tatertots above these. +Fries - regular fries. HUGE basket for a $2 side. I went to Rickybobby two weeks ago on a recommendation from a friend. We got there at about 5:57, and were seated at 6:03. We ordered at 6:05. I ordered the lobster mac & cheese, and my boyfriend ordered the special, which was a short rib lasagna. At around 6:07, the waiters huddled in the corner and started whispering dramatically. A few minutes later, our server came back to the table to inform us that they were out of the special. I don't understand how a restaurant could run out of the special 10 minutes after opening, before a full round of tables had even ordered. The server didn't apologize or offer any explanation. My boyfriend decided to go with the burger, which was underwhelming. I don't know how a burger ground with bacon could taste so average...The lobster mac & cheese was delicious. I couldn't believe how much lobster there was, from the first bite to the bottom of the bowl. The cheese was a little runnier than I like, but it was super tasty. The service in general was just weird. The server seemed confused most of the time.We'll probably be back, but I think we'll give them another month or two to work out the kinks. Not that you asked, but my advice is that you get drunk, go to Rickybobby, and then get drunk again. You will feel alive. This is a place to go when you want to eat kids' food (for grownups) at communal tables in a loud bustling shoebox of a restaurant. Don't take your girlfriend and her parents here. Unless you're all wasted.Rickybobby is at the corner of Haight and Webster, adding extra coolness to an already awesome neighbourhood. Yes, you will have to wait for a table, but it wasn't insufferable and the staff didn't sadistically delight in watching us wait, like they do at that other place. YOU know what I mean.I ordered the beef and bacon burger and the chicken drums. The bacon and the beef are ground together, which is an idea so brilliant it should win the Nobel Prize in Meat. The chicken is not to be sneezed at. An order of drums is two legs so our two orders amounted to (wait for it) four BBQ-glazed drumsticks. They were sticky and delicious, and I left feeling like someone punched a delicious fist deep into my stomach. Not too pricy either. Thank you Rickybobby. Obligatory Title Pun: ROLL in this RICK: you'll never want to give it up.Menu Readability: Everything you need is in a framed chalkboard above the kitchen.Need to mention: If you don't chew Big Red, then fuck you!What this place teaches me about myself: Like seriously, why isn't there a Nobel Prize for meat? Yikes!  I'm going to get massive eating at this place.  Crawfish grits, short rib lasagna, phenomenal burger and sweet sweet potato tots.  Affordable and delicious. So glad this place is BACK!! The menu is great!! We had the lobster mac-n-cheese, the special of the night short rib lasagna, and our favorite dish the crawshrimp and grits!! Superb dining experience and great service.  If I could give this place 6 stars I would.  I'd recommend getting there early..meaning right when they open since it does get packed very fast!!! It feels like deja vu writing a review about RickyBobby when I had almost the same food at Broken Record last year.  Yes those same geniuses that came up with their Beef & Bacon Burger and Pulled Pork Waffle Fries have created their own restaurant in the Lower Haight.The Beef & Bacon Burger (Triple B) is still awesome and still one of my top 10 burgers of all time.  Really now, with bacon inside the beef patty, there's no way you can not not like this burger.  The only difference this time is now it's a double patty instead of a single.  More bacon for your buck!!!  Delicious!!bit.ly/12CoceKSweet Potato Tots are good to share with everyone at the table  Especially with their house ranch sauce.bit.ly/Y1hwB9Tried their Lobster Quesadilla Special.  This was really good and had huge chunks of lobster inside.bit.ly/UQTn3QThe space isn't that much bigger than their dining room was at BR.  But it definitely has more room and I do miss the counter where you can see the chefs work their magic behind the kitchen, but the bigger space makes up for it.  If there's one gripe I have with the spot, it's that parking around the area is a crapshoot.  But that's really irrelevant to the dining experience.It's good to see the former BR chefs doing their own thing with RickyBobby and I will definitely return again for another round.  The Beef & Bacon Burger is simply worth coming back for! Sometimes I just don't understand the concept of ""just because your food is good, doesn't matter if the service is good/or not"". server was super ""blah"".As for the food, David and I shared:Pulled pork - taste was good, liked the bread, but sandwich was lukewarmShortrib Lasagna - more vegetables, than shortrib meat?Sweet Potato Tator Tots - very good, very plentiful for just $5red or white wine? - really? Yum.CLEANLINESS: 4/5SERVICE: 5/5FOOD: 5/5+ Sweet Potatertots+ Beef and Bacon Burger+ Crawshrimp Grits+ Short Rib Lasagna+ Chicken Drums+ Pecan and Walnut PieThe first time I went here, I didn't even get a chance to eat. That's because we waited an hour and then the host kept saying it'll be another hour... So just left and decided to try it another time.We got here early and got seated once the restaurant opened. I pretty liked most of the dishes that we got. I'm a sweet potato fan, and the sweet potatertots are a must! So good! (Not sure if you can get them somewhere packaged, but either way they were good). The beef and bacon burger was pretty good. My definite favorite was the crawshrimp grits. I've never had grits before, but this sure tasted good. The short rib lasagna was also good. The chicken drums were ehh. I wouldn't get them again. The pecan and walnut pie was okay. A little too sweet for me. It was quite nutty too for you nutty fans. I wouldn't order it again.We were hoping to try the lobster mac n cheese, but apparently they change the menu here every so often. I'll definitely try to come back when they have it again!Just beware of the wait time! I totally don't care if I have to sit at a common table with hipsters in ugly printed trousers and weird hats, the tater tots are amazing and totally worth it. No lobster Mac the night I was there, bacon burger was okay, grits were far tastier. First, I was devastated when they left Broken Record, then I was excited again when I heard they left to open their own restaurant. (Though I did prefer them at the previous location because they were closer to me and didn't have a long wait)I got the crawfish grits here again because I wasn't that hungry and I was simply sharing it with my boyfriend. Again, all that is missing is having it served in a bread bowl. I mentioned that to one of the staff members and he hinted that they might be coming up with something new on the menu served in a bread bowl - but not the grits. Sweet Potater tots - yummmm. Dunk or throw them in your crawfish grits, you won't regret it. It tasted like they were made for each other.Fries- HANDS DOWN THE BEST FRIES IVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. no lie. not even exaggerating. If I could eat this all day without killing myself, I would. Rickybobby has a FABULOUS menu, and I'm excited to try everything on the menu one day., their food really can't dissapoint. Holy sh*t! Everything is really good, great food & rowdy, casual atmosphere. Get here early though, it's a mad house and they don't take reservations. Customer Service is probably the only reason I'm doing 4 vs 5 stars. Everyone's nice, but  think they may just need more staff. But food-wise, this place is totally worth it. The burger is great, the lobster mac and cheese is a rich bowl of heaven and the chicken drums --get these regardless of what else you order. Wow. They're the best! I rarely yelp, but this place was amazing.  The shrimp and grits were unlike anything I have ever seen and the pulled pork sandwich with green chiles was life-changing. The only drawback was the line, but it also shows you how amazing the food is at this place. Rickybobby isn't amazing.The place has all the makings of your new, hot, SF establishments. There's always a line out the door, no reservations (apparently they aren't willing to call you when your table is ready since ""we don't have a phone"".... *BS ALERT!), and communal seating. These aren't the worst thing in the world, they're just status quo for SF restaurants. Not complaining.The food is a mish-mash of rich ingredients that are hard to mess up. The comfort food menu includes: lobster quesadillas with salsa and sourcream on the side, a burger with a patty made of beef and bacon, short rib lasagne, pulled pork sandwich, and a sweet glazed drumstick. Since Rickybobby isn't too expensive, we tried all of the above hehe. Everything was fine, but nothing to write home about (only YELP about!)The true standouts: Sweet Potatertots, Crawshrimp Grits, and the Chocolate Brownie Sundae. I came in super skeptical because of the name, and left thinking that this is the best burger that I can remember eating. When you factor in the price, it is even better. Great food, great value. I seriously can't remember a better burger though.The grits were a revelation as well, but the sweet potato tater-tots were just good. I can't wait to go back. *small intimate seating place with some unique and spectacular food*#wellpriced#zomggritsSo only recently I started noticing this place while passing on the bus. You can't miss the American pig sign out front and decided to check it out with a friend on a Tuesday night. Wow, packed with a 30 minute wait for 2 people. This place is set up in an interesting way with 4 long huge community tables which is a fun way to eat. Very busy in there but gave us ample time to perv at other people's food selections and check out the high resolution massive pictures. Also 5th element was playing and that's just amazing. An order of fries came out that wasn't ours, but the generous owner decided to just leave it for the table which was incredibly nice of him. All I can say is...oh my god these craw-shrimp cheesy grits were like nothing I've ever had before. Soaked in a seafood broth, littered with succulent craw fish, and then topped with some pork-belly. A true amalgamation of amazing taste. Totally thrown off guard and enjoyed every moment of it. My friend also got a tasty habanero pulled pork sandwich that was delightfully done with an apple and jicama coleslaw. I still have no idea what jicama is but a unique twist and delightful turn on coleslaw. On top of all this you get a great price for the food that you are getting. Glad this place is so close to me. Check it out. I went here with Desmond C. and my cousins the other day.  We made sure to arrive about 20 min prior to opening and it's a good thing we did!  About 5 min later there was a line of about 20 ppl after us!  We decided to do family style and order a bunch of dishes.  The most notable ones are as followed:Sweet Potatertots: If you're a sweet potato fan, you will LOVE these delicious crispy tots.  They are cooked to a perfect crunch!Crawfish Grits: packed with flavor and even had some meat chunks sprinkled on top!  The only criticism i have with this dish is that I wish it weren't as liquid-yBacon Burger: While this burger was pretty tasty, I think Umami's burgers are more juicyShort Rib Lasagna: This was pretty good and there was plenty of meat in the dishThe only thing I don't recommend getting are their $3 chicken drumsticks.  Don't get me wrong, they were good, but not worth $3.All in all we ordered 2 chicken drumsticks and 5 dishes that came out to only $15/person including tax and tip!  (we went with four ppl!)Definitely coming back here again :D Definitely a restaurant for people in their 20s who want a quality cheap bite.$5 wine is great, as long as you don't need quality.All communal tables, which is fun.  One or two dishes are wow scrumptious (ahi tuna salad with tangerine and wasabi cream); the rest are pretty basic - good but basic. Always been a fan of a good burger/american contemporary cuisine. My roommate and I came here on a Wednesday night thinking it wouldn't be too packed. SO WRONG. Place was packed and there was a nice queue forming. However, a lot of people seemed to have given up so the waitlist was a lot shorter than it really was. I ordered the chicken parm sandwich and my roommate got the lobster and pork belly grits. We also ordered some sweet potato tots. Orders came out REALLY hot. The time from the food goes on to the plate until it hits table is maybe 30 seconds. The tots were really good with the ketchup and ranch dipping sauces it came with and the portion is definitely not skimpy. Can easily be shared between 3-4 people. The chicken parm was a pretty tasty sandwich. I loved how they loaded it with basil. The chicken was moist and crispy. I had a few bites of the grits and that was really good as well. Flavorful and very filling. I will say that the sandwich costing $10 was a bit steep. While I did enjoy it, I felt that the price for JUST a chicken parm was a bit up there.I will come back and try more of the menu. woohoo there was  a significant wait on a thursday evening, when it was looking grim we stuck it out and only waited 15 minutes.  Waiters were busy but also really awesome-loved the food and the new interior! Will definitely be coming back. The food at broken record was so popular that the chefs had to open this restaurant. I heard a lot about the food from a cowoker and was really excited to try it. My husband and I went on a thurs night at 7 and were pleased the wait was only 15 minutes. It's communal seating though so you may sit with a few strangers. I had the crawshrimp grits and they were delicious! The grits came with a broth so it gave it a unique texture. The flavor was great although the pork belly on top was just a little on the tough side. The sweet potato tots were crispy, sweet, and plenty to share amongst 3-4 people, but I wish it came with some type of an aioli. My husband got the bacon burger which had 2 patties. He really liked it but it was a little too much meat for me.I'd definitely go back for the grits alone. Everyone raves about the lobster mac n' cheese so I'd also like to try that. Their desserts also sound delicious. When we went they had a brownie sundae with macadamia coconut ice cream and a pinot nutella sauce! I wish I had saved room for that! This was second dinner in my birthday palooza outing. I had been wanting to try the lobster mac and cheese, and although I was full already it was the best damn lobster mac and cheese I've ever had. The lobster pieces were big and plumb. The pasta was perfectly cooked, and as you dipped into the dish and pulled the fork away the cheese oozed and followed along. So much food. So full. So good. So cannot stop.  Also had the sweet potatotos. They were fresh, perfectly bite sized and delicious. I can't wait to go back to have their cheeseburger which looked AMAZING. If only I had a second stomach sometimes. This is the best burger in San Francisco and OMFG what a brilliant name for a fatty fatty restaurant. It's especially delicious at midnight. That's all I've got. Oh Rickybobby, you have fooled me twice.  Never again unless you get take out.  On the first trip we were seated and expected to know our order instantly.  When we didn't know our waiter left us to watch the projected movie for ten minutes.  We ordered the pulled pork sandwich, the chicken parm sandwich, the pear salad and the sweet potatertots.  The pulled pork came first, it was yummy but the slaw was a little weird.  Where was the salad or the utensils?  Apparently you have to ask for utensils and the salad comes with the second person's entree.  I am not sure where they were raised but it is not polite to eat while the other person is waiting for their food.  After all of the first three dishes were finished the tots finally arrived.  The food is all very good but what joker is expediting?  It makes no sense.  We thought our waiter was the worst the first time.The second time was even worse.   We were seated right away and our order was taken.  Looks like you need to know the menu before you hit the seat to get your order taken in a timely manner.  Once again no utensils and the food came out in a ridiculous order.  This time it was the burger & tots before the lasagna and salad.  When the first set of food came out we asked why the salads never come out first.  The waiter's response was ""I don't know, oh and well they have to cook the salad.  Hold on there buddy.""  Did I hear you correctly you had to cook the salad?  Really I was unaware that you cooked a salad.  Then waiter got angry and stormed off.  When the rest of the food came the plates were thrown at us.  The poor couple that sat down at the community style table with us had to look at our empty plates for 15 minutes until we asked for the check.The food is really good, but I can't deal with the service and badly expedited kitchen.  The two stars are earned by the food.  I wish that you just ordered and the counter and got a number.  Anything can work better than what they are doing now.  Maybe when they finally have take out I will eat their delicious food again. I must confess that I have a new man in my life and his name is RickyBobby!Our love affair didn't seem very obvious to me at first. Oh, what's that? A new hipster haven with an ironically silly name just opened up in the Lower Haight and they're serving comfort-esque style food and cool beers. What? Never heard of such a concept before and in San Francisco? You don't say.But much like most ""dates,"" I find it best to go in with a slightly open mind and reserve absolute judgment until hipster food makes its way into my somewhat jaded mouth and much like an awesome internet date you never saw coming, this place was RAD! With tables pretty much on top of each other, prepare to get cozy with your neighbor. If you are a food stalker like me, you will love this as you can easily survey what other people are stuffing into their faces. As soon as I caught one look at the dark and shiny glazed chicken drumstick, I knew that bad boy would be mine. Then, oh what's this, short rib mac n cheese?! Are they reading my dirty diary!! Sweet happy Jesus, in the mouth NOW.All of these were amazing, but they must now step aside for the main reason I have come out of reviewing retirement. That reason is the cheeseburger. Good God of all things meat and glorious! This might be the best burger in San Francisco. I shit you not! Not only is it loaded with ooey gooey American cheese (stop and hold your hate roll), but the perfectly cooked patty is filled with crumbled bacon. It's not dry either. Oh no no, it's super moist and amazing and perfectly seasoned and it's, it's just, it's, it's absolutely  oooohmazing!!I know I have a history of falling in love with meat dishes and then leaving them for others, but I can't stop thinking about this Rickybobby burger. It is 4am craving-worthy. It's name your first born after-worthy and it's available at a cute new spot with a slick decor and a warm and friendly vibe.Try this bad boy. Trust. This could become my new favorite neighborhood place! The food is awesome and decently price, and service is friendly. Definitely don't come here expecting to maintain any of those ridiculous ""I'm going to start eating healthy"" New Years resolutions you made a few weeks ago. Even their salads are pretty rich.My friend and I split the following for dinner:-Bacon burger (Amazing. Bacon is fried, chopped up, and incorporated INTO the meat patty = bacon in every bite)-Beet salad (Minus the fried oysters, just to be 'healthier')-Lobster mac and cheese (Oh boy. SO GOOD. They definitely don't skimp on the lobster, and the dish is baked, so you get a great crust at the top)Since they apparently just got their liquor license, we also ordered some adult libations for the table.Total was ~$40 (minus tip) for everything. Since this place is tiny, and just opened up a few months ago, expect a 30+ min wait if you show up on a Friday or Saturday night. No big deal-- just get your name on the list, and walk a block to a drinking establishment on Haight. This place's clientele has outgrown its tiny interior almost instantly!  There are six or seven communal tables, and our party of three waited 30-45 mins to grab a small section on a Friday night.The food is decadent - comfort food kicked up a notch.  Like mac and cheese? Add some lobster.  Chicken parm?  How about some fresh basil.  They grind bacon into their burger meat, which makes a delicious, greasy mess.  I highly recommend it.The sides of sweet potato tots and fries are quite generous - this is to say sharing two baskets between three people was a futile task.This is probably a solid weeknight spot for me, as long as the wait isn't too long! Food is awesome. Service and wait are terrible. That's all you really need to know. Like at Broken record, the food at Rickybobby is an excellent value. We arrived early on a Wednesday and were able to snag a whole table for our party. Service was a little slow but very friendly. I particularly enjoyed the beet salad - the idea of ranch yogurt seemed kind of disgusting (I normally avoid ranch anything), but it was delicious! Somehow the chicken drums that we've gotten always seem to come ~3/order rather than 1 - not sure why, but I have no problem with it! The pecan pie is really fantastic - some of the best I've had - and the ""half"" is quite large. When we came it was BYOB, which was nice, but I look forward to giving them more money for alcohol, because I really feel like they're undercharging. A great addition to the neighborhood! Came here with a friend on a Saturday night... bad idea! But luckily the food tasted good, so it was all worth the wait. I've never eaten at the Broken Record... but if this is the type of food they used to serve, I've been missing out! Arrived around 6:50, and we ended up waiting for an hour and thirty minutes. So... if you don't feel like walking around the area... I'd probably come on a weekday.My friend and I shared everything we ordered. If you're uncomfortable with sitting next to strangers, this may not be the place for you... luckily we were seated next to some nice people. Ordered the sweet potatertots, beef and bacon burger, chicken parm sandwich, and the lobster mac n cheese! Sweet potatertots were the first to arrive... I'm not sure if it was because my stomach was starved after eating itself, but it was AMAZING. Plenty of tatertots for 3-4 people... it was the only dish we couldn't finish. Eat it while it's hot, cause thats when it tastes the best... just be careful and don't burn your mouth like I did! But then again... when you're starving, you just don't give a s***! Next up was the beef and bacon burger and the chicken parm sandwich. The beef and bacon burger was really good, especially with the condiments they give you. But the entire time, all I tasted was bacon, but that's because they mix the bacon with the beef. So I guess if you're a bacon fan, you'll love this burger instantly. Oh, and the burger came with a pickle... I know it's just a pickle... but I LOVED THAT PICKLE! It was crunchy, sour, and fresh! I was tempted to just ask for a few more sticks of pickles! The chicken parm sandwich was actually my favorite dish of the night. VERY flavorful and everything blended very well together. I didn't think it was spicy, but my friend thought it was a little spicy. Chicken wasn't dry either... I savored every bite... I was kind of sad when I finished it. Finally, the oh so famous lobster mac n cheese. It definitely was a very CHEESY mac n cheese. I'm usually not a mac n cheese fan, but this was definitely really good. Sure, it was probably clogging my arteries but at least it was worth every bite. They're also not skimpy on the lobster meat either, you get some pretty big chunks of lobster in there. Near the end of the meal though, when I was stuffed and felt like I needed my fatty pants, my friend and I was forcing ourselves to finish the mac n cheese. I'm not sure if it was because I was too full or the cheese was just too much, but I started to get nauseated. Maybe next time we'll just take it to go. Basically the food was awesome. Service, was okay. Like other reviewers said, they probably need one more waiter just to balance everything out, but they're definitely trying. Place is clean. Definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu, but maybe on the weekday so I can avoid my stomach digesting itself again. I had a fantastic dinner here on a cold wintery night, and this place served up just the right level of rich and decadent comfort food with a sophisticated twist.  The wait was a tad long, the tables are communal, and the menu is written on the chalkboard above the kitchen rather than distributed to each patron.  None of these things were that bothersome.  They were also showing some excellent cinema on the wall (read that jean claude van damme classics).  Three of us shared the fries and the sweet potatertots.  Good, standard, large portions.  The entrees really sealed the deal though.  One of us got the chicken parm sandwich which he seemed pleased with.  Two of us shared the lobster mac and cheese and the burger (yes, the infamous partially bacon burger) and both were richly divine.  I thought the mac and cheese was the best lobster mac I'd had in SF.  The sauce was rich and creamy, the corn, spinach, and tomatoes added diversity to the taste, and the lobster was plentiful.  However, some of the claw meat felt overcooked and had a slightly off consistency.  If it had all been tail meat, it would've been a slam dunk.  The burger had the amazing taste of bacon, but the consistency of beef.  I felt content after only eating half because it was so rich.  The servers were nice, though swamped with the crowd.  I was a little disappointed because I asked if we could get the burger with a cheese other than American (there were clearly other cheeses on the menu), but the waiter said we could not make substitutions, though he let us put the ketchup on the side.  That bummed me out a bit, but luckily the burger itself outshone the cheese, so I didn't mind in the end.  I would love to come back and try most anything on the menu, so come here hungry and looking to feel nice and satisfied at the end of your meal. Arrived on Saturday night and scored a table right away! Another 5 minutes and we would've faced a significant wait. Only about 10 large tables line the walls of this small restaurant...so once word gets out I'm sure this place will be packed to the brim.we went all out and ordered: Bacon infused burger, tater tots, chicken drumsticks, lobster mac n cheese, beet salad, grits. For dessert we had the hawaiian bread pudding. BYOB! After we ordered we walked to the liquor store across the street for beer (classy!) and offered one to our server. Interesting concept but it beats paying for overpriced liquor! Food arrived and we were floored by how amazing each dish was. At less than $10 per plate, the portions were more than generous and the servers were chill and friendly. We were tempted to just hang out and drink more beers, but the long line piling up near the door made us feel bad. cannot wait to return to try the rest of their dishes and desserts!!! I loved it when it was being served at The Broken Record and I love it now at Rickybobby.The food is fantastic.  Lobster mac and cheese is my favorite, but the crawfish and grits is amazing as well.  I don't think you can go wrong ordering anything at this place.I'm surprised reading some of the negative reviews, because I've never had bad service here, even when it was INSANELY busy, which leads me to believe that some yelpers tend to be a little bit sensitive....surprise surprise.  Oh well, hopefully they don't come back and take up a seat I could be occupying.If you like good food and a good atmosphere, this is your spot. Too bad, so sad. No, really I am sad. I wanted to like this place, it's about 3 minutes from my apt. and there's this big line and this big hype and there's...the food. Yeah. That's the thing. The food. It's just not very good. The current 4.5 star rating is shocking, truly. Lobster Mac 'n Cheese: Tasted like nacho cheese with un-properly cooked bow-tie pasta. (chewy, crunchy). The lobster was tasty, but I'm fairly sure they didn't make that in house (wink).Beet Salad with Fried Oysters: The fried oysters were tasty, but they had nothing to do with the salad. That is to say, they didn't go together. In fact, nothing in the salad quite went together. I can't even remember what else we got...oh. the Pulled Pork Sandwich. Meh.  It was just, okay. Not much more to say, not much more to it.The stumperS: Our server, who came to our table numerous times asked me my name ""for the order.""  Why? How bout, table number 3 that you're serving. We clearly weren't going anywhere. Perhaps this is a growing pains issue from a walk-up counter at one location, to a sit-down at the next? This was confusing. Also, they have these big pictures on the wall of pigeons and horses, and landscapes and then - they have a hamburger. It went from hipster to TGIF real quick. Blown up hamburger picture? Wha?Oh, Rickybobby. I haven't even written a review in years but I couldn't sit back and watch 4.5 stars encourage people to eat you. It's simply unfair.My girlfriend says: ""I'd go back there, but probably just because they're open late.""  Well, it does beat the new Volare pizza. In short: overrated right now. Customer service needs MAJOR improvement. They need takeout, and I won't return until customer service improves dramatically.We came here last Friday (01/11/2013) around 7PM with a party of 3 to check out what everyone had been talking about. Super packed.. alright.. expected. The host walks up and asks us ""Are you on the list?"" ""Nope..."" He walks back to the other end of the restaurant and picks up the list and writes our name down and says about 25 minutes. We grab a (crowded) seat at the front and waited.. They were SEVERELY understaffed. The host, who I could tell was a bit frazzled, also bussed the tables and sometimes grabbed water for folks, all while putting people on ""the list"". Right around 25 minutes (but after folks with same number in their party), we were seated.We look around... and wait. We knew what we wanted to order (the menu was on the far end of the restaurant). A party of three sitting next to us had 2/3 of their food delivered when we sat down. It looked tasty, but one girl didn't have her food. Fast forward to the rest of that party finishing their food, when the other 1/3 of the order shows up.All of this happens.. and we still haven't been given water. Finally, after 20 minutes of being seated at a table, we are given water. I flag down a waiter (who was annoyed I flagged him down), and we order our food. We are starving.Maybe 10 minutes later (not too long), my food (grilled fontina cheese and crab tomato soup) arrived first. My grilled cheese was lukewarm.. soup was warm. $10 for lukewarm grilled cheese was my first thought? I wait patiently, hoping the rest of the food comes out.. no dice. My friends tell me to eat.. I take a bite of the grilled cheese and was very underwhelmed. Slightly burned, lukewarm, and seemingly lacking butter (but I can't confirm it other than what my tastebuds told me). Honestly, my grilled cheese would have been better with Kraft American singles. The tomato/crab soup was fine.. but underwhelming. My meal was *NOT* worth the $10 I paid.Most of our food finally arrived -- sweet potatertots, beef/bacon burger, lobster mac & cheese, and two chicken drums. Each plate was SLAMMED down on the table by our disgruntled waiter. Lovely. Sweet potatertots were generous, pretty tasty, and overall pretty good (I think I was still pissed I waited so long for water and my grilled cheese was crap).  Beef/bacon burger was juicy & tasty but looked NOTHING like the picture on the wall right behind us (who puts a giant hamburger picture that isn't something from their menu?). Chicken drums were loved by my friends, I wasn't impressed; they still say they were fantastic. You be the judge. Lobster mac 'n cheese was very good -- it lives up to the hype. Is the hype worth the wait and bad customer service? No. We ate pretty much everything on the table because we were starving. I was so hungry after waiting so long that I even finished the crappy grilled cheese. Oh.. and guess what didn't show up? The pear salad we ordered. I really wanted Rickyboby to live up to my expectations and the initial Yelp reviews, but they didn't. I have never been there any other time, but the service BLEW MONKEY BALLS on Friday night. Some of the food was good (lobster mac and cheese), others can be dropped (grilled cheese). I hope it improves.. but right now I will not return. I came here yesterday with my boyfriend at around 6:45pm on a Friday night. It was tad bit awkward because it was a full house, but none of the parties had their food yet. Anyways, we were seated right away and the waiter gave us glasses of waters as we squinted our eyes to look at the menu up front. I've never been to Broken Record, but my boyfriend told me that they basically kept the same menu. We settled on the Sweet Potato tater tots, Crab Grilled Cheese with Fontina, and Pulled Pork Sandwich along with some good ol' Anchor Steams to wash it down.Sweet Potato Tater Tots with house made ranch sauce and ketchup - Finally! A restaurant that knows how to do Sweet Potato Tater Tots! The basket was enough to share between 3-4 people and house made ranch was divine! I secretly wanted to take some of their house made ranch home. The tots aren't oily and are oh so good!Crab Grilled Cheese with Fontina and a spicy Tomato Soup with crab - I definitely wish they put  more crab in the grilled cheese! No worries, I found it in the soup! The spicy tomato soup was perfect for dipping or even slurping on. The Fontina cheese tasted more like American cheese, though.Pulled Pork Sandwich - The pork was sweet and SO good! I can't really say much about the bread lol because I just had a bite of the pork.Overall, I'm giving RickyBobby 5 stars. My water glass was constantly being filled, my belly was full, and I am not complaining! Didn't wait too long, and everyone working there was very nice. I got the burger, which was very good.  My bf got the crab grilled cheese which was a miss.  It just wasn't good. The cheese was bright yellow and tasted like american more than fontina.  I felt bad he didn't like it so gave him a few bites of the burger, which he also thought was really good.  They were pretty slammed so our fries and sweetpotatoe tots didn't come out until we were done with the mains.  That usually bugs me but the waiter was very nice and I think they just sell those items so quickly that they couldn't keep up.  I think something else might be a better side rather than ranch like sweet chili sauce, but I might be in the minority there.  Overall good and we'll go back.  Any kinks in the meal were overshadowed by the friendly staff and the burger tastiness! I'll keep mine short and sweet. If the menu sounds like your thing then you won't be dissapointed. Everything is done with great thought and detail. Always exceeds expectations. The Rickybobby kitchen used to be a little pop up in Broken Record. Came here for a new years eve dinner:Lobster Mac & CheeseSweet PotatertotsCrab & Fontina Grilled Cheese with spicy tomato dipping soupOne of the reasons why I followed the kitchen from Broken Record to Rickybobby is because of the lobster mac & cheese. I love the lobster mac & cheese and I think they improved and already perfect thing!Everything is delicious at Rickybobby but I found the sweet potatertots and the spicy tomato dipping soup a bit salty. I am not sure if it was just our dishes or just the day we went (since we went for new years eve so the chef might have been a little happy with the salt). But definitely get the lobster mac & cheese! It has corn, lobster, and spinach! I love it! The only problem I have with Rickybobby is that there are literally three options without meat. Seriously.  Tots. Fries. And a beat salad.  Fortunately, beat salad and the tots are pretty good.  So, come on gents, star a few menu items and make them available vegetarian. PS way better than Roti. As a fan of this crew when they worked their magic at Broken Record I was excited to visit Ricky Bobby which is even closer to home.Though we got there only 30 minutes after they  opened (it was their 1st or 2nd week open) there were already a bunch of people waiting for tables. Good news spreads quickly.I am not sure if Ricky Bobby is still BYOB but they were at this point. Luckily the corner store across the street has a decent beer selection. Come prepared. The staff are very prompt which helps keep things moving at this restaurant but the BYOB can cause tables to linger and finish their 6 packs.Our table split the sweet potato  tater tots for the table and I ordered the bacon cheese burger. I was sad that I couldn't taste much of it because of the cold I had but the texture was great! Also, those in my party that tried it said you could taste the bacon in every bite (it is ground into the beef).  I will be back to revisit this item for sure.My only suggestion for this crew is to bring back the gringo fries!! LOVED it, but I had the biggest food coma I've ever had in my life.  Go easy good people, this place will make you feel like you need to give birth... This place is great! It's like what your mamma used to make but better! Imagine all your favorite the comfort foods with a unique touch. I went with a few friends and we just ordered a bunch of stuff to share which I highly recommend doing because it's difficult to choose. The lobster mac and cheese was delectable, the sweet potato tots were addicting and the beat salad was mouth-watering. Sweet potatortots!!!1 Aahh so worth the hype!! I would normally say $5 is expensive for tatortots but no. Worth it!! I've been dying to try the sweet potatortots ever since I heard about them from Broken Record, but haven't been able to try them due to the chefs moving. They are amazing!!!! I also had the apple salad, which was pretty good for an apple salad :d hahah. If you don't like apples or beets though, and you're vegetarian, just go for the tots ahaha good enough! My friends waited for a super long time, but I was late so I didn't wait as long as they did :}. They didn't seem to mind though, and the staff was superrr nice. Love this place! Make sure to get there early (or at least have somewhere get there early for you)! Same rating but went a second time.1) No longer BYOB.2) Bread Pudding was pretty great - and I don't even really like bread pudding3) Points for service - they forgot to put in our order for lobster mac and cheese. They offered to comp it for us, but we were in a rush so had to pass. I always appreciate the gesture though. Came here on a rainy day over Christmas w/ Janette after tearing up Union Square on ice skates (it wasn't raining earlier). Butternut Squash and Carrot Soup - a special of the day... this was delcious and very creamy. What set this soup up surprisingly was not the heartiness of the soup or sweetness of the carrots, but the season croutons placed on top. The crisp texture and saltiness really complemented the mellowness and added a great texture contrast.Steak and Scallop - another special... New York Steak, scalloped potatoes, and a single seared scallop. The new york steak was ultra tender, but needed a little more seasoning. The sauce was similar to a red wine/beef burgundy reduction with shallots. The scalloped potatoes were creamy but not overly cheesey, as to not overwhelm the flavors. The scallop was perfectly seared. The pricing was actually pretty good (12-13) but I would pay a little bit more for more meat.Burger - of the many bacon burgers I've had, this one sits up there with Hodads. Like Hodads, this is a very simple but well executed bacon cheese burger, where you get bacon in every bite. The bacon is fried and mixed into the ground beef patties. The patties are beefy, seasoned with salt and pepper, and also have the smoky flavor of the bacon. Added with the standard fare of american cheese, house made mayo, and ketchup all sandwiched in a toasted bun, this burger pretty much was AMERICA. Big, simple, tasty as hell, with a don't mess with a classic attitude, and a great price.It looks like they got their wine and beer license, and I really wish they could serve a larger variety of beers, because the food is straight gastropub and deserves a ton of great beers to be served alongside it. Pricewise, this place is great and the taste to cost ratio to me is really high. I will definitely be back to try everything else. I am so glad that Rickybobby finally opened after enduring the few months after the chefs from Broken Record left and decided to make their own restaurant.  In terms of describing this concoction of delicious items on the menu, it would be ""high end bar food"".I came here on a Thursday night with some friends and this place was surprisingly packed as it is only open for dinner.  This new establishment is a lot bigger than the previous dining area at Broken Record with there being seating for at least 50 people. The servers here are friendly and try to accommodate all parties as quickly as possibly.My friends decided to share the Chicken parm sandwich, lobster mac and cheese, braised chicken, and crawfish grits.  The chicken parm sandwich is definitely a must-have.  The chicken cutlet was perfectly breaded and fried, topped with melted mozzarella, and had pieces of house made sausage on top.The lobster mac and cheese was my favorite; a mouthwatering combination of cheeses, pasta, and fresh tasting lobster baked in a huge bowl with pieces of corn and spinach inside.My friend enjoyed the crawfish grits; a spicy and hearty stew-like mixture of shrimp, crawfish, and grits.  Even for a person who isn't fond of grits, the way that they made their version made me enjoy it.The braised chicken has a nice sweet Asian style glaze to it, but it was pricey at $3 a pop, although we received four even though we ordered two.One item that everyone must try is their bacon burger: it's simply burger goodness to the max, a juicy patty with hints of bacon in every bite. Most of their main dishes range from $5-14 which is totally reasonable.  As of now, drinks are BYOB as they are working on acquiring their liquor license, but that's a plus since there's a liquor store just across the street .I definitely recommend trying this place at least once, with the guarantee that you'll definitely leave satisfied and the urge to try everything on their menu on your next visit. It's 2013! The beginning of a new year. That time when oh so many people make those New Year's resolutions to workout and eat healthy.  On January 2nd, those folks hit the gym and eat a salad. And on January 3rd through December 31st, the gym membership is paid but unused and it's pizza and hot dogs for every meal.  So for me?  I didn't make that New Year's resolution. I went with a friend to the new restaurant from the owners of Broken Record, Rickybobby. Let's get to it and dive into the food:We each ordered:Beef and Bacon Burger $10ground together! american cheese, house mayo, ketchup, onion and pickles on the sideThen we split the following:Sweet Potatertots $5ketchup and house ranchFrench Friesside $2, basket w/ ranch $5Beer and wine is BYOB for right now. But believe they have plans to serve it soon. So the result?  Ok, so maybe I wasn't completely accurate above, I did technically workout that day, but then ultimately destroyed that entire workout by eating the epic Beef and Bacon Burger.  But I didn't make a resolution, so I feel like I'm in the clear.  And even if I had and broken it practically the first day, it would have been worth it.  Because this burger is EPIC!   Here are some quick notes...* The burger was in my top three in the city.* The tots were killer.* The fries, solid.* BYOB worked just fine for the night, with a corner store right across the street.* The atmosphere is fun.* They were playing some fun tunes.* The staff was attentive and super friendly.My advice is throw your healthy New Year's resolutions out the door and go dominate this Beef and Bacon Burger. It is sooooooo worth it.  I don't give out many five star reviews. But they are off to a great start. So here's to hoping Rickbobby keeps up the awesome work!Ok, I'm headed to workout. Until next time.  Good talk. The first time my friends and I tried to come here, there was a huge mob waiting outside. We took one look at the limited seating inside, and decided to try again another day. Unless you show up when the doors open (6PM), expect a line. So determined were we to try the lobster mac n cheese, we found ourselves loitering outside the restaurant at 5:30PM the next day. WORTH IT!!Rating Breakdown:2/2 Stars for Taste --We pretty much ordered the entire menu and everything was delicious. Dishes that really stood out were the Lobster Mac N' Cheese, the Crawfish Grits, and Sweet Potater Tots. I don't usually eat spicy things and I hate sweet potatoes, but Rickybobby turned my tastebuds on their head so that they just didn't know what to do with themselves. The savory creaminess of the lobster mac, the subtle slow spice of the broth in the grits, and the crispy batter on the tots...you simply can't leave this place without trying at least one of these three items. Also, their pecan pie a la mode is crack.1/1 Stars for Value --Everything on the menu is around $10. Portions are generous. Everything came out hot and fresh. The lobster mac was still bubbling when they brought it to our table. I would throw my money at this place any day.1/1 Stars for Customer Service --Don't expect someone to be waiting on you hand and foot at this place. The restaurant is pretty small and is always CROWDED. Waiters are always helpful and try their best to be attentive, but bring someone who isn't afraid to command attention in your party. Bonus star because even though I hate lines, I definitely see myself coming back to Rickybobby. Not a great place for huge parties, but a great place to relax with friends, gorge on great food, and enjoy a cold beer. I love the upscale down-home food hear.  The pulled pork has such great heat from the haberno sauce, without losing the flavor of the pork.We were really impressed with the spicy craw-shrimp and grits.  The sausage in the grits and the heat from the sauce make this so good. How to dull the heat?  Dunk one of the sweet potato tots in ranch and keep going.The pecan pie was a little burnt, but a perfect ending to our meal along with their killer ice cream.  I love having this new joint a few block from my apartment. Hope these guys keep it up!! Rickybobby's chefs used to reside at Broken Record in some part of SF that I never ventured. Once I heard the announcement of Rickybobby's arrival I knew I wanted to try it out for my birthday. At around 8:20pm, on a Friday night, we arrived to a packed crowd of hungry San Franciscans. Three communal dining tables on each side of the restaurant which can seat 6-8 at each and one little extra table on the right. Be prepared to wait if you want to try out one of SF's newest hot spots. Luckily for us, everyone waiting was in groups of 4-8. It was just the two of us, so by the time I arrived back from the liquor store with  24's of PBR and Heineken, we were ready to be sat. Less than 10 minute wait in this HUGE crowd?! Happiness!Shortly after our no nonsense waiter arrived with "" Sup? Do you know what you want?"""" Beef and Bacon burger ($10), Lobster Mac and Cheese ($12), and Sweet Potatertots ($5)""10minutes later the burger arrived. This, folks, was the highlight of our visit. Is this one of the BEST BURGERS I HAVE EVER TASTED? Without hesitation, YES! The way the ground bacon is molded with the beef and cooked medium was honestly indescribable food porn. 10 minutes after arrived the Sweet Potatertots came. This is enough for 4 people. They were decent. Somewhat bland. We didn't finish them. A lot of food, perfect for sharing, but I wouldn't order them again. Finally the much hyped Lobster Mac and Cheese, with corn and spinach mixed in. We weren't impressed. The cheese tasted like KRAFT, it was slightly watery. It was very much a disappointment. There is much to explore on this menu though, so I am optimistic about trying the pulled pork and chicken parmesan sandwiches. Dumb to give 3 stars or lower when the burger is out of this world, and I haven't fully conquered the menu. Bring plenty of beer with you to drown out a potentially silly dining neighbor....the original group of people we sat with were friendly and pleasant. After they left they sat six tech doofuses with us who complained about everything.  See you again soon, Rickybobby! After reading about this new place on EaterSF a while back, I finally decided that tonight was a good night to venture out on my own and try what was billed as a neighborhood spot.  I found indeed a good neighborhood spot, but certainly one that is probably still working out its growing pains and post-opening jitters.First - the food.  As a single diner, I really was kind of on a mission - I wanted a burger.  And I thought about going to the SuperDuper down the street, but again, new place, why not.  So I came in for the burger.  While good, I don't know if I would necessarily rank it up there on the $10 burger scale, and certainly wouldn't rank it it the top burgers I've had.  The patties, while flavorful, were greasy yet dry, a very odd oxymoron.  The flavor of the bacon did come through in a wonderful supporting role, but occasionally the beef found itself playing second fiddle.  The bun was toastily soft, and held its own well.  The burger is dressed simply with some mayo and onion, with pickled onions on the side.  I would have to say that I probably would've been happier with a little more greenery to balance out the meatiness - even with piling the pickled onions on, and even eating the pickle spear (I don't even like pickles all that much unlike a certain Jersey Shore character), I found myself wishing for more balance.  An hour after eating, I'm still downing water, which makes me think that it may have been seasoned a bit too much.Of course, it's hard to have a burger without some sort of side.  I opted for the sweet potatertots, which are about what you expect.  There was definitely a little more salt on them than expected, but I think it created a nice balance.  Warning though: those things come out crazy hot.Now, as for these growing pains I mentioned earlier - I think the biggest issue is their wait management and service staff.  Let me preface it all by saying that the wait staff is probably as friendly and down-home as can be.  But after arriving, it took nearly 20 minutes of just waiting for me to even get my name taken down on the list.  There's sort of a waiting area just inside the door, but if a crowd gathers, anyone can get lost in it.  Despite trying to flag down a wait staff member/host, it still took a while.  Since there's no host stand, nor any sort of wait focal point, I definitely got lost in the shuffle.  Granted, again, as a single diner, I was seated rather quickly, getting a random seat out among the communal tables.  The wait staff, while friendly, I think definitely had their work cut out for them, and maybe are a bit overwhelmed, with what appeared to be only three servers navigating a dense number of parties, through lots of people milling about.  I'm wondering if just an extra person might help with both the wait list and the service issues.I'll probably need to come back to try some of the more fancy food, like the crawfish and grits and the much-talked-about lobster mac and cheese, but for now, a solid three stars...3.5 for the food, 3 for the service. great atmosphere, great food, really friendly and fast service. the chicken drums were awesome and huge. the kitchen hooked us up too with some extras. lobster mac and the burger were standouts. and the tatertots were fantastic. go to rickybobby! Something about this place is just plain likeable.It's a small menu with a unique artisanal twist to comfort food, but when you can make food this good, a small menu is all you need.  Rickybobby is one-of-a-kind with its food, concept, and atmosphere. I brought my friend from out of town and she couldn't help but notice how this place embodies SF.  Everything we ordered, I can recommend:*Beef and bacon burger -- Beefy and juicy with a hint of bacon flavor melded into the patties to round it all out.  Comes with a pickle and pickled red onions on the side.  A must order for burger lovers.*Lobster mac and cheese -- This came out hot and bubbly with a crispy top.  Spinach and corn complement the farfalle in cheese sauce, and of course, you'll find a few chunks of lobster meat for your eating pleasure.*Sweet potater tots -- A generous basket of sweet tots with their tasty house ranch and ketchup.Next up to try:  pecan pie, crawfish gritsP.S.  Oh so hipster. While I want to keep this place as my little secret, the folks at Rickybobby must know how they're doing everything right!My three girl friends and I ordered about 80% of the menu: pulled pork sandwich, crab and fontina grilled cheese, crawshrimp grits, beet salad, sweet potatertots, fries, braised short ribs (a special), butternut squash soup (a special), and a pistachio ice cream sundae.  The standout at our table was the grits. Magic in a bowl. Also the sundae was dynamite! Actually, everything is delicious. I would love to order the whole menu at my next visit.The service was really great as well! Right when we walked in, they told us they were BYOB and pointed out the bodega kitty corner from the restaurant. The food came out fast and piping hot. Our waiter was nice and not overbearingly attentive. When one of my friends wanted to order a second pistachio sundae, he shared that they were already out (1.5 hours into food service) but offered to hand roll vanilla ice cream into a ball and cover it in graham crackers for us. We declined his sweet offer but damn, how cool was that?Noise level made it hard to hear each other as night went on but who'd want to come up for air and talk when you could be woofing down some yummy food? By far, one of the best burgers I've ever had. The meat just by itself tasted great, moist and rich! My wife ordered the grilled cheese with tomato and crab bisque... Loved it. My friend ordered the short ribs with mashed potato, I'm not a fan of beef ribs, but again, they were heaven.At the end we had the pistachio ice cream and the pecan pie. I have to say these guys really know their stuff, you can taste the love they put to what they make.I had to go to the kitchen to compliment the cooks/owners, something I don't do often, and they definitely deserve it.Kudos! I came here on Wednesday night with a couple of friends and had a delightful experience. I thought the decor was nice, we were seated within five minutes and our waiter promptly directed us to the liquor store across the street for a little BYOB action. The three of us split the lobster mac n cheese, sweet potato tots, chicken parmesan sandwich and burger. The food isn't anything fancy but everything we ordered was super yummy and the bill was $13/person. Whaaaat?! Cute/ fun/ casual yet hip/ good price point... definitely a keeper. Brought to you buy the guys from Broken Record, Ricky Bobby features the same menu they had at BR. At the moment, it's a BYOB place, there is a corner store across the street so super easy.FF and I shared the Bacon burger, Lobster Mac and cheese, the chicken drums and the shaved apple salad .  -Bacon burger was okay, wasn't as good as I remembered from when they were at BR.  The bacon flavor wasn't as strong as before. - The shaved apple salad was good, normal. - the chicken drums ($3 bucks each) was suppose to be a big drum, but when it came out small, the guys brought us out two.  The sauce on the drums were tasty, but the drum that I had wasn't as juicy as I was hoping for and was kinda dry.  Hoping that they are just tweeking this and making adjustments '- the mac and cheese was good, super cheesy.  Most of the lobster meat was claw meat, so if it's the smaller pieces, it dried out in the oven. =TService is awesome.  The waiters are all super nice and seems like they were liking the new place.  I would come back and try the $14 scallops and the $11 shrimp and grits! ""Aaaaah, Ricky Bobby! Now we shall dance. And yes, it will be a slow jam."" -Jean GirardWhen I read that the Broken Record kitchen decided to start their own place, i suggested this place to meet up with some friends.  We loved the food at Broken Record so we were really excited to try Rickybobby.The 6 of us ordered the following:3 Lobster Mac and Cheese2 Sweet Potato Tots1 Beef and Bacon Burger1 Beet Salad1 Pull Pork Sandwich1 Full Size Pecan PieI ordered one of the Mac and cheese and Tots.  The Mac and Cheese was awesome.  It was freakishly hot for like 20 mins, but damn that was some good mac and cheese.  Not the best I've ever had (The Truffle Mac and Cheese with Lobster from Alexander's Steakhouse in Cupertino) but still awesome.  It had a lovely crust on top, as it should.  The size of the lobster chunks were nice and there was plenty.  The corn adds a nice texture to the dish and the spinach helps in balancing out the richness from the cheese.I'm not a big Sweet Potato fan, but ordered the tots from all the suggestions on Yelp.  They were nice, i still prefer regular tots, but they were nice.  Its just that with sweet potato being softer than a regular potato you don't get the individual little chunks that make up the a regular tot.  It's one of those ""i'll take some if a friend orders it, but wouldn't order it myself"" type of thingTook a bite of my friend's Beef and Bacon burger and damn that's a bombass burger.  I didn't know how ground the bacon would be but when i had that bite you get that texture from the bacon and wow.  They apparently cook the burger to medium so it was not dried out (the bacon fat probably helps with that as well).  Mos def going to get it next time. My friend's pecan pie was also good.  The crust was amazing as it was flaky and buttery.  Pecan filling was nice and the ice cream was a nice touch.The pulled pork sandwich was good as well.  I really like how they don't fully slice the bread through, allowing the pull pork to stay in the sandwich.  It looks like a pocket full of meat!One thing that we were all sad to not see on the menu were the pulled pork waffle fries.  Really had hope they brought it over from Broken Record. Currently its BYOB so don't forget.  Hope they get their liquor license soon along with a nice selection of microbrews. Amazing lobster mac and cheese, and it travels well to boot! I would venture to say that the food is somehow magically better than before (at Broken Record)! I will be dining here frequently to the chagrin of my waist line. Only down side is that my lady is gluten free and there are virtually no current options for her, perhaps the future will bring some. My girlfriend mentioned that Rickybobby was going to open this past Wednesday, we were there for dinner on opening night. We have been a fan of their pop up kitchen inside Broken Record for years. After circling the neighborhood for parking, we walked in and the host showed us where to sit as we shared a communal table with other diners. The three of us fired out orders like we were eating for 6 people: Pros:Lobster mac and cheeseShaved apple saladBeet salad with fried oystersPulled pork sandwichSweet tater tots Cons: Crab and fontina grilled cheese with a spicy tomato dipping soup - did not taste the crab in here; all cheeseFor dessert, we tried: Pistachio ice cream, graham cracker crumbs with caramelized cherriesHawaiian bread pudding with TCHO chocolate and vanilla ice creamBoth desserts were pretty damn good! Plus it's BYOB so our friend picked up a couple of cans of Bitter American and had a great time with awesome company, endless laughter and conversations. It gets pretty loud inside. They do take credit/debit cards, too. Seating is always first come, first serve. No reservations. I'd come back here again! Thank you sweet tiny baby Jesus for bringing this delicious eatery into my neighborhood! The chicken drums are so damn good that I hope they sell them by the bucket. The $3 piece of chicken was seriously better than some roast chickens I've ordered at fine dining restaurants. And the lobster Mac and cheese is beyond good, and they don't skimp on the lobster! Also tried the bacon burger and sweet potato tater tots, big wins. The opening of Rickybobby's signals an arrival of sorts for the Lower Haight to a true trendsetting culinary neighborhood in SF. Plus this place is super casual and low key, they were even letting everyone byob since they don't have a liquor license yet. If you ain't first, you're last... and Rickybobby's is definitely in first! Here's the deal --James Moisey and Shane LaValley are the best there is. Plain and simple. They wake up in the morning and they cook excellence.Dear Eight Pound, Six Ounce, Newborn Baby Jesus, don't even know a word yet, just a little infant, so cuddly, but still omnipotent. I would just like to thank you for bringing Rickybobby into all our lives and for introducing me to my new favorite burger.Lord baby Jesus, we thank you so much for this bountiful harvest of the juicy delicious Beef and Bacon Burger with the bacon and beef ground together to form the perfect burger with 2 delectable patties, for the the spicy, yummy Crawshrimp Grits with spicy shrimp broth, and loads of crawfish and house sausage, and chicken drums braised, glazed, and sprinkled with sesame seeds and served with house blue cheese dressing. Let us not forget the perfectly cooked french fries and their ranch dressing. We thank you for the genuine and unpretentious service, excellent photographs on the wall, and the chance to watch some of best of awesomely cheesy, awesomely bad, awesomely awesome or awesomely 80s films projected on the wall. I will be back.Amen.Shake and bake!!! I enjoy scouring the city in search of the best burger.  Before hitting up Rickybobby the other day, I had found it at the Broken Record.  Sheer Mastery.  When I learned that the chefs from the Broken Record had moved to the Haight to open their own place, I had to be there.  Though it has a very similar menu to that of the Record, they have somehow managed to improve on what was already near perfection.  You can taste the pride that the chefs have in this place in the food.  Mouth watering deliciousness of indescribable proportions.  I could go on, but you really  have to taste for yourself.Couple this subtle yet distinct refinement with the fact that they now have a waitstaff and a much more comfortable ambiance, and you have one of the best places to go out and eat in all of San Francisco.  Zero pretension, just amazing food.   Other notable dishes are the pulled pork and the lobster mac and cheese.  Really though, just go there and order anything... Eat here. The entire menu consists of comforting, deliciousness and there is no way you will leave the restaurant without a huge smile on your face, and a happy tummy. Come hungry because you will want to try everything on the menu. Went here last night for a casual dinner.   The staff was really sweet and the chefs were chill behind the counter.  Upon being seated I was informed that the chefs want to be out by ten so could we order in the next five minutes? I was like hell yes, honey order what you want i have been drooling about this place opening for awhile.  We end up ordering crawfish and grits, shaved apple spinach salad, a drumstick with some crazy amazing sauce, lobster Mac and cheese and the pecan pie with icecream.  First let me just say there was not one dish that I did not like.  I already love Broken Record but this food just seemed more well thought out.  I thoroughly enjoyed every detail that went into my meal from the warmth and spice in the grits to the crispness in my salad.  Amazing food not crazy expensive and its BYOB.  Yeah I will be back pretty much on a weekly basis...  Big ups to the former chefs of Broken Record for moving closer to my house so I can enjoy you all the time. James and Shane know what time it is !! no matter what you get .. its always made w love and will make you want 2nds !! come here often :) To be honest. Pretty disappointing for opening night. Id like to think that there should be minimal room for errors. I would give this place a 3.5 at best. After reading raving reviews about broken record (an affiliated establishment), i expected ALOT.  While the serving staff was courteous, they lacked experience. For example, after asking for some utensils ( really shouldnt have to in the first place), they aimply walked over and threw a couple of forks on my unfinished plate. Really???? The food was at a questionable 4 as the menu was limited in choices and 2 out of the 4 things were good.  Must try the sweet potato tots and the bacon burger.  The crab and fontina grilled cheese was not great as it was kind burnt and lacked flavor.  The lobster mac n cheese was kinda liquidity and lacked cheesy consisteny. I try to yelp rate as honest as possible, so all in all the food is at 4 and the service is at a 3. But i know that this place will step up its game and become a huge hit. Thanks and have a nice day. # 4 reviewer for ricky bobby.

The premise here is simple. You could very well describe it as ""comfort food"", as it comforts me simply to know that a place like this can exist. There are no pretenses here beyond food that just tastes GOOD. There are items on the menu with a slight twist on a classic (grilled cheese -- with crab and fontina!), simply classic (pulled pork sandwich done to perfection), or legendary in their own right: The Beef & Bacon Burger. Fans of the Broken Record will know of it, as that's where head chefs James and Shane originally conjured it up before recently starting Rickybobby. There are many ways to describe this burger, but I've got my own. It's as if a long-lost manuscript was found, an illustration created by Leonardo DaVinci himself, which diagrammed the exact dimensions and meat-to-bread ratio of an invention he called ""The Tastiest Burger"". The recipe was lost, passed around from memory, incarnating itself in such modern variants as the In-N-Out Double Double. But this burger is the original recipe, the real deal. The burger (whose blown-up image currently stands as the only signage out front) is kind of a good representation of Rickybobby. No frills food that tastes awesome. I'd highly recommend the crawshrimp grits as an appetizer. You don't have to be familiar with either crawshrimp or grits to know that this is just delicious, and I want more of it, right now. The vibe is super laid back, and it's equally as good of a place to meet up for some food and drinks after work, or to go on a casual date with that special someone. I'm very excited to see how this place develops, and would not be surprised if  the crowds starting piling up with word of mouth. So if my review has done anything to convince you and your friends (and inevitably their friends) to patronize this fine new establishment, then please, save me a seat. And some sweet potatertots. I came here for opening night (last night).For the last 4.5 years, I have been on a quest to find the best burger in San Francisco.  I held burgers from Umami, Spruce, Nopa, Roam, Wayfare, Bix in high regard, but none of them really captured the essence of what I was looking for, UNTIL NOW.RickyBobby has somehow managed to reduce the humble cheeseburger to its very essence: theirs is pure, unabashed american umami.  They grind bacon into the meat, skip the lame veggies (no lettuce and tomato), add grilled onions/mushrooms, put it on a toasty, unique bun, and arrive at a place that is truly incredible.  At last, I can rest in peace.  Go now... I foresee this place getting Yelped to death shortly."|2|91|2|Routine Inspection| No thermometers or uncalibrated thermometers Improper reheating of food  [ date violation corrected: 4/2/2014 ]|GOOD: no inspection needed
Kitchen Story 0|4.0|Breakfast & Brunch in San Francisco, CA|$11-30|813|0|4.241379310344827|" The food was amazing. I had the tilapia sandwich.  It was AMAZING.  My friend had the french toast and it was INSANE.  Like, I would like to eat it every day for the rest of my life until I couldn't fit through doors. I expected more from a place with a massive crowd out front and four stars on yelp.The worst of it was the Bloody Mary, not sure how a brunch spot could ruin a Bloody Mary, but they did. Tasted like tomato juice and too spicy - it wasn't drinkable. We had two sips of them and couldn't bother to try more, and I never leave a Bloody Mary behind.I had the pork belly huevos rancheros. They we're way too over seasoned (pork belly has enough flavor for the dish). Tasted as if they were trying to fit too many flavors in this tiny egg dish. I took a bite of something too strong that stuck with me through the yogurt.The best we had was the yogurt and granola, which, was good but also standard. This place must be riding on its reputation and hype, because it's just not worth the trip. Came here with a large group and the restaurant was very accommodating. Millionaire's Bacon is worth your time. I have tried to come here on several occasions for brunch but the wait is just too crazy. My friend and I cam here late one night for dinner and it was such a PLEASANT surprise! For appetizers we got pumpkin fries and ahi scoops. Pumpkin fries were good, but the ahi scoops were delicious! Seriously, get them, you won't regret it. For entrees, I got the POP belly and my friend got the Castro sea. The pop belly was AWESOME.  I love pork bell in general but this was so good I ate EVERYTHING on the plate. Though I will say the brussel sprouts were pretty salty so I wasn't a fan of those. Otherwise, this place is great. Portions are pretty good and the price is reasonable. Definitely going to come back here for brunch some time soon. I ordered from this restaurant tonight. They were prompt, which was nice, but the food was too expensive to arrive undercooked and spoiled. The Thai tea I ordered was twice the price of any other in the city and it was fermented. Gross. The burger arrived completely pink, even on the edges. The potatoes were good but not exceptional. I would have rather paid half the price for food that I expect to not be any good anyways. I was not expecting dangerous food from such a highly rated restaurant. My bar is not that high for take out, I just really don't want food poisoning. Hooray for bottomless mimosas and a wonderfully prepared California burger. Went into the city and it was nice to have a place to sit down and enjoy brunch with some friends. It was a chilly day and our server was kind enough to let us move from outside to indoors.Walking distance to Dolores Park. This place is the bees knees get anything on the menu with a side of millionaires bacon and you'll leave happy. Had the millionaires bacon and was amazed at how great it was. Came with potatoes, a croissant and some slices of fruit. Perfect way to start my day! Service was bang on to boot. We went with a group of 8 with dinner reservations and were seated promptly.  Asian fusion type offerings were all excellent.  Scallop and Millionaires Bacon sandwich was outstanding.  Good choice of beers as well.  We will return ! Saturday brunch wait time: 40mins (but totally worth it)Food quality: excellent Food price: affordable ~$10-15 per person Seating: indoor and outdoor (with heating)Came here with a party of 4. And here's what we ordered:Ricotta hotcakes with scrambled eggs and millionaire bacon on the side: comes in three pieces of hotcakes topped with fresh mixed berries, honey butter, and maple syrup on the side. the millionaire bacon was candied to perfection. Nice thick slices of bacon. Can't comment on the hotcakes personally but from my friends reaction it looked orgasmically good!Frisco Benedict: I had this plate and this plate comes with chicken and mango sausage, avocado, the poached eggs atop a slice of levain toast and crispy rainbow potatoes on the side with fresh fruits. The poached egg and the chicken mango sausage went perfect together with the fresh avocado! Tasted like a salad actually just without the greens :) Ribeye omurice: a friend ordered this and the expectation was the egg around the rice but it was just sitting on top of the rice which was OK with her. I tasted the rice part..very flavorful but it seemed like it could be better. Also came with crispy rainbow potatoes and a biscuit on the side and fresh fruits.Total price for 4: ~$45 not badAside from the wait time, the food was amazing. Maybe that I was starving but I would come again when given the chance. Even though they're known for brunch, the late night post movie meal was pretty amazing, too. It's too bad their kitchen closes by 10pm or so, but the nice thing is you can make a reservation for dinner.   At first, I was a little skeptical of the Asian fusion style diner food, but everything ended up being amazing comfort food. - Millionaire's Way: thick cut bacon with smoky maple syrup and asparagus. The asparagus was fine, but the bacon was amazing, and I could eat it with anything- POP & IING: I loved the sweet syrupy garlic ginger sauce on the Kurobuta pork belly. We had extra sauce, which we used to dip everything. Arugula holds up well to the strong flavor - ""Burgah"" Boy: maple syrup wagyu patty, more of the amazing millionaire's bacon, white cheddar, arugula. This was probably one of the best burgers I've had - it just had so much flavor to it - Pad See Ew: typical rice noodles but generous on the chicken, egg, carrots, and broccolini, so it wasn't just a bunch of noodles. The flavor was pretty right on and authenticThey also have beer and wine.  I feel like they would get a lot of business if they were open later to cater to the post Castro bar crowd, but I guess they need to be up and ready for breakfast every day.  I'm so excited we found this place. 3 1/2 stars actually but the millionaire's bacon is good for half a star.  Food is good, nothing special, but good. Prices decent for the city.  Crowd very mix, and loud.  Staff friendly and efficient.  Decor eclectic in a homey kinda way.  Came in on a very busy Sunday morning and had a short 20 minute wait.  By the way, that bacon is a glorified version of the Filipino tocino, just way super leaner.  Though the tocino is far tastier. Kitchen Story is this cute little place on 16th. Because it's a corner shop, you know it's bound to be busy. My good friend was visiting from Palo Alto, and I wanted to make sure I chose a spot that was close to public transportation for her...and also, Kitchen Story was a brunch thing in the past, and every time people went, I had to miss out. I could not let this happen again.Honestly, I had no idea what to expect from this place. From the name itself, the first thing I thought was, ""Hmm, I wonder if this is an Asian place."" And I was sorta right! Asian fusion breakfast! Who would have thought? The wait was about an hour or so, and we weren't really sure when or how we'd be seated, but it happened eventually, and it was a nice, sunny, Easter-y sort of morning, so it's not like we had anything better to do.The menu was so vast and filled with such enticing options, like okonomiyaki, omurice, and bugolgi burgers...all happily snuggled alongside ridiculously yummy-sounding things like Mascarpone stuffed deep-fried French toast and a bounty of scrambles. I usually have trouble deciding what I want, but I definitely freaked out and ordered randomly by the time they got to me. I ordered a spinach omelette (which I can't find on the menu anymore...hmm) so I could share with my vegetarian friend.These people definitely know how to plate their food. The wait time wasn't too long, especially with all the people during the Easter Sunday rush. Everything was delicious, but what I loved was the biscuit. Oh my goodness, that biscuit! I was so confused, so delightfully confused, at the flavor of this biscuit. At first, it looked like it was going to be one of those bay biscuits from Red Lobster, but with whatever butter they put on it made it taste like one of those scones from Lovejoys. Basically, there was no way this could have gone wrong for me. I left this place feeling pleasantly full.Only downsides were that we were cramped in our table, but again, it was a busy day; and if you're seated inside, it's way too loud to hear anyone anyway. It was hard to hold a conversation with someone sitting directly across from me, and that wasn't fun. I would definitely come back, because I want to try the lunchy part of the brunch menu. I'm down for a wagyu burger or something...just saying. Dear Kitchen Story, Good job.  I went to brunch this morning and with it being Thursday, there was no wait.  I was impressed by the decorations and atmosphere.  It gave it a really intimate and comfortable feel.  Another bonus is that the service was awesome!  They were very attentive and friendly. Now about the food...  I got the millionaire's bacon with eggs.  The millionaire's bacon was very sweet and thick.  I loved it, but I got tired of it pretty quick.  For some reason I really loved the croissant they gave me... and those rainbow potatoes!  I would definitely come back and try everything out cause everything looked so amazing!  Especially those lattes! Amazing food! The French toast is my favorite. Don't forget a side of millionaires bacon! Definitely enjoyed this place. That kooky Millionaires Bacon appetizer is amazing. Never have I spent $12.00 on two pieces of bacon and oh, my gah, it's worth every single penny. I had the fried chicken and the curry sauce was delish!Great service, very friendly, excellent food and awesome location. Will definitely be going back soon. I'm new to the Bay so the whole ""bottomless mimosa"" is still foreign/amazing to me. There was a solid 45 minute wait - totally acceptable especially with a party of 9, and again bottomless mimosas and you can drink while you wait! I had the pork belly rancheros. Now I love the belly of our favorite ungulate as much as the next guy, and this was legitimately one of the best dishes I have had since moving to San Francisco. The egg was perfectly poached, the kim chi picco was a great balance of spice which complimented the sweet/salty pork belly to perfection. The reason 4 and not 5 - well first of off it wasn't total perfection. The bottomless did have a bottom, and they started to get more orange juicy by the third round. The French Toast while innovative was just a large doughnut. And the millionaires bacon was very tasty, but for 6 dollars a side I would expect more than two slices. Of the nine dishes we had at our table mine was by far the stand out. After looking over Yelp last night for a dog-friendly, outdoor dining, delicious restaurant to eat at for brunch on a day trip today with my boyfriend and our dog, I came across this one! I noticed a ton of the reviews complained about the wait. I went on a Wednesday at 2pm and had no problem with the wait, but I think this is because we were seated outdoors. When I went inside they kinda gave me an attitude about needing to be seated outside because of our dog, but later another couple came with their dog too. I noticed a lot of reviews about having dogs here so I didn't think it would be a problem at all. Food came fast and it was quite yummy! We ordered the bulgogi burger and the chicken mango melt. The bulgogi burger was super yummy and had lots of interesting vegetables on it. The only thing I'd suggest is a little more bulgogi. The potatoes/french fries on the side were amazing! As for the chicken mango melt, that was also really good, but didn't really notice the mango flavoring, which was why my boyfriend was interested in it. I don't think it was very filling and it didn't seem like there was much chicken in there, but luckily we had many more food places to visit later :) i'd definitely come back for sure to try the french toast, Thai tea, and a few other items that caught my eye. This place was a great find! The menu is an awesome mix of different types of comfort food. We tried the pad thai and the fried chicken with coconut curry dipping sauce. I'm pretty sure I drank what was left of the dipping sauce when we were done... Their dessert menu isn't online but it's awesome as well --- we ordered two things, one had chocolate the other did not, both awesome. The portions are quite generous as well. Will definitely return! Best breakfast in San Francisco. If you eat nothing else at this place you must order the bacon. the food is amazing here .. It is a small spot .. so if you go during their busy time expect to wait for a table ... also there is great shopping near by .. With brunch being my favorite meal of any day, I decided to visit this hyped up breakfast joint that replaced a past favorite (tangerine). My group of 3 stopped by around 1:30pm on a sunny Saturday morning and waited approx 30 minutes! Not too shabby considering how intimidating the storefront looks every weekend I've driven past. Food: I ordered the franciscan scramble ($13) w/ cup of berry (add'l $2 which replaced the rainbow spuds). chicken mango sausage, avocado, pepper, but with swiss cheese that engulfed my entire scramble. I probably enjoyed my sides more than the scramble as berries and cheese biscuit w/ honeyed butter was perfect. My friend ordered the omurice- korean dish that basically resembles an omelette with fried rice stuffing- and she was thoroughly pleased so perhaps I'll order that instead.Interior/environment: super cute with both indoor and sidewalk seating available.Service: Nice and attentive! I definitely appreciate attentive staff and nice people, overallOverall: 3.5 stars but i probably wouldn't revisit unless my friends insisted and the wait was less than 30 minutes. I've been wanting to try this place for some time but never got a chance to go or just didn't feel like battling the park chaos around there but this past weekend was different. We originally were suppose to go to another spot for breakfast but seeing the line out the door we opted out and ventured out to seek another place for a good hearty breakfast. So what did we do? We searched Yelp! hahahaWell I guess it was meant to be because we only circled once and the parking gods parted the clouds and provided a rock star parking space right in front of the restaurant. I took it as a sign. It was time to try out this place. hahaMy girlfriend said that it use to be a restaurant called Tangerine which jogged my memory because that was the place where I had my first eggs benedict dish. Anywho that is neither here nor there.Location: Well read the above statement and get an idea. Parking is hard unless you have good parking Karma. :-)Service: Really quick and to the point. We choose to eat outside, which was your usual sunny but windy SF day. In other words it was cold but it was the shortest wait. Food: The food was great! I had the Belly Rancheros that had slow braised Kurobuta pork belly, avocado, arugula, Kimchi Pico De Gallo, spicy guacamole, corn tortilla. I have 3 words for this dish: IT WAS HEAVENLY! Although I didn't taste the Kimchi pico de gallo much but who cares the rest was melt in your mouth goodness.My girlfriend had the Ricotta Hotcakes. Words can't express how delicious these were.Overall the place is great. i love how the check comes on a book hence the name only reason I docked a star is because we didn't know who our server was because we were outside and I wanted to order a cappuccino but didn't know who our server was. Its ok its not a horrendous thing I know it was a busy time.If you are in this area and don't mind the wait, come check out this place. So, the wait time was a little annoying, but then again, we got there right when everyone else thought they should be hungry too. The food was amazing! I got the Mascarpone stuffed deep fried French Toast with chicken mango. It was very filling and very tasty. Our whole group got French Toast that day, and everyone loved their food. I also got a dirty chai while waiting, and some of my friends got bottomless mimosas. Had I not needed to drive, I would have done the same. Alas, it was a good drink. Make sure you get there early! This place is awesome. Service was on point, especially on the bottomless Mimosas, new England burger was life changing, definitely the place to go Asian fusion? lol.. I think I would classify it as Thai style American..The place is really good.. I've been several times now, and can say that not every dish has fit my palate, but there are some pretty awesome dishes here. Millionaire's bacon, French toast, and omelets are all pretty awesome. The side of rainbow potatoes are nice and crunchy and delicious. Today I had the two egg breakfast w/sausage and a side of millionaire's bacon. The main entrée also came with the rainbow potatoes and a biscuit. It was a great start to the day! So the reason I say its Thai style is that it reminds me of the non-Thai breakfast food I can get in Thailand.. First, the scrambled eggs are folder over into a type of pocket (like a half moon giant lightly made tamago). Second, the sausage was a irregularly shaped hand pressed patty. This reminds me a lot of street food and the fish xakes my mom used to make.. Third, a lot of their fried foods are done Thai style.. I'm not quite sure what the difference is.. but I think its just higher heat so it comes out crispier on the outside. I remember having the fried chicken one night and I had a sense of deja vu like I was eating food off a food cart in Bangkok..With all the kudos out there, I will say that I haven't been impressed with everything here.. The okonomiyaki (egg pancake) was really weird. It was not savory and didn't feel very substantial to me at all.. Can't win them all....One random novelty of the place is they clip the bill to a old book when bring it to you..Overall I think this place is amazing.. The wait can get long at times, so go early.. and snag a table outside if you can.. This place is like an Asian fusion gem in Castro!  I loved their brunch.  The millionaire bacon was so tasty- just the right amount of sweetness and saltiness.  Rainbow potatoes is definitely intriguing to the eye but also very appetizing as well- cooked to perfection!  (and I usually don't like potatoes)  I'm certainly coming back here again.  Big portions.  Weekends- take a risk because you may have to wait a long time.  We got lucky and waited about 20 minutes.  Parking around this area is also tough on weekends. I wish I could say the food was amazing but the Truth is that I couldn't even taste the food. I had the coconut latte and it was so hot, it burned my mouth. I couldn't taste anything else. Not the millionaire bacon or the egg on rice thing I had. Not my boyfriends eggs Benedict taco thing. I mean I am sure they were good. They looked good but they tasted like burned taste buds. :/ To date, I've been to Kitchen Story three times - twice for dinner and once for brunch, and the experience has consistently been amazing. The style of the restaurant is Asian flare meets California fresh, and there is both substance and style in the food. Among the dishes I've sampled:- Millionaire's bacon - sweet, salty, fatty, and crisp. A must-have at any time of day (it's on both the brunch and dinner menus)- Ahi tuna salad - fresh fish, mango salsa. Light but filling.- Pork tacos - well-seasoned pork with a variety of fresh salsas- Finger Lickin' chicken - crispy fried chicken with perfectly cooked fries and an amazing curry dipping sauce- Bottomless mimosas - need I say more?The service is impeccable, with frequent refills and quick preparation of food. The staff is very friendly and accommodating.The ambience depends on the time of day - it can get pretty hectic during brunch, but they also have a lovely outdoor seating as well. Dinner has been quieter - a good place to meet a friend or a date. On a weekend, expect to wait 30-50 minutes for a table for brunch. Their turnover is pretty quick and you can order mimosas while you wait for a table, though. All in all this is my go-to place to meet friends for dinner, and I'm always raving about it to others! Fortunately, I came here on a Tuesday and didn't have to deal with waiting in line for brunch.  This is definitely a cute little place with the wood table settings and there's also extra thought put in all of the dishes.  I'm a big believer in ""presentation is everything,"" and this restaurant did just that.  Even when you ask for the check your receipt is delivered to you inside a book, to go along with their ""story"" theme. Gotta love the commitment. I ordered the Frisco Benedict, and it came with the side of rainbow potatoes.  The potatoes itself was just okay, but the mango chicken sausage was good.  I do wish cholula or tapatio was available, since i'm not big on tabasco sauce but that's just a minor preference thing.  Overall, the service was great the staff was very attentive, and because it wasn't super crowded we got to come in and enjoy brunch without waiting too long.Will come back to try rest of the menu for sure.  French Toast? Millionaire Bacon? Coming for you! :) Great ambiance! Very cozy and welcoming. I liked this place because it was very quick. Tried ribs tacos and finger lickin' ... Both were great. This is truely an amazing place, both for the quality of the food, and ambiance of the eating room.  All the dishes come out of the kitchen with a feel of human touch and refinement.  You really feel this east asian touch of harmonic human nature in the food.  Some japanese places also cary this feeling.The food truly has a unique fusion touch, and it is very easy pick items from the menu that satisfy a balance of meat, vegetables and rice.Note: the kitchen staff is different for lunch and dinner, this review is for dinner. I really like their curry dishes on the dinner menu.  Wine list is good.Brunch: eh.  The Millionaires bacon is good.  Everything else is pretty average.  When I went today, my food came out cold.  The service is average at best .I guess I'm surprised because people line up all day Saturday and Sunday to get in. All I can think of is that old Robbie Williams song, ""Millennium"" when I see their bacon. I don't eat much meat due to my stomach hating me, but I just HAD to try that stuff. WOAH. That shi cray. Tip: it's easier and cheaper to get if you just order an entree that has it already with it (you have to upgrade for $2 but it's worth it). Also you only need one order. One artery clogged per person, per brunch. That's my limit.The rest of brunch was also sick. (Sick in the ""cool"" way...not a great food descriptor? Whatev.) I got the Red and Green benedict. I love that I remember the name of the dish after two weeks; means it was THAT good. The boy ordered some sort of egg plus THE FRENCH TOAST. OH EM GEE YOU GUYS. GET THE FRENCH TOAST. It's mascarpone stuffed. It's fried. It's AMAZING. Imagine a light funnel cake stuffed with french toast...but like, without the creepy carnies that serve it to you. Amazing.This was my favorite brunch meal of San Francisco, and we went to 4 places that were all highly rated. Also, The Castro is just so cute. We ended up walking allllll the way to Height and Ashbury and then through Golden Gate Park. Definitely burned up that french toast. But who cares? I would eat that bad boy anytime, anywhere, no regrets. OH EM GEE, BEST BACON EVER!!!If you're like me and know the only way to eat bacon is drenching it in maple syrup, you have to come here for the millionaire's bacon! It's everything you look for in bacon. Sweet, salty, sugary crunchy coated goodness! I dream about this bacon!Deep Fried Mascarpone Stuffed French Toast was meh, the dough/bread was a little too chewy for me. Presentation was really cute though!Ribeye OmuriceOne of the dishes that makes Kitchen Story different from your typical brunch joints. This dish is tasty, hearty, and flavorful. Rice, eggs, and meat with this amazing gravy. I wanted to lick the plate! Love this place! The service is great and the food tasted wonderful. They have a very unique menu but anyone can find what they want on it. The food is diverse and this is a great place to go to especially if you're an SF foodie like me. Kitchen Story was recommended to me by my BGF (brothers girlfriend lol) and fellow Yelper, Kathleene E. Luckily for us, we came on a Wednesday morning so there were about 4 customers inside and 2 hour street parking was a breeze. The space itself is very cute; like my BGF said, it looks like you're in someone's nice, big kitchen. Might I also add that I made a reservation through my OpenTable account and earned a $20 certificate! Ca-Ching! Ca-Ching! (That's my Filipino jackpot sound.) Enough small talk. On to the food. The Mascarpone Stuffed Deep Fried French Toast was good; but it tasted nothing like French Toast, hence the 1 star I knocked off. I love my French Toast, and when I order French Toast, it must taste like French Toast, regardless of what it is stuffed with. But let's be real, what we REALLY came for was the MILLIONAIRE'$ BACON (Ca-Ching! Ca-Ching!) Hubby liked it a lot. It's definitely a nice change from regular bacon. Chewy and sweet. Very yummy.Overall, I enjoyed our food and experience at KS. Thank you, BGF! Will we be back? Maybe for some of that Millionaire's Bacon...Ca-Ching! I loooove French toast but their French toast is amazing!! Try the mascarpone stuffed deep fried French toast with a side of millionaires bacon- perfect combo of sweet and savory goodness! I also tried their Frisco Benedict and the CA burger. The Frisco Benedict was delish, but everything else that we ordered overshadowed it. The CA burger was juicy, flavorful, and the goat cheese just melted in my mouth. I will be back for more yummy goodness. Your tastebuds will def have a happy ending for sure :) Um CUTEST BRUNCH PLACE EVER?! I can't believe we almost didn't make it; when P drove by we saw the line for Ike's overlap with the entrance for Kitchen Story and thought there was a wait. I made him go around so that I could get a better look and yay! We made it! I love mason jars and they served their drinks in the cutest ones. I wanted to take the mason jars home with me haha. We ordered an iced tea and some fruity lemonade. The iced tea was unsweetened and perfectly refreshing while the lemonade was a tad too concentrated that we had to dilute it with water. I ordered the Deep Fried French Toast with Mascarpone filling and a side of Millionaire's Bacon to share. They were both to die for. The French Toast was topped with delicious fresh tangy berries that complimented the sweet mascarpone pudding cream inside a deep fried toast. The bacon was thick and being Canadian, that maple syrup encrusted over it, just got me. Omg I need more. Like, now. First off let me say wow! This place is so amazing! Im pretty sure its Thai owned too! This place is a treasure to San Francisco.  I love having eggs Benedict and Kitchen Story had a variety for me to choose from. How it was deliver was on point. My girlfriend order the Omurice which was bomb! I highly recommend this place to new people. This place will not disappoint. Will be returning! Oh and did i mention they have bottomless mimosas!? :) Damn, man. People on Yelp, you were not messing around about that millennium bacon. So delicious. Sweet but oh so savory. And the wagyu beef in that burger? Totally worth anything. God, I feel like I could eat a hundred of those bad boys. I'm really craving one at this very moment. Juicy, tender, light but filling. Oh man. If it wasn't 18 dollars for just one of them, I'd eat it every day. The rest of the food? The fries were great, crispy and just a touch salty. The seafood was not impressive, sadly. It tasted like light seafood curry. But, it was definitely better than I've had. Great small restaurant, lots of booths and tables. I want to come back for brunch. HOLY BEJEESUS CHRIST !!I seriously dream about their coconut latte !! Everyone should order it !! It's not sweet or strong!!Their french toast is a friend piece of heaven !The wait for brunch is ridiculous, but it is well worth it.I loved this place so much I went back the next week for dinner !! (Oh yes, I did !! )The dinner is just as amazing. I ordered the sizzling steak over rice and was barely able to finish it .. but it was just so darn good I had to unbutton my pants . (Yes,  not so classy, but their dim lighting was in my favor )Top of the line service as well.Promise you won't be disappointed. Been here about 3-4 times. Love this place. Kitchen story is legit and great breakfast/brunch spot. I love the fact I can have Thai Ice Tea with my omelette. Bring your friends here! Charming decor (especially at the back of the restaurant), excellent service, and not too loud to enjoy the conversation with your friends. Would give 5 stars if the vegetarian options were more extensive. Oh, Kitchen Story, how I adore thee! People rave about the weekend brunch, and there are long waits to prove it (Millionaire's bacon lives here), but the real secret is dinner, which features delicious Thai specialties, all sorts of curries, and my personal fave, The Castro Tower. Their $18 burger is an umami explosion for the record books. Also, they open for breakfast at 8:00 am during the week, so if you want the brunch experience without waiting for an hour, go during the week. Great place for brunch in the Castro. The eggs benedict was great and the service was as well. I didn't have to wait too long, 5-10 minutes. Came in on a Monday afternoon. No line! Very tasty brunch foods. A little different than most brunch places but couldn't have enjoyed it more! We had the deep fried French toast and the New England burger and both were very good! Deep fried French toast is definitely a must. Service was quick and attentive. This is a tough review to write, mostly because the food was a little unmemorable, but the company and the service was wonderful (and made up for it!) Back to this food thing. None of the many dishes our group tried were bad at all--it's actually the opposite. Everything was tasty, but there was no ""ka-pow!"" or ""Oh jeezus... that's goooooood""... It's kind of hard to explain, but I left there almost forgetting what I had as a main course, which was a tasty pan-fried noodle dish that needed some kick. The service was super since the moment we brought our group in--we did not want for wine or beverages without them asking to refill us first. Plus, were having such a great time that we were being ridiculously loud, but no sass from the staff. We even closed the place down and not a word. These people are probably the nicest ever. I think I might need to try the brunch next time I'm in town, but for now, I'd say Kitchen Story is worth a try! We dinner here for a friend's birthday. Started with pumpkin fries, the split the mango salad with tiger prawns.  For the main course, we had the Wild Salmon, Burgah Boy and the Finger Lickin'. This is such a low key place, and it's comfy & has a homey feel. The food (dinner) was really good overall. If you do not like your food too spicy, tell the wait staff it make it mild or else your mouth sizzling. I'd say though that it's not a $$ place, it's closer to $$$. The prices here are not cheap, you pay more for the artistry & presentation of the food (quality too) vs quantity. Kitchen story is absolutely delicious and surprising. Their menu is a mix of California and Thai.  The atmosphere was relaxed, casual, with a dash of quirkiness (books lining the walls.)  I got the millionaires bacon to start--it was very rich and delicious. Then I got the curry which was also quite good! No complaints here. The food here is undeniably delicious; however, their small portions just don't match up to how much they charge. We loved this place. It more than lived up to its reviews. Millionaire's Way was even better than billed. We also shared Castro Sea and Dancing Queen and both were excellent. If we didn't live in Boston, we'd eat here often! Highly recommend. mimosas are great! brunch is ok. We like Tangerine which was located in this location for years.Now it's Kitchen Story and we LOVE Kitchen Story.  I swear its the same ownership and the food is smartly prepared, plates well laid out and super tasty.  There is ALWAYS a long line on the weekends for brunch.The Mimosa special is a good deal especially if stumbling around the Castro afterwards is part of your plan.The staff are smart in how they pack the place and friendly without being outgoing. Certainly, worth your visit. This is a cute place tucked in the Castro. It was pretty easy to get a reservation on a Saturday.We started off with the Millionaire's Way which we were told is one of their signature appetizers. It was okay but nothing special. I ordered the Dancing Queen. The meat was tasty and so was the rice and we got a kick out of the waiter lighting it on fire. But the beans were cold and bland. The service was spotty - we had a few different servers and could never really figure out who ""our"" designated waiter was...I doubt we'll be back when there are so many other Castro restaurants with tastier food. came here with a party of three for a casual brunch. got here at 1130 and it was only 10 min wait. after 1130 the lines got longer and got a full house where the wait was over 30 mins. I suggest you come here early to avoid waiting. the service was so so since it was so busy they did take a bit slower for the service. they also ledt the water cup and jar empty.  we also had to flag them for the bill. now onto the food. I ordered the tilapia burger which was reasonable for 12 bucks. the fish abd mango salsa was good. the buns were soft although a bit try. the salad that came with ut was good and not too wet. also the millionaire bacon was a thick slice and it tasted sweet and very good. I like the fat that was on the bacon. they say it takes 5 hrs to anke it. I recommend this. although during brunch it doesnt come with asparagus. I wont be coming here soon unless I crave the bacon other than that nothing too special about their brunch not worth the wait to me. Fun and interesting food. The burger can be overkill esp with the Millionaire Bacon, recommend sharing with a friend. ;) Kitchen Story is officially my favorite brunch place in San Francisco and I will be back for more! :)I came here with my coworker for lunch this week. We booked reservations just in case there was a wait as we had to head back to work after. When we arrived, there was no wait at all and the restaurant wasn't too packed. From what I learned, having brunch on weekdays is way better than having it on weekends because of the long waits. Anyways, I had the Ribeye Omurice which had scrambled eggs over jasmine rice, marinated ribeye, carrots, cherry pepper, spinach, and scallion with demi glazed sauce. It was also served with a croissant and some rainbow potatoes. I love their rainbow potatoes! It has a nice crisp on the outside yet soft on the inside. The scrambled eggs were really fluffy and pretty! It was HUMUNGOUS! The marinated ribeye reminded me of bulgogi. It was very flavorful and tender. Not too salty or sweet. Everything was very tasty and delicious. Really big portions, by the way. Definitely worth the price. I want to be back for their bottomless mimosas one day and try other dishes on their menu. I had heard that Kitchen Story is also the same owner as Sweet Maple. So if I had to compare, I definitely like Kitchen Story a lot more! It's a really cute place that makes you feel at home. There is also a patio for those who want to sit and eat outside. Plus, the food tastes way better at Kitchen Story. One interesting thing is that they give you the bill with a book. Cute and clever, Kitchen Story! Stopped here serendipitously when next-door Ike's was packed. Glad we came. Green Panini, Banmi Panini, Stone Pot made for a perfect late lunch for 3. Seasoning just right, unexpected extra attention to presentation, friendly fast service. No hint of rushing us even though our meal went past closing. Cool. One of my favorite meals in the city. Rustic, laid-back ambiance. Tuna tartar was excellent and we would have been perfectly happy just with the eggplant. What a cute little place! Went here for lunch with one of my coworkers today, and knew exactly what I wanted to order. I originally wanted the ribeye omurice, but I gave up red meat for Lent (sadness) and opted for the Frisco benedict, which is a chicken mango sausage, avocado, cherry pepper and hollandaise. Served on ciabatta and paired with rainbow potatoes, it was presented so beautifully I almost didn't want to eat it. However, it was so delicious that I surprisingly ended up eating the whole thing.I also ordered a thai tea latte, and it had just the perfect amount of foam! They're also known for their millionaire's bacon, but I've had it at Sweet Maple before and I'm not a big fan of the chewy bacon, so I wasn't really missing anything. Classic brunch fare in the heart of the Castro!  Massive juicy artisan burgers, paninis, and of course, breakfast standards, including the all-famous ""millionaire"" bacon (they even have a poster explaining how it's made near the restroom!)  Definitely going back next chance I get. right when i flew into s.f. the first restaurant we went to was kitchen story. and before i continue the rest of the review... i want to really point out out of ALL the places ive been to in s.f throughout my 4 day trip there.... this was the ONLY place i truly enjoyed. not only was EVERY dish amazing...not just good. AMAZING... but the service was really amazing as well.so to continue..our friend made a reservation there for 13 people in honor of my friends bday. they accomodated us by splitting the bill by two tables and also gave the bday boy a small chocolate cake? but that was really good to. heres a list of the things we ate:APPETIZERS:-Millionaire's Way 12 Try our famous Millionaire's Bacon, grilled organic asparagus and homemade smoky Maple syrup sauce -Ahi Scoops 12 Pan-seared sesame crusted Ahi tuna served with spicy cucumber seaweed salad, crispy yam, ginger and wasabi cream sauce -Crispy Calamari 11 Red curry battered Monterrey squid with spicy pepper, garlic aioli and homemade pickle-""CASTRO Tower"" 12 Diced Maguro tuna* ceviche tossed with roasted rice, kaffir lime, lemongrass, diced mango served with crispy chips MAIN COURSE:-POP' Belly $19 Overnight slow cooked Kurobuta pork in five spices, turmeric curry rice, Brussels sprouts with fermented beans sauce -Dancing Queen 20 Grilled Snake River Farm Wagyu Beef Flank Steak, spicy garlic Thai long bean, roasted rice sauce, 151 rum, ginger rice -Panang Curry; avocado, peanut, bell pepper, basil, crispy yam 14There were a few more that other people ordered that I didnt taste... but i promise you you cant go wrong with ANY of these dishes i just listed. everything is so well presented and flavorful..i wish they opened one up in LA!! (hint hint)HIGHLY recommended :D Came here a few weekends ago for the first time!! The place is pretty cute and kind of small, but they have outdoor seating too! The employees are really attentive; my water glass was always full and they even brought over a pitcher because I guess they noticed I was downing my glasses pretty fast haha. The millionaires bacon came out first and oh my god it was so good!! I cringed when looking at the price but wowww. I tried to eat it slowly because I wanted to savor it, but sooner than later it was gone. :( Fyi I was on their Facebook page and I saw that they put a recipe up for it!! Could it be? One day I'll try making it for myself... One day. As for the main dish, I ordered the frisco Benedict, which had chicken mango sausage, cherry peppers, avocado, lemon hollandaise, and a perfectly poached egg on top! The chicken mango sausage was delicious and still stood out through the egg yolk and the hollandaise! The dish also came with rainbow potatoes and fruits. I also got to try a little of the pancakes! I don't know if it was because I hadn't had pancakes in a while or because they were actually good, but I really enjoyed them!! Paired with the blackberries, strawberries, and blueberries, the pancakes were delicious. Coming from a person who doesn't like pancakes that much, I hope it means a lot!Overall this is a great place for breakfast/brunch with good service and yummy food, I definitely recommend it! The only bad part is parking.... Haha. I definitely want to come back for the millionaires bacon.. And to try the marscapone stuffed French toast!!! The wait for any good Sunday brunch in this city is like trying to get into a trendy bar in New York City. 1 hour plus is very normal. Luckily this place will serve brunch till 3pm everyday. I love it here. On a sunny day their outdoors seats are the perfect blend of sun and shade. The service is always excellent as well. Their patio was closed today but we had our dog with us, so they were very cool about opening up the patio for us.The indoor seating is very intimate and good for dates. Also good for a small group of friends. Like all SF hotspots, they are tiny. So I wouldn't roll up with 10 best friends but 2-4 would make a good brunch date.The food is awesome. I had the pork belly benedict today and my husband had the marscapone french toast. Both so very yummy. The bbq pork belly was a fusion dish served on small tortillas and kimchi de gallo. NOM NOM NOM!!!! It is fusion brunch so be adventurous and try all the great finds on the menu. Artichoke watercress benedict is also a win! We love coming here. But if you are here on the weekends, be prepared to wait an hour. For the most part every dish has some type of cheese in it. The lemon French toast was bomb not to mention thee Millionaires Bacon :) NOTE: This a review for BRUNCH!Every weekend my roommates and I always have a hard decision where we want to brunch. This place is right around the corner where we live so we come here pretty often. It's a really great place to brunch on the weekends (haven't come here for dinner) but the prices are kind of expensive and the wait can be pretty long so I wouldn't come here if I woke up late.FOOD: 4.5/5The food here is really really good. Every time I come here, whatever I order it is super delicious and I lick clean the plate. Most of the time I get eggs with some type of meat, either an english muffin or a crumpet (or something like that) and some freshly fried rainbow potatoes with a side of fruit. I wish they seasoned their eggs (they come unseasoned) but that's just a minor gripe. They perfect their Eggs Benedict with their amazing hollandaise sauce and their over-easy eggs are cooked to perfection. Everyone here is going CRAZY over the Millionaire's Bacon but to be honest their Mango Chicken and Pork Belly are absolutely delicious as well and costs much less. Their Millionaire's Bacon is pretty much a big fat slab of bacon covered in maple syrup, thai spice (think spicy honey garlic wings) and sugar making it salty, sweet and spicy all at once. It's really good and everyone should have it once but it's too heavy for me TBH and quite expensive. It only loses the 0.5 because it doesn't blow me out of the water. The flavours are familiar and delicious but it is nothing to scream out about - it's just some really good brunch.AMBIENCE & SERVICE: 4/5 Their Service is excellent. Everything you expect out of a good restaurant - they fill your water, your bottomless mimosas, they're super nice and they give your bill in a nice cute book (which is different every time). The ambience is also very nice and casual, when the sun is out they have a patio seating where it's super nice to sit out. My biggest gripe is the wait though. This has absolutely nothing to do with the restaurant itself but on Sat & Sun mornings, if you come here at peak brunch hours (12-2ish) expect to wait at least 1-2 hours for seats. Here is where I think this restaurant is simply just not worth that amount of time for waiting. I'm not sure if everyone in this area just comes here or everyone just comes to this area to go to this place but it definitely isn't worth 2 hours of waiting. Not to mention the bottomless mimosas so people stick around longer than usual. Come here early if you don't want to wait with the huge crowd.PRICE: 3/5This place is really goddamn expensive. I'm not kidding. It's around 12 bucks not including tax or tip just for a typical 2 eggs, bacon, muffin, potatoes breakfast and bottomless mimosas are a whopping 16 dollars. 16 DOLLARS! That's pretty goddamn expensive for bottomless mimosas. The millionaire dollar's bacon is also pretty expensive too and everyone goes gaga over it. It really isn't worth that amount of money - I mean it's good the first time but I wouldn't consistently come here just cause I don't want to go broke. Everything here runs up $13-$15+ so it's not cheap here, and I don't think the food is worth the amount of money they charge. It's good but not screaming AMAZING (as I said, not worth a 1 hour wait).WRAP 3.75/5I'll round it up to 4 because I really do like this place and I had some great experiences here. The food is fantastic and the service is great. However, there is just a huge wait sometimes and the price is pretty expensive for what they serve. I'd definitely come here a few times but I wouldn't be a regular just because I don't think the food is THAT amazing to wait an hour behind a huge crowd and pay that amount of money for breakfast. Definitely do check it out if you haven't come here before (and especially if you've never had brunch before) just make sure you come early at around 10-11am before the crowd picks up and try the millionaire's bacon. Just don't count me in as a regular just because of the price and the overhype people give it. came here for breakfast after church. like wow, the breakfast is awesome!! ample portions, beautiful plating (which i'm a sucker for since i'm a designer :D), and reasonable prices. apparently a popular neighborhood place with a long queue. waited 1/2 hr for a table but it was worth it. the service itself was pretty quick. definitely will go back to try out their dinner. Kitchen Story is by far our favorite brunch place the past couple of years.  I feel silly not having reviewed it until now.  Maybe I wanted to keep it a secret, even though it's hardly one at this point.When they re-made Tangerine into Kitchen Story, they got everything right.  They ditched the old decor which was stale and lifeless and brought the right modern texture to everything from the table dressing to what adorned their walls.  They kept the Asian fusion concept but changed nearly every dish, while maintaining the gorgeous presentation of the dishes themselves. I have so many favorite dishes from their menu after dozens of visits but the standouts have to be the following:- The Millionaire's bacon - applewood bacon dusted with chili and brown sugar and draped with maple syrup - A MUST TRY- The Mom's benedict - house-made pork wine sausage, meyer lemon hollandaise - quite good!- The Bulgogi burger - a Korean-style marinated rib-eye, mixed green, tomato, scallions, carrots, jack cheese - my mouth waters thinking of this dish- The Ribeye omurice - scrambled eggs over jasmine rice, marinated ribeye, carrots, cherry pepper, spinach, scallion. Demi glazed sauce. - Same meat as the Bulgogi burger but served over a bed of eggs with a sweet, tangy sauce; frickin' amazing.Their Achilles heel is their cocktail menu, it's pretty lacking.  But the food more than makes up for it. My friends and i went here for a group dinner with a reservation a few saturday nights ago. We were a big group, lets say about 15 people. dinner reservation was 8:30, we didnt get seated until past 9. service was a bit slow since they were busy. Other than that the food was yummy. REALLY GOOD BRUNCH. Got 2 poached eggs with millionaires bacon and the French toast with berries, iced dirty chai latte, and a mimosa. The bacon was so damn good.  The French toast too. I was surprised. I'll be back here First time out to SF and this brunch definitely satisfied my foodie nature. The millionaire's bacon is out of this world - I've never had better bacon in my life! I followed up some tastes of bacon with bottomless mimosas and the belly rancheros. Food and drink were 5/5! My only gripe was that our bottomless mimosas were cut short 15 minutes before they officially closed at 3:00 with no warning before we ordered. Got the lemon french toast which came with enough strawberries, blueberries and blackberries. Also ordered  a side of millionaire's bacon, which was really good (believe the hype) but also made me hate myself after finishing it, along with the scrambled eggs for the  complete breakfast option. Service was good and I liked the ambience a lot--lots of natural light, open kitchen and bookshelf lined with old paperbacks. Nice touch to put the bill on an old paperback, I suppose in line with the name. Will have to skip dinner after this hearty, self-indulgent breakfast. The Millionaire's Bacon is, in fact, a thing, one which you will probably order (or sneak a bite from when your starry-eyed dining buddy looks around the room to ensure everyone sees that he ordered it). And it's good, in the same way sex, breathing, truffle oil and Gauguin are good - there exist some indisputable absolutes. Candied bacon belongs on the list.Beyond this cornerstone of their Asian fusion menu, Kitchen Story is anticlimactic. Excepting a fresh, bright Castro Tower - Maguro tuna ceviche Thai'd up with kaffir lime, lemongrass, and diced mango scooped to your fishy face aboard crispy chips - and the fun and funky pumpkin fries, the dishes left me wanting. The star (anise) of any menu should bedazzle, yet the POP Belly muted the slow cooked Kurobuta pork in to a pool of poorly rendered pig fat, turmeric curry rice, and Brussels sprouts with fermented beans sauce that had a severely chemical finish. Zero sweetness, incredibly rich and overwhelmingly fatty, I've had the black hog before and this was no shining example.Other items drew attention, and I soon regretted not opting for the Burgah Boy (a maple Wagyu patty slapped with Millionaire's bacon) or the Big Eye Sandwich (day boat scallops, seared and... slapped with Millionaire's bacon) or anybaconthing elsebacon with bacon on its bacon. I guess the entire experience felt like a culinary petting zoo: scraggly plates milling about a one-trick pony. Good for kids, I reckon. Despite a slow start, the story of my dinner at this restaurant was full of laughs due to fabulous company, delicious food, big wine, and a casual fun environment...Just as sometimes it may take a few pages to connect with a good book, it did take a tad bit longer than ideal to get acknowledged the Tuesday night we were there.  Although the restaurant was slammed when we arrived, so no hard feelings!  Our party of seven decided to share a bunch of appetizers including Millionaire's Way, Fried Pumpkin, Sweet Caroline, the Castro Tower, and Garlic Asparagus.  None of them disappointed.  Neither did our entrees, but I think the highlights were the Pumpkin Curry, Red Curry, Pad See You, and Burger.Our wine glasses and water glasses stayed full thanks to the attentive staff... and we were celebrating a birthday amongst our group, so we did share one dessert and it provided what?  You guessed it... a happy ending!Very clever, by the way, that the check presenter was an actual book... smart thinking, Kitchen Story folks ;)Needless to say, I would not hesitate to return. OMG this places is Awesome first time there Breakfast was so good. It's one of the best breakfast I had in long time :) Came here for a weekend brunch, and it just so happen to be the nicest day in SF.  I ordered the Frisco Benedict with chicken mango sausage, avocado, cherry pepper, topped with meyer lemon hollandaise. It also came with a side of colorful fried potato bites and 2 pieces of fruit. We also ordered a side of the Millionaire's bacon (how can we not when it's raved above and beyond on yelp). I devour the Frisco Benedict, the cherry pepper was loaded with lots of flavor and the avocado goes so well with the bread (instead of your o' fashion English muffin). What surprised me was the chicken sausage that is actually a patty they topped on the benedict. The eggs were poached to perfection, but had a really strong taste of vinegar. The millionaire bacon is sweet and savory. It's not your typical crispy bacon and it melts in your mouth. Brunch didn't disappoint at all, will come back to try other things on the menu like the Belly Rancheros or the dirty chai.... This restaurant has a great vibe to it with outdoor seating, a bar area, and a very efficient staff who happily handed over the most amazing bloody mary I have ever had while we were waiting.The bloody mary was spicy as hell (ordered it extra spicy and they actually listened) with bits of kimchi in it.  It was topped with a variety of pickled and raw vegetables.  I am a bloody mary fan and this was probably the best one I have ever had.  I strong suggest you order it.I ordered the Belly Rancehros, a delicious combination of pork belly, poached eggs, and kimchi and it was definitely amazing.  The burger was pretty good as well but it was difficult to keep together as it disintegrated into a mush of bun, burger, and avocado.We got a side of millionaires bacon which as unreal, a mix of thick cut delicious bacon dusted with spices and maple syrup.Everything here was presented immaculately and the place was very well ran.  I highly suggest getting some breakfast here and if possible participating in the bottomless mimosas. Nice home like setting kitchen throughout the restaurant. The bacon is thick and sweet, tastes just like ham. The mimosas are strong and yummy. I really enjoyed the atmosphere in addition to the delectable brunch. I ordered the mascarpone deep fried French toast and a side of Millionaire's bacon. There was no wait on a Sunday for brunch... Though that may have been because it was raining. It's a close walk to Dolores park... Makes for a good date venue! Kitchen Story, visit #1. We had a group booking for dinner and I'd forgotten to look over the menu beforehand (which never happens). Thankfully I quickly spied Yelp mentions of the ""Millionaire's Bacon"" and knew I needed something with that in it. I decided to go for a burger under the ""Mom's Special"" section of the menu and ordered the ""Burgah"" Boy: Maple Syrup Wagyu Patty, Millionaire's Bacon, Vermont White Cheddar, arugula, super crispy russet wedges, housemade pickle. For an $18 burger I wasn't sure what to expect and was delighted when it arrived - sure, it was massive but I could still eat it without deconstructing it. My only negative comment would be that mine was a little overcooked for medium rare but it didn't cause any problems. The bacon is absolutely delicious - really thick cut, rich and sweet, the flavours of the burger gelled together really well. I also really loved the russet wedges which were cooked perfectly and even though I was really full, I still kept shovelling them in. I ordered a passion fruit iced tea which I expected to be sweet but it wasn't. No drama - I swapped drinks with Flo who had the raspberry lemonade and we were both happy. Service was friendly if a little rushed but there didn't seem to be many people on for the size of the restaurant and how busy it was. There was three tables of groups of around 8 (that's what happens when Yelp CMs hit San Fran for CM Week!) and I think they did the best in the circumstances. Kitchen Story, visit #2. Well, it's not happened yet but seeing as we're staying a block away from here for the next week, we'll definitely be back. We got here just past 10:30am on a Saturday while it was pouring rain so I thought the wait wouldn't be too bad, but we still waited for about 20-30 minutes.  The wait for the food is a bit long too, so allot a good 2-3 hours to brunch here.We all shared one order of the millionaire's bacon.. honestly it was good but I feel like I could pretty closely re-create it at home.  At $6.50 for 2 strips, I thought it was overrated.I enjoyed my frisco benedict.  The eggs were poached beautifully and I really liked the chicken mango sausage.  Really liked the omurice too, if you're craving something on the meatier side. Good ambiance, good food. Not exceptionally great. My friend brought me here and I was oh so pleasantly surprised to find that it was right next to Ike's!This is a cute little brunch place which has a pretty nice atmosphere & decorations.When my friends and I arrived, we waited about 15 mins and were promptly seated in order of arrival. ( this place is pretty organized & has wait-time updates )I ordered the eggs benedict with rainbow potatoes ! AND I loved the eggs, made perfectly like how I love 'em. Pretty runny & good. My favorite part was the rainbow potatoes! They were so delish, they're basically a variety of different potatoes! For those who love potatoes, you're in for a treat. hehe. ( i love potatoes...fries....yumm )We also ordered millionaires bacon, thanks to yelp :p, and it lived up to it's reputation! It's super sweet and THICK. Originally, I thought it was quite pricey for two pieces of bacon, but it's so filling that I could barley finish it. I love sweet stuff, but be warned: it's really sweeeet.I'm basically a regular, love this place! Oh & they give you your receipts in a little book. Hehe, hence kitchen story. Great brunch spot! I think this one was hovering at 4 stars, but what bumped it up to 5 stars is the lack of a wait if you go at a reasonable hour! Brunch in this city can be ridiculously hard to come by - not due to the lack of places offering brunch but because I just really don't want to wait 2+ hours to eat some brunch. Cue Kitchen Story where we walked in around 11 AM and there was NO wait.Favorite part was the millionaire's bacon! I love bacon, so I had to try this out: and YUM. It is a thick cut giant slab of bacon, sweetly glazed and marinated and just beautiful. I liked the asian-fusion decorations and food - sometimes Asian fusion can go very wrong, but they did a good job here balancing the flavors. I had to try the Dirty Chai - chai with a shot of soju and a shot of espresso - it's a perfect drink for brunch. I hope this place stays under the radar just a little longer so I can continue to get quality yummy delicious brunch without an hour+ wait!!! love the bacon and deep fried French toast. The best brunch in a crowded district. I really like this place for brunch! The Frisco benedict is so yummy! The hot cakes and french toast are also really good! The millionaire's bacon didn't fit my taste buds; I know a lot of people like it, but it was way too sweet for my liking. I've been coming here often the past month, which must mean something. Deducted a star because of the service, it's always hard to flag down a waiter. My two friends and I came here Sunday morning and it was packed. The Host was a bit frazzled but told me it would be a 35-minute wait. I didn't believe it based on the huge crowd outside, so I made a quick trip to Tartine for a snack. By the time I got back, they called our name. The host had timed it perfectly!We agreed to sit outside but without heatlamps (which they later told us they'd be installing in a few weeks), and a wind that suddenly picked up, it was freezing. We asked to be moved inside and was told that it would be a short wait. The staff was very friendly and the bottomless mimosas kept coming. By the time they moved us inside, our food was set down in front of us within 60 seconds. I'm not kidding. So well timed.I had the deep friend French toast which is really fried. For real. And it's actually stuffed with mascarpone. I'm emphasizing these things because I've been to other establishments that promise similar things but aren't really fried and hardly stuffed. They nailed it. I made it a complete meal with two eggs cooked exactly as I had ordered and pork sausage which was the right amount of greasy.The millionaire's bacon, as nearly everyone has pointed out, is excellent. I really wasn't expecting such excellence after my mediocre MarketBar breakfast the day before, but I will absolutely be back here. There were many things on the menu that I wanted to give a try. I think I love all things MILLIONAIRE BACON. Yummmmmmm! This place is owned by the same owner as Sweet Maple and Blackwood so the millionaire bacon is gooood! And the wait here wasn't too bad. I do like this story theme they have going here. They give you the bill clipped to a book too! How cute. I usually get a Benedict with millionaire bacon at the other restaurants but today I tried the BLT with millionaire bacon. It was delicious! In case you don't know what millionaire bacon is, it is a thick piece of bacon with a glaze on it so it is sweet. The texture reminds me of beef jerky but more moist. You gotta try it if you haven't! Decor (4 stars)The restaurant is visually impressive and gives a warm homey feeling.  I loved the rustic atmosphere with the driftwood tables, open kitchen, and wide windows that faced the street.  The books stacked on shelves along the wall left me feeling like I was sitting in someone's kitchen/dining room.Food (3.5 stars)We ordered:Crispy Calamari ($11) - We loved the red curry batter used on the calamari as well as their garlic aioli. It was tasty and nicely crisped.  The plate was beautifully presented as well.Millionaire's Way ($12) - Almost the same side dish at Sweet Maple but comes with 3 pieces of grilled asparagus and homemade maple syrup sauce at almost twice the cost. We've only had the millionaire bacon here once, but it seemed a bit smokier and less sweet/spicier compared to Sweet Maples. Personally, we prefer Sweet Maples.Dancing Queen ($20) - The plate is nicely presented and before you actually get to eat, they pour the 151 over your meat and light it on fire. The steak was tender and delicious and didn't need the extra sauce that came with the meal. The long beans accompanies the steak/rice very well. ""A"" loved the ginger rice.  Pop Belly ($19) - Another beautifully presented dish!  There were 6 slices of pork belly over a bed of tumeric curry rice.  The pork belly was flavorful, but it didn't melt in my mouth.  The tumeric curry rice was interesting.  It had a strong garlic powder taste...guess the chef got a little too heavy handed with seasoning the rice.  I actually wasn't a fan as it left a weird aftertaste in my mouth.Black Sesame Gelato - I was expecting one scoop, but out came three.  It was delicious and very creamy.  The black sesame was on point and I loved that it wasn't overly sweet.  I'm not sure where they get their black sesame gelato, but I'm assuming Bi-Rite Creamery as it's close by.   You MUST order this!Croissant Pudding - This is their take on bread pudding.  It was good.  The salted caramel ice cream and candied walnuts complimented the croissant pudding. Coconut Cream Latte ($5) - This latte would have been a winner if it wasn't so sweet.  It was creamy and smooth.  The coconut flavor was apparent and I liked that it didn't taste artificial.  There were even toasted coconut shreds sprinkled on top.  Thai Ice Tea ($4) - Very sweet!  ""A"" waited for the ice to melt to water it down a bit and it didn't work. lol!Knocking off a star as the waiter did not check me in when I told him I made reservations via OpenTable.  He acknowledge it when I told him, but then I receive this e-mail stating I was a ""no show"".  Not cool! #180. The other brunch place was extremely packed and this was another option nearby.  We got here around 10am on a Sunday and were immediately seated.  Sweeet.I got the mascarpone stuffed deep fried French toast (yelp.com/biz_photos/kitc…).  It's so bad but so good for you.  Not super sweet either.  And there was plenty to take home.  I was stuffed halfway through.  Pun intended.Don't mind coming back to this cute little place.__________My 2¢:- First timers: get the French toast.- RSVP to avoid the wait. What is a kitchen story? Is it a tale set in a kitchen? E.g., Ratatouille?Or maybe they're referring to a specific floor of a multi-level building? Specifically, the floor where food prep occur?Or maybe they're referring to the little-known culinary stylings of Joseph Story, US Supreme Court associate justice from 1811 to 1845?*I don't know. What I *do* know is that I have eaten here three (3) times, and each time the food has been exceptional. Get whatever looks good. It's all tasty.*His culinary stylings are little-known because I just made them up. Ate a delicious breakfast here this week.  The atmosphere is lovely and there were only a few people at 8:30am on a Friday.  The service was attentive, but a bit cold (like she wasn't quite awake yet or something). My friend and I had the Frisco Benedict, Millionaire's Bacon, & the Deep Fried French Toast.  All of the food was delicious, however the french toast is quite rich. I enjoyed the coffee ( it wasn't bitter which can be an issue at breakfast places like this). I would definitely return. Yes, the millionaire's bacon alone is worth the visit to this place. Brunch time can be packed, but the last time we were here, we sat outside with our frenchie and enjoyed our brunch with the rare San Francisco sunshine. Fast service, no wait on a Friday a little before 1pm. If I was gonna drop $17 on breakfast, I might as well have gone all out. Got the millionaire's bacon, deep fried french toast, eggs, high cholesterol, and probably an early heart attack induced death. I mean, I used to say Pork Store was an unhealthy breakfast but oh ho ho was I wrong. Not a fan of bacon, but millionaire's bacon is no traditional american bacon - it's sweet, savory, and gives off a texture of fatty beef jerky. Deep fried french toast was the bomb, a terrorist to my body but a delight to my mind and soul, and the mascarpone in the french toast? Sweet baby Jesus! Seriously, add some syrup on the french toast and you will literally have tasted the face of Jesus. The eggs you say? Yeah, they're eggs. They were alright, they're eggs. There was also a woman breast feeding at the table nearby, I didn't say anything, but I did try to take a discreet photo. sooo filling and so delicious =) you can make a reservation here so there was only a short wait! The service was friendly and fast! I was happy because I was running out of time before I had to head to the airport. The wait was short compared to a lot of other brunch places in San Francisco. Ordered the Belly Rancheros and had a Bloody Mary. I was in awe with the how cute the presentation was with both. The Belly Rancheros was sooo goood! Slow braised pork belly, arugula, avocado, spicy guacamole, kimchi pico de gallo, topped with a poached egg, all on top of a corn tortilla. The entree came with rainbow potatoes! I loved how this place has an Asian infusion. The flavors of everything blended so well together. Over all, I was definitely pleased. Fast and friendly service, great ambiance, and good food. Millionaire's bacon, scallop salad, and wagyu beef noodle soup were all good choices, although the bacon was a bit overpriced. The mango sticky rice dessert was really good and I usually don't like sticky rice desserts. I'd come back:) 3.5 stars. Cute place, fast service, food was good, but nothing wow. Ribeye omurice with scrambled eggs over jasmine rice, marinated ribeye, carrots, cherry pepper, spinach, scallion. Demi glazed sauce-hubby got this. He really enjoyed it. I thought it was weird to have rice, but he really enjoyed it. I got egg whites and on the side it came with potatoes that had mushroom, and onion, topped with cheddar cheese. Came with a herbed biscuit that was pretty dry. Millionaire's bacon-really yummy. Went here for brunch for the first time and I think I'm in love. The staff and management were understanding and accommodative when I called ahead to say there was a disabled person in our party. I truly appreciate the efforts they took.Now for the food, oof is it tastey! I may have had quite a few mimosas, but the food knocked my socks off. The stuffed french toast was the best thing I think Ive ever had for brunch. And the staff made sure that your glass never got too low (bottomless mimosas!).This place is worth it, but there is a bit of a wait, but you can start drinking while you wait! Doug and I came here to celebrate our 31st anniversary. We were staying at the Parker House, a B&B around the corner. We were seated right away. Everything looked great on the menu and the staff was very attentive. During the course of our meal I mentioned that this was our anniversary dinner. At the end of the dinner we were presented with a dessert mentioned and told to order one on the house. When the dessert arrived it was served with two flutes of champagne. Needless to say it made our day the way they made us feel so special.Bob.W This is an odd place.  While it claims to serve California cuisine, I found the dinner offerings to be slightly tweaked Asian food.  The dishes were well-prepared, but it wasn't really what I was looking for.  If I want Asian food I'd rather go somewhere that serves authentic dishes.  Not hugely motivated to return.  Maybe the brunch is more compelling.Given the high turnover of restaurants at this address I'll be curious to see what comes next when Kitchen Story's 15-minutes inevitably expire. The hot cakes. You must have the hot cakes. These may be some of the best hot cakes I've had in, well, ever.Really great ambience, fast and friendly staff, reasonable pricing for the quality, and just an overall great venue. My friend was also telling me that the wait time seems shorter than other popular brunch places in San Francisco. After reading the yelp reviews raving about, well, EVERYTHING at Kitchen Story, I was eager to give this place a try. I hauled myself out of bed at the ungodly hour of 8am on a Saturday morning just so my friend and I could beat the rush. We got there around 9:45 (I'm a girl, it was 8am...an hour to get ready is amazing) and even though there was a good amount of people in the restaurant, the bar was completely open and we were seated at a table right away. There was a good mix of asian-flared food and traditional breakfast dishes on the menu. Even though everyone says to get the deep fried french toast, neither one of us was feeling very ""sweet,"" so we each ended up ordering the Belly Rancheros. It was good, but pretty much a taco with shredded pork belly. I know, we probably didn't order the right thing. But I couldn't help feeling disappointed. We also got the millionaires bacon which was delicious. Sweet Maple does the same thing, but I enjoyed Kitchen Story's much more. It wasn't overly sweet and there was a perfect ratio of meat to fat. YUM.I will say parking around here was surprisingly easy. Even when we left at around 10:45am and there was a long line out the door there were still many spots around. I also really liked the ambiance. It has a really homey feel with bookcases all around and crown molding. It really feels like you're eating in someone's living room. Overall, I was disappointed with the food and satisfied with everything else. Nothing was bad, but nothing was great either. And in a town overridden with exceptional brunch spots, I can't say Kitchen Story will be one of my go-tos. Really trendy, fresh from the farm food. The staff was warm and welcoming and the wait isn't as bad as it seems. Parking however, is a bit tough especially on the sunny weekends.They have gluten free and vegan options! I'd been dying to try this place since my cousin told me about the millionaire's bacon and saw the reviews/pictures/etc. on yelp and IG. So my bf and I decided it was time to try this said, millionaire's bacon- and what better occasion than his birthday! We went ahead and made reservations on open table for brunch on Wednesday- we didn't technically need it, but haaay, points for open table! We walked in, and it was the cutest little restaurant ever. It looked like an actual kitchen. Super cool feel to it, and big windows to let natural lighting in. We were seated immediately, and I decided to order the mascarpone french toast with fresh berries on top, and for..I believe (an extra $5), you could make it a meal complete with millionaires bacon and 2 eggs. BF had the athenian omelet with a croissant, complete with a mimosa. Their mimosas are great. Perfect combination of champagne and orange juice. I'll definitely be coming back. TIP: ALWAYS MAKE A RESERVATION &**look for parking a block before 16th,  near the school/preschool place Stopped by this place for lunch with a friend after checking out the reviews on my Yelp App. I remember when this place used to be called Tangerine. I ordered the burger with the millionaire bacon on it and it was the bomb! Pros: Burger was very tastey medium rare way to go! The fries I was not a fan because they tasted like KFC potato wedges. not a fan. The Service here was extremely slow for a Monday (30mins long no joke). The food definitely made up for the service. I will try this place again but I am hestiant on coming over the weekend. I had the deep fried French toast and Millionaires bacon. They lived up to the raves. Delicious!! MIllionare's bacon was Amazing! rest of the food was delicious too! Service was fast and polite. Overall 3.5I had bookmarked Kitchen Story but couldn't recall why.  So read the yelp reviews for a mind jogger.   MILLIONAIRE BACON that's why.  So I knew I wanted something that included the thick sweet bacon slices.  Previously I had it at their sister Sweet Maple restaurant.  I went with the Castro millionaire bacon BLT on ciabatta with a side green salad.  Hubby got their slow cooked pull pork panini ciabatta sandwich with a side of roasted potatoes.  He thought the meat too sweet for his liking. The roasted potatoes were herb seasoned and crispy.  Yummy.My BLT was good but messy.  And the bacon wasn't as snappy as I would have liked.  A side of bacon would have been a better choice.   I ate the first 1/2 sandwich with my hands, slippery and oozing sauce. Then second 1/2 with fork and knife.   Tables are kind of tight, and we had three women on their lunch hour next to us whose voices and conversation was discomforting.  I should have asked to be moved.Parking was somewhat challenging.   We parked on 18th & Sanchez. Ribeye omurice is delightful (as other reviewers have mentioned)!  We also tried the fried French toast, which also does not disappoint.  The line is usually pretty long on the weekends, but the service is fast and efficient.  Would definitely come back again to try some of their more traditional breakfast / brunch dishes. I had the burger and it was flippin' fantastic.  And the calamari was delicious, as well.  The waiters were nice, and I dig the ambience of the place.  I didn't even particularly mind that it was cold outside and every time the door opened a draft came with it.  Man, that was a tasty burger. Excellent fluffy omelets, delicious fatty lacquered bacon, great crispy potatoes (a mix of types), rich coffee, responsive service, perfect berries....what's not to like? I did go early on Sunday, so perhaps that's the secret...get there before the crazy crowds. Came here for brunch with my girls on President's Day at 10:30am and did not have to wait for outdoor seating, indoor seating was a different story (there were already 3 parties ahead of us waiting). The place is affiliated with Blackwood so I anticipated the subtle Asian fusion style - though Blackwood is more Thai inspired and Kitchen Story has more Korean elements. Our feast consisted of the following:Franciscan Scramble: chicken mango, avocado, pimento, mushroom, celery, jack-way too much cheese, it drowned out the flavors of all the other ingredientsFrisco Benedict: chicken mango sausage, avocado, cherry pepper, meyer lemon hollandaise-delicious, the benedict equivalent of the above scramble without the cheese-couldn't actually taste the meyer lemon hint in the hollandaise, but maybe I'm just a little plugged up and off my tasting gameBelly Rancheros: slow braised Kurobuta pork belly, avocado, arugula, Kim Chi Pico De Gallo, spicy guacamole, corn tortilla-the pork belly had the perfect texture and I wish all places had their spicy guacamole-the guacamole wasn't spicy per se, but just a lot more flavorful than the typical green mush you've come to expect from guacamoleMascarpone Stuffed Deep Fried French Toast-in case you cannot tell, me and cheese are not friends so this dish didn't do it for me either since the filling has a plentiful amount of mascarponeAll the dishes came with a colorful side of potatoes and the overall quality of the food is nothing to complain about. ""Would you like some coffee?"" the host asks, as I'm waiting for my date to arrive. First dates are always nerve racking, and I was wondering if the coffee would make me even more jittery. I decided to drink it anyway.I barely spot my date from afar, and we grab a table.I had the Belly Rancheros. A pork belly dish with fresh avocado, multi-colored potatoes, arugula, and kimchi pico de gallo. My only complaint was that my potatoes tasted cold and salty, so I left them.Overall, the flavors went together well, and complimented each other. Which is what I would have liked to have said about my date, but there was something missing between us. Our chemistry was about as tepid as the potatoes on my plate.The service was good though, and they kept refilling my coffee. Which was good, because I was now lacking the energy to muster up any excitement. 3.5, rounding up.Went here with the old ball and chain for Valentine's Day because we're both terrible at making plans and they still had a table open a couple days before.I would describe the service as sluggish. The ambiance is lovely- there was a small jar-vase of fresh flowers on each table- but slightly patchy. My boyfriend ended up with a copy of the menu that was the same on both sides. The charming book they clipped the check to had been vandalized if you checked inside it.The food experience was totally OK. The complimentary sweet potato chips are somewhere between chewy and crunchy, which is not a great combo, but they were edible. I have a very low spice tolerance, so there are things I did not personally enjoy that people who don't have delicate baby tongues would be fine with. We got the samosas for a starter. The pastry was nice. The sauce with them was very good, but I gave up on it because of the spice issue. For dinner I got the salmon, but requested it with the sauce on the side, because: spice. I was happy with my large chunk of fish and the asparagus it came with. I did try the sauce a little but even without the spiciness, I don't think it would have added a lot.My boyfriend got the tuna salad and enjoyed it. He, by the way, is totally fine with spiciness. The salad was garnished with two long rigid noodlelike things? You do you, Kitchen Story.For dessert we got the ""choco cake."" It was divine. Admittedly, it's pretty difficult to make a chocolate cake with a gooey chocolate filling not good. It had the same noodle things for decoration, by the way.Overall a totally adequate restaurant, maybe a little overpriced, but I'd be willing to visit again to try more of their menu. Although probably with the sauce on the side. The food was delicious, especially that Millionaire's Bacon. Though I must admit, the service was slow considering that the restaurant wasn't all that busy. There was literally no wait to be seated, and plenty of seating area was available. It would've been five stars for the quality and taste of food, but I just was not as impressed with the service. It took quite a while to order, get the food and even get the check.The waitress was friendly but could use a little more practice and tips on hospitality/service. Decent food, but overpriced. The decoration and the presentation of the dish are very artistic! The BACON is worth eating but a little bit heavy~ Food seemed overpriced for what you get. The servers are nice but not really the fastest. The bacon was good. We came for dinner; you shouldn't. The burger was missing a kick of some sort... or a bite that would cut the meatiness. Just a slight lack in flavor. The fries were good. The chips however, were not. They were accompanied with the bacon wrapped scallop sandwich. The scallop was cooked well and the bacon was overwhelming to the scallop. This place is an ok on my list. I might have thought differently if I tried the brunch instead. Happy Happy Happy. With the exception of my empty wallet (typical for delicious food in SF!!) Kitchen Story is my new found happy place. Our hearts set on brunch in the Castro, the BF and I ventured out to Kitchen Story. The line both excited and frightened us - we were prepared for a 45 min wait - but we got called in for a table in 2 minutes - no joke. Fortuitous perhaps?Atmosphere:  As soon as we were seated I was elated by the cozy and beautiful decor. No detail left unnoticed, the place looked like a catalog picture of pottery barn and was buzzing with laughing, happy groups of fellow brunchers. We had a little two -seater, the place is tight but so aesthetically pleasing you won't notice. The service consisted of several people with a main server. Everyone was kind and efficient. Main vibe is hustle to the max.Food: HOLY S***. Hands Down Best Bacon Ever. Millionaire's Bacon is the best $6.50 you will ever spend. Just do it. I got a coffee (also perfect) and the Athenian Omelette. This came with rainbow potatoes, fruit garnish and the best freakin biscuit you'll ever devour. The basil, cheddar biscuit with sweet butter (?? i think??) was to die for. I would happily trade 2 days worth of calories for this meal. The omelette had a perfect blend of flavor with goat cheese - yesss. The rainbow potatoes are a blend of fancy potatoes and sweet potatoes - simple taste but delicious. I sound a bit too excited about this place, right? But I think my enthusiasm can be chalked up to expecting nothing and getting everything. Seriously, enjoyed every.single.piece of my meal. THAT is a rare find.  Just go. Enjoy your life for an hour and blissfully indulge in this lovely experience. Well done Kitchen Story! OMG. Fusion's finest! Lord knows I love brunch. I also love Asian Fusion. Well, hold on to your panties guys...ASIAN FUSION BRUNCH! Who reached into my fantasies and pulled out a Royal Flush of Awesome? Sweet Christ on a Cracker this place rules. It's small and crowded but hey, that's the calling card of awesome in SF. The staff is accommodating in the face of an endless line of people asking, ""How long is the wait?"" I was seated quickly and served in an amount of time that even I considered to be fast, and I was really hungry. ;-) GO. Get the Millionaire's Bacon. Thank me later. Delicious bacon. Deep fried french toast was a bit much. I couldn't eat after a few bites. Pancakes were excellent. Had a nice brunch here. I got a basic eggs plate, and it was tasty, and I'm hard to impress when it comes to a plain eggs-and-potatoes brunch. Millionaire's bacon was much better than what I had at Sweet Maple (which was more like beggar's bacon). Had a pleasant wait for our table, mimosas in hand. Sooooo good!! Must get the french toast and millionaires bacon. I have never had anything so good in my entire life. The only thing negative that I have to say, is that we had to wait an hour before we got seated for breakfast. But in my opinion it was well worth it. We came here for dinner last Friday and we were impressed!The ambiance is low key but the food was very good. We ordered the spicy Waygu roll, the ahi tun, the steak with ginger rice, and a noodle soup. Everything was very delicious and unique!The prices were fairly reasonable. I would come back again! Everything - and I mean everything - about this place is suberb. Deep fried marscapone French toast, delicate green tea, beautiful decor, inviting service. I'm not a going out for breakfast person but Kitchen Story changed me. Forever. Is it possible that I haven't rated this place yet?  I've been here many times, for weekend brunch mostly, but once for breakfast and once for dinner, and I love the food.  There is almost always a really super long wait for brunch (think an hour), and parking is horrendous.  But service is friendly and the food options are interesting.  They call it Californian, but there's a definite Asian influence.  For brunch, I love their bulgogi burger and their crab panini.  Large portions and oh so tasty.  Friends have loved their millionaire's bacon, ribeye omurice and mascarpone stuffed French toast (if you don't get this, you will salivate when you see it being served elsewhere).  For dinner, I've had POP Belly (pork belly with yellow curry rice and brussel sprouts), Finger Lickin' (fried chicken breast with curry dipping sauce and russet wedges) and short rib beef tacos with kimchi pico de gallo, spicy guacamole.  For dessert we had a croissant bread pudding with salted caramel Bi-Rite ice cream, and mango sticky rice.  Everything was DELICIOUS.  One of my favorites despite the parking situation. Incredibly rich, delicious breakfast food, highlighted by the Millionaire's Bacon. The flapjacks are equally good and -- I can't stress this enough -- rich. Seriously, if you're looking for lighter fair, or healthy, you might want to look elsewhere. But if you want indulgent breakfast food in a vibrant restaurant with good service, this is the place! This is one of my favorite brunch spots in San Francisco. I love all their eggs benedict dishes and their millionaire's bacon. The biscuit with pork wine gravy is seriously to DIE for. I can't get enough of it. Whenever I have family or friends stopping by, I plan on taking them here.The wait is usually not so bad if you get here early enough. You can come around 10AM and there usually isnt a wait. The only time I did have to wait, it was only for 10 minutes and they served us coffee/tea outside without any charge. This place is amazing! I don't know what to say about this restaurant. I came here with my boyfriend for dinner and was a little bit disappoint with the food. I thought the food will be amazing since the Kitchen Story is related to Sweet Maple, so I had high expectation on Kitchen Story. Maybe I'll try there breakfast/ lunch for a different perspective (hope it will taste better). Came here for my friend's bday dinner and was pleasantly surprised...all the food was so flavorful & good!  I think of this place as a fusion thai restaurant.  We had a preset menu for a large group party.  Right off the bat, the ahi poke salad was very fresh and good!  I immediately fell in love with the millionaire bacon- sweet & salty all in one bite!  And the POP belly - pork belly with curry rice was absolute heaven in every bite!  I couldn't get enough of this dish!  I highly recommend this place if you're looking for amazing food in the city! Delicious, clean and friendlyI came here at 8am with a friend to have brunch (apparently you have to get to these places early to avoid a long wait). I ordered the Franciscan Scramble which comes with rainbow potatoes and a biscuit, which was really delicious. I could have done with less cheese but the avocado and veggies inside the omelette were very delicious! The rainbow potatoes were perfectly roasted (delicious but not overly greasy so it retains its crunch and toasty goodness). I had a bite of the Millionnaire's bacon, which is the most unique bacon I've had! It's a bit pricey for two slices of bacon ($6.50) but if you are a bacon fan, I would recommend it. Overall, I thought the place was really clean and nicely decorated. Service was fine! CasualFriendlyAsianModernCleanDelicious I absolutely love this place. My friends and I are frequent guests and their food is absolutely amazing. But the reason I give this place two stars is because of their service. Almost every time I have been there, the staff has been incredibly rude. The first time we went, the host snapped at me for asking how long the wait would be for a party of 6. Then, one of our friends' plates was not brought out and the waiter said to us that he didn't order anything. We told her politely what he had ordered and she rolled her eyes. No apologies or anything.I went there today with my family and I went up to the host (same person as before) asking to put our name in. As I'm writing our name down, he starts opening the door over my foot and says ""you need to move!"" There were customers on all sides of me and I was shocked by how short he was about it and that he was forcing me to bump into other customers. We finally got seated and ordered our food, and my sister forgot to order a coffee. We saw our waiter and we tried to get his attention. He looked right at us, and then promptly walked the other way. We then asked the next person who came up to our table to refill our waters and he said ""I don't take orders. You have to ask your waiter for that""Honestly, if it wasn't that their food was so great, I would not return. I'm not asking for a whole song and dance, just some politeness from the staff. Decent food, but service not quite up to par with the prices. Came here for dinner.First off, more than half of the dishes on the menu has a deep-fried component. Good if you're craving that kind of stuff, but since I wasn't, I ordered the scallop/beet salad. For $11, it came with exactly two scallops. The underlying beets/greens were nothing special and not particularly tasty. They could have roasted the beets to bring out more flavor.For a main, I settled on the Pad Kee Mow, which was perfectly suitable, similar to what you can get at any Thai restaurant around town. I also tried a bit of the burger, which was quite tasty, as were the accompanying fries. But nearly 20 bucks for a burger is just too much!It was a little hard to summon a waiter to order drinks. Also, water was spilled on one of our party by a clumsy waiter trying to clear plates, who also was dropped a dish as well (fortunately this was not at our table). This is the kind of service I might expect at a divey place in Chinatown, but not at a $20 burger place. Fast, Delicious & DifferentTip: Go around 2pm. It was so noisy and packed but we happened to go towards the end of their open hours and got a seat right away.Ordered the breakfast sandwich with a side of ""Millionaire's Bacon"". Delicious and fatty. Not good for a diet conscience person, but a fun place in a nice neighborhood. Bottomless Mimosas. Ricotta Pancakes. Millionaire's bacon. Pure glutton but oh so worth it. Great brunch spot to start off before hitting the Sunday Funday trail. The waits can be long but the staff is great and the prices are reasonable. 1st time having brunch here. Customer service was great. Food very beautiful and tasteful. Place is very nice. There's inside & outside sitting. Great service and great food, what more can u ask for. I will be back!!! Perfect spot for a quick dinner. Good prices and friendly staff. We had the yellow curry and ahi salad and both were very good. What a perfect little brunch spot. Not exactly sure what their niche is, but they make lovely brunch! One word of advice though - don't order the oatmeal, it is dreadful. My own fault for trying to be healthy and get some fiber and oaty goodness. The oatmeal is watery and flavorless and completely regrettable. They did bring me brown sugar and milk which did nothing to salvage the flavor. But luckily, I had more than enough other delicious plates to make up for this folly!The millionaire's bacon should be renamed Bacon King Supreme Being of All Bacon Entities. That's how amazing it is. I don't even like bacon. So this speaks volumes. It's sweet, crisp, THICK, and almost unbearably scrumptious.Mascarpone stuffed french toast is FRIED and tastes like a donut french toast. Take that, cronuts! This is cronut extreme! It has mascarpone! Ain't nothing beating this breakfast now. The mascarpone tastes like a rich pillow of heaven in your mouth. I can't get over how indulgent this french toast is, I've never eaten anything so fluffy and fatty and goooood.I got a cheddar biscuit with gravy and the cheddar biscuit was so fat it looked like they gave me two by accident. I'll take it. It was super flaky, buttery, but with tons of flavor and herbs. The gravy on the side was so thick it was almost like its own dish - almost like a soup/stew, really. It was so savory and creamy and wonderful I almost wished I'd ordered gravy with a side of biscuit instead of the other way around.My friends and I got the thai tea latte, green tea latte, and dirty chai. I'm biased, but I think the green tea latte was the best, but you couldn't go wrong with any of them. Best part? Parking took me about 5 minutes on a Sunday morning around 11 and there was NO WAIT for 3 people. Shocker people, there is good brunch to be had in SF without a bleary-eyed wake-up call at 7 am. Easy 5 star review. Checked it out because of the great reviews, love the twist on traditional brunch dishes. They are also super efficient, jam packed place w only 20 min wait. Delicious millionaires bacon and ribeye omlet. Will def go back! I've been here about 3 times now and each time I've been here it's been awesome. Two of those times was for the Bottomless Mimosas. It's $16 per person and it's a pretty good tasting mimosa. The first time we got our own glass pitcher to pour for ourselves but the second time they came by and poured it for us. Not sure what the rules are for Bottomless since everyone of us got it each time. Lunch ends around 3PM and that's when everyone starts clearing out.The food is okay. The Millionaire's Bacon reminds me of Filipino Tosino. It's just bacon that's a little sweet. I think it's worth trying at least one time but I wouldn't pay extra for it to get it on the side.Overall, this is a great place to get good tasting Bottomless Mimosas. The food is just okay but don't think I would be coming here unless it's with some bubbly. Pros:-Great tasting bottomless mimosasCons:-Super busy and a long wait Came and tried the Pad See You with Roast Pork. Delicious! Beautifully garnished and a great portion size. Vegetables were crisp and the pork juicy. Highly recommend this dish. The Francisco Benedict was amazing!Great service and great food! I will definitely come back next time I am in San Francisco! Came here for my birthday brunch in the summer. Think we waited about 20-25 min for a table and were seated outside (it was sunny, yay!). Was heavily contemplating between the omuraisu or an omelet and opted for an omelet with rainbow potatoes. Those potatoes are to die for. The omelet was alright, nothing special. It came with a mini croissant which was kind of burnt, but very buttery. I tried my friend's omuraisu and it was interesting. Had a spicey kick to it. Another friend ordered some melt and it was really good! Will be ordering this next time I come back.Service was accommodating. We wanted to switch to a larger table and they allowed us to do so promptly. Great food, service & experience. Highly recommended for brunch! As other reviewers have mentioned, the millionaires bacon is amazing. Also really love the tilapia burger. Mmm yum... Will be returning when in SF. 1st time at Kitchen Story yesterday. The place was packed but you get seated easily if there's 2. If you have a group of 6 like we did, we had to have everyone there to be seated.All the staff were friendly. They were so patient with us. Everyone was very happy with their brunch choices. I was very surprised how yummy my scrambled eggs was. It was light and fluffy! Awesome texture! I was most pleased with the home fries or the rainbow potatoes. I was expecting they were gonna be lukewarm from being under a heat lamp but it wasn't! It was hot, crunchy and fresh!The bottomless mimosas looked like it was more OJ than champagne but it was still potent! Millionaire's bacon lived up to the hype! It was delish. Folks complain how pricey it is. It takes awhile to prep & cook those as I was told by the staff. Love this place!!! Had dinner here, and it definitely surpassed expectation.   Started with an app of the Millionaire Bacon, served 2 slices with 2 spears of Asparagus $12 (a little pricey for two pieces of bacon, but damn son, that's some bacon).  Thai Iced Teas ordered around and then I had the fried chicken served with curry dipping sauce and my buddy had the burger... we split what we had and WOW, the burger there may be my new favorite food in San Francisco.   The chicken was good too, loved the red curry dipping sauce, had to debate whether or not I was going to stay classy and not drink it straight after the meal was over... I didn't... but I wanted to.   I'll be back, next time with a soup spoon. Came here off a friend's recommendation. Everything was good but the millionaire's bacon is what's going to bring me back. Holy cow. Who would think a fat slab of bacon soaked in syrup would be delicious? Just kidding, that sounds inherently awesome. BUT! I would never have imagined it would be as delicious as it was. If you come here and don't get the millionaire's bacon, then you are a fool who just missed out on a golden opportunity. I really like the food at kitchen story and my order (Ribeye omurice) was great and tasty. But the restaurant was very noisy. This place is owned by the same family that owns Sweet maple and Blackwood restaurants,  and the menu is pretty much the same as Sweet Maple. Food quality and variation gets 4 stars but not the environment. The restaurant is very noisy and tables are close to each other. I understand that the management cannot regulate the noise level but I'm not a fan of having to finish my food fast in order to get out as fast as possible. If you don't mind the noise you can enjoy tasty dishes here. Unfortunately I left with a bad headache. I don't go out to eat as much in San Francisco but if I could, I'll be sure to try out new spots. The ""millionaire bacon"" was something new to try for those bacon lovers out there. This is a small place and has plenty of parking around the restaurant. I ordered the Ks omelette which was really satisfying because I avoid trying go to eat oily and greasy food and their plate that consist of my omelette, potatoes, and buttered crossaint was really perfectly made. Went for dinner and ordered the burger. Delicious, cooked perfectly. Millionaire bacon on burger was mouthwatering. Burger had a sweet taste to it. Best burger I've had in San Fran so far. My friend had the sandwich with bacon wrapped scallops and it was equally delicious. mediocre food at best, and horrendous service. ..AND a fly flew in my mimosa. When i pointed it out to the server, he had the nerve to glare at me rather than apologize. In short - considering how many great places there are in SF, save yourself the trouble and skip out on this dump. It's not worth your time or  your money. Kitchen story is my go-to place for larger group dinners (just like Jasmine M. said). they're very accommodating about adding people on reservations last minute too!i think the service is nice, but the standout is definitely the interior decor. it reminds me of someone's house/lodge/cabin in the woods, books on the shelves, dark lighting, benches with pillows...my recommendations: Ahi scoops were nice, salmon is pretty good, millionaire's bacon, shrimp currythe reason i don't give this 4 or 5 stars is because i never go around in life 'craving' kitchen story food. it's just good, but not incredible mouth-watering dying. (note: ooh, the brunch pics look good though! maybe i'll come here for brunch one day and add a star!) I've been to Kitchen Story a couple times now and am really impressed with the way they handle large groups for dinner. It's scary easy to make a reservation for a group of 6+... even on NYE. The staff here is super friendly and happy to answer any questions about the menu. Vegetarians: I would recommend a couple of small plates here. They don't really have many veggie entree options, except for the tofu curry which I haven't tried. The Sweet Caroline is totally delicious, as are the potato Samosas. I love the side dish of string beans here- perfectly cooked and sort of spicy. My non-veg friends rave about the Salmon, Ahi scoops, and Shrimp Curry.They don't really allow you to split the bill on multiple cards for large groups, which is a bummer. But, they bring out the bill clipped to an old book- cute touch! Two words: Millionaire's Bacon, One Feeling = HeavenlyKitchen Story is an adorable and cozy restaurant located in San Francisco's Castro neighborhood. I was introduced to this restaurant by a good friend of mine and I have been thankful ever since. To be honest, I have never been more in love with bacon after having my first bite of the Millionaire's bacon. This bacon is absolutely amazing as it is 5x thicker than normal bacon. I fell in love with every delicious piece that entered my mouth. Should you feel a need to order something else besides the delicious Millionaire's bacon, I recommend the following brunch dishes:- Ribeye omurice (scrambled eggs over jasmine rice, marinated ribeye, carrots, cherry pepper, spinach, scallion) - Mascarpone stuffed deep fried French toastFun Fact: You will fall in love with the Millionaire's Bacon. came here for brunch on new years day with a group of 4 because everybody else had ridiculous wait times.  we waited 30 minutes here.  very busy.  decent service.i wanted to try the bacon, but they didn't get my order right.  they gave me the wrong burger and the wrong side.  oh well.  it happens.  the CA burger wasn't that good.  the burger was very thick but pretty mushy.  it didn't have a grilled taste.  avocados made the consistency even mushier.  overall, it could have used more flavoring.  potato wedges were average. I love this local spot. Fresh squeezed orange juice and carrot are very good. The freshly made cheddar and chive biscuits are my weakness. This is probably the best breakfast I've ever had. I had the Athenian omelette and it was amazing!! The goat cheese was such a great touch to already amazing flavors. The potatoes were a great mix of sweet and russet. You'd be a FOOL to miss out on the MILLENNIUM BACON!!! Watch out for those pollenating flowers on the bar tho. That food is TOO sugary.Like everything was covered in caramel sauce. sweet meats, sweet rice, sweet vegetables. their plum sauce was pure tooth decay.my kids got the pork tacos and couldn't eat them, they said they were like boiled meat covered in melted icecream. If you're like us and prefer savory dinners, this place is a diabetic's nightmare. Great service even though we didn't order drinks. Reasonably priced, and the check comes on a paper back book. Great brunch! Bottomless mimosas and delicious brunch food! We had a slight problem with the eggs benedict, eggs were still uncooked on one side but we sent it back with no fuss and they served a new one within 2/3 minutes. Service was already good with everyone jumping in to help but the nice way they handled our food send back (especially cause we hate doing that) made everything even better.. Cannot wait to come back Kitchen Story! Whoops, I did it again. That is, moved to a new city and decided what my favorite restaurant was within 24 hours or so. Seems to be a pattern with me. If only my taste in men were nearly as definitive and accurate.My friend and I were looking for a place to go for NYE, and didn't want to go to a place with a two-hour-wait, nor did we want to hit Taco Bell. We looked on OpenTable and saw we could get in here in an hour... booked it... then went online and saw four-stars on Yelp. Promising. Highly promising.We arrived and went with the highly-reviewed items. The Millionaire's Way (Millionaire's Bacon, grilled organic asparagus and homemade smoky Maple syrup sauce)... POP & Iing (Slow braised Kurobuta pork belly, arugula, spicy ginger sauce)... and for entrees the Finger Lickin' (Chicken) (Fried organic chicken breasts, extra crispy russet wedges, coconut Yellow curry dipping sauce, cucumber salad) and the Dancing Queen (Grilled Snake River Farm Wagyu Beef Flank Steak, spicy garlic Thai long bean, roasted rice sauce, 151 rum,ginger rice).The Millionaire's bacon was the best bacon I've had. Period. The POP & Iing is the second-best pork belly I've had, but if you knew what it was like at Animal in Los Angeles, you'd realize what a compliment that is. It would be like dating my ex and being told that you're the second best in bed. Take it as a compliment. The Chicken in curry sauce wasn't Earth-shatteringly good like the appetizers, but it was delicious nontheless, perhaps in my top ten chicken dishes ever. The Dancing Queen ordered the steak ironically also called the Dancing Queen... and loved it, as did I.As we left we saw signs for the Pajama Brunch the next morning. New Years came and went, we awoke... and... what the hell.We go back and have two eggs with millionaire's bacon, the chicken mango sausage, the Ribeye omurice (scrambled eggs over jasmine rice, marinated ribeye, carrots, cherrypepper, spinach, scallion. Demi glazed sauce) and the Okonomiyaki (modernyaki) egg pancake (w/ cabbage, scallion, asparagus, carrots, mushroom, red onion). Bottomless mimosas in BIG glasses. Again, everything was amazing, and since it was brunch, totally different than the night before. Though we got the same table and cuter-than-a-Coppertone-baby waiter, Max.Blah blah blah, January 1st passes. An old friend from Oakland hits me up, wants to see my new place. Parks. Looks. We decided to go eat. He says ""OMG you're a few blocks from one of my favorite places... let's go there!""You've gotta be kidding me.For the third time in 24 hours, I walk in. Max eyes me suspiciously. Can't blame him. By now it must seem like I'm staking out the place. I needed to get something different this time. I mean, for the love of God. So I went with the Thai menu. Totally different, right? Started with the Crispy Calamari (Red curry battered Monterrey squid with spicy pepper, garlic aioli and homemade pickle) and it was perfect. Then had the Pad Kee Mow (Spicy flat rice noodle, bamboo shoots, bell pepper and basil). I ordered it 7.5/10 spicy, and I swear it was exactly right. Nice kick, not overdone. Just as good as Thai food at a ""real"" Thai restaurant (meaning solely Thai food). My second friend had the POP Belly (Overnight slow cook Kurobuta pork belly with five spices, yellow curry rice, Brussels sprouts with fermented beans sauce , Spicy ginger sauce), which was a different format of the POP & Iing, and every bit as delicious.I left, vowing that after three meals in a row, I'd not return for at least two weeks. I don't think I'll pull it off. My friend Vanda introduced my friends and I to this place and it was awesome!  I had the french toast with the millionaire bacon, some of my friends had the eggs benedict and a few other dishes (there were 8 of us). All of us cleared our plates and had some sides. Bottomless Mimosas were the choice drink for some of us, I had the bloody mary!  The bloody mary was so good and wanted to order another! I am for sure coming back here.  My suggestion is come earlier than you expect to eat. There were a lot of people waiting and I heard it's usually like this. We waited about 30 minutes. It was worth it.  The staff were nice and service was good.  The crowd of people there were pleasant, a few probably could've pulled their heads out of their *sses... but overall a great environment during brunch.  If you sit close to the door gets a little cold tho. Which I forgot about when my food came... :) go go go! I love this place! Great atmosphere and every breakfast dish I've tried is amazing. The marzipan French toast is perfect, rainbow potatoes and a housemade biscuit are tasty sides, and the millionaire bacon is a delicious treat. The service is always helpful but not intrusive, the atmosphere is energetic and pleasant. This place always brings out the best in me.A great way to set the tone for the day. My dish (KC's omelette) was so beautiful to look at. It also comes with a very fluffy egg and interesting spices (lemongrass in it!). I don't care about the biscuit, it needs to be more buttery I think.I ordered the millionaire's bacon just like everyone. It's a really good bacon candy.Space is cramped. Too cramped! They leave a ton of room in the middle of the restaurant and leave no space between tables. Hence -1 star.Parking was difficult, but we got lucky.Go early! With the ever increasing number of restaurants to try in San Francisco, Kitchen Story is one of the few I consistently go back to, and I am never disappointed.  It's no cheap place, coming to an average $30-50 per person for a plate, drinks, tax, and tip, but everything I've had here is delicious and satisfying, definitely worth the cost.If you come after 11am or before 2pm for weekend brunch, be prepared for a wait up to an hour/hour-and-a-half, if the weather is nice.  (Still worth it.) Meet up with some friends here for a post T-day brunch. Overall, was good.  Had the two eggs, biscuit and potatos.  The biscuit was amazing, esp with the maple butter.   May venture to the some of the other items on my next trip out. I try to get breakfast here at least once on every trip I make to San Francisco. Seriously, its that good.My favorite menu item is the Frisco Benedict, which is a scrumptious benedict with chicken mango sausage, avocado, cherry peppers and hollandaise. Friends of mine have tried to take me to other brunch places in SF that they swear by, but I always return to Kitchen Story because it never disappoints. Tell me a story...Well, this is one for Kitchen Story.Chapter 1 - R i s e  &  B r u n c hIt was one of those lazy, morning Sundays, that I pestered my friend to go here for brunch and we both stayed up quite late (3:30am), the night before - a Saturday night.  We beat the crowd and arrived here at 10am.  We basically got about 5 hours of restless sleep.  I was worried, whether it was worth it on grabbing brunch.  It was!Chapter 2 - T i n g l i n g  T h e  P a l a t e From considerate thinking, my friend suggested to be seated at the open bar for the full experience of the kitchen cooking and prepping dining experience rather than the table seatings on the side.  Being the friend, who doesn't like to be bothered in the mornings, he was actually right on that part.  The observation of food entrees that was coming out from the kitchen, was marvelous.  You got to see how they handled the food and what looks delicious to order up!  It was a tease to the palate.  The service was commendable as well - servers reassured us that our entrees will be coming out very shortly, refilled our waters and asked if we needed anything else in the meantime.  They have bottomless mimosas for $16, but I saved my hungry stomach for their sizable brunch plates.Chapter 3 - N o m  N o m  N o mLet's get it started with the Millionaire's Bacon - Served right out of the kitchen, it was still piping hot.   Drizzled with maple syrup and in its own savory, bacon flavor, their bacon was thick, rich and grand!  It suits its name!  Each bite was sensational and a must order item!Frisco Benedict - You can't go wrong with Egg Benedicts!  Their hollandaise sauce and poached eggs were on point.  Their chicken mango sausage, needed more of a flavorful finishing touch.  I like the atypical bread that they substituted with, compared to the usual English muffin.  It gave it a different texture.  In addition, they had different types of potatoes that was served up on the side - taro, yam and the regular white.  They named it rainbow potatoes, which made it all the more creative.Last, but not least of my food entree adventures, was the Ribeye Omurice - I've never seen an Omelette made SO FLUFFY!  Well done!  The glazed sauce Omelette was topped over tossed up marinated ribeye, spinach, scallion mixed rice.  Their biscuit that was topped with a spoonful of generous butter, made this a bit country-styled.  With rainbow potatoes on the side, it was a grand, homely, tasty, unique dish.All in all, when the bill came with a book as a tab cover, I was more than happy to pay for this one - especially when my friend was still tuned out and grumpy from being woken up in the morning!  With their fun delightful, brunch entrees, friendly and attentive service and homely decor, I just needed to tell a Kitchen Story.  It is never The End, but to be continued about more on their other entrees here!Until next time... AH! My new favorite brunch spot in Castro, yes, its you.Despite walking up right smack in the middle of brunch, we were seated fairly quickly. After a glance at the menu I decided on Red and Green Benedict: Spinach, mushroom, roasted tomatoes and mango salsa on levain toast and yes -- it does taste as good as it sounds. Pair that with bottomless mimosas, good company, great conversation and you've got a perfect brunch. Oh and the awesome service to boot.Besides the great decor / vibe of this place, I loved that they give your check in old books. It was a cute little touch and I couldn't help but read a paragraph from the random page they placed it in. I can see how this place could pose a frustration if you have a big party -- luckily it was just us two -- but that wouldn't stop me from dragging the gang here in the future. I don't write a lot of Yelp Reviews - but when I do (sound like a commercial you've seen?) - its because I had an EXCEPTIONAL experience. I ordered the two eggs w/bacon breakfast and it came with what I can only describe as the BEST mushroom gravy sauce & cheddar biscuits I've ever had! I had 1 hotcake on the side and it was soooo light and fluffy and not doughy like many hotcakes I've had in the past. Overall a great experience from food thru service and ambiance. Highly recommend this spot :)! Kitchen Story takes the cake for my favorite brunch place in the city, for practical and subjective reasons: their food is tasty, to be sure, but they're also one of the only good brunch places in SF that have less than a 15 minute during normal brunch hours. Having been here twice now, I've tried the:* Millionaire's Bacon - This is a must, if you're any sort of fan of candied bacon: thick cut, somewhat smoky strips of sweet and savory candied bacon, that go wonderfully with their starchy dishes (see below).* Ribeye Omurice - Fluffy egg omelet over a bed of slightly spicy fried wild rice, rather than the usual rice-in-omelet setup. Tasty, and comes with a biscuit that goes great with their bacon.* Ricotta Hot Cakes - I'd heard of hot cakes before, but had never had occasion to actually try it before. Like pancakes, but less dense, and with a hint of sour cream or something otherwise tart. Not bad on their own, but great when had in conjunction with the bacon.In short, come eat here. Your stomach will thank you for not making it wait. (Just, don't, you know, all of you come, and turn this into all the other brunch joints in SF!)***Accessibility Info***Venue - Plenty of space inside the venue, so seating and maneuvering isn't much of an issue.Bathroom - Didn't try, so no comment. After seeing so many check ins at this place by my friends, I finally made plans with the BF and a good buddy to have brunch here. Located off 16th and Castro, Kitchen Story is just down the street from Market and falls on a corner so you can't miss it.Apparently they serve Asian fusion faire, so I was curious to say the least. We didn't have reservations so we had to put our names down, but like any cool place they let you drink on the sidewalk. Bloody Mary (with sake or soju, as it's beer/wine licensed only), check.We were able to sit down at the bar area and order. Everyone was raving about the Millionaire's Bacon, but unfortch for us, they were out! I ended up ordering the steak omerice (omelet rice) that came with rainbow potatoes. (So that settles it -- Kitchen Story is an amalgamation of Korean, Thai, and ""other Asian"" cuisine with some American classics.) The BF ordered a sausage eggs benedict and my friend opted for an omelet. The food came out relatively fast and was flavorful, IMO. I had the best dish out of the bunch, so I can't speak for my party. The energy was buzzing and I'd love to come back for their dinner, but would definitely make a reservation this time. I had heard such great things about Kitchen Story from my friend but sadly we both just thought it was kinda okay. I had the ricotta pancakes which were decent and my friend had a scramble with a biscuit on the side. I love a good biscuit but this one was really lacking the layers of buttery goodness. It was on the drier side and even dipping it in the gravy didn't really save it. The millionaire bacon however....saved the meal...it was beyond delicious!I'd like to mention that the service is really great as is the atmosphere so perhaps we just came on a off day. Long wait, ended up sitting outside in 40F weather, and the service was just OK.  That said the food was really solid.  Millionaire's bacon is maybe over-rated, but the biscuit and gravy were awesome. oh yeah!  This place is legit. we got here at 10am on a sunday and we were able to sit right down.  30 minutes later and there would have been a LONG wait.  the staff is on point...attentive, fast and thorough.  very well trained.the drinks came out super fast and the food followed after about 10 minutes. it was crazy fast. we quickly dived in and were super pumped we chose this spot.  we will definitely be back and i highly recommend the frisco benedict.  BAM! The Millionaire Bacon is everything you need in your life and then some. Point. Blank. End of story. Stumbled upon this place last week for lunch and loved it. As soon as I sat down at the table, one of the waiters brought me a glass of water and a pitcher for my table (yes!). The veggie burger was delicious. The staff was very friendly. Nice neighborhood spot. review of dinnerfound this thanks to yelp!we orderedfried chicken - children's plate - yummy! came with rice. (would have preferred some veggies to help children be healthy)Salmon with curry sauce. husband loved the curry sauceside of roti - who doesn't love roti.? it was instantly devoured. seemed like croissant - buttery.bok choy with garlic - LOVED it. had lemon which gave it tang that made it impossible to stop devouring. love it when a restaurant makes me eat veggies! braised meat with asian spices - reminds me of Taiwanese meat with spices. brought back good memories. not so healthy, but oh so yummyGREAT bathroom in that there were lots of hangers and I had my coat, purse. and 2 kids!!they should get a velvet curtain near the entrance to block the cold though... delicious food, good price, attentive staff.  Not skimpy size dishes.  Would definitely come here again and I certainly recommend it!  You can be causal there obv because it's SF, but the ambiance is just nice enough that it could be a good date place. I came here after church service and we had already put our name down before we went into church so we only waited about 10 minutes to get seated.The millionaire's bacon is what I HAD to try and it was really good for the first few bites.......then it got cloyingly sweet and didn't have any spice to even out the flavor profile. I poured some Tabasco on it and made it taste better. Overall, I thought everything was on the sweet side and I have a more savory palette. It was not a horrible experience here but I don't know when I would come back. Guys...at Kitchen Story they give you fried chicken...and then CURRY to dip it in!  This is amazing!  I've officially added curry to my list of Condiments for All Occasions.I wanted to try out a new restaurant on a weekday night and made a reservation for Kitchen Story.  We wandered over and were seated immediately.  I ordered the raspberry lemonade, which was tasty but pretty small (a mason jar filled with ice) (also, can we talk about how sick of mason jars I am?  I can't drink out of these things).My fiance and I shared the samosa appetizer, which was really good - all about the cilantro dipping sauce (I guess dipping sauces are the theme of this review).  I got the aforementioned fried chicken with yellow curry dipping sauce, named ""Finger-lickin'"" on the menu.  My apologies, but I definitely ate it with a fork!  The Finger-lickin was super super delicious, and my dinner mate looked on it with jealousy.  He had ordered the burger, which he would have been satisfied with had he not learned about the magic of dipping things in curry.The entree portions were fairly hefty, and I was stuffed - sadly, no room for dessert.  The check comes out between the pages of a paperback, which was a cute and creative touch.  I can't wait to come back - maybe brave the wait for brunch some weekend? Visited with a dear friend a couple weeks back, and enjoyed the ambiance, food (presentation was great) and service was superb; definitely coming back, and love this new found gem. My new favorite brunch spot in the city! Kitchen Story is everything you could hope for on a lazy Saturday morning. Great food, a quaint and charming atmosphere, friendly service, and delicious details that make this place very special. I came here specifically for the Millionaires Bacon, but was impressed by so much more. What is Millionaire's Bacon you ask? It's thick-cut bacon that's slow roasted in the oven for 4 hours with maple syrup and special spices. YES - sooo delicious and completely worth the couple extra bucks.I ordered the Deep Fried French Toast, stuffed with mascarpone cheese and topped with boysenberries and strawberries. Super decadent and filling. I had to take half of it home! If you don't want sweetness overload, I highly recommend going with the complete breakfast option where you can add eggs + bacon. And be sure to upgrade to Millionaires! You will NOT regret it. I washed my meal down with fresh raspberry lemonade, which comes in an adorable mason jar and is topped with a sprig of mint and a lemon wedge. It was quite perfect. I'm not exactly sure why this place is called ""Kitchen Story."" I feel like there's some deeper meaning behind that, but it seemed to all make sense when they brought us our check that was appropriately clothes-pinned to a paperback novel. It's a nice touch. They also have a few cookbooks perched around the restaurant, which adds to the homey feel. Even though it seems to get busy here, I was able to snag seats at the bar with no wait at 11:30am on a Saturday, and by noon, there were open tables available. The bar seating and fast turnout of the food makes this place feel half way between a diner and a restaurant. It's nice and bright inside and a perfect place for a date with your hubby, a catch-up session with a friend, or a nice meal with your family. Definitely coming back! And not just for the bacon! Was not worth the insane wait.  We were seated at the bar for reasons inexplicable - we were three and they wanted to give a table to a group of four who put their name down after us.  Just strange, and indicative of an extremely faulty system.  It's a wonder they have so many customers brave their brunch.Sitting at the bar put me off coming here ever again, especially because the plating station was visible, and their practices were iffy at best.  The person doing the plating used the same rag to clean/dab bacon as she did plates of vegetarian food, spreading the bacon grease far and wide. Our water glasses had thick rings from shoddy dishwashing, and the water smelled of fish.  And having eaten at Sweet maple and Blackwood - the menu here was nothing to write home about.  Left feeling a bit disgusted and overall unimpressed. best bacon ever.  everything is good.  no complains Decided to come in last minute about two weeks ago.Parking was painful and the wait was manageable.  Staff was friendly and service was overall a-okay.  Saturday morning brunch is busy as can be expected so it is what it is.  We had the french toast, the pancakes, the chicken and was it the prime rib omelet?  Something steak omelet.  Everything was satisfactory although the french toast seemed more like a dessert rather than a breakfast meal.  too sweet and seriously deep fried.would likely come back to try other things...  Make reservations though! I love trying new places when I visit SF and Kitchen Story was a hit! I ordered a omelet and my friend got the French toast!! Both extremely delicious!! And of course we both had to get the millionaires bacon!! Cute place, long wait. Came here with a group of 4 for Sunday brunch and waited 50 minutes. We tried a whole bunch of food, the millionaire's bacon, different types of scrambles, ribeye omurice, and the mascarpone stuffed deep fried french toast with fresh berries. The definite winners were the french toast and the omurice. I usually love eggs and the scrambles were fluffy but too much cheese that congealed in a thick layer on top of the eggs. French toast was amazing, glad that we got one for the table to share because I don't think I can finish all that sweetness by myself. The variety of potatoes on the side was a nice cute touch. Would come back to try dinner or for brunch again if we could beat the crowd. We were recommended here by our dear friends and I will say it was ok, nothing to rave about. We ordered the millionaire bacon & that was probably the best thing we ordered. We also got some crab cakes that we nothing special but the salsa served on it was good. My husband ordered the finger licking chicken & it was pretty good, I ordered the pork chop and wished I had of ordered anything else because it was gross to me. Our whole meal was really expensive for the amount of food we got ( 12 dollars for TWO strips of bacon) but the service was excellent. I'd return if a friend wanted to go but I wouldn't request it on my own. Amazing food! I had the Big Boy sandwich (I think that's what it was called...), which had scallops wrapped in their amazing Millionaire's Bacon. Looking forward to my next visit!Update - 01/07/2013:I got a pretty severe case of food poisoning from my visit two days ago. Spent all of yesterday in the ER. I don't pin food poisoning on any restaurant unless I'm sure -- the people who dined with me that night also had symptoms, but not to my extent.I got the spicy tiger prawn soup. I won't be returning here. My first visit, as from my initial review, still stands as a good meal in my memory, but I'm concerned about cleanliness. I was really surprised that the food was so great! although, it could be a bit cheaper. it seems as if fusion always adds another $3 per entrée. (also, it was a bit off putting to get sparkling water served out of a plastic bottle. im all for down home style...but at a down home pricetag. okerrr.)service was superb. waiter was super cute. and our city supervisor was dining at the table down from us! what a special treat! I hear its amazing for brunch too. definitely get the tuna ceviche with avocado and the fried chicken. the bacon is overrated but still quite delish. finally, the portions are generous. a shared app and a shared entrée will do the trick (and save on the bill!) This place has won the title in my little foodie heart as best brunch in the city! It's a really magical place - despite its growing popularity, I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated, and these were during peak hours too. Crazy! And everyone is so friendly and inviting and warm. It's amazing.Millionaire's bacon. Hell. Yes. I'm not the biggest fan of bacon normally (I know I know, terrible, but meat shouldn't be so crunchy??) but this stuff is thick cut marinated perfection, beautifully glazed meaty glory. It reminds me of Chinese style pork jerky - the sweet and savory combination kills me. Cue drooling everywhere.All of the food is presented so beautifully here, with colorful garnishes and motifs. Brunch food is not always the most attractive, but they really go out of their way here to make everything very visually appealing. It's that extra consideration and attention to detail for every dish that really makes Kitchen Story special. I sat at the counter the last time I was here and the care that the chefs and servers take in making sure everything is presentable is really lovely.  Things I've eaten here include the ridiculous French Toast and a wagyu burger with bacon which was probably the best burger I've ever eaten. I came for dinner once and had salmon, which was unfortunately on the dry side. But that aside, everything else is stellar! Get the 'Dirty Chai' - chai with a shot of soju and a shot of espresso?! It's as good as it sounds and more.They give you your check in old used books. Totally unnecessary but I LOVE IT. Dreamy drooly sigh. The best hamurger I have ever had.  My friends BLT was amazing!  I'm from LA and want to fly to SF just to get a burger now! Came here for lunch with my brother and enjoyed everything we ordered but our Scrunchy Salad. Only because it has mint leaves and a bit gingery taste in it that I normally don't like. Can't really go wrong with any of their orders but I had the Frisco Poached Eggs and loved every bit of it. The potatoes were delicious and came in such a variety such as sweet potatoes, the prole potatoes, etc. Yum! Will be back. Love how they give you the check with a book attached to keep in theme with their restaurant too. Portions are super filling and they serve drinks in mason jars ^_^ I'm sorry to give this place 1star but even though my friend enjoyed his deep- fried French toast, my egg white scramble smothered with cheddar cheese was airplane quality food. It was awful. It was watery and I'm pretty sure it came from a cartoon of egg- whites. My 8year- old nephew can make better eggs than this. Sorry but this place is a brunch no-go for me. Amazing pork shank.  I loved the windows out to the neighborhood, it was off the main beat but close enough to walk to the Castro.  Romantic - yes.  Service was amazing.  Oddly, we were one of only 4 tables of people.  It was a Thursday, so I don't know if that had anything to do with it being a Thursday night.  Had there been more people, the service may not have been as attentive.  Check this place out for sure. This restaurant totally feels like something straight off of pinterest - suuuper classy/home-y, really really pretty. There were not many tables ... but luckily my friend and I came right when they opened for dinner and got a table right away! :) We ordered the: + BIG EYE : scallops wrapped in bacon with really good sweet potato chips and a mango salsa. - Much like the reviews below mention, their bacon is SOOO yummy. + BURGAH BOY: maple patty with bacon and vermont white cheddar. - Also REALLY good! I thought the patty was pretty favorful... or maybe it was the bacon .. either way, it just worked. Good thing both things we ordered were delicious or else we would have not been able to justify the pricey-ness. As good as this place is - it is not somewhere you want to be eating at every night.The dishes were decorated really prettily =D The service was super attentive; I don't think our cups ever reached half empty...AND their bathrooms were clean - ehehhe.  I really want to come back for the breakfast/brunch menu!Although I will mention, it was a challenge to resist Ike's right next door... What a sweet corner (literally) to brunch in the Castro. Have you ever heard of deep fried french toast? I had not until I came here. Oh wait, it's not just deep friend but also stuffed with a mound of mouthwatering mascarpone cheese topped with fresh fruit and sprinkled with powdered sugar. This thing is massive so sharing is encouraged. Get it, you won't regret it! This please is over rated.   I food was so so however... the millionaires bacon was helluva yummy.   The service was not consistent and actually poor.  Place will not last with just 1 great dish and poor service. I totally did not expect this to be a thai fusion place from the reviews.The decor was good, the food was great and the atmosphere was nice. They had a few wines and we had a good time."|4|92|4|Routine Inspection| Moderate risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 5/7/2014 ] Improper thawing methods   [ date violation corrected: 5/6/2014 ] Moderate risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 5/6/2014 ] Improper thawing methods   [ date violation corrected: 5/7/2014 ]|GOOD: no inspection needed
Kitchen Story 1|4.0|Breakfast & Brunch in San Francisco, CA|$11-30|813|1|4.00561797752809|" Had brunch here on a Saturday. This place gets pretty crowded, (there was a 30 minute wait or so when we left).  Luckily, we got seated as soon as we got there. Definitely try their hotcakes and french toast - quite delicious. Also, they have something called their Millionaire Bacon. I'd recommend trying it. It actually tastes very similar to Filipino Tocino if you've ever had it. It's basically bacon smothered in maple syrup! The servers were attentive and we didn't have wait too long for our food. I would definitely come back. Had the Frisco Benedict. Excellent combination of flavors. Just wish it was warmer.Service was solid and we were seated immediately for a 10 am Sunday brunch. Everything was delicious!  Our boss took us here for an after work team dinner.  The place was packed on a Tuesday!  Everything was so yummy. Millionaires bacon was amazing, and crispy chicken dish just melted in my mouth. Mahi appetizers...I dont usually get into SF except for work but would live to take my husband here. Great for brunch and for dinner. came here for dinner last night for my lady's birthday. it was a monday evening at 8pm and they were not busy at all. so if youre trying to avoid a line...there is nothing i can say about the MILLIONAIRE'S BACON that hasnt already been said. it was a genuine treat. first you smell the aroma of seared swine wafting from the kitchen. i could bathe in that smell. then it arrives and it is everything you could possibly hope for and more. by itself, it is a treat. together with the asparagus, it is a nice change of taste. very well executed dish.we also had the CASTRO TOWER appetizer, which was very delicious. the fish and avocado were both fresh and plentiful. on top of the wonton chips, they were an amazing combination. i will be ordering this again.for an entree, she had the BURGAH BOY. the wagyu beef was very very very tender and juicy. melt in your mouth. cooked perfectly. topped with MILLIONAIRE'S BACON on a brioche bun. such a treat. the potato wedges are also ridiculously tasty and crispyi had the pad thai with prawns with NO BEAN SPROUTS. cus gwoss. not bad. no complaints. but the other dishes outshined mine by far. next time, i want to try this sandwich that i dont see on the yelp menu. but it was a scallop sandwich topped with MILLIONAIRE'S BACON on ciabatta. that is something i can support.for beverages, m'lady had the fruit punch, which was tasty. i had the last beer on the list - some type of brun (brown) ale. nutty and coffee-tasting. just my type of brown ale. they comp'd the salted caramel gelato since it was m'lady's birthday. that was nice. all in all, we got out of there with full bellies at a cost of $75 (includes generous tip). service was top notch. decor was nice. will definitely be returning to support this fine establishment. THANKS KITCHEN STORY!! I can happily say that I've been here for both weekend brunch and dinner.Brunch:+ Millionaire's way bacon ($12): two thick slices per order. Heavenly. Perfection.+ Artichoke watercress pesto benedict ($13): pure genius concoction. I have never had an egg benedict dish with artichoke or watercress but the combination works. The pesto hollandaise sauce was a nice change to the ordinary hollandaise sauce, too.+ California burger ($14): awesome burger. When the burger arrived to the table, I was shocked at how big the burger was. I couldn't take my eyes off of it! The burger is made of a wagyu beef patty, dressed up with grilled onions, tomato slice, avocado, sprouts, arugula, mild goat cheese, and a light balsamic glaze. If that description does not make you drool, I don't know what will.Dinner+ Millionaire's way bacon ($12): two thick slices per order. Same comment as above.+ Ahi scoops ($12): the presentation was just damn lovely. Each order consists of 4 scoops of seared ahi tuna on top of cucumber seaweed salad, and crispy yams.+ Mango salad with grilled tiger prawns ($12): divine dish. It's light and refreshing - the mangoes were ripe, the prawns were cooked perfectly (glistening but not oily), and the lime dressing gave the salad a tangy taste.+ ""Burgah"" Boy ($18): I didn't have a chance to try this dish but my friends raved about it. However, I had a chance to try some of the fried potatoes that accompanied the burger. They were crispy and delicious! Addicting almost.+ Green curry with tofu and rice ($12): pleasantly spicy and sweet at the same time. This is probably one of the best green curries I have ever tasted.+ Side of spicy eggplant ($10): YUM. Eggplant done right. Not mushy or greasy. A friend proclaimed Kitchen Story as her favorite brunch spot in the city (having gone here over 10 times) so naturally, I had to check it out.First off, there is free street parking that doesn't involve parallel parking along Sachez! Great start.We were seated almost immediately and our food arrived more quickly than expected as well. I chose the Primavara Omelette which was a beast of an omelette. Definitely filling. The plate also came with a delightful jalapeno cheese biscuit and a beautifully decorated cup of berries. On top of that, we ordered a side of the Millionaire's Bacon..which was PHENOMENAL. It's pricey at $6.50 for two thick slices, but even frugal me would say that it's worth the splurge. Tasted great with my omelette as well as the biscuit.Can't wait to come back and try the bennies and sandos!PROTIP: They take up to 3 credit cards. Had the most wonderful dinner here!  Such a cute spot, servers were spot on and so super nice, and the food was truly excellent.  Lots of gluten free options and great ambiance.  Had the salmon curry, he had the beef soup, shared the ahi cups.  Portions were great and cooked perfectly.  We cannot wait to come back and try more of the menu. Get ready to wait for good food! This place is always packed but they have an excellent brunch.  I am not a fan of pork but I will inhale their millionaire's bacon any day of th week. Lunch and dinner items are pretty good too. They overcooked my burger once but it's okay.. I am a forgiving girl since everything thing else is pretty awesome. The place is very cute and the staff are super nice! We were in town for the day and wanted some brunch, and this place had the best reviews on yelp, so we try it...Really? 4 stars? The service was very awkward, the food was alright, nothing special, the prices were a bit outrageous for the quality of food. I ordered a Bloody Mary and did not finish it (this has never happened before), that's how bad it was. The place was cute and packed.  The servers and host were friendly.  But the service was SLOW.  I had to ask someone to get our sever so we could order because after sitting there for a long while, we still hadn't been approached by anyone. -The coffee was good. -The mimosas were DELICIOUS and strong.  I think they were the highlight of the meal-My Frisco Benedict was absolutely amazing.  The chicken sausage was on point. -My boyfriend thought his Frisco scramble was mehhhh.  He indicated it wasn't bad and got the job done, but nothing to write home about. I'd go there again if it was less crowded.  Glad I tried it though. Terrible experience here. After going through the menu with the waitress to make sure that all food we were served was gluten free (my girlfriend is allergic to wheat) we were served beef that was marinated in soy sauce. An allergic reaction started and we had leave quickly to get Benadryl. She was sick all night and it completely ruined our evening, although a more serious reaction was averted. This place needs to understand that food allergies are not a joke. We tried the Omurice, deep fried french toast, and the millionaire's bacon.First, the omurice comes in a huge serving, I didn't even get to finish it and I eat a lot! so yeah, good price for the size of the serving.The french toast was a little hard to slice. it was okay.The millionaire's bacon reminds me of the Filipinos' tocino. It was good but I suggest getting one order for two people unless you really really love pork.It was a good meal, will def come back! :) Nomnomnom! Boy was I a happy camper after leaving this place. I would say, probably top 10 in my books for brunch places in SF so far. I came here after eating only 2 hours before so I was exactly super hungry, which would've been nice because then I would've wanted to get a different plate without worrying about having leftovers. I decided to order a simple breakfast with two eggs, chicken mango sausage, rainbow potatoes, and their own cheddar biscuit. I decided on the chicken mango sausage because it was different, something I wouldn't get from other places. I really enjoyed them. It came out as a big patty and it had subtle hints of mango. The biscuits were pretty good. I enjoyed the way it was seasoned and texture. I really wanted I order the famous French toast or the omelette but when I saw it come out for other people, I knew it would've been too much food for me. Will for sure come back with a bigger appetite next time. And props to filling our bottomless mimosas before our cups ever got emptied. Thanks! Our daughters took us out for my BD dinner. The restraunt ambiance was nice. However my food was blend. My wife had beef dish which was so salty. When she came home she was having stomachache and threw up all night. This will be our first and last trial for this place. Right after i wrote this review I was having stomachache and diarrhea. Whoever goes there be careful. Kitchen Story is the reason I got a Yelp account.I went to Kitchen Story in September and have been meaning to write this review for the longest time.  So therefore, some details might be fuzzy.  Overall, my first trip to San Francisco did not go as planned.  All the restaurants I intended to try were busy, closed early, or no parking (as I soon learned would be the case for many of the restaurants).  Kitchen Story was a wonderful accident.After searching through Yelp, my good friends who live in San Francisco now but are from Hawaii found Kitchen Story and warned me of the wait.  We had one person put in our name for the wait while we found parking which is an excellent idea.Skip past the waiting since it was crowded but I expected a much longer wait.  The decor is beyond adorable and the wait staff was amazingly attentive.  Word of advice: you will not know what to order if you sit at the counter and watch all the food come out of the kitchen.Get the bottomless mimosas.  Not only are you making your money back by getting three of the glasses filled (yes, this was calculated prior to ordering them) but they are delicious.  Okonomiyaki pancake?  Who would've thought?  It was soooooo good.  Side order of millionaire's bacon?  Why yes.  It was fat and juicy but soft and tender.  I was on vacation so of course pay the extra for something called MILLIONAIRE'S bacon.  I could go into more detail but the fact the place was so good I can recall the amazing-ness of the food months later says enough for me.  The next time I'm in San Francisco, Kitchen Story will be on my list and no longer an unknown discovery thanks to Yelp. Saturday Brunch.  The experience didn't start off very well.  I put my name on the waiting list.  After about 35 minutes, I started to notice that parties arriving after us (of similar size) were being seated.  I checked the waiting list and noticed there was a line drawn through my name.  We were waiting about 3-4 paces outside the front door, and I watched for the host/hostess every time he/she came out to collect the parties.  I informed the host of the situation to which he scribbled a green highlighter over my name on the waiting list.  Later, two more like-sized parties were seated.  I then talked to the hostess.  She and the host conferred, possibly discussing the meaning of green highlighter.  Afterwards, she acknowledged that we would be seated next.  We were finally seated after about a 50 minute wait.  Frustrating.Service: 3 starsFood came out quickly, coffee was regularly topped off.  Waiting list system needs work.Food: 3.5 starsFranciscan Scramble was just okay.  Rainbow potatoes tasted as if sitting out for a while.  Butter croissant turned out to be a dry and flavorless biscuit.  Ribeye Omurice was pretty good with nice flavor.  Millionaire's Bacon was very good.Decor: 4 starsThe place is visually impressive.  It has a clean, homey feel with lots of wood finishes and furnishings.  The tables are tightly spaced and it gets really, really loud during peak dining periods.  Low-talkers beware.  There is also bar seating and outdoor seating with heat lamps.Overall: 3.4 stars (weighted average)If the food had been better, I might have been less annoyed by the wait list experience.  Some places have an off day, so I'm all for giving second chances. 4 starts yelpers? I think not.. They serve sweet potato chips as a starter - mehThe fried calamari was sooo oily - but the aoli was yummyWe ordered the green curry - the guy said it wasn't very spicy - he was wrong! It was SPICY.. so he told us to order something else.. Oh I forgot we also got the roti - ewww it was soo greasy!We then ordered the Pad Thai - it was just ok.. It was pretty packed, maybe they were off last night OR it's so new that people are swarming to try it.. I might give it another try but for brunch next time.. Stay tuned.. The place is very cute, with a lot of rustic wooden furniture.  The staff is super warm and friendly, allowing us to sit before our full party was there, and never rushed us to leave.The food, however, was only okay.  The millionaire's bacon comes with 2 strips for $12.  At a glance, that seems very little for the price.  But its buttery sweetness will soon consume you and you realize that no one needs to eat one whole strip at a time anyway, so there is actually plenty to share for that $12.  It's definitely decadent and something that's quite out of the ordinary, but I don't know if I necessarily would crave it once the experience is over.My cod with bok choy was quite disappointing. I thought I was getting a nice piece of black cod, but the fish I got was mushy and didn't embody any of that magical texture a decent piece of black cod should have.  And there was no flavor to it. The bok choy, however, was really tasty, and went well with a bowl of jasmine rice. Nothing my friends ordered seem so alluring that made me want to try.  Most plates look like what you'd get at a local Thai restaurant but bigger and pricier. Perhaps their brunch option is better. I waited a week to write this review. Why did I wait? Because I really wanted to think about my experience and make sure that I wrote it when I wasn't still thinking about the millionaire's bacon.I'm still thinking about it.Kitchen Story is ridiculously packed, even at 11 AM on a Saturday, which I feel is the start of brunch, but apparently not here. We ordered bottomless mimosas, which were strong and delicious. Because I'm me and I'm not big on breakfast, I ordered the New England burger, which came with a maple syrup Wagyu patty, millionaire's bacon, arugula, and white cheddar. I'm not a bacon fan, but I'd seen so many reviews talking about the millionaire's bacon that I had to try it. And if you have a sweet tooth, which I do, the millionaire's bacon is a dream. Thick cut bacon laced with fatty goodness, basically dripping with maple syrup. It doesn't sound good, but it's like being in a really rich, decadent dream. If you only eat one thing at Kitchen Story, make it the millionaire's bacon. It's worth every single cent of the hype.My burger was pretty tasty, but the star was the millionaire's bacon, and honestly, between the sweetness and richness of the bacon and the maple syrup patty, ti was a little too sweet for me. Tasty, but I definitely needed to take some breaks, and I have a huge sweet tooth.Kitchen Story is a true gem. Just make sure you get there before 11, or you'll be waiting a mighty long time (but it will still be worth it). I love brunch. I love Korean flava. So naturally, I was drawn to Kitchen Story.Definitely a brunch go-to, so go earlier if you, especially on weekends. Kitchen Story is a small restaurant right next to Ike's. Long line corner all day! But with great reason.This rustic, hipstery, asian fusion hot spot has great sweet and savory dishes. My favorites include the Ribeye omurice and the mascapone stuffed french toasts. The ribeye omurice is essentially eggs over bomb ass asian rice with ground beef and other veggie fixings and sauce. The french toast is as sweet as it sounds - would suggest if you get the meal with it to NOT get the millionaire's bacon, unless you down for some quadruple diabetes in yo mouth. The millionaire's bacon is greeeeaaatttt, but caramelized and sweet as ferngully. Get regular bacon or sausage for that palette abalance, if ya naymsayin. Get the millionaire's bacon paired with something else, and I think you'll get the best flava flav out of it. Service is quiet fast, probably because of the crazy rush. Sadly, no reservations for brunch, but they can be made over the phone for dinner.  Hopefully I get to have a chance to try their evening menu as well!An awesome find forsure! I came here about two months ago, but whenever I think brunch, i always think about kitchen story.food is delicious with an asian twist in every dish. I had the frisco benedict with the rainbow potatoes and being a big potato fan, i was even impressed with the crunchy/softness inside texture of the purple potatoes. the benedict was especially good and filling. my gf ordered the french toast and i must've ate at least half of hers because it was so good. However, the main reason I think of this resturant all the time is because of their millionaires bacon. Theres no proper way to describe it except that its the best bacon ive ever had. Im not even a huge bacon fan, (i always pick sausage over bacon) but I would eat this bacon anytime anyday anywhere! haha its really to die for. delicious food. cool vibe. servers are attentive and friendly. cant wait to come back for seconds The East Meets West was awesome; the pork shank was delicious. Don't eat the leaves that wrap around the rice... The tuna cups were also tasty. My dining partner's eggplant was a bit oily.  I want to return for the Mieng salad and famous bacon!It appears as though Blackwood in the Marina is the exact same restaurant and menu, but with a different name.... Have been twice, once for brunch, once for dinner.The service leaves something to be desired, but the food is so consistently good!! Millionaire's bacon is a must-try, no doubt. These guys do brunch right. Fantastically fluffy omelettes with the perfect distribution of filling in every bite (and they don't skimp on extras either). The freshest fruit. I even put away most of my cheddar & chive biscuit, which I usually avoid as they tend to leave my mouth feeling like a drought-stricken field. Very reasonable prices given the quantity and quality of the food, the ambiance, and the service. I'll be back! I am seriously IN LOVE with this place! I ordered the deep fried French toast with scrambled eggs and the millionaires bacon! Mmmmm. The best bacon and French toast I've ever had! The place is lovely with ambience.  I love the decor but of course we came here to try the food.  We had the salmon with curry, salmon was a bit overcooked and curry wasn't spicy; the Pacific cod was good but too peppery; pad see ew was good as my friend has allergies and ordered it without garlic and no MSG and it was sweet which she liked and I had the finger lickin which was tasty and I liked the curry dip as well.  They also served us some yam chips to start us off.  Those were crispy and tasty.  All in all it was good.  I think if I am ever in the area again, I would like to try their breakfast which is what they are known for here. Awesome place for nice relaxing brunch. Love the atmosphere and food. Quiet enough for nice conversation as well. Me and my friend came here for brunch this past Sunday.  It was roughly a 30-35 min wait and we sat at the bar. I ordered the deep fried French toast with eggs and millionaire's bacon. I wouldn't say it was the best French toast I had. The fried part of the toast was a bit too hard for me to chew (I expected more fluffiness). Thebacon was also too sweet for my taste but my friend loved it. My friend ordered the ribeye omelette. In my opinion, it tasted way better than the French toast.  The omelette was perfect (light and fluffy).  The rainbow potatoes that came with it was good as well. His dish also came with rice and ribeye underneath the omelette. Overall, it was a pretty good dish. Since we sat at the bar, we saw a number of dishes that came out. I would definitely come back to try the mom's Benedict and possibly the bulgogi burger. oh.  my.  god.  i loved this place!  yummy food, great service, fun neighborhood.  my girlfriends and i are picky (they are just picky and I'm gluten free and dairy free) and this fusion food left us all happy! i will def be going back. This place was quite tasty and I loved its location - right on the corner of a very residential street... made it seem a lot cozier / quainter. My food was decent but I would HIGHLY recommend the bacon - thick and delicious... you DEFINITELY get your money's worth with that. Dirty chai wasn't too shabby either! Showed up with my entire family who was in town for a wedding and we were thrilled with the service and the food. The burgers were to die for! I also got a scramble that was amazing- white cheddar and spinach. The portions were really large, (which I was thankful for... our family is not from SF, and are used to being stuffed when they leave a restaurant, and they made sure no one left hungry!!!!!). The staff was super sweet and attentive, and I plan on coming back on a weekday to try some of their salads and burgers. Well done Kitchen Story! I came here with a couple of girlfriends on a Saturday afternoon. We waited approximately 15 minutes and were seated at the bar which gave us a prime viewing spot for all the dishes that were served. I ordered the poached green/red eggs with a fruit cup, my friend got the japanese pancake, and my other friend ordered the poached eggs as well. We were very impressed with the quality of the food! It was absolutely delicious. I am loyal to Zazie, but this place is definitely worth going to especially if you live in the Castro/Mission part of town. If you're vegetarian check out the green/red poached eggs -they were phenomenal! I love this place! Came here twice, food was always yummy. Service is always great. Millionaire bacon melts in the mouth. It's definitely not your ordinary bacon! I love their French toast. I'll be back soon!!!! Get any dish with Millionaire Bacon in it. The name should speak for itself. Their egg dishes and potatoes are miraculous. If you're brunching it up, you can beat the crowd if you arrive at 10:30 or earlier. Plenty of counter seating. Amazing millionaire bacon! Amazing mascarpone stuffed French toast! Love the place, the decor.... It's really homee! There fresh raspberry lemonade is really fresh! Def a must....you won't regret it! You might want to go early because it gets quite busy after 10 am on the weekends... The Sweet and I celebrated a friend's birthday here. We liked the menu - a nice mix of flavors and unexpected treats. The Millionaire Bacon is worth the hype - if you like rich, deep, sweet, salty flavor. The asparagus is a nice, fresh, green foil to the bacon. The wine selection is good. We tried a lot of different dishes and were not disappointed.Our only complaint was the dessert - our friend ordered mango & sticky rice. It came in a nice presentation with mango dice on top, but the mango was completely green and not tasty. The Servers took it back, no charge, and were very friendly about it. What makes up for just a little bit above average food? Service & Food Presentation. These 2 elements are ever present in the Kitchen Story. We went here for brunch and I must say that the portions are HUGE! I tried the Franciscan omelet coz it says on the menu ""mango chicken"". Unfortunately, I have not tasted the mango or any tanginess on it :( My friend ordered the waffles and it's ok. My other friends ordered the burger which according to them is good :). I will still go back here if I need a very filling meal but for taste, I will consider somewhere else. PS- Oh, the bathroom lights I think are loose!! I asked the staff to check it for me and he grabbed a broom and nudged the lights! I keep on praying it won't turn off while I'm peeing!! Lol!!! pleasant service, prices good. food good, not great. noisy. Woohoo! As good as it gets!Millionaire's Way -- I'm still drooling from itSummer String Bean -- light and crunchy with a light dipping sauceI had the pan-seared tilapia -- it had good flavors but it was a little dry, probably wouldn't get it again, but it was plated really nicely.My party got the Finger-lickin' -- I wish I had gotten this. The dipping sauce is like crack.... so when you order it's like ""Hi can I get some crack please?""They also got the grilled wagyu beef noodle soup -- you can get it as spicy as you want it. I didn't think the medium was very spicy but as my party said ""well you're Korean""... touche friends. the service was amazing, everyone was really accommodating and I'll definitely be back! I've been here quite a handful of times and coming from a picky eater like me, this is a PLUS!Parking: Street, but free if you are lucky.  Wait: decent, about 30 minutes.  You can stare at the people who are waiting in line next door at Ike's and listen to the employees coming out to direct them to ""not block the streets.""  Entertaining to some extentFood: Well, I am not a fave of bacon (I know, who doesn't like bacon), but I HAD to order the Millionaire's Bacon and see what the craze is about.  ODG (Oh dear God) was it good.  It is like they drenched this pig in sugar, forced it to drink sugar, and roll itself in ...sugar.  It was delightful :-)  I also had their French toast, which I must admit is nothing like the regular French toast one would make.  However, this my friend, was divine.  What else is good, you asked?  The Franciscan Scramble with their colorful rainbow potatoes which is crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.  The chicken sausage, which I think that chicken made some crazy love with that pig from above.  It was sweet, yet salty all rolled up together as one.  Their burgers whichever one you choose off the menu, was ginormous.  You better practice opening your mouth for this (again, don't be nasty).Overall: 4- keep it up, Kitchen Story! Go for brunch - obvi. Just found out from sitting at the bar today that this place has an 100 out of 100 Health Score. Impressive! Their counters are indeed squeaky clean.As for the food: There were three of us today, and we got three different permeations of a veggie sandwich: the veggie burger, the green panini, and the grilled veggie morning melt. All of them were packed with fresh avocados, arugula, bell pepper, you name it...so good, with generous portions of side salad or potato wedges. And of course we had to get a side of Millionaire's Bacon. It's like candy. Do it.I've never tried to make a reservation for brunch before but looks like they take it. We waited about 35 minutes today and had lovely service. Coffee mug never went empty. This place is solid in my book. Went for brunch, previously had dinner here.  Just can't get excited about the place.  Dinner was OK (3-stars), but everything struck us as slightly sweet, where things should be savory.  Even the ""famous"" Millionaire's Bacon, which admittedly is intended to be a *little* sweet, is just too sticky sweet to be really great.  More like candy dessert than meaty appetizer.Brunch was pretty meh too. I went decadent and got the fried french toast, expecting a french-toast-like item. Instead it was like a hard-fried ball of tasteless dough with some cheesy goo in the middle.  Not dead awful, but I failed to see the appeal (2-stars).  My partner got an Omurice dish; much better, basically a savory and spicy fried rice with egg on top.  Not fully authentic, but pretty good (4-stars).Service first time was very good (4-stars) but it wasn't very busy.  Brunch was busy and service suffered - no coffee refills until the check came, for example (2-stars). Food: 4 starsService: 5 stars (our server was very attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly)Ambiance: 4 stars (as noted by other reviewers, it gets a little loud inside)We went for dinner and had the:- Millionaire's Way: Millionaire's Bacon, grilled organic asparagus and homemade smoky Maple syrup sauce.- Big Eye Sandwich: Pan-seared U-10 scallop wrapped with our famous Millionaire Bacon, Cibatta roll, garlic spread, arugula, avocado, sweet yam chip, Mango salsa and spicy Dijon Mustard.- Wild King Salmon: Pan seared, grilled organic asparagus, bell peppers, basil, red curry sauce, jasmine rice.- Granny in Town: Mascarpone French Toast, Whiskey Chocolate Sauce, Chocolate Ice Cream, and Whipped Cream.- Black Sesame Gelato- A glass of their Pinot Grigio and MalbecI would highly recommend the Big Eye Sandwich, Pinot Grigio, and their Granny in Town.  The Black Sesame Gelato was delicious, but a little heavy.  The only low-light of the meal was the slightly dry salmon.  Otherwise, the food was great and we'll definitely be coming back again! The millionaires bacon should be called the billionaires bacon. Food is delicious. Definitely one of the best brunchs in SF. Worth the wait! Went on Labor Day and there was a line but the tables turned but fast. I went with my partner and we both agree we'll be back.We started with a michelada and bloody Mary. In my humble opinion, the bloody Mary was the BEST I've had so far. Perfect balance of salty, spicy, tomato deliciousness. We had the Bulgogi burger, grilled veggie panini, and shared the deep fried mascarpone stuffed French toast. Both entrees were delicious, but the French toast stole the show and definitely made to share. I can't image how I'd feel consuming that entire portion solo! We definitely left with food babies but enjoyed every morsel. Service was quick and friendly. Millionare's Bacon = worth every penny. Very accomodating of a large group. Friendly and fast service. Delicious food. A must try! I'm not sure if it was just the night my friend and I came in, but for some reason, things either needed to be seasoned more or seasoned a lot less! Salt is crucial! Crucial, I say! Alright, I'll calm down now...The yam chips they give as a starter were delicious. The calamari was also nicely prepared... though it could use a bit more salt. Dipping sauces are crucial, and theirs was on point. My friend's dish, ""Finger Lickin'"", was finger lickin' good (womp womp). The chicken had a nice batter. I like that they put pickled cucumber on the side to finish off an otherwise heavy dish. For my entree, the ""Dancing Queen"" ('cause I'm a dancing queeeen hayyy! We *were* on our way to hitting the clubs after dinner. Duh.)... oooof so this is where I thought they went a little crazy with the salt. The steak (which I ordered medium) was more like medium rare, but hey, it was delicious anyway. (Plus one person's definition of ""medium"" is another person's ""rare,"" right??) The sauce's flavor was delicious: sweet, spicy, and unfortunately over-seasoned. The string beans (which reminded me of a Thai dish) were slightly spicy and cooked well (not too crunchy, not too soft). My favorite on that plate, aside from the meat itself, was the ginger rice. Glorious! ""Can you share that recipe with me please? kthxbye!""We liked the ambiance. It was low key with high-brow as well as comfort food. I liked that the menu had some ""California"" or ""New American"" foods along with pan-Asian dishes. I'd give it another try -- probably for brunch. That might change my ""meh"" review of Kitchen Story. What a great place to have breakfast. I remember the old Port Cafe... Then Grub...then Tangerine... Seems like this was the cursed corner for restaurants... I like Kitchen Story. Nice updated contemporary interior. Lots of energy (and noise level) to bring you alive in the morning/early afternoon. Good service, and good food.I had the deep fried mascarpone French toast, with a couple eggs, and that much talked about millionaires bacon... Excellent on all points. Really. I will return to try other features! I've only been here once with a friend for dinner and I look forward to coming back. We came here on a Friday night without reservations and had to wait a bit for us to get seated while they sorted out a problem regarding reserved tables but we got seated in roughly 5 minutes which is more than acceptable and the server was very nice. The decor of the place is also really nice, feels comfy and lighted well enough to not feel like you're eating in the dark but also not so bright that you will be distracted by other customers.We started with the crab cakes and they were really good. It didn't taste like they used very much filler (which is always a big plus). There was two crab cakes (making it great for sharing) with a sauce that I couldn't quite make out what exactly it was but it was delicious nonetheless. The only issue I had with this dish was the particular plating; the arugula was sandwiched between the crab cakes and the mango salsa was on top and the sauce on the bottom. Although the plating looked great, it wasn't very practical when it came to actually sharing it because taking the top crab cake would mean taking most of the mango salsa, then we had to remove the arugula before taking the bottom crab cake which had most of the sauce. Aside from that issue though, it was delicious.I ordered the Burgah Boy while my friend ordered the Finger Lickin' (fried chicken). My burger was cooked to perfection and the potato wedges were surprisingly good. I usually don't expect very much from fried potato sides (fries, wedges, etc.) but man these were good; they were very crispy on the outside and meaty on the inside and seasoned well. The ""Millionaire"" bacon is definitely unique in its taste in a good way; it was a very thick cut of bacon, a tad salty with a sweetness that compliments the burger surprisingly well. I can't say that I would want to order this burger again because sweet bacon is just a bit odd in flavor for me but it's definitely worth trying if you haven't tried it before. The burger was still good, it just wasn't what I want in a burger if that makes any sense.My friend's fried chicken looked so good, it made me regret getting the burger, yes, it looked THAT good. I didn't try his chicken though but it looked like it was cooked perfect; fully cooked on the inside while still moist. It came with the aforementioned potato wedges as well as a stellar yellow curry dipping sauce. I tried the curry and I was ready to drink it! This is definitely something I would get the next time I come here.My friend also had two glasses of wine that I didn't try and the total came out to about $73 without tip. Over all, I really enjoyed my experience here; the servers were friendly and fast, good food, and good ambiance. Definitely see myself coming back. Kitchen Story is incredibly cute - whoever was in charge of the interior design did a spot on job with all the decor. However the food was just okay, and the service was A for effort, but C for execution. I'll get to that in a second.I went with a big group of friends so we ordered a variety of dishes. Definitely, definitely get the Millionaire's Bacon appetizer. It was probably one of my favorite bacon dishes of all time. You really can't go wrong with bacon and asparagus, ever. The crispy calamari was pretty good too!Now for the mains, I was really disappointed in my mango salad with prawns. It was wayyy too wet and the sweetness of the dressing was overpowering. I was really looking forward to it too :( Mom's coconut soup was amazing though and my friend's spicy eggplant was to die for. But really, you can get amazing eggplant like that for 1/2 the price at a Chinese restaurant. It's funny how once it becomes asian fusion the prices just double.Our server was really nice, and perhaps overly attentive. I don't think he was aware of the etiquette behind pouring wine because he filled our glasses up way too high. It was a bit annoying because a few of us drove and really just wanted a single glass of wine, not an endless glass. This particular way of serving the wine also led to us finishing multiple bottles of wine (3-4) where 1-2 would have been way more than enough. Again, though, I don't think he did it intentionally.Overall, this restaurant was really cute and had a charming vibe. If you're craving a burger, I'd recommend checking it out since our friend who ordered a burger loved it. But if you're looking for a reasonable dinner with friends and wine, this place will be over your budget. If they learned how to pour wine, maybe not. Had brunch here a few months ago and enjoyed it. Very cute decor, and we got right in (although I do believe it was a weekday). Solid eggs benedict, which is one of my all-time favorite dishes so I'm very picky. I'll definitely go back and try some of their other options. I've been to Kitchen Story twice.  Once for Lunch and once for Dinner.  I LOVE THIS PLACE.  For lunch I had the Chicken Sandwich.  It was soooo good.  HUGE piece of chicken and so flavorful.   My mouth waters just thinking about it.I was a little disappointed to see they had a completely different menu for dinner because I was going to order the chicken sandwich again!    But it wasn't available so I ordered the Pad See Ew.   It was some of the best I have ever had.   My friend ordered the Pad Thai and he felt the same way about his dish.I would highly recommend Kitchen Story.... Food was amazing and the service was just as awesome. Great dinner for my girls birthday. Table reservation was ready for us. Must have the castro tower and the coconuy soup!!! The Millionaire's Bacon is like eating steak. I've never tasted bacon quite like it. So freakin good! (See my edit below)Love that they have healthy options here! Egg whites and berry substitutes for potatoes. The potatoes are fantastic though, you can get them in several ways such as rainbow, with cheese etc.Mimosas are fantastic. A great location for a San Francisco Brunch.Edit: We ordered two millionaires bacon orders which is why my recollection based on what was indicated on the receipt was that it was over $12 for one. As the owner states it's $6.50, so this is even better--get two orders! I almost avoided this place because of all the talk of bacon. Luckily I didn't and had an eclectic meal, well cooked and served.  The steak with ginger rice was delicious to the point of eating every grain of rice.  We also shared a  Raw tuna appetizer which was large and delicious.  Everything we got was a hit. Liked the ambiance here, had the maple burger with bacon, holy F. I'll definitely come back. Adorable indoor theme - 1 starEasy parking - 1 starFast & friendly service - 1 starGreat salad/ veggie options - 1 starTantalizing dessert menu - 1 starBEST BURGER IN SF - 1 *million* stars!!   (million to go with the Millionaire's bacon!)I love this spot.  So easy to get to, and off the beaten path.  It feels like a neighborhood gem, and it IS!  Must get:  Tartare Salad, Millionaire's Burger.  It is the BEST - maple, sweet, smokey, crunchy, savory, meaty, juicy.  If you can save room for dessert do it - grandma's french toast is decadently delish. Went there Sunday at 10:00 am - greeted well and immediately seated - and the bus boy brought us a nice bottle of water.   That was the last we saw of anyone who acknowledged us for the next thirty minutes.  The table two down from us who were seated after us received their beverages (coffee and orange juice) and we were again ""not seen"".   I wish we could say we had a comment about the food but we decided to leave for lack of attention after waiting nearly 30 minutes at the table. Neither the host nor anyone else acknowledged our existence.    I'd have to tell people ""don't waste your time"" when so many other restaurants provide excellent service and good food. This place is great. Reminds me of sweet maple but I think the food here is a little better IMO.  When the food comes out it looks perfectly assembled, and tastes ever better! Fast facts:-Portions are just the right size...pretty hefty amount.-Millionaire bacon is amazing.  -Omelettes are nice and puffy.-They make really good coffee. Parking: Easy find (for us), it's street parkingYes, waiting list= we visited on a Saturday afternoon, so the wait was about 30+minutes, or more? They didn't call us and we were waiting outside (like the rest that were on the list), and we checked to see how many more ppl ahead of us and they said they did call us. (No they didn't we were near the door!) -_-Sat down and already knew what to order, waiting about 20+ minutes for our order to come. FOOD: Yes it was good, that's why there's even stars here. Otherwise service/wait---Ehh it was so-so. Went in to this place for brunch with a cousin and her friend and the only saving grace for this place was the food; the service was rock bottom.It took our server 20 minutes to bring us water.. so I enjoyed a packet of sugar while we waited. Then my chicken sandwich arrived. I couldn't believe it. The most amazing sandwich I've ever had in my entire life. Could it have been the extra sugary snack beforehand? Maybe, but I let the chef have his day.The rest of our visit was pleasant, spent with great food while the server was absent until the check came.I typically NEVER have complaints about waiting or service in a restaurant so this was the one exception I've ever made. Know what you expect to order before you sit down so you don't have a long wait. Otherwise, enjoy your sugar water! Delicious food. Friendly, funny staff. Millionaires bacon is to die for. Spicy Pad Kee Mao was phenomenal! My wife and I went for a breakfast but lunch menu looked really good as well. I had a berry french toast with scrambled eggs and ""Millionaire Bacons."" Eggs were cooked the shape of an omelet, which I really enjoyed but most impressive among them was the Millionaire Bacon. It was thick, tender and perfectly cooked and maple cyrup glazed. Definitely the best bacon I've ever had in my life. I'm sort of glad I don't live in San Francisco because this bacon is too addictive.Needless to say, the french toast was excellent also. Would love to make another special trip again. Loved it. Yelped to find somewhere to eat in this area at the right price point and stumbled upon Kitchen Story. We were able to sit right down with no wait (8pm on Monday). Three of us split three entree salads which were fun, creative and fresh. This place is the most delicious breakfast ever!  The staff is sooo friendly and very attentive.  I just had bacon and croissants but the butter they served was tasty and slightly sweet.  Even on a Tuesday it's busy but worth it. Cute space with excellent service. We enjoyed our dinner here very much. It's affordable and laid back. We were able to be seated immediately which was a HUGE plus. The food was fresh and tasty. Often times I find ""fusion"" to be code for bland, but Kitchen Story's dishes are flavorful with a decent spice level. We will be returning with our next group of out-of-towners! Tried this place for breakfast/brunch.Great local food with an Asian-Fusion twist, Great balance. The Interiors made the eating experience fun and enjoyable. There was a line but it went quick.We will definitely try this place for dinner. This place is decent: affordable and tasty and so close to my house. Potatoes were delicious, fries were yummy, bacon was amazing. However considering they are a brunch place, they need to learn to poach eggs. Mine was overcooked and it seemed too busy to send it back. Kind of ruins a good Benedict when the eggs are not runny. Sad eggs make me sad. Overall: Loved the presentation and flavors. The menu has a fun variety of options, will be going back to try them out. I came here on a Sunday with my sister few weeks ago. It's in the Castro district so it's kind of hard to find parking which kinda sucks. My sister and I arrived to the restaurant around noon and the place was PACKED! Luckily, we got seated pretty fast because we asked to sit by the counter instead of waiting 30-40 minutes for a table. The restaurant itself is a pretty small place but it's not too bad either. My sister ordered Ricotta Hot Cakes and I ordered Frisco Benedict. Man oh man, both of our plates tasted so good!! So, the Frisco Benedict has a chicken mango sausage that were super savory and some colorful potatoes on the side. The Benedict itself was really good too. It was poached egg and mango sausage on top of a piece of bread. Everything looked so fancy and delicious. If you look at the pictures on yelp, basically that's what it is. Looks really good huh?! I really enjoyed it. My sister's dish which was the Ricotta Hot Cakes was also good too. It had a lot of fruits on it and was savory too. Man, looking back at my pictures, I AM WANTING SOME RIGHT NOW!!!! AHHH!! I definitely would love to come back here and eat here again. I would love to try other dishes and some of their sandwiches too!! Awesome brunch spot with great bloody marys. The wait can be a little long but totally worth it. Sweet service. Dorky decor. Mediocre food that leaves little impact. I took a friend from Hawaii and was embarrassed that I had since it wasn't that good. I can vouch for only one item on the menu: The Burgah Boy. It's good! Cutest place ever with a unique Asian fusion menu. My boyfriend took me here for brunch on Saturday around 1:30pm, and the wait was about 10-15 minutes. I loved the ambiance and decor. The walls were lined with old books and little succulents on top of wooden bookshelves. I ordered the mascarpone stuffed deep fried french toast with scrambled eggs and millionaire's bacon for $2 extra. The french toast was 2 thick slices of bread with mascarpone in the center, deep-fried to perfection, and topped with fresh berries. The mascarpone complimented the sweet french toast and fruit. And when you dip that combination in the sweet syrup - heavenly! The scrambled eggs brought out the Asian fusion theme in the dish, and it reminded me of the steamed eggs that Korean restaurants serve as a side. I love steamed eggs, and these were light and fluffy and delicious. The millionaire's bacon was probably the best bacon I've ever tasted, and I usually don't like bacon. They were 2 gigantic thick slabs of what seemed to be pork belly and were covered in a maple glaze.My boyfriend ordered the frisco benedict with rainbow potatoes. The benedict consisted of chicken mango sausage, avocado, peppers, a poached egg, and a light lemon hollandaise sauce. I had a bite and it was so good! The hollandaise wasn't heavy like most hollandaise sauces tend to be. The chicken mango sausage was slightly sweet and was packed with flavor. The rainbow potatoes were very interesting and looked like a combination of purple yam, yellow potatoes, and sweet potatoes. I expected them to taste sweet, but they were actually all savory! They added such nice color to the plate too, which is definitely a plus. The portion was smaller than my boyfriend had hoped for, and I could tell that he was was trying so hard to savor every last bite of his meal.I really enjoyed my experience here. The service is fast and the waiters are friendly. The check comes inside a book, which I thought was the cutest thing ever. I guess I'm just a sucker for all their cute decor, and I can never say no to good food. I'll definitely be back again soon! Solid brunch spot with good food and service.  Two of us showed up on Sunday at noon without reservations and the wait was around 15 minutes.  The Okonomiyaki (modernyaki) Egg Pancake was huge with a nice crust and chewy bite to it.  The flavor was like a green onion pancake (the eggy kind) with a hint of kimchi.  I upgraded my plate to include eggs and millionaire's bacon.  No need to elaborate on the bacon since it gets so much love.  I did quite enjoy the butteriness and half moon shape of their generously portioned scrambled eggs, which kind of reminded me of the airplane breakfasts I eagerly wake up to on long-haul flights.  Didn't realize that it was sister restaurants with Sweet Maple until my plate arrived garnished with the two strange skinny crunchy sticks that I noticed a few weeks prior on my plate at Sweet Maple.  I'd happily eat here again. I should have read the reviews first - it seems the main reason to come here is either a burger or the millionaire's bacon.  I had the KS omelette, which was sub-par diner fare.  The potatoes were good, but really not compelling.  I think Pomelo is much more creative, and Zazie's much more flavorful. I don't understand the four out of five stars overall rating. I have been here on two separate occasions for weekend brunch and my boyfriend and I have been mostly disappointed. I will talk about the ""mostly"" soon.We have ordered their omeletes and have experienced them as blah. No flavor. Runny. We add salt and ketchup in hopes of something more but still nothing. A few more notes: Coffee is average and tea comes to you lukewarm. However, on our most recent visit, we decided to try the infamous Millionaire's Bacon. It's a whopping $6.50 for two strips of bacon. That is $3.25 for one strip of bacon (oh, hey, I can do math!). Can I just I say ""well-worth-it?!"" Long story short? Come here for the bacon only. Great brunch, service, ambiance and price. A hidden gem I'm excited to go back to!Had the ricotta stuffed deep fried French toast and shared it with eggs, bacon and potatoes. Both we're delicious, especially enjoyed the potatoes and bacon! This place a was very nice surprise. My friend and I ran into it while trying to search for a breakfast/ brunch joint. It was perfect. They combine the old vintage to a more modern look. I loved it. Everything from their decor to the check holder. Food: was good. I had the egg Benedict and my friend had their famous million dollar bacon. Bacon was tasty but the sweeter side for my pallet but good non the less. The Egg B was perfectly cooked, however, I would prefer it on a hot platter. Atmosphere was great, staff was excellent and again I love the decor at this place. Will definitely go there again. I had no idea this place was an Asian fusion restaurant until I read the reviews after I had already eaten there. The rustic decor makes me think it is an upscale fancy American diner. I don't think anything I ordered had an Asian flare to it. Nevertheless, I did enjoy having brunch here.I ordered an eggs benedict type plate which did come with two skinny crispy Asian noodles on top for garnish or something. I guess that's what made it Asian! The poached eggs were perfect and the sauce was delicious. I opted out of potatoes and got a little cup of berries instead but I was so full from my meal that I barely touched the fruit. My friend had rainbow potatoes with hers and they were super crunchy fried and colorful. It was delicious! The service was friendly and fast and it wasn't too crowded but then again I went on a weekday during brunch. They take reservations which weren't necessary on a weekday but I am sure it'll help on the weekend. Great place for brunch! This review is based on the Franciscan omelet that I ordered.  I came with my boyfriend and we both ordered breakfast entrees.  It seemed as if the timing was off because my food sat under a heat lamp for about 5 minutes before his was ready.  I get that things like this are usual but when my food came it was lukewarm and the ""cheese"" that was melted on top had turned into a rubbery texture.  The omelet itself was a round circular pile of eggs and then it looked like slices of jack cheese were just melted on top - so no cheese was actually cooked in with the eggs.  The potatoes seemed like they were microwaved or reheated somehow and very oily.  I didn't finish my meal and wouldn't come back here again. Our rating is an average (rounded-up) for the members of Gentlemen's Burger of the Month Club.  Individual member reviews below:""Bring your sweet tooth! The Kitchen Story burger is decidedly out of place in this Thai-fusion restaurant, but the chef knows his way around a patty and a bun. The maple syrup in the patty is decadent but delicious, and the bacon was the icing on top. 4 stars if it were a notch more savory and less sweet.""3.5 Stars-Cameron E.""Very solid burger and it was obvious they were using top ingredients.  I usually like bacon, but in this case found the Millionaire bacon too sweet. Overall too rich of an experience, after all I'm not a millionaire. Bonus points for good staff and comfortable place. I'd come again, but maybe not for the burger.""4 Stars- Paul L.""If you are ever undecided between french toast and a burger, kitchen story has the solution for you. they have a long name for it, but i just call it the brunch burger. all of the ingredients were top notch, from the meat to the bun to the fixings...but the maple syrup made for a strangely sweet (and messy) burger. good stuff, if you have a sweet tooth.""3.5 stars-Jamie H. Let me just get straight to the point - you don't want to look at the menu, I will tell you right now what you will order:Two eggs with Millionaire's Bacon.Long and thick slabs of bacon all sweet and stuff. And if you're feeling extra thirsty, go for the bottomless mimosa. There's is usually a long wait for brunch especially on weekends, BUT you can start your bottomless mimosa order while waiting. Seating inside and out, but I would prefer inside because it's hella cold in SF for an LA girl. Parking by streets. I enjoyed Kitchen Story so much that I had brunch here two weekends in a row. The first time was during Labor day weekend. The four of us arrived around 11 a.m. and the wait was about 30 minutes. This past weekend, the wait was 10-15 minutes around 10 a.m. If it's a nice day and outdoor seating is available, make sure to sit outside as it makes your brunch experience that much more enjoyable.  Both times I had the Red & Green Benedict, which might be the ""healthy"" version of all the benedicts -  mushrooms, roasted tomatoes, spinach, and mango salsa on a thick slice of bread, all topped with two perfectly poached eggs and no hollandaise sauce. Although there's no meat or hollandaise sauce, this sucker packs a punch of flavors from the tomatoes and mango salsa! I definitely recommend this. $12Two of my friends ordered the Frisco Benedict. Damn, that chicken mango sausage is tasty! It's a flat patty that's spicy, savory, and sweet at the same time. $13. The other friend ordered the ribeye omurice. Not impressed. After reading the description, everyone was expecting a slice of ribeye, but received something like fried rice with small pieces of ribeye mixed in. Definitely not something to order when craving for a a piece of red meat with your eggs. $14If you are craving for meat, order the California Burger. I don't think I've ever had such a silent meal with WL. The only thing I heard hungry man say was, ""damn this is good,"" after taking his first bite. The fries were superb also.  $14 He looked quite satisfied afterwards and mentioned, ""if this meal wasn't good, you would've gotten an earful."" Disclaimer: if you're like me and isn't a fan of goat cheese, pass on this and order the New England Burger $14 that has the famous millionaire's bacon, which leads to the next delicious item...Millionaire's Bacon. Although the price is quite steep($6.50 for two slices of bacon), this is probably the most delicious bacon I've ever had. Extremely thick cut bacon covered in sticky brown sugar and chili flakes causes an explosion of flavor in your mouth. It reminds me of sticky moist Chinese jerky my grandparents used to buy us. Order from the portion of the menu that has the french toast to add a slice of millionare's bacon for $2.One of my picky eater friends found a HUGE eggshell in his Frisco Benedict, but he was so happy with his order that he let it pass. Both times, there was no complaint on service. My cup of coffee and water were consistently refilled and the waiters passed by so many times that it was no trouble at all to wave someone over. Good coffee and good food is a winner in my book!Coming here on a regular basis can get costly since it cost $24 per person each time around, but I'd definitely recommend Kitchen Story to anyone and everyone who asks for a brunch spot. ahh I return again for brunch with a friend.  I was craving an omelette and thus ordered the K's omelette.   It looked waay better than it tastes.  The sausage bits are microscopic and sparse in this thing. I couldn't really taste it at all.  The asparagus is cut up in small pieces.  The thing is NOT SALTED AT ALL.  In fact I don't think there is any salt in any of the omelettes or eggs.  It is simply just different when you salt something after cooking, and salt it during cooking to incorporate and meld the flavors.  Anyway, better than -too- salty (which happened anyway as I oversalted, but that's my prob :/).  But seriously, salt is the one true seasoning so I am not sure why the chef doesn't do it for the eggs.The pork wine sausage is nice.The bacon was super hella crispy (too much), and a bit too salty. I ordered the ribeye omurice ($14), the main reason I wanted to try Kitchen Story. The rice was served under scrambled eggs rather than inside an omelette. The scrambled eggs were delightfully buttery, and the demi glace was tasty. The jasmine rice with ground ribeye, carrots, peppers, spinach, and green onion had a mild kick, and the flavors reminded me slightly of bibimbap. It was served with a croissant, rainbow potatoes, and fresh fruit, like most of the egg dishes on the menu.The choices at brunch span the full spectrum of breakfast, brunch, and lunch options, from eggs and French toast to burgers and paninis, and a few Asian-inspired dishes here and there. I'd come back to explore more of the menu. The staff and kitchen worked efficiently, and we experienced no inappropriately long delays from when we were seated to when we got our credit cards back. We weren't rushed by the staff either though. Reservations aren't accepted for weekend brunch, and Kitchen Story doesn't seat partial parties. The first time I tried to come here, the wait was over an hour. The second time there was no wait.Nice, well-lit space. Lots of seats lined up on the sidewalk for people who are waiting for a table. Visually, nice restaurant, but when it comes down to restaurants, I really want great food and service.   The service was a bit spotty - frantic help at the front to get a table to changes in waiters who sporadically brought food out - always rushed.   Maybe they should hire more staff.  The table who sat much later than us got their food first.  We did get an apology for the delay.  We ordered the millionaire bacon and was so disappointed - super sweet and not to my liking.  The sweet potato chips tasted like they were cooked in burnt oil that needed to have been changed yesterday.  I had the scallops sandwich and just my luck - it was wrapped in the millionaire bacon!  Waaah.  The scallop smelled fishy so I had my plus one smell it and he was brave to tasted and assured me it was safe to eat.   Positive:  walking distance to Birite ice cream - good way to get over the night. Delicious!  The French toast was unique and amazing, tried the bacon too.. Highly recommend! Just went a few days ago when a friend from out of town was visiting and it worked out really well for our big group.The wait staff was incredibly patient with us, our different arrival times and our many menu-related questions.I got the penang curry and it was really tasty. I was honestly surprised because I tend to have low expectations of places that have menus that sprawl over different cuisines. Usually, restaurants trying to do too much do nothing well, but I think Kitchen Story is surprisingly tasty!We asked for our curries to be extra spicy, and didn't find them to be too spicy, though.  But I can understand them being fearful they'll turn a customer totally read and teary-eyed.Lovely dinner, thanks guys!Also just some background on my rating scale for other reviewers: 5's are rare for me--restaurants that blow me away4 is really good--places i'm very likely to go back and eat more of very often3 is squarely good--a good experience that one should try but that i wouldn't go out of my way to go back for in the next 3 months but would return to if I was in the neighborhood2 is okay--a meal that i won't really remember or recommend others to try1 is badI do plan on going back to try the brunch, though, there's always such a big line and I'm intrigued! Also find that there's such a big variety of things to try on the menu, I'll probably be back for dinner the moment I'm in Castro again. Not only did I have the best bloody mary of my life, but I had the best bacon of my life, as well.  With a name like ""Millionaire Bacon,"" I expected something tasty, but I did not expect to be so blown away by the rich complexity of the flavors.  Look, guys.  I know how bacon tastes.  It's friggin' delicious.  I could eat it every day, and never get sick of it.  But what I ate at Kitchen Story was NOT bacon.  It was MILLIONAIRE bacon, and though I am far, far, far away from becoming a millionaire in actuality, I certainly felt like a million bucks.But please, let me tell you more.  I had some kind of eggs benedict, the name of which escapes me currently.  It wasn't the *best* eggs benedict I've had, but it was certainly up there.  Finally, the atmosphere.  Treat yourselves, guys.  The restaurant is as interesting to look at as the food is to eat.  Five stars. One of San Francisco's Hidden gems. This must be a new personal record, to go to a restaurant four times in the same month. I am thankful for the friend that ditch work to take me to this place. The restaurant is located right next door to the overly hyped ike's place. Their line usually covers the restaurant scaring away any potential guest from coming in.Once you walk in you are greeted by the friendly staff and seated. The decor has nice accents of wood allover and has a cozy cabin feeling. Seats are made from metal and booths are against the walls. Most of the staff are asian (thai i think) you will notice a lot of familiar american items are touched with a little asian flare. Many of the savory items on the menu have a small hit of sweetness like thai food. Ive been here a total of 4 times for brunch. I will be coming back for dinner. I can safely say that this place is definitely a better breakfast place then lunch. The ricotta hotcakes are TO DIE FOR!!!! Other things I recommend are the eggs Benedict's and millionaire bacon are crowd pleasers.This place gets me excited about breakfast again, something i thought was forever gone. The crab panini has an excellent blend of cream dressing that accommodate the crab very well.  helenic salad the shrimp are over cooked but the rest of the salad is good specially the dressing it goes well with the goat cheese Ran through my list of usual places for brunch on Labor Day but couldn't find any of them open, so took a pin in the map of the Castro and ended up at the Kitchen Story. I suppose there is a story behind the name but I never figured it out. They don't take reservations for brunch, so it's put name on list and wait. I think we waited 45 minutes today. There are three places to eat: outside on sidewalk (windy), inside at the bar (barstools), or traditional tables. We opted for an inside table. The service was slow, and the noise level chaotic, probably due to the endless mimosas being served. At times the noise exceeded 110 db. (I had a db meter app on my phone), especially when the woman next to us shouted everything she had to say to the entire restaurant. 110 db is about the equivalent of a lawnmower or rock concert. Too loud for a comfortable brunch. The only alternative would to have sat outside. We should have. Next time, for sure! I understand that dinner is far more subdued (no bottomless mimosas) and enjoyable.To the food:  I had the California Eggs Benedict with chicken mango sausage. It was near perfect. The eggs were just right, the sausage delicious, the Hollandaise exactly right.  My partner had the benedict with pork sausage, equally delicious.Summary: go for the food, bring ear plugs if it's a cold, windy day and you must sit inside. First, let me say that I have no big complains about the food or the service. In fact, they were quite attentive, the food was presented nicely and largely tasted alright (more on that later). So whats the problem? Well, by the time I get around to eating here, I've already read numerous articles about this restaurant and seen dozens of facebook posts...so my hopes were way up by the time I step foot into their door. Needless to say, they didn't quite live up to what I was expecting. The food, I would call them a fancy upper scale thai restaurant that also serves burgers, kind of like asian fusion but definitely more thai than fusion. The yam crisps were good, they were on the house. The millionaires bacon was sinful. The finger lickin chicken was fried to perfection, i loved the russet wedges that came with it and the cucumber salad as well. The wagyu beef though however, was just a tad bit disappointing. Firstly, you would have to think twice about wagyu that costs only 20 dollars. Its not a great cut, and was chewier than the wagyu's I'm use to. It came with a side of garlic long beans, which was delicious, and was on top of a large bed of brown rice, which was wonderfully flavored from the beef juice and maybe even some hoisin sauce. But the beef was a bit overpowering, it tasted too saucy and that took a lot away from the beef flavor that I like. I dont know why they pour rum over it and light it on fire, I dont think it adds anything to the flavor, its all looks. Anyhow, I think the millionaires bacon is worth the stop, but thats about it. The millionaire bacon is awesome if you like bacon and have some tolerance for spicy food. I also liked the French Toast a lot. 3 of us shared 2 entries plus a side order of bacon, and that was more than enough. We went on a weekday at 10am and it was pretty full. I can imagine this place being packed on weekends. Loved the rustic decor. Have to admit I was a bit confused by the concept (Asian fusion is always difficult to execute, especially when the restaurant looks like an American farmhouse). My friends and I stared at the menu and had no idea what to order (burger? coconut broth? rice? salad?); we ended up with a medley of dishes that sorta did, sorta didn't work together.Good news is, I was able to sample several dishes on the menu (sadly not the burger, which for the record looked PHENOMENAL). The coconut broth was creamy and perfect. The famous millionaire bacon with asparagus was show-stoppingly good. My friend had the mango salad with grilled tiger prawns, which was apparently far too wet and not to her liking. I had the calamari ceviche salad with ""crispy"" wontons -- really fresh fish and great sour flavors, but the wontons were a bit soggy.We were a party of 6, we shared a couple bottles of wine and our bill came out kind of expensive: around $50 each. Would totally have added on a star if it wasn't for the hefty price tag. Overall had a charming time here, it's just not one of my favorites in terms of value. Very impressed.  I finally know how millionaires eat bacon, and what motivates them to succeed. Came here for my very last minute birthday dinner for a party of 8, I believe I made the reservation only hours before. They graciously made the reservation for me.Still though, I had to push their buttons and arrive almost 30 minutes late, nearing closing time. Still, the waiters and staff were understanding and we received great serviced that was not rushed or compromised due to it being closing time. The food was great, not spectacular, but very well-priced.Thank you guys for making it a great birthday dinner for me! :) Good breakfast spot if you are in the neighborhood. Reasonably priced. The millionaire's bacon is solid. Wow, I have to say that I loved the Short Rib Tacos - sweet and savory and tender to the bite, these were a perfect dinner item.  The space is cool and it's always busy, which makes for a lively dining experience.  Some friends had the burger and really liked that too... Awesome place for a late brunch. Ordered the snowed spinach scramble and hubby had the California burger. Everything was delicious. Oh and two orders of millionaire bacon please. This is really why we came, the entrees was to cover a bacon addiction.Going to be super decadent and order take out next time. This way we can order more bacon and say it is for friends:) Arrived on a sunny Sunday afternoon around 1:15pm with a girlfriend.  Brunch ends at 3pm so the wait was not too bad.  Their waiting list had 3 options - outside, inside or bar.  I checked off all 3 since I was starving like a mofo.  But if I had a choice I would def opt for outside seating especially on a sunny day!   So after about 10-15 minutes, we got a seat at the counter bar.  This works out since there was only 2 of us and we can see all the food that comes right out of the kitchen.  We ordered: **Franciscan Omelet $13 - consists of chicken mango sausage, mushroom, celery, cheese and avocado.  The eggs were super fluffy and I love that they have egg white options ($2 extra). Came with house ""rainbow"" potatoes and croissant. Overall a delicious dish and the presentation was very pretty.  **Crab Panini $14 - grilled crab salad sandwich with arugula and pepper jack with a side salad.  Simple but good. I thought it went really well with the arugula.**French Toast $10 - deep fried ciabatta bread and filled with mascarpone cream. This was just OK- a little too heavy for me.  It actually reminded me of the fried Chinese donut.  2 bites was more than enough to satisfy the sweet tooth.  ***Bottomless Mimosas $16 - Fresh squeezed OJ :) I just want to let folks know that they will not take reservations for large parties; walk-in only. Even if you have 14 people. I find this really troubling because usually if you're organizing a brunch for 14 people, you want to make sure there's space for you to actually eat. So this restaurant should absolutely be taken off the ""Good for large parties"" list. Amazeballs!!!! Yelpers thank you for finding this place for me! Millionaire way- should be illegal! So amazing!Calamari- if you like fried food this is a must. Spicy Kobe wraps- partay in my mouth!! :) Tuna salad -skip this one but try their beef saladShort rib tacos- all hail the best taco I have eaten in a very long time. This was the star of the night! You must must must eat this! Wine- Sauvignon Blanc was fabulous Service- 6 stars...so honest and knowledgable.  Really warm and welcoming. This place has now become our go to spot for friends who love asian fusion! Huge huge thumbs up!! Sister restaurant of Sweet Maple in Lower Pac Heights.Lovely menu that offered brunch items even after 11am.I only realised that they were the sister restaurant of Maple when I saw ""Millionaire's Bacon"" or rather, ""Billionaire's Bacon"" IMO.As tempted I was to order Mom's Special Fried Chicken, I knew I was going to have a heavy dinner that night so I got the Veggie Burger. It had the requisite grain patty, roasted tomato, onion, avocado, spinach, swiss cheese. Wow. I really liked this a lot. Everything was fresh and delicious, one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had. Of course I had to recommend Millionaire's Bacon as a side and I was a teeny bit disappointed that it took so long to get to us. We had pretty much finished our meal and it came at the end, like a dessert but we were so stuffed that we couldn't finish it. Imagine that - not finishing the Millionaire's Bacon. Sacre Bleu! The food here is a little gimmicky, (*Millionaire Bacon*, *Deep Fried French Toast*) but doesn't really deliver on the execution.  Everything sounds really good, but then just tastes OK, nothing special.  The Millionaire Bacon is extremely sweet because of whatever they add to it, which to me kind of ruins the bacon flavor.  It's just a bit sloppy and doesn't really work, and $7 for two (albeit thick) strips is a bit steep.  Also had the San Fran eggs benedict and it was just OK.  The potatoes it comes with are a nice blend, but under seasoned.  This is OK for the sweet potatoes, but then you get a bland mouthful of non-sweet potatoes and it just doesn't work. Came here for a friend's birthday dinner. We got the crispy calamari and string beans. Both over-battered and deep fried with no taste. The ahi spoons were quite good but with a little too much going on a spoon. Hard to eat as well since it's too big to go down as one bite. I got the Mieng Kum salad. The description reads ""crispy prawns, spinach, zesty mixture of lime, ginger, onion, roasted peanuts and shredded coconut, caramelized palm dressing."" Tasty right? What I got was two shrimp wrapped in lumpia wrappers over a bed of wilted spinach and over dressed with sour, salty fish sauce. No peanuts or onions. It was not worth the $12 I paid. The waitress did not check up on us at all either. Oh well, yet another overpriced restaurant in the Castro that I will never frequent again. DERICIOUS! I've been here 3 times and each of those times was amazing! The service is great, the food is great and the ambiance is wonderful. I highly recommend the Finger Lickin. The combination of the fried chicken and crispy potato wedges dipped in their awesome curry sauce is oh so yummy! Also, the Wild King Salmon is great if you like a little more kick to your food. My friend first brought me here, then I brought my other friends, and they then brought their families! that's how you know it's good :DAlso, they give you complimentary sweet potato chips to nom nom on while waiting for your food! A+ I am a fan of the Millionaire's bacon and loved their deep fried french toast!  One of my very best friend is planning her wedding which will take place in 2013 so we decided to have brunch at Kitchen Story.  Unfortunately they don't take reservations for brunch on weekends but since we got there real early on a Sunday we were seated right away which was awesome! They served their iced teas in cute mason jars.  Service was great and the food arrived quickly.   I love the ambiance of the restaurant as well.  You definitely need to try the Millionaire's bacon and the deep fried french toast. Love this place and will return. food is absolutely mind blowing. So. Tantalizing. Service sucks, very abrupt and for the most part the staff has no idea what's in what. It seems as if they rely on the higher price points to determine their tip and don't care to engage. They need staff who have actually served before. But I keep going back though because the food is AMAZING! Have been here multiple times, and every time is delicious.Burger, tuna appetizer, and the curry were winners. After a rather disappointing car appointment at the dealership (which I will write a review about soon), my sister, mom, and I decided to venture in Castro to try this place for breakfast/brunch. My mom has been here before so she knew what to expect. Perfect timing as we beat the crowd before brunch time. Parking is not hard to find as long as you keep your San Franciscan eyes open and you know how to look for a parking spot as soon as a car pulls out. Ambiance is quite cozy and the server is gracious and friendly. I had the Frisco Benedict which was delicious, although I felt that the toasted bread, as opposed to the English muffin, was a bit heavy for my liking. The potatoes were great though. My sister's Ricotta Hotcakes was DELICIOUS! It reminded me of a mixture of Swedish and fluffy pancakes, only better! And finally my mom had the Athenian Omelet which had goat cheese and oh my God did it taste amazing.  To top it off, I found an even better tasting Millionaire's Bacon right here at this very same place! Yes, that's right folks. I found their Millionaire's bacon to be better than Sweet Maple's because it had a spicy kick to it. I loved loved loved their bacon. Will definitely take the BF here sometime soon. Happy eating! Really nice cafè with hip interiors. Californian/Asian cuisine is apparently a good mix - for breakfast, the eggs with rice and ribeye can be recommended, as well as the Thai Iced Thea - fresh, sweet and creamy. Review base on Brunch only.Was here for brunch with the hubs on a Sunday at 12:#0; and the wait was about 45 minutes.... but the host kept checking in with us which was nice.For Brunch we had:Crab panini - First 5 bites were good... tasty... creamy... and SUPER rich! After the first 5 bites... it was just blah... too cheezy and creamy for my taste.New England burger: Delish! It was really tasty with the millionaire's bacon and maple syrup wagyu patty!  I also enjoyed the pickles that came with the dishes... it's picked with star anise.Would want to come back here and try the dinner items.  Good service good food. Millionaire's Bacon #3, check!Came here for brunch on a Friday.  I was contemplating between the panini and the fried chicken.  I went with the fried chicken because it was under Mom's Special.  I guess cuz Mom's food is always special to the heart and the stomach?  I don't know...  Anyway, I was presented with a big bowl filled with the most crispiest wedges topped with a crispy chicken breast resembling a golden fish.  The millionaire's bacon did not disappoint, as usual. Sooo satisfied with everything! Came here with a friend around 11:30am. Having endured the lines at Mama's, Outerlands, Red Door, etc., I was mentally prepared for an hour+ wait, and we had a bit of pre-brunch to tide us over...much to our surprise and glee, we were seated at a table inside (thank goodness, because it would've been freezing at the non-heated tables outside) by noon. Points already.And the food was delicious. Unexpectedly the rainbow potatoes that came on the side of my Frisco Benedict might've been my favorite part - they were perfectly puffed up and so tasty! And included sweet potatoes, which is always preferable to normal potatoes...the chicken mango sausage on the benedict itself was very flavorful and it all went great with avocado, as so many things do. And I appreciate that the whole thing wasn't drowning in hollandaise, which was also lighter than I've had anyway. My only complaint was that they put it all over a small slice of levain bread, which was difficult to cut through and eat with the rest. Also the eggs could've been a little runnier for my tastes. Saturday brunch can always be really crazy with the long waits in SF. I've been here twice. When we got there we saw a really long line and thought that it would be a long wait. There's actually an Ike's next door, hence the wrap around line. We didn't make reservations and it was 4 of us. We only waited about 15 or 20 min. We shared everything family style. 1) Ribeye Omurice2) Mascarpone French Toast3) Pancakes4) Okonomiyaki Pancakes - favorite5) Green Tea Latte6) Millionaire Baconyelp.com/biz_photos/kitc…Everything was so yummy! It reminds me a bit of Blackwood in the Marina, Asian Fusion type of food. I think this is one of my new favorite brunch places in SF now. ^^ Millionaires bacon! must get! its kinda pricey but its very very good....$6 for 2 pieces or you can add it as a side to one of their entrees for $4....gotta try the mascarpone french toast! one of the best frrench toast i have ever had in the city.... Delicious! Every bite was amazing. We went for a weekday brunch so it was also low key, with great service. I love my morning melt--I loved it more because I can't eat eggs for breakfast and there's rarely a good savory option for me. But this had chicken sausage, roasted tomatoes and was bursting with flavor. The boyfriend had the ricotta pancakes which have been pronounced ""best of the trip."" So creamy! Too bad I really wanted to like this place!I had their BLT, which was pretty good. The bacon was sliced thick and so juicy, goes perfect with the fresh veggies and the bread. Waiters were polite and friendly too. HOWEVER, when I saw the bill, I was not happy... Including tip, it was $18 and I had ONLY BLT. Is it expensive lunch and I am not sure if it was worth it. (It's kinda hard to imagine what kind of BLT can be worth S18) If you are a deal seeker like me, this is not your place for sure. Outside, the metallic sign touts Kitchen Story as California cuisine, which is arguable. What I do know is that its fresh ingredients, colorful presentation, and creative concepts are executed well and does Asian fusion justice. The new interior has the typical trendy theme of rustic wood tables + metallic trimmings, low hanging lamps over a bar, and the recently popular bookshelf decor (with real books). It's well-ventilated with bay windows and was a peaceful place for brunch for one. Deep Fried French Toast: It's made with ciabatta bread which you don't see often, but it provides a great crunchy exterior and a soft airy interior! Basically two pieces of ciabatta sandwiches the mascarpone cream and is then deep fried. I'm a big fan of deep fried Monte Cristos, french toast, and the like because it encases the filling inside neatly and you never have to worry about it falling out. In this case, the structure was a lot like a cream filled donut. It came with a generous portion of fresh berries and maple syrup. Frisco benedict - I had to get the city's name sake even though no one calls it Frisco if they're from here. It came with this amazing mango sausage patty and freshly sliced avocado. The eggs were small, definitely not your large or jumbo sized eggs, but it looked cute. I find most hollandaise sauces heavy, but their meyer lemon hollandaise was probably the most fantastic thing about this dish. I also loved the side of home fries it came with, they were called rainbow potatoes and consisted of: potatoes, purple potatoes, and sweet potatoes. It's one of those perfectly fried potato sides that people rave about, especially the sweet potato home fries!The service was very attentive and they replaced my fork immediately when I dropped it. They also informed us in great detail about each dish when we inquired. This is quite the neighborhood gem in Mission. Excellent restaurant!  A MUST for any foodie!  This is a quaint restaurant situated on a corner in the Castro District of San Francisco.  Our party of four had drinks, appetizers, dinner and two desserts, all of which totaled approximately $50.00.  Good food does NOT have to be expensive! We came here for the french toast.  We tried both versions that were on the menu but they turned out to be somewhat disappointing.  But if you're here - definitely try the millionaire's bacon! I love lazy Sunday!!  My bf and I had brunch here on Sunday. We got there around 11am and the wait wasn't too bad. We waited for 10-15 min for an inside table. My bf ordered a Classic Benedict ( Mom's Benedict) and I ordered 2 eggs with Chicken Mango ( instead they give me 2 eggs with applewood smoke bacon), also, we ordered a side of millionaire bacon. I found my scramble eggs look very interesting. Instead of scramble eggs style, my scramble eggs was in a omelet style. The eggs were very fluffy and light. Despite the fact that I got smoke bacon instead of apple mango, they mixed the bacon with potato wedge and onion and lots cheddar cheeses. It was way too cheesy. Other wise, it was good!. My bf's Benedict was definitely different compared to the traditional ones. Where there are Hollandaise sauce on top on the poached eggs. The millionaire bacon were good. savory, sweet   and thick slice cut.  I'm not a big fan of bacon but millionaire bacon make me have a second  thoughts . Definitely would go back again to try the other items on the menu. Millionaires bacon is so good! I got the scallops wrapped in bacon on ciabatta bread sandwich, seriously incredible! Had breakfast here on a Saturday, arrived at 9am, no wait. Noticed that the place had started to fill up by 10, although all the outside tables were mostly empty. Menu for breakfast is very good - not too long, variety, and most of the items have twists that give a new taste to many traditional breakfast choices. Food - I had the Frisco Benedict with sausage and avocado. Very good and perfectly prepared. Note that many of the dishes come with potatoes as a side; that can mean many things, so if you're curious, at Kitchen Story it was small cut crispy potatoes.Coffee - strong and rich. Service - friendly and efficient.Atmosphere - Clean, renovated space. Didn't get too loud despite filling up. Nice, lively local crowd. Tool Factor - LOW. No fedoras in sight. No hipsters taking photos of their food instead of talking to their friends. No inappropriate cell phone users (you know who you are).Oh, and yes, the M's bacon is fantastic - sweet, savory, and a little peppery kick at the end. GET THE BLT!!!!Best BLT I've ever had. Hands down. I can never try anything else on the menu ever again because I can't risk it not being as good as the BLT. Otherwise, good salad, fries, a tad slow on the service, but who cares -- the food is awesome! Finding a brunch place in the city without a wait is impossible. My parents were in town with 4 of their friends so I had to find a place for brunch that would accommodate a party of 9. I had many choices, but I settled for Kitchen Story. I've had it bookmarked for some time and I was dying to dry the Millionaire Bacon. My parents got here around 9:30 and surprisingly there was no wait. Only half our party was here, but they were still willing to sit us anyways. I was very surprised considering how packed they get. Everything here is very appealing to the eye from decor to the presentation of the food. I normally stay away from sweet breakfast options, but I was very impressed by their mascarpone stuffed deep fried french toast. It was very light and non-oily; my dad compared it to a Chinese donut. The portions were also perfect. I was full after my meal, but not TOO full where I couldn't eat anything the rest of the day. I would definitely be coming back here again. Side story on the Millionaire Bacon. I first heard about this place because of my coworker and I quote:""I normally don't like bacon, at all. But I went to Kitchen Story and tried the Millionaire Bacon and was dreaming about it at night. Really.""Truth. Pay the extra $7 and complete your meal with a side of Millionaire Bacon and some eggs. We were here for a conference and stopped by this restaurant based on a recommendation. The food was amazing. Inventive - creative - great flavors. The ONLY downside is that it took forever to get our food. I think dinner took almost 2.5 hours... But the food is worth the wait. Next time we are in SF, Kitchen Story is a must. A surprising find in the Castro/Mission. I didn't expect it to be so good. I would have given them 5 stars but just a tiny issue with one of dishes, so this is 4.5 stars review.First off, excellent and friendly service. Such a cute little place too. Make sure you make reservations as they fill out fast on the Friday we were there. I guess the food is Asian Fusion. But the only thing you have to know is they have Millionaire's Bacon LOL. Don't be a dummy.. order this appetizer. It's spectacular. We also ordered the Castro tower of ahi tuna which was really good.They have so many good and yummy menu items that I could not choose one! I really wanted the Monterey Muscle scallops burger wrapped in Millionaire's bacon but my partner ordered it aaaghh! It was, not surprisingly, excellent. I ended up ordering Finger Lickin' fried chicken breasts. This is where my tiny issue comes up. The batter they use for the chicken was just not good and quite greasy. Everything on the plate was salty so combined made it taste more salty than it really is. Except for the cucumber salad which was sweet, but the coconut curry for dipping was also salty. Add the potato wedges and it's way too much salt. I actually felt a tiny pain in my tummy maybe from salt attack! I suggest they change the dipping sauce to something sweeter perhaps? A fruit jam? Peanut sauce? Then that dish would be perfection. This is really a minor complaint because other than that it was a fine dish. Overall though we loved our experience at Kitchen Story. Reasonable prices and outstanding food (great presentation also).  Maybe next time we'll just order small plates like the table next to us did because their appetizers all look amazing. We would not hesitate to come back. I came here for brunch on a Saturday. They do not take reservations during brunch so I came in around 1045. The wait wasn't too long, maybe 10-15 at most. While my friend and I waited we started off with bottomless mimosas. They are not skimpy on the champagne so good enough for me! I ordered the mascarpone stuffed deep fried French Toast and am soooo glad I did. The crunchy shell was the right amount without feeling like I'm gnawing on jerky. The mascarpone on the inside was a delightful addition. It gave a nice, gooey consistency and a good contrast with the fried shell. The two slices of bread were easily an inch thick so thank you for that. =) I could have poured that maple syrup on everything on my plate. Lol I went with the meal so also had scrambled eggs and bacon. The eggs were fluffy and had a creamy center so definitely delish. And you can't go wrong with bacon. I would definitely come back again to try the other items on the menu. I am giving Kitchen Story a 5 star (great food and good service).  This is my current favorite restaurant and is reasonably priced.  I have been here for lunch and had to come back another time to sample their dinner menu.  My favorite is the Ahi Scoops (sesame crusted tuna with spicy seaweed, crispy yam, ginger and wasabi cream sauce) - the combination of flavor was bursting in your mouth!  Millionaire Bacon is a must try and so is the Spicy Kobe Rolls.   Hop on over to the Kitchen Story and enjoy your Asian Fusion experience :-). Favorite new little spot in the Mission! Kitchen Story has everything I look for in a great go-to spot:- Consistently delicious food - they offer Asian-fusion done right. FINALLY, a place that gets it! (also check out The House for a fantastic weekend lunch menu)- Easy seating on weekday nights, although I'd recommend making reservations on weekends- BRUNCH!! GOOD BRUNCH!- Decent service- Reasonable prices. Approximately $25-$30 per head if you eat like a normal person- Warm, cozy interior. Like someone's comfortable living room- A few blocks away from Chile Pies, which is one of the greatest dessert places ever. Kitchen Story probably has a delicious dessert menu as well; I just haven't gotten around to trying it.Some delicious items worthy of note:- CASTRO TOWER!!! Lots of delicious spices on yummy chunks of tuna and avocado, served with crispy chips. This is the item that keeps us coming back- Love their curries - they are maybe a bit on the sweet side but the fatty American inside of me likes it that way. Preferably ordered with a side of rice.- Anything served with rice. This is an odd thing to point out, but their rice is REALLY good (coming from a girl that grew up eating rice every night). The white rice is soft and fluffy and if you're feeling adventurous, you should try the ginger rice. Very aromatic - similar to the rice served with Taiwanese Hainan chickenDon't be shy - try whatever sounds good on the menu. I have yet to be disappointed with this place :) The best story here is that the Castro finally has a quality restaurant that is open for breakfast, lunch AND dinner I have been here a few times and it is always a great experience. Come hungry because these meals will fill up even the biggest appetite. To date my favorite dishes are the short rib omurice (sp) and the hot pot.  The coffee alone is worth coming for. Strong and fresh. I'm going back with a group Thursday for  dinner and I am looking forward to trying something new. The restaurant is well designed, has a 100% score from the health department, has an innovative menu and a great staff. It may be priced slightly higher than some restaurants but it is a cut above most neighborhood establishments. One big happy ending for this Kitchen Story. Very Crowded Sunday brunch. We sat at the bar in front of the heat lamps. This gave us a good view of the kitchen and prep areas. Décor was nice and new looking. Bottomless mimosas are truly bottomless. They did not hesitate to give us more each time. (some places in my experience get stingy after a couple of refills) I had the 2 eggs with the cheddar melt potato's. The dish was good, but the potato's were excellent. Mushrooms, and bacon made it sooo good. My friends and I went here yesterday for Brunch and this was my first time here.  And you know the saying.."" good 1st impression""?? well, i wasnt impressed.  It took our food more than half hour to arrive!. My eggs werent fully cooked, glad i didnt get sick.  At least not yet...And when our food finally arrived, my food was cold, they miss-placed one of my friends food or the cook did not get his order. He also ordered a side dish of the famous M. bacon, which came first before anyone else' food arrived (weird).  So, we were all waiting for our food to arrive while the bacon sat there $6.50 and all, and got cold and chewy!  $6.50 for 2 pieces of bacon?? REally?? it was good but not that good!  With all that being said, our bill came and they charged my credit card 3x, with different charges! ugh...Not sure if i will go back here again. Like i said my 1st impression wasnt good at all!...and that is My Story! Food = good.  Had their ricotta pancakes with millionaire's bacon.  Millionaire's bacon = heart attack on a plate.  *heart cloggedPrices = moderateService = friendly, efficientBottomless mimosas = awesome and perfect start to my birthday!  $16/ppReservations = get 'em! Overall, I'd be back for brunch or dinner!  Dinner sounds awesome! I love brunch and I love Asian fusion, so Kitchen Story already won me over by combining the two. The atmosphere is extremely pleasant, and the decor has a homey, California feel.I had the mascarpone stuffed deep fried French toast. Typically, I am not a huge fan of deep fried foods, but I decided to give it a try! French toast is one of those foods that you can do so much to, so I was curious as to how this would turn out. It came with one big hunk of French toast that was stuffed with a creamy, but not too sweet mascarpone. The batter on the outside was slightly too much for my taste, but it wasn't oily at all. The fresh fruit and light mascarpone actually paired well with the heavier crust. It reminded me of a donut, but with higher quality and developed flavors.My boyfriend had the ribeye omurice, which was so unique and absolutely delicious. It's rare to find fried rice that isn't greasy and heavy, but they made it perfectly here. The ribeye and veggies in the rice were plentiful, so the ratio of rice to toppings was about even. The scrambled eggs on top were so fluffy, and the quantity was large enough to pair every bite of fried rice with egg. It came with a butter croissant and rainbow potatoes that were both really tasty. There is so much more that I want to try here after my first trip. Kitchen Story is definitely a must-try, classic San Francisco spot! This place was ok--- the decor and ambiance is nice, and it's in a nice neighborhood.  We had good service. The place was extremely loud though, and I had to raise my voice across the table just to talk which wasn't so pleasant.  The thing is--- the food is a bit expensive, and this whole ""asian fusion"" thing is starting to seem like a gimmick to me.   A lot of their menu was not really fusion at all--- it was  traditional thai food like yellow/green/red/panang curries, thai noodle dish (pad thai), and thai cocunut soup (tom kha) which they called Mama coconut soup or something like that.... and that is OK but I can get great authentic Thai food for cheaper.  Why go to some fancy asian fusion restaurant to get authentic thai dishes with no fusion spin on them?  Where's the fusion?The red curry shrimp--- we asked for medium spice, and it was extremely spicy. I like Indian food and spicy food, but this was a bit much. I think we counted 5 shrimps, which ended up beign 2 shrimp for me when sharing it with my gf.  That was dissapointing, for a $16 curry plate.  That left me with a bunch of sauce and some zucchini.The short-rib tacos were pretty good--- they came LOADED with short-rib meat  and it had some nice mango salsa and kimchi stuff.  The meat was flavorful and good, but $16 for 3 tacos is really expensive.The coconut milk soup was decent, but everything was overpriced and I enjoy getting my Tom Kha even more from my local thai spots like Thep Phanom or Marnee Thai and I don't have to pay so much for them, especially since the soup was nothing out of the ordinary.So ya... It was ok, but the menu is not too special and it's really expensive for regular Asian food. Stopped in at 9 for a lighter fare dinner at the bar. Saw some great stuff coming through the pass. Ordered coconut milk soup, large bowl, medium heat. Just perfect, except twice what I could eat, and for $12, wow great., Chicken was shredded, not diced, onions were obviously pre cooked so they could just be added to the serving at the last minute. Heat just right. My wife had calamari ceviche. Not ceviche, I am sure the squid was quickly poached. Great fish sauce dressing, nice hunk of avocado.  Great spot, open 6 months, need to go back to try more dishes. I was super excited to come and try Kitchen Story for the first time a month ago. I had friends visiting from New York, and thought this would be an appropriate place to have a nice, quiet, sit-down dinner. Although the food was delicious, I didn't appreciate the waiter lying about your mussels being scallops. I ordered mussels and the waiter brought out scallops??? I questioned him, and he proceeded to tell me in broken English that your mussels are scallops? I'm not stupid...and know what the differences are between mussels and scallops. I'm disappointed that the waiter just didn't admit he got my order wrong and fabricated a lie to cover his mistake. I'll come back to Kitchen Story, but have to read the fine print next time. This restaurant exceeded my expectations. After seeing the long lines for Sunday brunch, I was wondering what was the draw to Kitchen Story.  When I looked at the menu, it didn't seem that impressive.]Several weeks later, I made a lunch reservation for a large group. They we able to sit all of us at the time.   The food and drinks were right on par.  Mind you, we all ordered the bottomless mimosas.I shared the fried chicken and the pancakes.  The fried chicken was fried crispy and was tasty.   The pancake, were a disappointment.   The entire dish was a mess fry.No Pun!Overall come for the fried chicken. It is the bomb. Ignore the rest. I've tried to like this place by visiting twice and I'm just not very impressed.  Plus, waiting 10 minutes for a cup of coffee before taking my order is just pretty slow service in general.  It wasn't crowded and it literally took 10 minutes to get water and coffee. Just sayin'... This place is freaking amazeballs. Yes, I said amazeballs! No elaboration needed, just order everything. But you might be looking for some suggestions, so here:Ribeye Omurice-Japanese-style fried rice with ribeye and veggies topped with scrambled eggs and crispy baked rainbow potatoes on the side. I licked the plate. Seriously, licked it right after I scarfed down the buttery and flaky croissant. Mascarpone Stuffed French Toast-Deep fried and stuffed with mascarpone, topped with butter and fresh berries. Really, not enough of a sell? You are crazy.Tilapia Burger-The tilapia filet was juicy and cooked perfectly. Mango salsa could've been the perfect compliment if the potato wedges weren't so damn good.BEC Melt-Bacon, eggs, melted cheddar.. Done. The must, MUST get... Millionaire's bacon. This will change your life. Thick cut bacon with maple syrup glaze. It is worth that $6.50 in your wallet. If I had the means, I would most definitely buy a plane ticket to SF just to eat here. Yes, amazeballs. Went there on a Sunday for brunch and I must say I'm really happy with my decision. The place was packed with a long line outside but being alone I was immediately seated at the bar. I ordered the poached eggs Frisco Benedict and a side of the Millionaire Bacon. Both items are really delicious, yet not a good combination. My bad. The staff was busy but friendly and never rushing so I felt comfortable and welcome the whole time. All in all, I'll be back for more delicious Asian fusion brunch items. Bumped up a star to match the food.  Went back for brunch and the fruit flies were gone.  Were able to get a nice table next to the window and the peeps know this place is good because it was packed even though it was drizzling outside!  So yay! I'm a fan.  And millionaire bacon still rocks it out. We arrived exactly at 7:30 pm for a 7:30 reservation and had to wait fifteen minutes to be seated.  Another party of four was lingering.  The staff apologized.  That said, the service was otherwise exemplary and the food was delicious.  It was my third time eating at this restaurant.  All of the curries are extremely good.  We finally tried the Millionaire's appetizer, and the combination of thick bacon, asparagus, and maple syrup sauce was a treat for the taste buds.  Our out-of-town guests just raved about the food.  Meredith W. It's Sunday morning brunch.  You're sitting at Kitchen Story for the very first time, and you wonder to yourself, ""Yelpers of the world, what should I fill my stomach with this beautiful morning?""  The right answer: Millionaire's bacon, but of course.  Thick slices of maple syrup-drenched bacon that's been sitting in the oven for hours at a time?  Yes please.  If you're looking for 'a real meal,' get the red & green benedict.  It's a delicious and healthy option to balance out your please-feed-me-more bacon consumption.  Enjoy. It's a great spot for breakfast. Today was my 2nd visit. This time I took the whole family. 2 adults and 3 kids. Staff was very accommodating. And the food was great. I got the KS own omelet and added avocado. My wife got the Franciscan scramble and my oldest son got the wonderful Mascarpone stuffed deep fried french toast and the two little ones got the Mickey Mouse pancakes. Good size portions. We were hungry from running a 5 k earlier in the morning.  We will return soon! With a complete makeover from being Tangerine, this is what the area needed. Something that was unique, with good flavors, good service and interesting but approachable food. Kitchen Story got it right. The food is fresh, with good flavors/spices, and the service is responsive and appreciative. They are truly glad you are there and they let you know in the way they provide for you. Outdoor seating or indoor with a nice selection to choose from. Have the short rib tacos as they are my staple here! Their wine choices are good both by the glass and the bottle. Very pleased that they have brought some good food back to the Castro area. Once upon a time, Kitchen Story opened. It made extremely delicious dishes, such as the Franciscan Scramble. Now, the Franciscan Scramble, that darling dish, was a pretty mixture of fluffy egg scramble, chicken mango, pimento, mushroom, celery, and oozing jack cheese. But beware of its deceivingly small and light appearance - the most innocent ones are generally the heavy-duty, protein packing fillers that make you want to chase after dragons for exercise.And if that wasn't enough, The Franciscan Scramble is accompanied with the captain of butter croissants and the squires of delicious - I emphasize once again, DELICIOUS - mix of rainbow potatoes: Potatoes, Taro, Sweet Yam perhaps? Worthy of being knighted.The tiny swords, tridents, and spatulas provided at the table may sometimes be of short supply. And the wait for the army of food may be a little treacherously long, coming out in random spurs to your party of eaters. You might end up watching your companion defeat the opponent first before you even begin your own battle.Nevertheless, a story worth telling. I always pass this place on Sunday on my way to my weekend job and there is always a line in front. So this Monday a bunch of us decided to try this place out for lunch and see what the hype was about.My partner and I decided to split the ricotta cheese pancake entrée and a separate fried chicken entrée. They didn't have chicken and waffles, so this would be the next best thing.  I was very impressed with the flavor of the fried chicken. It had a spicy batter that gave it quite the kick. We all had bottomless mimosas which helped move the day along nicely.I would recommend they add chicken and waffles to the menu. That would be a winner. Great ambiance  great service and great food. Happened on it by chance and just loved my delicious red curry. Will definitely visit again. Thai probably main influence but some of the dishes served were like works of art. The lady who had the position of maitre'd was charming and advised me on the preparation of my dish. Thanks for a lovely experience. Wow! What a great restaurant for so many reasons. The dinner menu has great options, portions are large, and all very reasonably priced. Two of us had dinner reservations on the Saturday night of the SF Pride weekend. The restaurant was very busy, and our table was not ready, even though we had reservations. The host was very apologetic, and offered to buy us each a drink while we waited. It turns out he was the owner, and what a great way to lead-by-example for his staff. The restaurant has a very welcoming feel, like you are eating in someone's dining room. And the menu is filled with comfort food. We were so impressed that we came back for breakfast! Another WOW! This will be a place that I return to each time I visit the city. I had a burger here, called the ""burgah boy"". I sat at the bar forever waiting for my food. I saw burger after burger go by, each time praying that it was my own. When it finally arrived, it was a bit blander than I expected. Regardless, it was absolutely wonderful watching all the beautiful food go by. They really know how to make food look good here. I'm sure much of it is also quite delicious. I really wanted to give this place more stars but I think the only reason that I am not is because the service was not very good. The food came out in a timely manner but none of the servers here are very attentive. Anytime we needed something we had to grab them when they walked by and even after asking for something, they would start to walk away before we were done speaking. The bus boy and host were actually the most talkative and friendly of the staff. I think they should be moved to the wait staff. Okay now on to the food which was the saving grace of our experience. I ordered the California burger because of my obsession with goat cheese and it was pretty good however very messy and drippy. My sister and girl friend both had a sandwich and they were also very messy but I tried them and the flavors were spot on. My mom unfortunately found a very long hair in her eggs and was turned off to further eating. Prior to her discovery though I was able to try her bacon and it was YUM!! Like an explosion of maple in your mouth. So good I wished that I had added a side of bacon to my order.So long story short I would definitely return but would expect to have very stand offish service. I can deal with that if the food is good and here it definitely is. So, it's kind of Thai, kind of New American fusion, kind of modern, kind of traditional.  In case you haven't heard, the thing you must get here is the Millionaire's Bacon.  Extra thick and juicy, and they coat it with something a little sugary.  Money.  Now if you come for breakfast (served 8am-3pm), the thing you want from that menu is the ""Belly Rancheros,"" with Kurobuta pork, which for some reason has not yet triggered a Yelp Review Highlight. My buddy ordered it, and seeing its massive size was planning to eat half of it.  Then we each tasted it.  Holy crap, so good: rich fatty pork with that (not actually spicy) ""5 spice flavor"" that you get at lots of Asian fusion places.  He ate the whole thing, it was that good.Also, if you come for dinner: from the Thai items, the Pumpkin Curry is baller!  And Mom's Coconut soup is like a really good Tom Kha. Wish I could give 4.5 - the marscapone stuffed & fried french toast was simply the best - WOW - covered in berries and syrup (our add to it), it was heaven sent - started the meal with that along with Millionaires Bacon - the bacon was nice and meaty, good sweet to spice balance and if you love bacon, you'll love it here.  Then we moved on to entries - had the Benedict served atop crusty baquette which delicious - potatoes were nice (might have just quick fried them too to get that crunch).  Highly recommend brunch here I think generally this is a pretty good place in a great cozy space. If you're looking for pretension or the latest trends in food, which are a ridiculous way to review any location, unless it considers itself among the latest trends, then you're going to be disappointed, and you should move along. This place has an eclectic menu; perhaps the drink menu could use some sprucing up, and the servers could be a little more attentive, but overall it is an above-average experience and well-priced.On our recent visit to the Castro we met friends of ours who live nearby and suggested this place. It was not busy (about 30 percent full) for a lazy Sunday evening, and we were seated right away. The server seemed a little overwhelmed with only four tables, but unlike our recent ""could-care-less"" service experience at Harvey's nearby, he was at least trying. What he lacked in mental faculties he more than made up for in hustle, so he deserves some credit. I think he needs to learn the menu a little better, but perhaps he was new. Nevertheless, he wasn't awful, and he was engaging. (For those of you who remember ""Mad About You"" in the mid to late 1990s, think Ursula, Phoebe from Friends's sister.)For starters, we ordered the calamari. Nothing impressive but also nothing unimpressive. Only drawback for me was the size of the sauce that accompanied the plate: It was completely disportionate, on the small side. The calamari itself had a nice flavors.Our buddies, ""E"" & ""J,"" each had a beer, as did I. My hubby wasn't drinking that evening. Being I wanted to try something I can't get in Chicago, I tried the Red Tail Ale from Mendocino. Decent beer. ""J"" ordered a beer, Big Eye IPA, that about ten minutes later, when we ""reminded"" the server of our drink order, we found out they did not have. He finally got the Red Tail as well. Again, nothing great but absolutely satisfactory. For dinner, ""J"" and I both ordered the Castro Sea. A very good dish. It is listed as medium-hot, but I'd call it medium. Definitely had a good flavor and plenty of seafood, along with avocado, and the curry was not heavy at all, just enough to give the dish the ""pop"" it needed. I definitely would have it again, and ""J"" agreed, and I would recommend it.My hubby had the ""Burgah"" Boy, their version of a burger. He really liked it. He must have. I remember seeing it when they sat it down, but ten minutes later when I asked him what he had, he told me, and from his empty plate he really enjoyed it. He never, ever, ever finishes his plate, and he never finishes before me. (He's always telling me to take human bites and that might food is not going to run off my plate.) For him to eat a dish that quickly, and completely, tells me the dish is worth a recommendation. I'm pescatarian, so I didn't try it, and even if I would have attempted I think I would have a few less fingers today. While some reviewers on here have castigated the way the dish is stacked, I think it works for this dish. Again, if you're all about trendy pretension, ask for it deconstructed, but remember this is a dining experience, not a Top Chef episode.""E"" had the Pad Thai, and he said it was worth getting. He's a big eater but took plenty home.Again, there's no pretension in this place. It is what it is, and what it is, to me, is a very good dining experience. Did it have its hiccups? Of course. However, were those excusable for the overall experience? Absolutely. Like I said earlier, if you're expecting a burger by Tom Coliccio or to be greeted and seated by Padma Lakshmi, this ain't your place. But if you want a meal that's appropriately priced, full of flavor, and portioned appropriately, this is your place. It just felt comfortable, and that goes a long way for me. Definitely recommend. A great spot for a date! Had dinner with my boyfriend a few days back, very glad we made a reservation because it was quite busy.Starters were excellent-,we had the Ahi Scoops which were super tasty and fresh. The samosas were a bit different than we had expected, the dough was quite thick, but good nonetheless.For mains we had the fried chicken and the  beef salad. Both full of flavor and nicely portioned. Atmosphere is classy as well as romantic but still quite trendy and hip. Very reasonably priced and would love to go again and try other unique creations they have! First impressions are lasting impressions.  i had an eggs benedict dish at about 11:30 on a weekday.  Restaurant was not very busy, but the hollandaise was cold and the eggs were hard, not runny as poached eggs should be. I heard so many good things about this place, but.... LOVE LOVE LOVE. This is the place to go for a hearty Sunday funday brunch with a touch of Asian. Perfectly poached eggs. Omurice! Bottomless mimosas! And, I usually don't care too much for the potatoes that come with brunch plates, but the rainbow potatoes here are so delicious! Perfectly crispy and a combination of purple yam, regular yams, sweet potatoes. Unlike any old fashion brunch joint, Kitchen's Story is clean, organized and have a less than ordinary menu. Their food is very delicious and quite inspiring. I had the Chicken Mango Melt, and to this day, I'm still thinking about it every morning. Gosh I can eat this every morning or lunch or whenever. The chicken mango sausages was so delicious and not salty at all like typical breakfast sausages. Layered in between the breads were spinach, tomato and cheese...can't get better combo than that in my book! Ahhh. I want some now. I also tried the Million Dollar Bacon. The dish comes with two thicker cut bacons with maple syrup and some chili peppers. Gosh, I don't even like bacons, but this bacon totally just kill my ""I don't like bacon"" era. I swear I could eat plates of this if I want to. I was also checking out my friends' plates, and they all look very appetizing, even the one with just scramble eggs and sausage on it. How do you they make something so simple so pretty and appetizing? The scrambled eggs look super fluffy...like super fluffy! I swear I want to learn their secrets to their dish so I can make myself some.All in all, their food get my thumbs up. Service was just okay though, maybe because they were busy or something. But bottomless mimosa takes forever to refill, and we have to keep asking for it...same with water, iced tea, etc. I was surprisingly unimpressed.  The menu is a mix of 1990s-era California fusion (think vertically stacked dishes; raw tuna and fried wonton chips) and pan-Asian dishes.  We had three of the ""California"" dishes to start:Tuna ""spoons"" that were fine, but overcooked (I expected them to be raw, and they were really cooked through, which is a waste of good tuna), and effectively tuna poke (good quality raw tuna, but overseasoned).  The third appetizer was ""grilled"" (tasted and looked sauted) eggplant rounds over a thing of fried goat cheese.  It was a bit too greasy, and there was only three anemic pieces of eggplant for a big chunk of goat cheese.  The whole dish needed an extra texture, and a lot more eggplant.  Overall, nothing bad, but they were all $12 each, which was not warranted.  For main courses, we all had various of the Asian dishes.  I had what would normally be called tom ka gai soup.  It was a large portion, and satisfying enough, but certainly not better than at any ordinary hole-in-the-wall Thai place.  If I closed my eyes, ignored the branding, it'd taste like a normal $6 bowl of soup.  It said organic chicken in the description, and I bet they used better ingredients generally, I simply could not tell.Service was not so good; they messed up one dish (made the wrong curry; we could have sent it back, but decided it wasn't worth the trouble), didn't know who ordered what, served the wrong side dish with one main course, were confused on the appetizer order, and were hard to find to get the check.  At least they refilled the water frequently.Overall: Everything was reasonable, but not worth any price premium over a basic cheap restaurant.  Their burger looked killer though, and I'll probably give them one more try to check it out. I read that Kitchen Story comes from the same makers of Sweet Maple in Pac Heights. I haven't tried Sweet Maple, but my foodie friend Vivian H says it's similar in mediocrity so I guess if you like Sweet Maple you'd like Kitchen Story. * Ribeye Omurice - 2 STARS ($14): scrambled eggs over jasmine rice, marinated ribeye, carrots, cherry pepper, spinach, scallion. Demi glazed sauce. This sounded so amazing and was featured in the paper. It tasted like low quality margarine sprinkled with a bit of low quality beef. It didn't taste Japanese in the slightest. It kind of tasted like airplane food.* Mascarpone stuffed deep fried French toast - 2 STARS ($10): This looked and sounded so good, I had to order it. Unfortunately, it tasted more like an overly deep fried funnel cake, very dry and filled with a low quality overly sweet marscapone cheese that would ruin even the best funnel cake.* Ricotta Hot Cakes - 2 STARS ($10): Perhaps I am not a fan of ricotta pancakes because I didn't like the mushy texture here or at Plow. Eh.* Millionaire's Bacon - 3 STARS ($6.50): I don't really understand the hype around millionaire's bacon, personally it's way too sweet. I guess you could call this the highlight of the meal, an item the owner claims to make the lowest profit margins on. I'd recommend upgrading your meal for $7 to get the eggs and millionaire's bacon (seeing as the bacon side is $6.50 alone).Kitchen Story, Pomelo, Tangerine were huge Asian Fusion brunch disappointments for me; the Mission needs to step up their game. If you're looking for fusion brunch, the owners did a much better job at Blackwood (Thai Fusion WITH amazing happy hour) in the Marina. The food is very good. Overall definitely worth a visit! I edited my review and updated to 5, there is nothing to complain! Cute little place, cozy ambience, superb + tentative service. Two girls, we ordered: mango salad with prawns - fresh but tad too sour; dancing queen (seems like a normal beef and green bean dish) and wagyu noodles. Everything was really tasty but also a bit heavy handed on the salt, its 2 hours after dinner and i'm still thirty as heck. Overall solid eating out options. Would come back to try their super popular brunch menu however =) This was the most fantastic meal that I have had in a while!! I picked this place out of the blue while I was looking for a place to celebrate Dad's day, and I am so glad that I did. This was AMAZING!Starters: Since it was so highly spotlighted on the menu we had to start with the Millionaire's Way bacon. It was thick, sweet tender and oh-so-tasty! It's served on a bed of asparagus and split three ways it gave us enough of a taste. I loved it. We took our 5-year old here and while they have a children's menu, he opted to order off the regular menu. The server was really respectful to our son which I like because often restaurants completely ignore him and expect me to order for him. Instead he took his order and that always makes our son extra happy. For our main meal he had:Mango Salad with Grilled Tiger Prawns - He dove into this salad with enthusiasm and said he really enjoyed it. I tried it as well and it was bursting with flavor. It was a big portion for a kid (actually all of the portions here are on the large side), but he ate quite a bit. I get to take the rest for lunch :-)Castro Sea - I love seafood and I love curry so I opted for this dish, sans green peppers. The table next to me ordered it as well and when I saw it come out I was already salivating. The fish was all cooked perfectly and I really enjoyed all of the different textures. There were crispy noodles, avocados, crisp peppers and soft basil. The sauce was creamy and spicy. I was in love!Grilled Wagyu Beef Noodle Soup - Hubby chose this and the server brought out a giant bowl of beef, noodles and broth. The noodles were soft but chewy, the beef was tender and the broth was spicy and bit salty which I loved. I wanted to eat his meal too! Lucky for us we each had leftovers so I know I can enjoy it tomorrow.I am not usually a big dessert fan and only want to try a bite or two, but today I had the (seasonal) mango and sticky rice and I was literally licking the bowl. I liked it so much I want to get a take-away order of it tomorrow! The cubed mango was served over a warm coconut rice and it was the perfect way to end our meal. I left the restaurant asking ""when can we come back?""We were seated in front of the kitchen so I got to see a lot of the meals coming out and truthfully they all looked good. I really want to come back to try the fried chicken which looked amazing and since fried chicken is my favorite food, I am sure I will love it. Our neighbors ordered the Summer String Bean appetizer and they looked good too. So much to try! I might need to come here every day!! Came for a late brunch, left satiated with a smile, and didn't want to eat anything else for the rest of the day because the food was so delicious!My partner and I came for Sunday brunch at around 1:30pm.  Our first time.  It was busy, but they were able to seat us immediately if we sat at the bar, which we did.  The seating outside looked super cute, and I totally would have done that if it weren't for the wind today.  Next time!The service was great, everyone was so pleasant and attentive, but so efficient at the same time, with no hovering.The food was absolutely delicious, especially for the price!  We got the red and green poached eggs (which was to die for, perfectly cooked, with whole, rainbow pearl potatoes, and a mushroom/tomato/spinach mixture that had my mouth water with every bite.  I got the mango salsa on the side.  Next time, it will not be on the side, but right on top of the dish since it was so yummy!We also had the marscapone hotcakes.  WOW.  I loved these!  Not too thick, perfect portion of three, the batter was delightful with a hint of sweetness from the cheese and orange rind, so all you needed was just a few little drizzles of syrup, rather than having to douse the whole thing to get flavor.Anyway, seriously loved this place, and can't wait to come back for brunch again! I absolutely love this place, and I've never even been inside.What I mean is, weekend brunches with the dog is one my favorite things in the world, so outdoor seating at a restaurant is usually a must. I've been here a couple of times, always for weekend brunch, and always seated outside. Even the time we came here and all of the outdoor tables were taken, it was no problem. The staff immediately pulled out a table from the restaurant and created new seating right then and there. Service doesn't get any better than that.Other restaurants will completely forget about their outdoor patrons, but the staff were so attentive and friendly checking on our table and refilling our waters every twenty minutes. The food was phenomenal; I highly recommend the New England Burger and Mascarpone Deep Fried French Toast. All in all, one of my favorite brunch places in the area, and I can't wait to devour the remaining dishes on the menu. I've been here a few times and I've really enjoyed each visit.  The place is very cozy, the portions are large and everything is made rich and flavorful.  For Brunch the Millionaire's bacon was definitely the highlight.  Describing it as thick bacon drenched in maple syrup doesn't even properly describe just how good it is.  As for their dinner menu, the appetizers were all solid and very flavorful, although it seems they .  I was really pleased with the Pad Thai, it had more vegetables than I was expecting and the Tofu was perfect.  I am confused why this was labelled as California cuisine.  It felt far closer to an Asian fusion restaurant. The good:The food! The presentation, quality, and flavors of the dishes were very good. The predominantly Asian cuisine was served on attractive, modern dishes and the chef put a lot of effort into the design and appearance of the food. A very appealing juxtaposition of flavors, colors, and textures, and the quality of the food was excellent. We asked our server for recommendations and she did a great job pointing out and describing a few of her favorites on the menu. We were glad we took her advice! We wished that we had been a bit more careful in choosing distinctive dishes, though, as our appetizers were very similar and shared over 50% of their ingredients. They did a great job with the interior design. It looks clean, modern, and inviting, more luxurious than Tangerine. The not-so-good:The place advertises itself as California Cuisine - right on the marquis - but it is not California cuisine. It's pretty much straight up Asian from the design and language of the menu down to the ingredients and the presentation. False advertising!The front of the house needs serious training. The tables were all set incorrectly with the napkin on the right, and the wait staff seemed generally confused and unorganized. A busser took away parts of my appetizer from my plate while I was in the middle of the dish, and there were a lot of interruptions. Also, when they removed our first course dishes they put our dirty silverware right onto the table, which is gross and surprising for such an expensive place. Which leads to the other big thing, the cost. Two apps, two entrees, and two glasses of wine was $120 including tip. About 25% too expensive for what it is, I'd say, and more than the two dollar sign rating here had led me to expect.Another minor thing is that I cancelled a reservation here a few days ago by phone but the restaurant did not update OpenTable properly so it counted as a no-show for me, which is irritating. I am a conscientious customer and I don't want a black mark on my OpenTable account. I was very impressed and pleasantly surprised.Fusion can be done very wrong or very right, and it this case its right on point. The service is phenomenal and the food is  very fresh, tasty and fits the theme of the restaurant. The fried chicken is very comforting and hearty! The batter they use is thick very crispy and tasty . Portions are worth the price and they have a decent wine menu. Great restaurant for a group because the menu is extensive enough to please everyone. Highly recommend for dinner. Food was fantastic!  The millionaire's bacon was pretty tasty.  I had the Francisco scramble which was more like an omelette than a scramble...but still very good.  Beware, the portions are HUGE.  I only ate half my meal...I felt bad wasting so much, but I couldn't have eaten all that food even if I tried!  The scramble itself was the size of a single deep dish pizza, and then you had a generous side of potatoes and a croissant.  Next time I will try to share with someone.  It really is enough for 2 people. Kitchen Story, where your bill is attached to a book. Space is quaint and cozy. I would recommend making a reservation in advance. I got there at 6pm and found myself pleasantly surprised at how empty it was. It's pretty great to enter a restaurant early on and watch as it fills. Come 7, Kitchen Story was bustling.Our server let my party know that portions were hearty and that we should err on the side of caution when it came to ordering. False. Portions are on the conservative side. I would recommend ordering family style and trying an array of dishes. Their Thai dishes (fried rice, pad kee mao, pad thai etc.) are solid. Kitchen Story is a solid neighborhood find. Would I make the trek just to dine at Kitchen Story? No. Would I stop by if I'm in the area? Yes. Definitely, yes.Parking can be tough, though there are some residential areas nearby so you may get lucky. It's walking distance to a muni station. Just amazing. The decor, the service and the food. Our group of five met for dinner and the food was amazing. We ordered the pacific ocean cod (flakey buttery goodness), the castro sea (spicy and flavorful w capers), the dancing queen (wagyu beef tenderness with fire presentation), garlic asparagus (super tasty), and the de tofu (yum). On top of us groaning from overindulgence, we managed to squeeze in room for desserts. Three awesome desserts: ice cream sandwich w/ millionaire bacon (thick savory goodness), chocolate molten cake with ice cream and another dessert which I blanked out on from food coma.  Intimate space, unlimited ice tea refills, great service and perfect way to end a Friday night in good company. Highly recommend for quality home cooking at affordable and reasonable prices. The food is good, but the service is really BAD. I went there  tonight and my entree came out 25 minutes after everyone else's. No apologizes and no acknowledgment. Just an arrogant attitude that they believed that they were not in the wrong ""the kitchen had a problem"" as if they had no responsibility for the service. I will not go back because there are so many more options in San Franisoc. The Millionaire's Bacon, the fried chicken, the beef salad were all amazing. Good service, GREAT food. I highly recommend this place. They also serve some free sweet potato chips to you while you wait for your food (I didn't wait long)."|4|93|1|Routine| High risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 12/2/2013 ]|GOOD: no inspection needed
Kitchen Story 2|4.0|Breakfast & Brunch in San Francisco, CA|$11-30|813|2|4.079754601226994|" You want good food?  Then you must hit up this place!  Kitchen Story is such a nice and cozy spot.  Now for the food.  We ordered the spicy kobe rolls for starters and it was just yummmm.  Now the main dish, we had the finger lickin good fried chicken,  boy burger, and thai fried rice.  i would totally recommend the fried chicken and burger!  The fried chicken came with a curry dipping sauce which made it tasted super good and the burger with the million dollar bacon was just delish!! YUMMMMMMMMM!!!  Millionaire bacon...must get the millionaire bacon...it's soaked in maple syrup and fried.  Super ridiculously horrible for you...but so delicious.I ordered a burger with a salad...I don't even remember what was in it except for the bacon.  That's all I cared about...the bacon.  Did I mention the bacon?Wifey ordered the mascarpone french toast with a side of millionaire bacon.  Geez, it was one of the best french toast dishes I have ever had.  The service was great...the mimosas were bottomless.  Perfecto.Their sister location is out by japantown but kitchen story was definitely the better of the two. The prices were decent...location was cute...the food and service was fantastic.5 solid stars.  Can't wait to come back here again!!! Eggs benedict - Delicious! Their fries are the best I've had in a long time. Not so big on the millionaire's bacon - unless you like soggy and sweet. Diner quality coffee, but very strong! We were actually en route to the restaurant next door but decided to eat brunch here once I saw ""Millionaire Bacon"" on the menu. Hands down the best tasting bacon I have ever had! The rest of the meal was great, too, especially the eggs (cooked to perfection in butter, not crappy vegetable or seed oils as most restaurants are wont to do), and the fruit salad. And despite being extremely busy that day, the staff was friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back next time I visit San Francisco. My boyfriend took me here for a romantic dinner. Our reservations were on time and the food was beautifully presented. The prices were not bad. The only disconnect was the ambiance. The venue was beautiful and the decor was very quaint. The only thing was that it didn't seem to match the food genre. Either way, it was a beautiful dinner and I can expect to return soon. Nothing but good things to say about Kitchen Story.The decor and ambiance is relaxing. The service was excellent. And the food was very good.  The signature bacon (Millionaire's Way) is awesome. I worried it would be too sweet with the maple syrop, but the taste was flavorful and and balanced.Salads were excellent, as well. Very fresh and tasty. This was always the restaurant I walked PAST to get to Ike's, but my wife convinced me to try it this morning so we went here for brunch. On the basis of many yelp reviews, I got the deep-fried, marscipone-stuffed french toast with two scrambled eggs and millionaire bacon. The meal did not disappoint.  Overall it was one of the riches meals of my life. We got there at about 10:15 and there were still a few tables available (Note: by the time we left at 11:00, the waiting list with 5 deep). The hostess was nice and sat us promptly. The waitress was attentive but not overbearing. The food came incredibly quick, and may be a product of their requests for no menu substitutions.I'm not sure what kind of super chickens they have in the back of the restaurant, but my ""2 scrambled eggs"" were the size of most restaurants' full-size omelettes. They were very buttery (dare I say too buttery?) and cooked perfectly. The french toast was something out of a State Fair, and I mean that in the best way possible. The crust was nice and crunchy while the insides soft and the mascipone for luscious. I'm normally a guy that usually douses his pancakes or french toast in syrup, and I barely used syrup because they were just so damn rich! Finally we come to the millionaire bacon. One principle, I almost didn't get it because it costs $2 more than regular bacon and that just seemed wrong. But boy was it worth it. The bacon itself revivals the best bacon I've ever had at any Midwestern diner. It's thick, its perfectly cooked, and glazed in a bit of syrup. What sets it apart is the extract kick at the end (which I'm guessing was chili powder). All in all, I can feel my food coma kicking in as I finish this review. We will definitely be coming back here for brunch, and based on yelp pictures will also likely try it out for dinner. We L-O-V-E-D Kitchen Story!!!  A pleasant surprise indeed it was!!!! YUM factor of a gazillion!  The four of us (all food lover's) shared 6 spectacular dishes in the very customer friendly, good vibe, nicely done, glad you are here great eats newer place in the hood!!!  I would recommend every dish we devoured.  Millionaire's Way (bacon baby!) what a splendid blend of healthy and not so much, Ahi scoops--my favorite!!!, Castro Sea--yummy, Burgah Boy-delish!, Short rib tacos--at this point I had died and gone to heaven, and Dancing Queen-- for the steak lovers!All truly exceptional in taste, presentation and value.  We can't wait to go back--SOON!  The waiters/servers et al were Fabu too!8 thumbs sky high up and yes indeed, a very pleasant surprise!A big heartfelt thanks to Rob & Dave for the recommendation! My new favorite Asian Fusion restaurant!! The Ahi scoops and short-rib beef tacos are to die for.  The staff was very friendly too! : ) I went there for my bday and they were very accommodating! Also, the decor was very interesting.... LOVE this place!! It was a windy Wednesday night and I met a friend at the bar for a pre-dinner glass of wine. After friendly service and a nice pour, we ended up staying for dinner. We moved to a table at the back, and I really liked the teeny cactus on the table. It was a nice touch (hah). I believe our servers name was Timmy. He was so friendly and helpful! I really thought he was personable and helped me find something that wasn't spicy at all on the menu. I got the bacon burger, while my friend got the Castro Sea full of seafood. We both enjoyed our food. Mine came with crispy wedges, which soaked up all the goods from the burger. YUM. They were a highlight of my meal. So many things on the menu looked delicious. I have heard this is a good spot for weekend brunch, so I'll be back! Asian fusion.Meh. Everything had a deep fried noodle sticking out of it. Cute the first time. Millionaire's Bacon is very meaty and salty-sweet. Definitely a crowd pleaser but me, I like my bacon crispy crunchy so this didn't cut it for me. My favorite thing was actually the ginger rice that came with the tilapia. How the heck did they make it that tasty?? Franciscan Omelette: best breakfast I've had in a long time! Same good food and service as Sweet Maple. Great breakfast. The millionaire's bacon is worth trying. I also had scrambled eggs that were fluffy and buttery delicious. I will definitely go back. great place for brunch! they definitely over decorate the dishes with things such as fried pieces of noodle which have no function except to look pretty. but aside from the excessive decorativeness of it, it's pretty good stuff. hearty portions for decent prices. large windows and a good vibe. i like this place! Great service!Great food!You have to try the Millionaire's Way Bacon!!! It is so good!!!We also had the Finger-Lickin' Chicken and East Feeds West Dinner!Both are very good.Definitely going back and telling friends!!!Wait staff was very attentive and helpful. Hello California burger!  Oh my!  Perfections!  It was a slightly chilly Saturday afternoon, we drove by on our way to Starbelly but the crowd was too packed there and saw that Kitchen Story had outdoor seating and looked cute.  Keep in mind, I have a 16 month old, so it has to be kid friendly and away from the crowds. Although it was chilly from the wind, but I was able to pull up with the stroller and plop down for brunchGreat menu, you know the kind that you can't decide because everything sounds so good.  Was in the mood for breakfast food.  Plates upon plates going by us and I was salivating.  I asked the really nice waiter, what should I get?  He gave me a few popular items frequently ordered by many, I asked him about the steak over rice, he said it is popular but can't say much about it because he does not eat beef.  I told him I was feeling like brunch eggy meal.  What does he recommend?  The California Burger.  Yeah, coming from a guy that doesn't eat beef.  Taking a risk, I went with it.  Man, when it arrived.  My eyes popped out, it looked amazing.  My first bite, in heaven.  Perfectly cooked juicy burger, on a sweet  toasted bun, topped with generous amount of avocado and sprouts, smeared with a mild goat cheese (lovex3).  The potato wedges, they were perfectly fried and seasoned.  It stayed crispy the whole time  and the pickle was also very crunchy and nicely brined.Best part of the meal?  I get to have my burger with a Thai ice tea, strange but it was a good marriage.I have to stay, service was really really good.  3 different waiter coming by asking if we were comfortable, checking on the baby, ask if we were cold and want to move inside, just really sweet staff.Can't wait to go back with more friends, that way I can try everything else they have. so good! must try the fried chicken with mushroom sauce. Beef omurice! stuffed ricotta French toast is a must too!! WOW!Amazing food.  Very unique menu. Wonderful service.I had the best breakfast ever in SF this weekend.Make this a destination for breakfast or brunch you will be delighted.Cheers,J Although we live near here, we only decided to have breakfast here at 9am because the line at Brenda's was already 20 deep.  We were relieved to find it uncrowded but not empty at this time.  We both ordered the Marscarpone French Toast, one with eggs and ""Millionaire's Bacon"".  I ordered coffee.  It was so strong and bitter even with cream that I had to have a spoonful of house raspberry jam to make it until the mains were served.  Plating was impeccable.  The Marscarpone French Toast is kind of huge, really just a big fried filled doughnut, most reminiscent of funnel cake.  The bacon is interesting but would be nicer unsmoked.In short, I'm still curious about the other food but not really impressed.  Benedicts are usually the morning choice going out so I'd still like to try that. Pretty trendy. I don't think the quality of the food quite matched what they were charging, but lines were short, decor was nice, presentation was nice and service was excellent.Specifically, I got the KS omelet with berries and a cappuccino. The cappuccino was very good, but the omelet was disappointing. I suspect there were better choices though. The ricotta pancakes are so silky and delicious.  I didn't like their eggs or chicken mango sausage (too much sodium!) though.  A solid brunch choice, and the servers are so nice and attentive. But the quality of food is much better at my fave brunch place in Noe Valley. Amazing food & service this is a great restaurant. I think this is my new fav restaurant in SF! Will definitely be going back! One of the rare times that I just walked in somewhere before checking it out on Yelp, but thankfully it was this place. Got the Original Clay Pot, so freaking good. Perfect amount of food, unique and delicious. Scoped out some of the other dishes being served and everything looked really good. Millionaire's bacon was a treat indeed. Thick cut and caramelized but too spicy for me (I am very sensitive). Ricotta cakes were lovely - not too dough-ey and nicely topped with berries. Frisco benedict was ok; the bread was a little too over-toasted but the chicken apple sausage was nice combined with the avocado slices and poached eggs. The side of ""rainbow"" potatoes (mix of gold, russet, purple) was decent if not a tad salty. Solid brunch fare. This place has huge portions.  My friend and I only got salads which were tasty and filling, but we both admitted to drooling when we saw their other dishes.  Will come back for brunch and dinner to try everything else. I get kind of hangry when I have to wait more than 30-45 min for brunch, so I was pleased to find a place within walking distance in my neighborhood (just don't call it the Mastro, please!) where there wasn't a ridiculous wait, plenty of tables both indoors/outdoors, eye-catching decor and a solid Asian Californian inspired menu. On two separate visits for brunch and lunch, I enjoyed the Frisco eggs benedict with perfectly poached eggs coated in a lemony hollandaise, Mascarpone stuffed french toast and the spicy beef salad with tangy lime dressing. All were excellent and beautifully plated, although I think the salad was a touch over-dressed so it may be advisable to get the dressing on the side next time...Ooh, and the side of crispy rainbow potatoes were excellent as well (potatoes should always have fluffy insides!). I also find it delightful that they serve wine on tap and bottomless mimosas ($18), which are a lovely option for boozy brunch with the ladies. An excellent alternative to the weekend madness over at Mission Beach Cafe! I saw a huge brunch crowd here on the weekend, so I came back later in the week to try it for breakfast.  I ordered the mascarpone-stuffed, deep-fried french toast.  The presentation was great - it looked spectacular.  But it was delivered with a steak knife that turned out to be essential.  There was an overly-thick and hard crust on the outside than was challenging to cut through and a little greasy.  Looks: 10, Taste: 3. Most trendy breakfast places in SF leave me thinking ""what's all the hype about?"".  Not Kitchen Story; this place delivers!They have delicious food, great service, and although it's crowded, you still get seated in a timely manner. Both my wife and I loved our dishes. Marscapone French toast with perfectly fluffy eggs and bacon and a unique and tasty spin on steak and eggs dish with potatoes and a croissant. I can't wait to go back.  We sat at the bar and saw a number of dishes at the service window that we want to try next. You know how hard it is to get a reservation for a large group in SF?  Well, this was one of the rare places in the city that would take a reservation for 7.  I researched this place and made the reservation based on reviews.  It's been a couple of weeks since I was there so I forget exactly what I ate but for an Asian fusion restaurant the food was good!  I do remember finishing my  entire plate and everyone else enjoying their food as well.  Some had wine and some had bubbles.  My friend who is a local found this new establishment pleasing (I think he said it used to be Tangerine).  The staff was helpful in keeping our water glasses full.  Our server was very attentive to our needs.  I would love to come here again. Delicious and superb service.  Love it! A new brunch place serving breakfast until 3pm? Why thank you very much, I will be there! And I was and it was good.The prices are Castro and San Francisco sized that is to say on the high end with everything being 8-14 dollar and most over 10.So if you are ok paying that much for breakfast then this a good choice. There was plenty of tables free on a weekday afternoon. The menu has mix of so much from  jook inspired to dishes to fried chicken and burgers. We stuck to the breakfast side of things with the Ribeye omurice (14)scrambled eggs over jasmine rice, marinated ribeye, carrots, cherry-pepper, spinach, scallion.Demi glazed sauce. It wasn't what I was expecting but it was good. It was scrambled omlet seved over fried rice with bit of streak in it and gravy poured over everything. It was a huge portion and served with great potatoes. The French Spouse had the Artichoke watercress pesto benedict(13) bacon, artichoke, tomato, pesto hollandaise without the bacon. This not your typical benedict with the hollandaise with lighter, but it was super tasty and again a huge portion.The servers seem to be the same folks as when it was Tangerine and the service was good. The remodel is quite nice and it's a bright space that should be ok for ASL speakers and for the hard of hearing. It's wheelchair accessible. Burger with maple syrup & bacon & amazing potatoes.....enough said! Many people have been suggesting that I'm missing something great by not checking out Kitchen Story, so here goes and I'll start with the burger itself which was truly great.  Tall, filled with an acre of sprouts and fashion designer greens with a steak knife plunged into the heart of the matter, this burger is a sight to behold and before taking my first bite I tried one of the extra crispy potato wedges, and they're perfect albeit scarce on the tired white restaurant issue platter.  A child's handful of bright red pickled veggies rounded out the presentation.  First bite showed the thoughtful burger concept in play here, touches of avocado, the melted white cheddar, the ripe, fresh tomato, the herbed mayo and a trace of balsamic glaze, all between a dense, toasted artisan bun and I experienced burger ecstasy and it became a burger I'll be returning for as long as they hold true to the current content and execution, it's truly top notch in every way.  The physical restaurant has had many incarnations and this one is almost a neutral design, simple, clean and understated as in a lack of ego perhaps by these owners.  Service was charming as well as professional and putting it all together, Kitchen Story is a win, win, winner.  Check was presented on a truly forgettable paperback novel, Bonita Faye by Margaret Mosley,  with and old fashion clothespin holding the check to the book, bravo for the little things in life. The brunch is excellent!I've also had the ""Finger-Lickin"" fried chicken with curry: Yum!The burger is pretty fantastic, but I just don't think it's $18's worth of fantastic.Very friendly service, nice decor, I'll keep on coming back! First off, I would like to say that this place had high hopes of being 5 stars for me. What went wrong: My party was 4. They brought out 2 of my party's brunches then made us wait 20 minutes until the 3rd plate came out and then finally brought mine another 15 minutes later. I'm not sure what place expects their customers to each 35 minutes between one another but that was pretty unacceptable to me. We were there to eat together, not eat, wait a half an hour and then wait around until the rest of the party ate. I had the Frisco Benedict. Unfortunately my eggs were fully cooked through. They put hard boiled eggs on top of my Benedict- not an ounce of yolk to be had. The waiter apologized and said he'd be back right away with some poached eggs for me and that I should just continue eating. Guess what? He forgot. I can deal with poached being completely cooked but don't promise to bring me something then just not follow through. After waiting 10 minutes and realizing they weren't coming I simply finished. The last I saw him was when he brought us our check. What they did right:The bottomless mimosas were awesome. From the food I did have, it was quite tasty. 2 of my party had the french toast and the millionaire bacon- it was delectable. I might consider trying this place again, but I had such a bad experience, I probably would rather go elsewhere where they actually care. This place is awesome. We've gone there twice now. Everything we ate was cooked perfectly and presented in such a fun way. We ordered: -Millionaire's bacon- OMG, make sure you order this-Ahi tuna scoops- very fresh-Finger lickin' chicken- great yellow curry sauce and fried chicken-East meets west- I think that's what it's called. the pork falls off the bone and the rice and cucumbers are fantastic-Pumpkin curry- this was pretty good, but I'd choose the above stuff before I ordered this again.The staff is super friendly too. We will definitely be back again. Went to dinner with a friend last night. We split the Millionaire appetizer, which was very good. My piece of bacon was a little on the spicy side for me but was still very good.   I had the black cod with bok choi. It was delish.  My friend had the short ribs (I think) tacos. The meat was very tasty. I also ordered the Burgah to go for my BF. who loved it. He was very happy. Service was pretty good although it table was so far back I felt like I was sitting in the supply area. I would go again for dinner and would like to try brunch. Bottomless mimosas!!!And the brunch was delicious!! Wanted to order everything from the menu...Service was friendly and they take reservations!! The brunch was not only beautiful but so super yummy. Good job!Perfect poached eggs. If you think that Kitchen Story (stupid name by the way) has a story to tell...think again. Listen to my story and heed notice. It will all end in tears! And those tears are Mine!My friend Kristy and I were contemplating on a place to have brunch in our neighborhood. We've pretty much tried everywhere else and wanted something a little different. She suggested Kitchen Story and was like, ""hmmmm, not to sure about that place? Isn't it basically a new Tangerine? Right?"" We both contemplated Kasa but ended up saying what the fuck! Why not? Let's give it a chance. First mistake.The place was pretty busy and it seemed promising. The brunch menu was a mish-mash of Asian/fusion brunchables and the like. Asian Brunch. How bad could it be? Second mistake.We were seated relatively quickly (at the bar) and our waitress was prompt enough. Her English wasn't the best and this showed in the way we had to rephrase our questions to the various items on the menu. For example, my friend Kristy wanted a side of avocado but was told NO, they don't do that. OK? Well then, never mind.Only to find out 5 minutes later that they do sell sides of avocado. We found this out by looking on back of the menu under the sides section. HUH? I guess we were not clear enough. Third mistake.I then inquired about the Okonomiyaki plate. Now get this...they charge $11.00 for this plate and then an additional $5.00 to add on an egg and bacon or sausage or an additional $2.50 ($17.50?) for their millionaire bacon. Seriously?!?!? So I asked if I could just order an egg, I didn't need any meat on top of my Okonomiyaki anyway. She said NO, I have to order the egg with the meat. OK? Well then I'll take a side of eggs (2 eggs @ $3.00) for the top of my Okonomiyaki. Fine, this should be good. I've had this dish numerous time and I know what to expect. Yum...I'm excited! Fourth mistake.FUCK! Was I wrong! What arrived was a DEFLATED, DEAD LOOKING, NAKED CORPSE of a Okonomiyaki on the counter before me! I thought it was a joke at first. They must of forgot the fixings? It must be arriving on another plate? WRONG! Fifth mistake.I was fucking annoyed! No, I was pissed! Really? There was absolutely nothing on top of my ""seafood pancake""! No garnishes what-so-ever! No cabbage! No Carrots! No katsuo Bushi! NOTHING, except (now get this) a few (6 strands) alfalfa sprouts, a slice of a strawberry and a slice of an orange with a tin ramekin of their (spicy mayo). Wow! They saw me coming. What a RIPP-OFF! I was really disappointed.Remember, we were sitting at the bar. So we could see everything that was coming out of the kitchen. Every other thing that came out of that kitchen looked good. Looked substantial. Looked alive. My plate looked DEAD! Kitchen Story was obviously trying to up-sell this dish. An extra $5.00 to add on to what normally comes with this dish? MAJOR CROOKS! Needless to say, when the waitress finally (yes finally) came by to check on our meal, I let her know that I was disappointed. She did not ask why and/or even inform the management about my albeit small predicament. So, when I caught the manager's attention I had to let her know that I was very dissatisfied with my meal and if they are going to serve Okonomiyaki that they should at the very least throw some chopped cabbage or carrots or something just to keep it from looking so DEAD! Of course she tried to justify the dish by saying that there were chopped veggies in the Okonomiyaki and that's how it comes. Blah, blah, blah. Really, excuses? Save it lady! I didn't even want to be comped. I just wanted the management to know and to tell the owner that they were serving a poorly executed dish at a disgustingly high price-point. I think I was beating a dead horse (which I should have ordered, anything would have been better then the shit they just served me). The manager just did not seem to care. Final mistake.I will never come to this restaurant again and I will tell anyone who is willing to listen, the reasons why. If I could give less than one star I would. This place is too expensive for what you get.Poor to adequate service and a cavalier (at best) attitude towards any constructive criticism. Next time we are going just around the corner to Kasa @ 18th and Noe. Just had brunch here with my daughter--sooo good!  People were waiting, not surprising as it was Sunday noon on a perfect warm day.  Wait for an outside table was a half hour but we were seated inside in less than ten minutes.  Extremely nice floor manager, extremely nice and efficient wait person.  I had a scramble with millionaire's bacon; she had the stuffed french toast.  Everything was really beautifully presented and beautifully cooked.  My eggs were just perfect, better than I can make myself.  The bacon is a treat if you have never had it--others have called it bacon candy and that is a good description.  My daughter's french toast was very good but she will probably go back to the Benedict she had last time.  Our favorite component was the potatoes though.  Crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside.  They were still delicious at the end of the meal when they'd cooled--I don't know how they did that but they were the star of the show.  Oh, and bottomless mimosas were fun.  Unlike some places, our glasses were refilled every few minutes.  Yummy food, great experience-we will be back! Excellent brunch and no wait.  Enough said. Mascarpone French Toast with Millionaire's bacon were great unique breakfast.  That's why the ratings are high.The Ribeye Omurice was good but my expectations were a little too high.  We were hoping it would blow us away but it didn't.  It was much likely healthier than HRD Coffee Shop's BBQ Pork Scrambled Eggs over rice but wasn't as tasty.  Will definitely return as this place is very promising, Really great meal.  The calamari and the Spicy Kobe Rolls were some of the best apps I've had in a long time, and the ""Dancing Queen"" Wagyu Beef was delicious. Service was great too. Definitely coming back soon! This is a great addition to dining in the Castro.  And, the price is moderate. The food has been uniformly good on the three visits I've made, and the service was excellent. Kitchen Story is restaurant that serves California cuisine with a touch of influence from Asia.  The owner Steven Choi is originally from South Korea, as well as bioengineer with passion for food.  He confessed that there's a lot in common between bioscience and cooking, they both require recipes. His invention, ""millionaire's bacon"" has attracted the attention of the Food Network and brunch goers alike.  It's something I regret not tasting while there; however, it will definitely end up in my belly in the future.The restaurant is located in the Castro neighborhood, so it's no surprise it's stylish, a modern and yet very cozy decor with earth tones used throughout. The ambiance sets the tone with high expectations for the cuisine.  But not to worry, the dishes were exceptional and delivered flavors that are foreign and lacking at most brunch establishments.  For example, I absolutely adore the KS's Own Omelette, which incorporates pork wine sausage, lemongrass, asparagus, bell peppers and soy sauce. I have never tasted an omelette this different and so complex in flavor.  Who would think soy sauce would be such a great partner with eggs.  The ingredients tasted fresh and the eggs were super fluffy.  The rainbow potatoes were equally delightful; the three types of potatoes were perfectly roasted, crunchy with soft interior, and without the common grease accompanying them.  The butter croissant finalized the dish, but ended up leaving the restaurant with me.  The coffee was also brewed to dark perfection.  I definitively have no complaints and only accolades for this place.The staff did not deduct from the experience and if anything complimented the decor and dishes with their professionalism and attentiveness.  My java and water were always full without requests and the food was delivered piping hot.  By the way, they offer free internet, just need to ask for the passcode, as they change it frequently to prevent the local building residents from enjoying free internet in their residence.I shall return as soon as feasibly possible!!!  The millionaire's bacon and the egg pancakes will be part of the next kitchen story. We came here this morning for brunch! Let me just start by saying that we finished everything on our plates. Everything! And that never happens. Our order: -Deep fried french toast: I was a bit off put by how dark the breading was, but it was still very good nonetheless. I liked the fruit it came with and the mascarpone was just enough to make it moist, but not overwhelming. I liked this one more than my boyfriend, but he's not too partial to sweets. The stick garnish is deep fried spaghetti! -Millionaire's bacon w/ two eggs: great bacon! They're just like short ribs! Thick cut with a bit of sweet and spiciness. The spiciness is what really made it special to me. The eggs were done well and the croissant, well...that could be improved, but I know it's not the star of the dish. The rainbow potatoes weren't very crunchy, but I liked the idea of them. The coffee was good and the service was okay. Sometimes it was a bit spotty. Like, we asked for more coffee and didn't get any, but then a person other than the one we asked noticed we needed more, so it was brought over. Then, we asked for the check and it took a while to get there--longer than I would have expected, especially during the morning when they should be trying to turn tables over. My water was refilled many times, which was nice though. Although, one thing that could be improved, is the bathroom situation. There are two bathrooms, I went to the one on the left and the top of the toilet tank was off, making for something unsightly. It wasn't overtly ""dirty"" but it really didn't have a clean feeling and made me uncomfortable :/ Overall, it was a good meal though and I'm glad to have tried it. Short story, we booked through open table 8 days ago for a table for 6 at 9:45pm. We were refused entry or service with one member of our group arriving at 9:43pm (but not checking in?) and the other 5 arriving at 9:47/48pm. We were told ""there is no restaurant in America that takes people at 9:45pm if the restaurant is closing at 10pm and the guests are expected to leave by 10:30pm"". Get a new manager and new servers, change your attitude - how unfortunate as my friends and I loved getting brunch at Blackwood in the Marina. Long story: There were 3 people in our party who had just come in from Philly and New York, one arriving directly from SFO and there was one other on his way out of the country later that evening. I had organized a booking at a restaurant that was willing to take a party our size that late at night specifically because of all the logistics. I thought I planned it all out - the restaurant is 5 minutes from my apartment, little did I know what was to follow.My friend from the airport arrived at 9:43pm and stood outside, the remaining five strolled in to see her in a conversation with someone from the restaurant at the door. Turns out this guy doesn't understand what Open Table reservations are, and that if they close their kitchen at 10pm they shouldn't take reservations electronically past 8:45 or 9:15pm, simple as that. This guy was outraged that we would even consider doing what we did - show up at a restaurant to eat food at the specified time of our reservation. Ridiculous - was really looking forward to the food, but this guy needs to at least acknowledge that this was a mistake on their part and they would correct their Open Table settings on their end, or follow up with people who reserve past a certain time. Pathetic. We were lucky that Chow was open and were able to have a relaxed hearty meal there. Walked in here without a reservation around 8pm on a weekday and had no wait to sit at the bar. This place isn't huge but they have a decent amount of seating as long as your party isn't large. Nice modern decor, and friendly service.Started off with a 1554 which is one of my favorite dark beers, haven't seen it in a restaurant for a while so this was a nice plus. They also brought us complimentary crispy yams with the beers which were deliciously crunchy which just the right amount of salt.The ""Burgah"" Boy burger was good. Especially the bacon on top of it which was decadent and delicious, think thick juicy candied bacon (not the crunchy kind). I think the bacon is their signature ingredient, seems like you can get it on a bunch of different dishes or by itself.Also tried the Dancing Queen which is essentially steak slices on top of ginger flavored brown rice and green beans. The steak was pretty good, the sauce and the rice add extra interesting to it, the most fun part is the 151 they pour on top and _light on fire_ when they serve it to you! Note to all restaurants: I'm a sucker for food lit on fire.Finished things off with the coffee gelato desert. Basically a ball of coffee gelato with sweetened semi-liquid espresso in the middle and coffee grounds shavings sprinkled on top. I love coffee and coffee flavored deserts so this one really hit the spot! First of all this is not a 5 stars restaurant with table cloth that you pay $35+ a dish so I didn't expect their service would knock my sock off. Cut them some slack,people! I never had a bad meals or bad service here! The food is well priced. Grilled KOBE beef for only $20??? The service is as good as you can get for a new restaurant that has just been open. I just appreciated that they brought something new and decent to the area so we have more choices to choose from. I heard their brunch is really good too. Can't wait to try it! I normally don't like to write bad reviews of restaurants, but I just can't help myself with regard to Kitchen Story. What is the story with Kitchen Story? We walked in and the place was almost empty when we arrived, and we were asked whether we had a reservation. Wishful thinking! The food was just awful. My wife and I tried the Castro Tower and the Ahi and other ingredients were awash in some sort of sugary syrup. My wife thinks she had the beef salad, but wasn't really sure because it was drowning in dressing. I ordered a curried salmon, and it came out deep fried like fish and chips. It was overcooked and I had to scrape off the greasy battered coating which was thick and hard, soaked through with oil. What a waste of a perfectly good fish. It was sitting on a bed of some Asian vegetables that were slathered in a greasy sweet sauce. I asked for additional vegetables in lieu of rice, and they offered a salad. They actually brought out a bowl of salad greens with no dressing - someone literally grabbed some greens out of a bucket and through it in the bowl. Forget about getting some ground pepper on the salad! When I was finally able to get the waiter's attention and ask whether I could have some dressing, he said he would ""check and see."" I wasn't given an option and he eventually brought out a dressing that he claimed was a vinaigrette. It was so loaded with sugar, I couldn't eat it. The waiter then tried to pour my wife a second glass of beer without asking - which we sent away, and then he snatched away her plate without asking whether we were done - I guess he already knew the answer to that question. With both of our stomachs growling and acid reflux jumping up our throats, we finally made our exit after paying a five star bill for a one star meal. Please don't waste your time or money or risk your intestinal health by dining here.  We have been to at two other restaurants located in this same location; sadly, Kitchen Story is destined to be just another flash in the pan on this great corner. How do I know when I tasted something truly delectable? I usually dream about it afterwards.Yup, there you have it, I had a dream this weekend...the main character was that beautifully smoked (looked it), mouth-watering, thick and chewy Millionaire's Bacon all wrapped in a slight caramelized sweetness. I woke up with a dire craving.Needless to say, my Friday night dinner was delicious! Had Millionaire's Bacon for appetizer; had scallop wrapped in Millionaire's Bacon (a.k.a Big Hug) for main course. In between, also tasted Ahi Scoops (yum!) and Spicy Kobe Rolls (so-so). I finished off the night with a big mug of Thai Ice Tea.Total satisfaction. I wanted to like this place more than I actually did. Everything was just a little bit off. I went for dinner two weekends ago and for brunch this past weekend. We'll just go dish by dish.We had the Ahi Scoops, which were pretty delicious, and I liked the different textures, but they were just too big and awkward to eat.My boyfriend had the Big Hug, which was pretty delicious. The Millionaire's Bacon was as delicious as everyone says it is. I had the short rib tacos, which were not that impressive. The meat was pretty dry, but the guac was pretty good. For breakfast, my boyfriend just had two eggs over easy with the millionaire's bacon, which were delicious. I had the Athenian Omelette, which I really did not like at all. The olives made me feel sick, and the cheese was just too creamy.I liked the rainbow potatoes, but I think I'll stick to our other spots for brunch. love it!!!... food, service, ambience. awesome!!!i will go back for those yummy ricotta pancakes. :) BREAKFAST BREAKFAST BREAKTAST.  Some of the best breakfast in the city.  The millionaire's bacon is like pork candy.  The Ricotta hot cakes have ruined all other types of hot cakes for me. Great neighborhood spot. I'm not a huge fan of the name but the food is outstanding!  Get the ahi scoops & the ahi salad! Mmmmmm..P.S. They are very accommodating to people with dietary restrictions (e.g. gluten-free) Let me just start by saying that I'm a server and I eat out all the time. Nonetheless, I'm not very picky about food or service. I'm not haughty about being a server so I can critique the service of others; on the contrary, I'm very empathetic.So I came here for brunch at around 2pm on a Saturday. It wasn't busy. There was no wait. I was a single party and I got a seat outside right away, which was nice. The bottom line with their product, in my experience, is that it looks nice but tastes bad. The Bloody Mary had a beautiful garnish, but tasted horrible. I've had many Soju cocktails, so it wasn't the absence of vodka that bothered me, it was the fact that the ""mix"" basically tasted like straight tomato juice with some slightly spicy element. It was nothing tasty or creative. There were chunks of something in the drink which made it annoyingly impossible to drink from the straw. There wasn't a lot of ice and it clearly wasn't shaken so it was warm. I couldn't finish it.I got an egg white scramble with white cheddar and spinach. The menu says that no substitutions are allowed, which I totally understand, but I asked if I could add a couple things and my server said I could. I asked for avocado and mushrooms. She blurted out a noise that basically implied I was asking too much and pointed to the part of the menu that said no substitutions. I'm not substituting anything I'm adding a couple things which you just said was fine, but if it's difficult for the kitchen I do not have to do it. They did it. Thank you. I don't want to be difficult.The food came 30 minutes later (which I didn't complain about because I understand what it's like to work with a small kitchen) only after another server who brought my drink earlier said himself that he was surprised my food hadn't arrived and went to get it for me. It looked nice. They use different colored potatoes and serve their breakfast dishes with a cute croissant. I expected roasted breakfast potatoes like the ones that are served at most restaurants, but they were fried. I couldn't have known because they're just called ""rainbow potatoes."" I think that's gross but that's only my personal opinion. The croissant looked great, but was dense and hard. The scramble was bland and the spinach hadn't been properly drained so the whole thing was wet and runny. Very underwhelming and really kind of surprising.Now for the service, if you want to call it that. You don't have to be a server to know that the first thing you say when you approach a table is, ""Hi. How are you?"" It's very easy. Instead I got, ""Are you ready?"" Whatever, I'm not sensitive so it's not a big deal. I'm here to eat. She took my order. That was the last time I ever saw her again. Someone else brought my food, which is totally fine, but no one ever checked back. You ALWAYS check back! ""How is everything?"" That's all you have to say! Then finally, quite awhile after I finished eating (and I'm not a very fast eater), the guy drops off my check without saying a word to me. I don't think he meant to be rude, he just didn't know what he was doing. ""How was everything (yes, once more at the end)? Anything else for you today?"" It's not difficult! He dropped off a check presenter with nothing in it. I told him and he brought the check and I handed him cash. He brought my change back, but not the check, and dropped it on the table without saying a word. I asked for the check and he asked, ""Oh, you want your receipt?"" Um, yeah! At this point I called him back and, as nicely as I could, told him that the service was horrific and basically told him how to do his job. He sat down at the table and listened and was very receptive. He apologized and invited me back saying things would be different. I really was nice about it. Then I tipped him 40% because I kinda felt bad. They're not bad people, just bad servers. And with bad food to boot, I will not be coming back here, even it happened to be a fluke thing. We went here for dinner on a Friday evening with friends & two toddlers. We called 15mins ahead and when we walked in our table was ready. The food was so good! A very nice fusion of Thai & American. They can make their dishes mild to spicy you just have to ask. I thought Mom's Coconut Soup was the best I've ever had! The Mango Salad w/Prawns tasted like an American version of Som Tum Thai. The kids order of Fried Chicken w/steamed Rice had the largest chicken breast I have ever seen served off a children's menu. The whole table had to ""help"" finish the plate. Everyone raved about the crispy batter, juicy chicken & perfectly cooked rice. One suggestion: skip their mango sticky rice and order the Tri-O gelato. Yum! Also, their wine selections were good & wait staff was friendly, professional & efficient. We are definitely going back!!! Oh, The Millionaire's Bacon is so worth it! Tried Kitchen Story for the first time with friends last night and we all loved it. The food flavors were very good and interesting, the menu had a lot to offer, and the service was friendly. Every dish we ordered we each enjoyed. We had just been drinking, so we didn't explore the wine/beer offering. I definitely will be back and recommend this place to others. This place was good. Service was attentive, nice atmosphere. Food was slightly overpriced for what it is, but not particularly memorable. Especially the curry was nothing spectacular. We went for dinner. I would consider going back for brunch. The bacon seemed overhyped to me. I'm not a big review writer, but my first visit to KS for brunch was a HIT!  I had the mango chicken benedict and it was superb.  I don't know what they do to their potatoes, but they're the best I've had anywhere.  Multi-colored and super savory and cooked to perfection! The other items on the lunch & dinner menus sounded SO good, that we're going back for dinner tonight with friends.  YUMMY : ) We found this place on a list of what's hot in the foodie scene. A friend was visiting so we decided to try it out and are so glad we did. The food was really delicious and creative.We had:1) Kobe Beef spicy rolls-this was a bite of amazing. A big bite and you need the whole bite to get all the flavors in!2) Millionaires bacon-this was featured on some TV show and I know why-it was very good3) Eggplant-yummy. Fried crispy4) Short Rib Tacos-these were good. Good portion, good flavors. The tortillas could have been done a little better, a little more creatively5) Pad Thai-this was god Pad Thai6) Mango and sticky rice dish-this was my least favorite dish of the night- I didn't like itOverall the food was creative, fusion done well, priced right. I will go back soon, there were lots of things on the menu I want to try, so when I do I'll update my review.Nice food, nice people, good atmosphere, worth a visit! We dined at Kitchen Story on a Monday night. The service was lackluster at best. Our server was friendly, but largely inattentive. The food was outrageously overpriced - an appetizer with two strips of their famous bacon and two spears of asparagus was $12. The hamburger is $18, and doesn't even hold a candle to the burger at Nopa (which I think is less expensive).In a nutshell, if you're going to spend $50/person on dinner, go someplace with excellent service and better food. I love the ambiance and the food is good enough that it's one of the restaurants that I keep on my list.   Service is good too.  It's a nice casual restaurant where you can relax with your friends.  I definitely recommend. Yelp did it again! I don't know what I would do without Yelp now. Like how would I know that this place exists?Well my Adam found this place actually. But thru Yelp and his Yelp friends recommendation. We were both very happy with our first visit. I took in the decor and observed the staff while waiting for my order. Five stars for both!My deep fried mascarpone stuffed French Toast was unique and surprisingly not overly sweet. I like it but the toast was too hard for my taste. It is still good. This place is next door to Ike's Sandwich. So don't let the long line fool you. It's for them not for the Kitchen Story. In a further attempt to brunch the hell out of this town, I stumble into Kitchen Story. It had decent reviews on yelp, and I'm becoming more discerning in my brunch selections. Well...mostly being nicer because I realized I was being too picky with the yelp stars. =) Came here and got their KS omelet with millionaires bacon on the side. I tried the millionaires bacon at Sweet Maple and found it disappointing....and after this one, I realized I just don't like millionaires bacon as much as regular bacon. Or bacon at MBC. My omelet looked like it was prepared on one of those infomercial omelet plans - strangely perfectly half-circle, with rounded edges. Perfect scramble. The taste was fine, but I'm not as impressed with the cooking method. It came with rainbow potatoes that were cooked very well, and a mini croissant that was buttery and flaky...but didn't seemed to be baked in-house.The service was very attentive. A waitress came by to greet me on entry, and each of the guests at my table as they arrived. They were prompt to come by to help, but didn't seem pushy for us to leave. The owner (I think?) ate with his family there, and said bye to us as we left. How nice! I gotta say I was devastated when Kitchen Story replaced Tangerine.  I had great brunch memories there.  But...I guess good things were to come because brunch at Kitchen Story was even better.Our biggest worries about our visit to Kitchen Story: It's Sunday brunch in the Castro - EASTER SUNDAY - and we had a party of 5 without reservation.  We braced ourselves for the worst (hour+ wait), but were surprised when we were invited in with less than 15 minutes wait time!  BLESS THIS PLACE.Eggs and savory dishes highlighted the menu, perfect for the hungover.  There were even some intriguing, tempting Asian fusion brunch items like okonomiyake and ribeye omurice.Our group ordered:- Ribeye omurice (x2)!- Millionaire bacon- Ricotta pancakes- Marscapone stuffed deep fried french toast- Frisco benedictTaste:I was EXTREMELY impressed with the poached eggs on my Frisco benedict - poached to perfection!  My inner chef is jealous of their skill.  The ingredients for this benedict were impressive as well - crunchy (not soggy) toast, chicken mango sausage, avocado, cherry pepper, and that hollandaise sauce...creamy, but not too heavy.  The side of rainbow potatoes are also worth ranting about.  They're good. I gobbled everything up!  My friends were a little underwhelmed by the ribeye omurice, which they described as a PF Changs brunch remake. However, the ricotta pancakes and stuffed french toast were divine - loved the colorful arrangement of fruit toppings.  Millionaire bacon is worth trying to see what the hype is about.  But let's be real here - my eggs benedict was too good to share.Food presentation:  Probably some of the most beautifully presented brunch items I've ever seen.Service:  Our server was friendly and attentive!  She helped us out with menu items and made sure we were well taken care of.Speed:  Again, we were prepared for the worst, but our food came out in no time at all!I saw that there were bottomless mimosas ($16) here and might just have to come back.  Reasonable prices, beautifully presented and delicious food items, friendly servers, efficient service, and a comfortable setting to enjoy brunch with your friends.  Kitchen Story is on the map! This place has got to be my favorite eggs benedict restaurant in the city.  They do this unique thing where they place two poached eggs on top of one thick slab of toasted bread.  It's SO good!  The eggs were perfectly poached, with the yolk running down the avocado and bread once they were sliced.  The potato hash is delicious!  The hash seems to have a couple of different starches in it. It has different types of potatoes and sweet potatoes.  Perfectly seasoned.  I cleaned the plate even though I could have very well stopped at poached egg #1.  This place was busy for a Sunday brunch but my friend and I only waited for 10-15 minutes max.  I would totally come back to try their other breakfast items like their omelet.  This may very well be the best breakfast place in town for me. Just had a brunch here today to try out a different place.So I ordered the eggs benedict and my friend had some omelet. The reason i'm giving this place a 3 stars was because of my eggs benedict. I was expecting my pouched egg to be perfectly cooked but it wasn't. The egg yolk was cooked all the way instead of being runny :( and i think the bread was too crunchy. if the pouched egg was cooked perfectly it would have been better. that was a true disappointment. I actually could have asked for another plate, not because of the pouched egg not being cooked properly, because i found a little piece of aluminum foil mixed into my potatoes. I just didn't wanna deal with it because i was hungry. The omelet my friend has was actually better than mines :( Though the food was a bit disappointing, at least the service was good. The servers were nice and attentive service. I would give this place another try but i will definitely not get eggs benedict. Fried Chicken with curry sauce... millionaire's bacon... Kitchen Story is officially in my rotation now. The five stars are for the magical combination of three things that are hard to come by in San Francisco:1. They can handle large parties (think 10) without a problem.2. They have lots of delicious options for around $20!3. Fried chicken that is truly finger lickin' just like the menu says.I had to scour the city for a restaurant that was well-rated and would accept a reservation for our giant party, so I was ecstatic when I discovered Kitchen Story. In addition to the large party, the menu is so reasonably priced for SF. When we arrived our table was ready to go, and our server was on top of things. We brought in three bottles of vino ($15/bottle corkage fee), and he took care of getting those chilled and poured as needed without nary a complaint. Throughout the dinner, you couldn't even tell we were being served because everything came and went so seamlessly. For my entree I ordered the Finger-Lickin' ($18) fried chicken breasts, extra crispy with russet wedges, coconut Yellow curry dipping sauce, and cucumber salad. It's like my Southern aunt and Indian mom from a past life birthed a magical culinary baby. I couldn't shovel it into my mouth fast enough or get enough of the delicious curry sauce onto each bite. It is truly a must-try dish. Yes, there's also the burger and the amazing bacon, but don't snooze on the chicken! Cute place and decor.Friendly and attentive service.Typical brunch food.No wait for bar seating.This place is worth checking out if you're in the area.  And don't be deterred by the line you see outside, it's actually for Ike's. I know all the foodie brunchers in SF are into millionaire's bacon at the moment, but doesn't it get to be too sweet? That's diabetes and a heart attack waiting to happen. Fortunately, I exercise and am in excellent shape so I'm allowed to eat it as much as I want. It still gets to be too sweet for me though, but stick it in a BLT panini and it's perfect. French toast was good. Mango salad was good. Omelet was good.JONASAPPROVED! Brunch here was good but not great.  The bread under my eggs benedict was too crunchy for the dish.  The flavors were all good but didn't leave a strong impression together.  Millionaire's bacon was delicious, service was good. So far I have been to this place three times. I have to say ever time I have been greeted by the friendliest staff. The service has been great. My favorite dish is on the lunch menu during the week. ""Mom's Hotpot"". It is very tasty. Presentation is great, however not a dish for a youngster. The Hotpot is really hot and could burn little fingers. I have been to Kitchen Story 4 times now and it's absolutely my favorite restaurant in the city. Asian fusion at it's very best. They won my over with the finger lickin fried chicken on my very first visit. The burger was amazing. Every side they put on your plate has meaning and is full of flavor. I love the attention to detail. I just learned that they have omurice and I nearly fell out of my chair. I cannot wait to visit again. KS was part of the DishCrawl via airbnb.com! Had a great time in the rustic space. The sampling of the veg food was really good! The tofu was well flavored and interestingly presented. Very tasty. I will definitely go back for a full meal. two words: millionaire's bacontwo more words: bottomless mimosas i've been here for brunch three times in the last month, and i've recommended it at least 5 times to others. so, do your mouth a favor and try this great new addition to the castro brunch scene. Great service and food! San Francisco does food right, and Kitchen story is a prime example.  Wanting a dish that wasn't too heavy, I got the pan seared tilapia with mango salad.  The fish was served over ginger rice and topped with a cilantro-lime sauce.  The sauce of thick and packed a hard, flavorful punch.  For my taste, this menu item was perfect.Everyone talks about the ""burgah boy"" bacon cheeseburger, so it's what over half of my party ordered.  Lucky for me, there where leftovers that I was able to try.  The burger lived up to the hype.  While I haven't been everywhere in the city, Kitchen Story stands out as my favorite eatery in San Francisco. Asian fusion done RIGHT!For dinner I had:Kobe Beef Rolls: 4 stars: good flavor and bundled up in cucumber and spices, the mix of flavors were great and jumpstarted my palette well. East feeds west: 5 stars: tender organic pork shank with just the right sauce. I'm not a huge carnivore but this was SO GOOD. The lotus wrapped yellow curry rice was a nice complement and reminded me of the rice in the green leaves they serve at dim sum. Add on the cucumber salad and this dish is a winner and welll worth the $22!! Highly recommended!Millionaire's bacon: 5 stars: 2 slices of deliciously thick bacon doused in maple syrup and made to perfection. A little expensive at $12, but you can't leave here without trying it! No need to be a bacon lover (I'm not), you'll still like the dish!! My mouth is watering as I think about it... yum! First I should say, I am totally obsessed. I've been here 5 or 6 times now and every time I go it's a wonderful experience. I always get the Finger Lickin' (fried chicken with the most incredible curry sauce) and the Burgah Boy, which is probably one of my favorite burgers of all time. Their millionaire's bacon is ridiculously good, so anything you can get with it is a good choice. Their salads are also wonderfully tasty and a bit spicy. Really, you can't really go wrong with anything on their menu - everything I've ever gotten has been outstanding. I also love how cheerful and attentive everyone there is and I love the little touches (they seem to always bring a little something like biscuits or homemade sweet potato chips while you wait). All in all, it's a wonderful experience! I've been several times - brunch is typically mobbed. The brunch food is good, but not as creative as their standard menu.Incredible food, with great presentation. I love the ambiance - especially after dark - the lighting would make this nice for a romantic evening.Recommendations: the ahi scoops, any of their soups, and of course the bacon. Went here just after they opened.  As a gluten-free person, it's almost always the first thing I ask about. I was excited that they accommodate by using gluten-free soy sauce so that i didn't have to completely change up what i wanted. I ordered the fried rice, my wife ordered a vegetarian dish.Then...we waited...and waited...and waited.  When we arrived there was only 2 other tables that had been seated.  About 45 min after we ordered and noticed that the tables had filled up, my wife's entree came out. She said it was really good.  But we waited for mine.  We noticed several more people's food and our server assured us mine was on it's way.  About 20 min later, I asked again and the server came back and said that they had a mix up but it was coming out now.  When it arrived, it had two long vermicellie noodles sticking out of it.  I asked, ""is this gluten-free?"" and she said ""oh...no.  oops.  I'll have to have yours remade.""  Bottom line, they forgot about mine and tried to just make one real quick.  I asked them to make it to go as we were done and leaving.  The next day, when i had my food for lunch, i was amazed at how good it was.  It was very flavorful and i really liked it.Sadly, the experience tainted the restaurant for us and i don't know that we will return. (See pics) Review #1345. The lunch menu is happily filled with eggs on almost all dishes! And this is definitely fast moving to become my favourite eatery!Ribeye omurice is my favourite. It was with ground beef was mixed with rice and covered with scrambled eggs, and poured with some delicious glaze. It also came with a house made biscuit that was also very tasty. It also came with crispy small potato bites that were fresh and nice crunchy.The one thing was the scrambled egg did not seem to have egg white in it?Egg pancakes was also pretty good and not as substantial quantity.Each dish is beautifully presented. It's like edible art. And the portion was not small with some actually were quite big. My colleagues all liked their burger dishes and classic benedict on thick toast.The house made raspberry sauce was also quite good as a condiment.Apparently the raspberry lemonade was refillable.The place has a nice setting and even had red pepper plants on the table (rather than flowers.) Service was very sweet friendly. Will definitely have to check out the dinner menu as it is quite different. quite impressed!  Brunch was fun, inventive and delicious.  The wait staff was somewhat indifferent, but the host was funny and welcoming.  Food came out quick enough and was as good as it sounded. Cute place next to Ike's Place.  We stopped here for breakfast and were excited to try the millionaire's bacon that all the yelp reviewers were raving about, but they said they ran out.. (but it was only Tuesday?!)  I ordered the two eggs, with chicken mango sausage, and rainbow potatoes.  Eggs are eggs, the potatoes had good texture, and the chicken mango sausage was decent, but overall this dish is probably something I could have cooked on my own.  On the other hand, great service, clean restaurant, cute location on the corner next to Ike's Place, i HATE being the person who drags a review down...i think small businesses are great and deserved to be recognized. however, i also try to be an ""honest yelper"" and my honest opinion is that this place wasn't anything that special.our waitress was nice and attentive, which was really nice. the seating is cute with a lot of outdoor lighting, which is exactly what you want for a hangover brunch (lets be real, everyone in their is hungover!). there is even seating outside for those hooligans that are so hungover they need some fresh air.what really brought the score down for me was the food. i just didnt think it was anything special. i will say this with an asterisk* that i really liked my friends' omelets. those were yummy! unfortunately, the ordered the tilapia burger and the sheer size of the bread overpowered any texture or flavor you could taste from the tuna. i ultimately just ended up removed the bread and eating the tuna on its own, which of course was a pitiful size. that was yummy, but once again, was not how it was meant to be ordered.i would actually want to go this place a 3.5 but hey, you gotta choose a whole number and i was overall unimpressed. i do want to come back and give it another chance, because the overall environment was cool. a lot of cuties in the restaurant :) 06-March, WednesdayBy the time we had plated ourselves to a small helping of each of our dishes -one would have thought we had just attended an international pot-luck, although everything was cooked quite well, each dish was such an odd and ineffective pairing of flavors.  1. The Finger-licking is probably a pseudonym for a stomach ache with its batter fried chicken breasts, russet potato wedges, coconut yellow curry as the dipping sauce. This dish comes with a light cucumber side-salad to make up for everything else you're about to clog your arteries with.. but I guess similarly this appears to be a deconstructed, and reconstituted take on the traditional Thai yellow curry with chicken and potatoes.  2. Big Hug: thick slab of bacon wrapped around a bay scallop, grilled eggplant drenched in sauce, cilantro sauce, and garlic egg noodle on the side.  This dish appears to be an inverted type of burger void of a bun, whereas the alternative for the carb comes as a side of flat noodles.. hrrm, something seems off.I don't miss Tangerine one bit, but it would have been nicer if something else would have filled this space other than just another ill-conceived Asian fusion restaurant. Kitchen definitely gets 5 stars for presentation and their lavish interiors, but somewhere along the way the story gets very convoluted and lost. I heard this place is great for brunch, but I only came here for dinner. This place is very cute and nicely decorated. The service is terrific! I got a pad thai and it was really good, but I won't give  the full 4 stars because I have had better pad thai. The presentation is really nice though! The portions are really big, so come here with an appetite or share a plate. I'd come here again if I am in the area! A nice restaurant in Castro. The menu is not that long, but there was a fantastic variety. I was going for Dad's Spicy & Sour Soup with Tiger prawns, three mushrooms, Galangal, Kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass. For 8 a good choice. Really yummie and frehs but also really spicy. ;-) I found the small portion quite big. As mains Kitchen Story offers Pad Thai noddles with a choice of tofu, chicken, pork or beef or prawns starting from 10 to 14 $ (prawns). And you shouldn' miss the selection of different Curries served with Roti bread or Rice again with your choice of tofu, chicken, pork or beef or prawns. The curry varies from Red Curry with bell pepper, bamboo shoots and basil to Panang Curry with avocado, peanut, bell pepper, basil, crispy yam to Pumpkin Curry with bell pepper, basil, crispy yam. Most of my colleagues were going for the Burgah"" Boy with Maple Syrup Wagyu Patty, Millionaire's Bacon, Vermont White Cheddar, a rugula super crispy russet wedges and housemade pickle for $18. This one is supposed to be really yummie! The service was really good and the food was served very quickly after ordering. I would definitively come back! This place is phenomenal. Honestly. A MUST TRY. **Best Burger in SF IMHO**My sister and I went for a Monday holiday brunch meal and it was great.  I had the California Burger and it was out of this world. The candied bacon, oh my god. So good.My sister had the beef salad and felt similarly as I did. ExcellentI cannot wait to go back and try more of their food. I really loved this place!  All dishes were amazing and there was a fantastic variety.  I would definitely go back! We've been here at least a half dozen times. The food is tasty and the service is very good but  the noise level is so high you literally can't hear the person across the table from you. With wood surfaces everywhere sounds ricochet. I'm not sure we will return. We had three dishes and shared.  Everything was good.  My favorite was the crispy tofu and peanut salad!  Fresh and tasty!   The Castro seafood curry was just a tad too spicey, but the tacos and East Feeds West pork were amazing.  It is definitely worth a return. Despite the description, this place is GREAT for kids! We took our 2 year old here for dinner tonight. The waiter stored our stroller, brought out a cup of water with a lid and straw immediately, and gave her a small bowl of rice without us even asking! We had mom's coconut soup (piping hot and yummy), pumpkin curry with pork (slightly spicy, liked the avocado slices on top) and a ""burgah boy"" (awesome burger). We'll definitely be back, I hope this place makes it becasue I don't think the location is ideal for foot traffic. I heard it had great thai food so I went here for lunch. THERE WAS NO THAI FOOD. It's almost like two different restaurants depending on the time you go. If you go for dinner: Expect Thai food. If you go for breakfast or lunch: expect California Cuisine. The brunch food was good but again, I went there for the thai. Loved that they remodeled the restaurant nicely after Tangerine left as one must do these days when taking over another restaurant.  While their service is only so-so, the food, especially for brunch was excellent.  Their Millionaires Bacon was simply amazing and both entrees we ordered were very good as well.  It is rare that I would say how good a restaurant is based on brunch.  I am interested in seeing what dinners there are like... This is my new favorite brunch spot.  Do yourself a favor and go for the crack/cocaine I mean millionaires bacon.  I'm not a connoisseur, but I can't imagine pancakes better than the ones here ok fine i admit I think about them more than what is probably considered ""healthy"" by most medical professionals DON'TJUDGEME go to kitchen story/ All I can say is yum.  Been here for brunch and dinner.  Excellent comfort food done creatively  and deliciously.  Man, I wish I'd found this place earlier! Kitchen Story has amazing food, but for the type of foodie I am it's absolutely inappropriate. I'm much more a cheap eats sort of guy than a fancy California cuisine. I LOVED their sweet potato chips, I loved the feeling of the restaurant decor (nice tables), the staff was professional and courteous. We ordered the Ahi Scoops, Short Rip Tacos, and the Big Hug. My only complaint is portion size (but for all you SF skinnies this might be perfect) especially for the price of the food. But i understand because it's a totally very nice upscale restaurant, while my tastebuds are very plainclothes. Everything was delicious and that Millionaire's Bacon will kill ya! This place is pretty awesome -- and the 'millionaire bacon' is definitely worth the extra four bucks.  This review is based only on breakfast, but what was especially interesting for me was the wider choice of not-sweet breakfast items, like the okonomiyaki pancake.  I am definitely going to try the salt & pepper French Toast next time.  The sweet things are great too -- the lemon ricotta pancake was fantastic.  and the coffee was really good, as you'd expect. Last night I randomly stopped to eat at this restaurant, and was incredibly pleasantly surprised. The customer service was great. The ambiance was nice. Most importantly, the food was absolutely fantastic! I was a big fan of Tangerine (former restaurant in Kitchen Story's location), so was bummed it closed. I sort of was boycotting this new place. My mistake, as this is hands down one of my best dining experiences in a bit. Every dish we ordered was so good; in fact we ordered one of the dishes twice. This dish is called ""Millionaire Bacon"". Can I just say...""OMG""?! Succulent, tasty from the very first bite and leaves a very nice lingering taste on the pallet. Highly recommend this new place! Kudos to the chef and the staff. So my first experience here was on New Years. We started with a group of 14 people and KS was one of the only places that would let us make a reservation without a charge for canceling, which was a huge relief since, naturally, our number shrank down to about 10 a few hours before. It's so super cozy in there and everyone is so friendly! Really great vibe and the food that night was tasty.BUT THEN!!! I went there for brunch. Listen: out of control. The ricotta pancakes were mind blowing, as was the millionaire's bacon. I was spying on everyone's food around me and it all looked equally amazing. Can't wait to go back!! I went there last night for the first time. I was happy to find a place that would serve us at 9pm in the Castro. The food and service were excellent. The decor of the place is also very nice, a departure from the usual cheap Castro look.Highlights: chicken coconut milk soup (really a Tom ka gai), one of the best I have had, and the pad see ew, so yummy I would have licked the plate.I'll definitely go back on a regular basis. The ambiance and style of this California Cuisine restaurant is amazing. The food is so good and presented so artfully you almost dont want to break into your dish and change the way it looks. Spicy blends of California and Thai or Southeast Asian style foods give this place a unique menu. The decor and ambiance is lovely and is suited for couples and larger groups. Service is fantastic. Not sure about other meals, but brunch here paints a pretty picture. I got the 2 eggs with one of their signature dishes, the millionaire's bacon, which is thick cut bacon marinated in syrup for hours and basically tastes like sweetened beef jerky and is somehow simultaneously crispy and soft at the same time. A fun and unique offering to be sure, but I wasn't over the moon about it. The rainbow potatoes that come with it are perfectly crispy and not greasy, yet soft on the inside. My eggs over easy were cooked perfectly, with the yolk runny but not stampeding all over my plate, and I delighted in dipping my butter croissant in the gooey eggs and then using the strawberry jam provided on the table to deliver myself a sweet crunch. I also ordered a latte which was made with the perfect milk/foam/espresso ratio. Overall I was happy with the food.Note: They don't allow substitutions on their entrees for some reasonI really love the rustic atmosphere of this place, with the driftwood tables, open facing kitchen, and wide windows facing the street on two sides. There's an extra home-y feel added to it by the books stacked on shelves on one wall, as if you were just sitting in someone's extra fancy kitchen. Service was quick and non-invasive, and because of its close proximity to Dolores Park I would definitely come back here for a brunch/park day combo on a lazy afternoon. Been here twice for breakfast only and essentially it's Sweet Maple: Castro.  The eggs were fluffy and light, and although I didn't get the Millionaire's Bacon,  the regular bacon is pretty solid.  Service is pleasant and the interior is bright and chill.  The butter that comes with the croissant is super tasty too and the potatoes are just right.  Definitely will be another go to brunch spot in my hood! Gee, I didn't even get a chance to try Tangerine, but it sounds like it was in the same culinary ballpark as this new-fangled Asian-fusion brunch spot in the Castro. My friend Carlos was out from New York, so I was trying to think what would be new and hip that we could try for Sunday brunch. 'Brunch' is our euphemism for not being morning people and eating breakfast at noon. I had never heard of Kitchen Story before, but Carlos was told by his local buddy that we had to try the Millionaire's Bacon, the best thing on the menu.For some reason, I was thinking this would be a more basic-looking space, maybe because I inexplicably kept playing word association in my head with ""Tokyo Story"", the classic movie that was all about self-sacrifice and living simply. But this is the Castro, for Harvey's sake. Of course a new eatery there has to offer fashion-forward breakfast plates like an omelette with pork wine sausage and lemongrass and a deep-fried French toast stuffed with mascarpone. You can still find bacon and eggs, it's just that you have to look harder to find it.Carlos decided to try the $11 Classic Benedict, a pair of tightly poached eggs sitting atop a pork wine sausage patty, which in turn, sat atop a slice of levain toast. The Meyer lemon hollandaise sauce was poured liberally over the tower with multi-colored potatoes completing the plate (see photo). He liked his more than I liked mine, the $12 Red and Green Benedict, a vegetarian take with wilted spinach, roasted tomato, mushrooms, and instead of the hollandaise sauce, a fresh mango salsa mixed with some bean sprouts.I also received the same lukewarm potatoes, but without the lubrication of a sauce, it came across as dry and rather bland (see photo). That was a bit of a shame since the ingredients were quite fresh and the dramatic presentation befitting of the Castro in its theatricality. But I do have to say the aforementioned Millionaire's Bacon, which we ordered as a shared side dish, did live up to its hype - a couple of strips, thickly cut and candied in maple syrup, chiles and honey (see photo). It was indeed the best thing on the menu. And my coffee cup was never empty.FOOD - 3 stars...pretty presentation but blandness prevails with their benedict dishesAMBIANCE - 3 stars...busy but not too hecticSERVICE - 3 stars...attentive but bordered on intrusive with plates being picked up prematurelyTOTAL - 3 stars...a bit more spice and a mite less strain on the service might elevate my rating the next time Their ""signature"" bacon appetizer was basically was just really spicy bacon that's drenched in syrup.  We ordered the ""Dancing Queen"" which was merely a few stingy pieces of steak over this big bowl of rice carbs.  My ""Fingers licked"" better from going to Jack in the Box last night.  Average Food trying to be unique by pulling a few stunts that is not worthy of mentioning. The ""purgatory"" dish is unreal . So delicious 5 stars for breakfast/brunch! 4 stars for dinner.  I first came here for brunch, ordered the steak with rice and gravy (forgot the name of the actual dish, but I believe it's the most expensive breakfast dish on the top left corner of the menu) and it was so freaking good! Had a nice mimosa to go with that as well.  Came back recently for dinner, and ordered 3 appetizers: Castro tower, Crispy Calamari, and the Kobe rolls. All three appetizers were delicious and very yummy!  However, when I ordered the main course, ""Big Hug"" and tried my date's ""Dancing Queen"", I was a bit disappointed. The ""Big Hug"" had their famous millionaire bacon with it, but for me it was just too sweet. It's tasty, but just too much. And when I tried the ""Dancing Queen"", it looks nice and flashy, the steak was cooked perfectly, but the alcohol they use to pour over the rice to light it on fire made the rice taste disgusting. If you like alcohol (i think its' Bacardi 151 rum) flavored rice then be my guest and try ordering it, but I personally thought it tasted nasty.  Had dessert as well and was disappointed again that they have ""Choco Cake"" on the menu, but later informed us after we ordered it that they were ""out"", and this was around 630-7pm.   Overall, appetizers and service was great, not outstanding, but good. I'd highly recommend the appetizers here. No thank you to the main courses. But definitely would love to come back here for breakfast/brunch. On my first visit I was taken back by the price of the millionaires bacon (quantity versus price ratio) and the dry biscuits. However, I've returned many times and have been impressed every time. I've developed a fondness for their Thai fried rice with prawns,  amaze-balls! Also, the biscuits have been fresh every time I've returned, I'm guessing the first experience was a rarity. The service has always been top notch and unfortunately word must be getting out about this restaurant. Dinner time, especially on the weekends, is extremely busy. Increased my rating from 3 star to 5 star I'm not quite sure how this happened, but at like 9:30 this morning, me and the boy walked in the door to Kitchen Story and were seated immediately. On a Sunday. For brunch. Whaaaa?Though, to be honest, I had never heard of the place, so it's mostly the boy's incredulity I'm channelling because apparently there was a line out the door when he had been there the last time.Anyway, the food was super yummy, and for a pretty great price, especially for the area. I had the Mom's Benedict, which was super flavorful, and I really have no complaints (eggs cooked perfectly, hollandaise not glumpy, bread not too chewy, potatoes [loved that they were rainbow] crispy without being dry), except that it could have used a smidge more acid. That could just be personal preference though since I tend to prefer my hollandaise super lemony. Also, I wish my plate had been a tad smaller. Like the actual plate. The potatoes were pushed to the far edge so it looked like two different dishes. Empty space on a plate that is just set in front of you is just a little offputting, in my opinion. Or I'm being weird.Either way, I would return. Just after I hit all the other great brunch spots in SF Initially bummed to discover Tangerine gone tonight, we dined at its replacement, Kitchen Story, by default; the menu looked promising, the decor inviting and the vibe intimate and comfortable.  Overall, we were both pleased with our experience tonight.  We were seated at a table for two without much of a wait, and our server was extremely attentive and friendly throughout despite the busy Saturday evening.  We ordered the Millionaire's Way to start, which was an organic asparagus, crispy bacon and maple syrup sauce concoction.  It was pretty good, but the intensity of the bacon and sweetness of the maple sauce needed more than three small, thin sprigs of asparagus to make it a total winner (5 stars in the originality department, though)  Our mains were a medium spice red chicken curry (which was actually really, really spicy but still good) and the Finder Lickin', which was the night's clear victor: perfectly battered fried chicken, expertly prepared potato wedges, a nice cucumber salad and innovative coconut dipping ""sauce"".  The portions were also generous and everything came out at just the right temperature. Minor annoyances: No refills on soda, and a $3 price tag for a 12 oz. can. Kinda ridiculous.Feels slightly overpriced in general, actually. No alcohol and we paid $70 with tip.Again, medium spice= mouth lavaDespite the mild hiccups, I'm a fan of this Castro newcomer (someone finally broke the neighborhood's bad eats curse); with its friendly, efficient service, tasty food, and warm, cozy ambiance, I would definitely return for another page out of the Kitchen Story. I am a huge fan of this place. The menu has a unique Asian flair that is delicious and always interesting. The portions are very generous for the prices and the atmosphere is homey and cozy.  The staff are all very nice and give incredible service (I don't think my glass was every half empty for more than a minute).I came for dinner the week it opened and we ordered the Dancing Queen and East Feeds West. The presentation was impeccable (complete with flames!) and the dishes were absolutely divine.I've also come in for brunch with people that have completely different kinds of tastes (Including a vegetarian. I, on the other hand, eat most everything) and they were throughly impressed as well. On the brunch menu, I've had the Chicken Mango Melt, Franciscan Scramble and the Ribeye Omurice. All were delicious, although the Omurice could have had sliiiiiiggghty more ribeye :)I brought a group of 13 for brunch on an extremely busy Saturday- not an easy task to handle. However, they served our group with precision- orders were all correct and timely and their service was still on point. I will be coming back many times over. I live in the neighborhood so I would be thrilled to see this place thriving for many, many years to come. Go check it out! Bravo Kitchen Story! Thanks for the wonderful evening last night. Sorry we stayed past close. We just couldn't get enough. We really enjoyed every dish. The Pad Thai, the Green Curry, the Fried Calamari, the Hot & Sour Soup, the Short Rib Tacos, the Chocolate Cake - all we delicious and I will order each and every one again next time. It was so nice to meet the chef and talk to your servers who care so much about good food. You didn't just do a great job with the food and service you also did a remarkable job with the design of the restaurant. I really cannot wait to come back again. Next time I must come for brunch. See you soon. xoxo Overall: Pretty good food, but prices a bit steep for what's offered.Chicken Satay: Wonderful. Wagyu beef burger was expensive as hell and was about en par with Super Duper across the street on Market. Beef shank was nice, moist and flavorful, and crunchy on the outside. Great rice with spices as well. 3.5 stars for now - I think this place has the potential to be 4 or even 5 stars, and I do plan to give it a second chance in a few months, especially since I still have to try the millionaire's bacon.I'd been hearing rave reviews about this place from foodie friends, so I decided to check it out solo during a rare free Sunday afternoon.  I ordered the Franciscan scramble and a Bloody Mary (my first time trying it with soju, as they don't have a full liquor license).  The food was pretty good (would have earned 4 stars) - in particular, I found the chicken mango sausage in the scramble delightful and slightly unusual, and the potatoes were delicious. I usually don't eat the potatoes that come with a scramble at all, and here I finished the entire side.  On the other hand, the bloody mary was not quite what I was looking for.  I like my bloodies to have an even consistency, where thick, spicy tomato juice is the heart of the drink, accented by a punch from the (ideally) vodka.  KS's drink lacked the spicy kick I was hoping for and tasted a bit watery.  As I've never had it before with soju, I'm not sure if this was the fault of the soju or the fault of the tomato juice that they used.  It also seemed to have a lot of particles in it - I think celery, but I wouldn't swear to it.  The additional 0.5 star deduction is for a couple of snafus that occurred with my food.  My scramble originally came out unevenly heated - the outside of the meal was warm, but the inside was unpleasantly cold.  I let the waitress know, and she took it back to warm it up - and then when it was returned to me, it was missing the side of fruit, which I had to ask for.  I could tell that the staff had been trained in response to previous Yelp comments.  They definitely were sure to check in with me regularly to make sure everything was going well, and they did address my concerns when I shared them.  I like that this restaurant seems responsive to constructive feedback, and I hope my comments in this paragraph are taken in that light.I also liked the post-Tangerine remodeling of the place.  Looking forward to giving this restaurant a second shot for brunch in a few months, and I'll update the star rating if warranted. I was delaying coming to visit here for awhile since it seemed like the menu was all over the place (California-Asia-Breakfast-Burger). I live a couple of blocks away and I'm glad I finally came. This place is great! I went at dinner time and the menu seemed pretty consistently Cal-Asian. My Panang Curry was super flavorful and the fried chicken and chicken noodles were terrific according to the rest of our party. They've done a really good job of remodeling from what used to be Tangerine. Service was friendly, efficient and fast. I can't wait to try other items in the menu. Came for brunch on a late Monday morning. Place was relatively empty...I guess everyone else has a job or something. :) :/ : The food was pretty good. I liked my ""KS's own omelet"", and opted for the berries mix instead of the potatoes. The $2 extra was definitely worth it for a berry addict like myself. I also love that every entree I see come out had this crispy stick thing poking out of it skyward. It was edible but mostly for decorative purposes. I just appreciate that they put in that little bit of extra effort to spruce things up.The servers were very attentive and gave us the semi-pro-tip of putting the jam on the cheese biscuit. Sweet and savory and best.Will definitely come back again! I was super impressed with both the food and the service.  Great comfy vibe with food that has extra flavor than average.  Staff is nice and wait is short.  Doesn't disappoint. Short wait (~15 mins around 12pm), great service, delicious food, cute decor. I decided to get the artichoke watercress pesto benedict with bacon, which was so good-- one of the best eggs benedicts I've ever had. The dish also comes with mixed potatoes and a couple pieces of fruit. My boyfriend and I also decided to order a side of their MIllionaire's bacon after seeing pictures on Yelp. If you're wondering what it is, imagine regular bacon twice as big, coated in maple syrup of some sort. Amazing. I definitely recommend this place and wouldn't mind going again. A solid 4 star breakfast experience, and I will be back for dinner. I went here after Yoga with 2 others and we were all happy. The service was very friendly and fast. We had standard breakfast items but they were all above average, and my breakfast potatoes with fried onions and cheese were OUTSTANDING. I want to try the millionaire's bacon next time which is apparently slow cooked for 4 hours. We just beat the Sunday rush and judging by the lines and how full the place was, our experience was not out of the ordinary. Recommended. Get the French Toast.  Don't regret it.  Drink bottomless mimosas :)  Service was great. A ""asian-fusion"" restaurant that was not pretentious, FINALLY! Oh yes the prices were super affordable, minus the side order of ""millionaire's bacon"" which is approximately $6.50, yikes.  I opted for the BLT Panini instead which comes with the bacon, and the most delicious rosemary fries EVER. I dear not lie. They were the most addicting wedge cut rosemary fries too. The oil was fresh. The fries were perfect, each wedge. How do they do it? Golden and crispy on the outside, pillowy and hot on the inside. Not greasy at all!The BFF ordered the ribeye omurice, and whoa was it hearty but super delicious. The egg omelet was fluffy and the whole dish came with home fries and this wonderful chive cheese biscuit with their homemade jam. I think I found a new favorite brunch place in SF. Yes parking can be difficult here, but I like who it's not hipstery/pretentious. The menu provided lots of options which was great too. I'm not going to lie, I was pretty disappointed in Kitchen Story.  My company was excellent, but the food was not worth the cost.  I had the Finger Lickin' and while I enjoyed the fried chicken, the potatoes were crispy but tasteless.  The side of yellow curry, which is what most excited me about the dish, was unbelievably bland.  I dipped everything on my plate into it hoping that eventually I would be rewarded with a modicum of flavor, but was deterred at every depression of my fork.  The introductory salad was forgettable.  I was also not impressed with the Pinot Grigio they serve.  Our server was prompt, but awkward.  Had I paid $6 less for my meal this would be three stars, but given the hype, I just don't see the reward for indulging in a Kitchen Story. Newly opened in November, but Kitchen Story reeks of the space's previous tenants, Tangerine; Asian fusion, mediocre brunch...I'm experiencing déjà vu. Every portion of my brunch plate underwhelmed me. Biscuit--dry, chewy, undercooked? Rainbow potatoes--like the concept of three different potatoes, but these were dried out & overcooked. Athenian omelet--arugula, goat cheese, olives, mushrooms...eggs could have stood to be fluffier. I tried to make an open table reservation, but no tables were available. Funny, between 10-11am when we brunched, the restaurant was only half full, so what's up with that drama?Dishes were served quickly. Our waiter had a good sense of humor. But, dull food & so-so quality does not make me want to spend my brunch bucks here a second time. Maybe I'm destined to not like any restaurant in this particular space. It was winter break of my final semester of school ever (maybe) which meant bottomless mimosas on monday at 3pm. Bottomless mimosas for 18? Excellent. Lucky for us, a reporter was on hand to capture the moment and publish it in the WSJ. (Yes, I'm that awkward red head holding her fork like a gremlin.)Entrees? Also excellent. I ordered the pork bibimbap and holy hell it was fantastic! Like really really good! And the portion was huge, I definitely enjoyed the left overs for dinner. I thought it might need sriracha but no, it was great and flavorful as presented. Looking forward to many a boozy brunch here with my mancat and my girls. Cute Asian Fusion place. Came here on a sunday night. Ordered their chicken satay which was so good with the roti and their cucumber and carrots. For entree I ordered their pad sew which was very flavorful. This place i heard has great brunch. Still need to come here for their brunches. Really cute place near the castro, yet parking was a bit hard to find. My new favorite restaurant!!The food was EXCELLENT as was the service, environment, speed at getting food to the table, cleanliness, and given all of that so was the price.  A friend took me there to dinner during the week so we were seated immediately and the start of our food was at the table 10 minutes after ordering.  It is probably more crowded on the weekends at for brunch.  The best was the bacon which was more like smoked, crisped, sweet pork belly.  The french fries were fresh and crisp and by far the best in the Castro.  Hmmmm, maybe the hamburger was too ... and the bacon ... and the soup ... and the samosas.   'nuff said.  TRY IT!! Food is amazing! You have to try the millionaire bacon, it's the kind of thing you cannot get just anywhere.They have a fresh take on brunch. I would've given a perfect score, but my potatoes were charred and inedible, nobody came by to check on us after we got the food. The rest was so amazing I will definitely go back!!!!! PERFECT spot for a friday night dinner date.My boyfriend and I were trying to find a spot to eat in the mission/castro area, and I happen to use yelps ""new and hot"" filter. Kitchen Story popped up and we were a couple blocks away so decided to give it a try.We got there at about 8:30pm, and expected a wait and were really surprised when we were seated immediately. The decor is adorable and our server was fantastic. He was the best server Ive had eating out in the bay area actually. After hearing his suggestions we ordered the MILLIONAIRES WAY BACON, lady prawns,  Ceviche, Yellow Curry, and the Pad See Ew.The bacon... oh I didn't know bacon could be so magical. It should be the first thing in your mouth at this restaurant. I would skip the Lady Prawns, they were meh and not noteworthy.The Ceviche was done PERFECTLY. The acid balance was perfect and seafood wasn't gummy at all, which is a rarity. I was really impressed!The Yellow Curry was also perfect. The fried potatoes in the curry was a surprising complement to the curry, and frankly I will never look at yellow curry the same way again.Last is the Pad Sew Ew, which took me back to the fiery street stalls on Thailand. This is the best and most authentic version I've had in the US. In fact it is on par with I've had in Thailand.  We also had the desert Pancake, though it was WAY too sweet. Also the comp biscuits are great without the honey butter. The honey butter was also too sweet. I would have given a five star review if it wasn't for that.Im definitely coming back again. Perfect for friends that are in town, and esp now because its new and not to crowed yet :) Great place for breakfast. Not crowded on weekdays, so you can hang out and work. Food is awesome.. potatoes are great and they have millionaire's bacon which has syrup and spice and awesome. They have WiFi from Xfinity, so if you have Comcast at home you can login with your comcast account (the one you use to pay your bill and stuff) for free. I don't know what happens if you don't have comcast.They let me hang out as long as I want, lots of coffee.. full menu. Just a nice place overall. The best bacon, ever. When your review starts with ""The best bacon, ever."" There's not really far to go. I think this bacon is even better than Mission Beach, which was my previous ""Best Bacon, Ever.""How do you like this:The best breakfast potatos, too--ever.  Seriously, they're that good. I usually order extra crispy. I'm glad I didn't because they were crispy on the outside and light-hot-fluffy on the inside. I think they're lightly batter coated. Yum. The main egg dish I had was great, too. This place opened near my friend's house and she went there 5 days in a row. Go. That is all. This place still isn't a great place-- sorry Kitchen Story is wonderful for those folks that only remember that they want brunch milliseconds after they enter frothing and ravenous fugue states of hunger. Like me! Though it's always been bustling when I've been (twice now), there is virtually no wait to sit down -- unlike Ike's Place next door. Bonus!The menu declares ""California Cuisine"" which I guess means ""normal"" food alongside Asian-inspired touches like a lemongrass omelette or a Okonomiyaki egg pancake. At brunch you can choose from egg dishes, breakfast melts, bennies, scrambles, and something called ""sensible breakfast"" for the self-hating wusses out there. (Don't order a sensible breakfast, ya dummy.)Because I'm baller as fuck, I definitely added a side order of Millionaire's Bacon to my salt and pepper French toast with spicy ketchup. I also upgraded my dish to a ""complete meal"" by adding two eggs and meat for $4. Not a bad deal if you're hungry, but it turned out to be overkill. Millionaire's Bacon is not for the faint of wallet ($6.50) nor those on the verge of a heart attack. It's two long hefty strips of coated caramelized bacon with a smoky and spicy kick. It's rich and tasty, though I will never get it again. The French toast, on the other hand, is a definite standout and I really can't get enough of that spicy ketchup. I've ordered it twice now, and will have trouble coaxing myself off it.Great choice for brunch.Obligatory Title Pun: This STORY has a happy ending. (Wait--)Menu Readability: Two column card in no-nonsense sans-serif. Probably made in Pages. Looks fine.Need to mention: Bottomless mimosas are $16.What this place teaches me about myself: Not every breakfast comes with a handjob. This is a wonderful restaurant. I love that there are lots of different options for types of food and for eating a really good, cheaper meal (tasty, fresh $12 pad thai) or a great, more up-scale meal ($20 Waygu steak ""Dancing Queen"" which was ridiculously good!).The service was very friendly and attentive. Food arrived promptly but well-timed.The decor is well-thought out, feels modern but cozy.Also, the ""Castro Tower"" app is fantastic, and the Millionaire's Bacon is as good as advertised, enough to make this mostly-vegetarian drool.Highly recommended - we have been many times, both eating in and taking out. Service was a bit shaky but overall the experience was a very good one.  I will definitely go back.The menu is very flexible and interesting, which I like to see.The Millionaire's Bacon is essentially candy.  Deep-fried ricotta stuffed french toast?  Make no mistake, this isn't health food. Two words: Millionaire's BaconThat is all. I haven't gotten a meal here that I didn't like. I eat here at least once a week, if not more. Try The Millionaires Bacon. I don't even like bacon and it was delicious. I went here a couple of days ago with 4 other people for a late breakfast/early lunch.  The place was crowded and buzzing.  Wait time was around 20 minutes and there is a counter to sit at while waiting.  The new owners did a great job remodeling the place...very clean and inviting; complete makeover of the previous Tangerine which I always liked.  I really wanted to like this place; the menu items are very appealing and a good mixture of egg dishes and hamburgers.  I saw plates coming out of the kitchen and they looked pretty fabulous.  While not what I'd call expensive, it is a couple of dollars over most breakfast/lunch restaurants.  We all found service to be polite but very spotty.  Our dishes came out one at a time over the course of 20 minutes.  Water came well after we'd been served.  Finally, tasting what we had been waiting for was a huge disappointment.  The flavors were bland and definitely not worth the price; I could have gotten this meal anywhere.  The Millionaires Bacon, at $6.00 for two medium size pieces was tasty but definitely not worth the price.  I wanted to get up and go into the kitchen and show them how to make a cheddar biscuit and spice up their egg dishes.  That being said, there are not a lot of places in the Castro that look this nice  for breakfast.  I wouldn't go here again unless the really up the quality of what they are serving and get better wait staff where English is not a barrier to good service. Went there last night with a group of 4. Service was timely and the food was phenomenal. Ahi tuna salad was one of the best I've had and ""Dad's Spicy Soup"" was aptly named--very spicy indeed.They take reservations and are extremely reasonably priced for the area ($12 entrees). I expect to be returning here many times. Had dinner here for NYE and it was a good experience. We ordered the Finger Lickin (fried chicken), Big Hug (scallops and millionaire bacon), Lady Prawns, Da'Da cake (molten chocolate cake with ice cream), and Belly Candy. The fried chicken was good and different with the curry dip, Big Hug was delicious, prawns were average, cake was disappointing (no molten), and Belly Candy (more millionaire bacon) was a great dessert to end our dinner! The server was attentive. If you love bacon, you gotta try this place! I ate here only once but it is enough for me to noticed that the employees and owners put in a lot of time and efforts in getting this place up and running. Everything was superb from food, presentation, flavor, quality, and service. I can assure that in no time this place will become a landmark in the Castro. I had always wondered what they would do with this space once Tangerine closed... I stopped in twice over the past two days (once for a quick, late breakfast and another time for dinner). Service was quite friendly and attentive (as should be expected for the first few months), and the food was tasty. As it's located 1.5 blocks from me, I will likely go again. A bit more than I was hoping to pay given the menu, location, and quality of the fare, however. Everything is better with bacon ... but Millionaires Bacon ... YES PLEASE!The owners of Sweet Maple have nailed it again. Went for dinner last night (Friday) on a last minute Open Table reservation. The place was full but not too full.The Food: Started out with Mama's soup for 2. Perfect size for 2 people. It was light but flavorful. Good for a rainy night!I had the flank steak which was tasty. It had a fresh lime and Bacardi 151 sauce which they poured on and lit on fire table side. 151 and fuego ... count me in!My better half had the Tilapia. It was also yummy. The ginger rice that came with both of our entrees was delish and plentiful.Didn't make it to dessert, but they all looked awesome.The only downside was that we had to wait quite some time for our food. Not a huge deal as we weren't in any rush. The manager and waiter felt quite bad and gave me a free beer. Free beer solves all problems in my book!!!Overall, we'd definitely come back for dinner and can't wait to try it out for brunch. I was excited about going here and I really wanted this place to work. The owner obviously invested a lot of money into the space. The menu, at least at first glance, appears to be creative and well put together. There's a lot of potential here, but something went wrong with the execution.SERVICE - For the caliber of restaurant that this place is trying to be, the staff is not up to the task. The communication issues are a problem. The staff that we dealt with were oblivious to our needs and the natural flow of the dining experience.  Basic things like when to order and how to check on a table, handle refills, etc. - all handled very awkwardly and with much difficulty. All in all, they came off as untrained. With the higher end prices that this restaurant offers, they need to be a little better at servicing that kind of clientele. FOOD - Lots of promise but did not deliver. We came for brunch. I'm big on omelettes and was excited to try theirs. Here's what we got:K.S.'s Own Omelette: The menu description sounded amazing. In reality, it was not that great. It was more of a scramble than an omelette. The lemongrass flavor was overpowering to the point of tasting like an herbal soap. I would not order again nor recommend.Ribeye Omurice: Again, the menu description sounded amazing. This one actually had some delicious, savory flavors, but the description was still misleading. I thought the ribeye was going to be a more prominent element to this dish. Instead, it was egg and spinach over a bed of rice, topped with a gravy that had bits of meat in it. Tasted good, but for the price ($13) it was a letdown. Also, the rice was cold, which took away from the enjoyment.  The cheddar and rosemary biscuits were almost inedible. They were extremely dense and leeched the moisture right out of my mouth. So much promise!    Unfortunately, with so many options in the area, I think its unlikely that I will ever return to give Kitchen Story another shot. This is a tough review to write as I really wanted to like this place as I do love breakfast and there aren't too many fab options in this area... but I just can't.Went in with my two friends and their newborn (in a stroller) and rambunctious 3 year old. Needed a highchair for her and was told they only have one and it was in use. Odd but true.We then get our menu's and I request a cup of coffee... 30 minutes later, after ordering and my friends had gotten their latte's, I then re-ask for my simple black coffee to the woman who had brought the drinks. She says ""ok"" and walks into the back aka opposite of where the coffee is without telling anyone (I later figured out she doesn't speak much English). I then flagged down our waiter who, after checking the coffee pot, informs me from across the room that they have to brew some... I coulda gone down the block, gotten some and of returned in less time!Another 30 minutes and our food arrives. I had asked for scrambled egg whites and got regular eggs; this is when I found out the server didn't understand English as when I asked her if they were ""whites only"" she replied ""yes"" and smiled. When I asked the waiter, he then asked the cook who said they weren't (good news: they recooked my eggs and were all whites!). My eggs were accompanied by frozen potatoes with cheddar cheese on top (how hard is it to cook fresh?) and a raw in the center biscuit. I can't speak for my friends meals as they were starving after an hour of waiting and gobbled theirs up so fast all I heard were grunts.Did I mention that they forgot the 3 year olds meal and it arrived 10 minutes later? That is forever to a little kid, and even longer to the adults with her...After all these mis-steps. the bill for 3 adults and a kid for a simple breakfast came out to just over $70 with tip... that's a bit much for what we got in terms of service and food. I really hope that Kitchen Story steps up, cooks fresh and can make the space work as they did a very cute remodel and seem like nice people who are just in a bit over their heads. 3.5 starsService: 5 starsEnvironment: 5 stars. Clean and modernSalmon: 3 stars. Too fried.Fried chicken: 4 stars. Overall, it's Thai food, with American dishes that have a Thai twist. I am really torn about this review. I do want to give this new restaurant more stars, as we did have a nice dinner here and there were several excellent aspects to our meal, however, overall, I wasn't overwhelmingly impressed. I'd say our experience was a 3.5 star one for now.  I must say I love the atmosphere and the space...the open design and large windows, as well as bookshelves that add coziness to the place.  The service was great, very attentive.  Our wine glass stayed full throughout the meal. We did not have to wait long for anything.  And when my boyfriend wanted to order the fried chicken dinner, but did not want the curry sauce that it came with, the manager brought out three other dipping sauces for him to try.  I must say there was one thing that turned us off a bit.  The server tried to refill our wine glasses so often that after a little while it began to feel overbearing.  Mind you, we would only take a few sips each and the glasses would be still full, but he'd be back to our table pouring even more into the glass.  We even joked about it, like, ""ok mofos, chug the damn wine bottle you brought with you and make a goddamn purchase from us"". That's what it felt like.  After refill number two, we politely told the waiter that we were ok on wine and will refill the glasses ourselves in a little while.  He let us be after that :-)My favorite dish was the Millionaire's Bacon appetizer.  It was fantastic.  I could have eaten this slow cooked bacon and asparagus with maple syrup sauce all night long. Im craving it right now.  The prawn appetizer was good, but nothing that stood out.The dishes we ordered were The Dancing Queen and Finger-licking' fried chicken. They were fine, good even, but again, nothing that stood out or was fantastic.  I have had better fried chicken at a couple of other SF spots.  I would return, however, as I really did like the restaurant itself and a few other items on their menu looked very intriguing.  The Kobe Beef appetizer that the table next to us ordered really did look amazing. I am hoping to revise the rating to 4-5 stars upon my return. First visit, everything was very good. We will go back before giving the 5th star! Mediocre egg and bacon ""melt"", my bf thought the CA burger was good.  So loud you can barely hear yourself think much less hear anyone across the table. A friend suggested we meet at Kitchen Story for lunch. He made reservations (a total plus for me) and we met there. We didn't need reservations, as it was a Thursday, and it was quiet inside, but glad we had them just in case. I loved the feel of the place, very cozy and inviting. I was instantly greeted and seated. I had a chai latte and it was delicious. I got a mushroom, red onion and cheddar melt. It was amazing. It came with greens. It was so yummy and really filling. Only $10.00. It was very well priced. We sat and talked forever and no one gave us the stink eye. The staff was very attentive and the food was great and the decor very cute. I will come here again for sure! I'm already dreaming of the mushroom melt again! Went there with a friend on Sunday for lunch. We went there because of the great reviews and the food really was great!  We had the New England Burger with fries and were not disappointed. However, the place doesn't seem to be air conditioned and was quite warm and for being listed as $$, the food seemed expensive. For two burgers and coffee the bill was $50 with tip. Leave it to this cute little hot spot to draw me out of my yelp slumber. Went here a week or two ago, here are my two cents:Food - Delicious. We ordered the fried chicken, garlic asparagus, papaya salad, ahi tuna and cheesecake. Every dish was absolutely delicious. With the exception of the tuna, the chips were great but the fish itself was a bit mushy. Otherwise, food was fabulous. Service - almost annoyingly attentive but overall endearing. You can tell they're new because we had 3 different folks ask us if we needed anything and made sure we were taken care of.Decor - comfy sleek. Don't ask me how they accomplished that combo but you'll get it when you see it. Overall, definitely worth checking out. My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place on a Saturday night.  We were walking by and after quickly scanning Yelp, decided to give it a try.  Since we didn't have a reservation, they asked if we'd mind sitting at the bar and we were promptly seated.  From our first interaction with the staff, it was clear that everyone was very happy to be working there and wanted to see the place succeed.  From where we were sitting, we could clearly see all the food that was coming out of the kitchen, and our mouths began to water.  We ordered a coconut chicken soup, a tuna tartare with mango and two entree-sized salads.  Including the bread and dessert, everything we ate was 100% delicious.  This is the first 5-star restaurant review I've written in ages, but well worth it.  Our meal and service were so good, we decided to return the following morning to give brunch a shot.  The menu was inventive and we really enjoyed our food, but perhaps only a tad less than dinner the night before. We'll be adding this restaurant to our regular rotation and cannot recommend it enough. Kitchen Story, only open since the end of November, is a great place for brunch and they actually take reservations - brilliant!  The Castro needed more brunch options - confirmed by the amount of people with no reservations willing to wait for a table or the bar.If you come for the brunch, you must get or share the millionaire's bacon, which is two slices of thick-cut bacon with perfectly rendered fat candied in what tasted like brown sugar, maple syrup, chili flakes and maybe even soy sauce. Amazing. It is worth the $6.50 for a side, but you can get it for $2.00 when added to another dish (but only specific breakfast dishes all this addition).Also a must to get or share is the mascarpone stuffed deep-fried french toast. Decadent. The egg dishes were better than average with fresh & interesting ingredients, the potato wedges were extra crispy and seasoned perfectly. I have a recommendation for the New England burger, which I hear oozes maple syrup goodness, so I must try it on my return... and I will return. I was desperate to like this place. The menu tries pretty hard to be good, but the staff just aren't up to it. They don't seem to be able to communicate effectively with customers. I might give it another go if I'm feeling brave. KS's own omelet with pork wine sausage, lemon grass, asparagus, bell peps and soy sauce was so fresh and delicious! Ribeye omurice had a wonderful savory flavor. Millionaire's bacon was sweet and unique. Service was great and atmosphere for brunch was perfect. Hip, casual, trendy, fun!  Definitely coming back. I REALLY wanted to like this place! I've been to 3 of the previous restaurants in this seemingly cursed location, and the mediocrity continues!7x7 Magazine has this place on their list of date spots, which is great if you're speed dating (more on that later).Negatives:- Even though they only had 2 reservations a 6pm, they couldn't confirm my reservation. I had to point out my own name on their reservation list! Sad.- Even though there were only 3 tables occupied, we were seated at the most dreary, cave-like table possible (check out my food pic for proof!). The people a couple tables over were even using their cell phone lights to read the menu.- Less than an hour into dinner, we ordered another round of wine and declined dessert. They QUICKLY brought our check, had us sign and took it away. This is normally fine, but they also set the 2-top table next to us for three people while the waiting party breathed on top of us from the bar. I swear they must have pushed the other table closer to ours because the third menu was practically touching our table! Omg, we get the hint! We are no longer customers and should leave! That's just wrong. That's what I meant about speed dating above, this place seems to care more about volume than service. Even the table on the other side us felt it. I overheard when they sat down, whispering that they needed to eat quickly because their table was reserved soon. Sheesh! If you can't fit a party in for a decent dinner, please don't seat them and rush them! We had a reservation and STILL felt rushed! Last time I checked, an hour isn't a long seating for dinner.- Don't order anything with garlic egg noodles! This side is an absolute embarrassment! They tasted like cardboard with dry rot!Positives:- The workers are really sweet when they're not trying to kick you out of your table.- The portions are decent. - My Three Buddies short ribs weren't overly salty. On an even more positive note, thanks Kitchen Story for bringing me back on Yelp!"|4|100|0|Routine|This inspection has no violations.|GOOD: no inspection needed
Kitchen Story 3|4.0|Breakfast & Brunch in San Francisco, CA|$11-30|813|3|4.473684210526316|" My friend took me here for a weekday birthday brunch. I really like that they're open at 8am so if I ever wanted to have a nice morning breakfast before work (or even just grabbing something to go)DecorReally quaint, and well designed. Muted wood and metal accents, looks really clean. There's a really fun bookshelf wall divider between the main room and the kitchen, and it's filled with accent pieces and books. Any place that provides interesting reading material gets a gold star in my book.ServiceThe waiter was a really nice guy. He seemed like he was really aiming to please and serve us. Really accommodating with the food orders too (substitutions and stuff). A lot of the orders come with a cheddar basil biscuit and potatoes (berries subs for $2 extra), but they let me have a side salad instead of the potatoes so that was fantastic! Checked up on us enough without being overbearing. The food wait time was good too, fairly quick but not blazing.FoodWe ordered the Red & Green Benedict (spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, mango salsa) and the Franciscan scramble (chicken mango, avocado, pimento, mushroom, celery, jack) The reason why the food wasn't blazing fast for what we ordered was because of the presentation. For a neighborhood brunch spot, their food presentation was incredible. Really gorgeous colorings and arrangements, I could taste the presentation.The food quality was good, but it wasn't out of this world. It's a really solid brunch spot, not too expensive for what you get. I will definitely come back to try their other dishes. Each category of dish has one or two Asian fusion style plates that I really want to try. The Okonomiyaki, Ribeye omurice, Bulgolgi Burger and the Banmi Panini. Good range of choices.I will be back for more! Lovely dinner with my hubby. Service was attentive and knowledgeable without being in the way. The food was delicious- satay, millionaire asparagus, waygu salad and mom's salmon. We'll return for another date night- yum. We all have different experiences an ours was fantastic! People judging a space from what it used to be before is so wrong but many people do it. Tangerine is gone and lets move on. This place the staff so friendly, right on me to see what we wanted, and the food OMG fantastic . The Maple hamburger was off the chart!  The shrimp and bacon we had as starters ...YUMMM.  The bartender even came out an ask us if we were satisfied with our drinks ! thats rare!  But over all I was very impressed and would go back many times and bring lots of friends. It was on the more expensive side but u also get what u pay for . Look at  Frances its very expensive but people love the place and its always booked. so again 2 thumbs up on this new place.. Pluses : delicious food. The Millionaires Bacon was fantastic - the bacon is sweet and spicy and the asparagus was fresh and tender. Thai Fried Rice: the portion was plentiful, the flavor was good just a bit salty. Wild King Salmon: portion was good,  the curry was just right level of spice. Ambiance: the lighting was too bright. They should go for more of the lighting like at Beretta. I asked them to dim the lights but they didn't really dim them very much. For dinner patrons like a different ambiance. They should lower the lights and add candles to the table. Also they brought the can of soda, I think they should pre-pour it. Seemed a bit tacky. I REALLY want this place to do well. Would be 5 stars if they fixed the ambiance. My boyfriend and I tried this place just two days after they had their ""soft opening"", prepared for some rough edges. There were no rough edges to be found... in fact, this was one of the best dining experiences I've had in months.The restaurant is located in the space formerly occupied by Tangerine. They've redecorated aggressively, and the results are really nice... simultaneously comfortable and cozy. I particularly liked the little pepper plants used as table decorations. They bill their menu as ""California cuisine"", but it's really mostly Thai fusion.The first surprise was the quick arrival of what would have been the bread basket in most restaurants. They offer biscuits instead of bread (or, rather, instead of nothing, compared to most Thai places). They were good. A bit on the cold side but they were free and had potential.We split a ""Millionaire's Bacon"" appetizer. While it wasn't quite as fabulous as the menu implied, it was still excellent... thick slices of high-quality bacon, tasting strongly of maple syrup and smoke, together with perfect little asparagus stalks. Highly recommended.I ordered the ""Dancing Queen"", a flank steak with garlic long beans and a rice and rum sauce. The menu didn't mention one feature of the dish - after setting it on the table the waiter set the high-proof sauce on fire (intentionally). I don't know if the flambée thing enhanced the flavor, but the results were excellent; one of the best steaks I've had recently. My boyfriend had the ""Finger Lickin'"", a boneless fried chicken breast made with the sort of Thai breading that you would usually see on calamari and some potato wedges. It wasn't  at all greasy, and was cooked just right. They didn't set his on fire but it would have been cool if they did. Service was prompt, professional and friendly, and the prices are surprisingly reasonable (at least by Castro standards). We'll be back! Outstanding new gem in the Castro.I went with my handsome boyfriend the first week they were open. We were politely greeted and seated right away with no reservation. The decor is clean and has a university professor's office who's hipster child decorated it from Pottery Barn and your neighbor's garage sale. The menu has many options. It's not really Californian but more heavily Thai inspired American food or American food inspired by thai, depending on what you order. They have booze. Order some. Freebies: We got some biscuits! They were pretty good. A bit on the cold side. I'm sure they batch make them. I would too. But it's free and who doesn't love carbs. For the appetizer, we got their Millionaire bacon. On the plate we found a few thick slabs of mapely bacon with asparagus in a thick maple sauce. It was quite yummy. It seem to have been featured on a show that I obviously don't watch but it was really good. It shows up in some other dishes that I didn't order so there are a few ways to get a taste of it.I ordered the fried chicken. It had some cute name to it  (finger-lickin') It was a boneless fried a la thai chicken breast. The same style of breading they seem to make fried calamari with at regular thai places. It all came with some potato wedges and some curry dipping sauce. It was all quite good. Crispy and not greasy. Kids would love it too.The sexy boyfriend ordered the flank stake. It was inappropriately named dancing queen as the boyfriend doesn't dance . But his steak came sliced on a bed of garlic rice. And wait there is more! They poured some alcohol on  it and set it on fire. (the steak not the boyfriend). It was quite cool. We didn't catch that in the menu. A nice perk. It was cooked just right. Very yummy. I'm definitely ordering that the next time we go. There were some long beans on the plate for colon health but who really cares about that part. We skipped dessert 'cause we had obicular figures to maintain but they have some.The service was prompt and fast. They checked in on us and made sure we had beverages refilled. My food came out a few minutes ahead of his but no big deal. They had just opened so I'm sure the minor flaws will be worked out at some point.  Prices were very reasonable for the location and the meal. Would definitely go back there with my majestic boyfriend. It's seldom a new eatery gets such consistently good reviews in the first weeks of opening and as such, I was excited to stop by Kitchen Story for weekend brunch. Occupying the former space of Tangerine, a former brunch fave of mine with their zucchini latkes, Kitchen Story has updated the space to give it a more contemporary feel. We arrived around 2pm without a reservation and were seated right away. Note: seating is pretty tight here and you will be quite close to diners on either side. Nothing better than starting out brunch with adult beverages and my bloody mary (yelp.com/biz_photos/kitc…), while not Zeitgeist-good, was very welcomed indeed. They also have bottomless mimosas for $18 if you feel like imbibing more liberally. I was going to order the benedict at first but ended up choosing the KS's own omelet (yelp.com/biz_photos/kitc…) because it came with a side of their cheddar basil biscuit. Unfortunately, said biscuit was nowhere to be found when my plate arrived. When asked about it, the server simply said they ran out and substituted it with bread. Well some heads up when ordering would have been nice; so would an apology or some mention of it when serving the plate. It's a pity because from what I saw from the diners next to us, those biscuits looked good! But with all things said and done, the food was pretty good. Plate presentation is definitely one of Kitchen Story's fortes. Every plate that left the kitchen looked really appetizing. My omelet was light and fluffy and every bite had a nice balance of pork sausage, asparagus, and bell peppers. I was glad they obliged my request to sub out potatoes for a side salad because the salad was perfectly dressed lightly. My friend has the millionaire BLT and from the bite I had of the millionaire bacon, you might want to consider getting a side of these thick cut slices of bacon slow baked with a generous brown sugar rub.   Biscuit fiasco aside, I really enjoyed my food and can't wait to be back for brunch again. On that note, the dinner menu looked really good too. I mean come on... millionaire bacon wrapped scallop? Kitchen Story is a welcomed new eatery to the neighborhood. Had a really great dinner at Kitchen Story during its first week of being open. At some restaurants that would translate into glitches in service, but Kitchen Story is off to a running start. The Millionaire's Way and Tuna Cevice appetizers were amazing, would order both again next time. The short ribs were very good, but the green curry stole the show in the main course. Can't wait to try brunch! Nice remodel.I found the menu a little odd.I did like my side of eggs.They refilled my coffee constantly. Excellent!!!!! Stumbled upon this place while roaming around the Castro district. The food is nothing short of delicious. From the appetizer of the Castro tower to the the Uncle Thai dessert and everything in between. The service was great and the prices are very reasonable. Will definitely recommend this place to friends and family and will dine here again when I'm in town. Stumbled upon kitchen story on Saturday night 12/1/12 and boy was I impressed! Our meal was phenomenal from start to finish! Our server Mita (who was amazing) recommended the Castro Tower for an appetizer. It was delicious! Ahi was fresh & won tons were fried to perfection and packed the perfect kick. For dinner the dancing queen was absolutely amazing and the finger lickin chicken was nothing short of. The perfectly cooked and delicately breaded chicken was served with a curry sauce that was tasty and delicious! Both chicken and combo Pad Thai was exceptional. We also ordered the burger topped with the millionaire bacon which if taste lives up to its name without factoring in price this is it. The best burger in town. For dessert we ordered the uncle tai which is totally unconventional but AMAZING. We will most definitely be back and will recommend Kitchen Story to all our friends and family!! The perfect dinner in the perfect city! Went here for Brunch on a rainy Sunday and was blown away.  I had the Frisco Benedict - it was delicious.    The Millionaire's bacon was fantastic.   We will definitely be coming back! Went here for a weekday breakfast. Got seated immediately and had very friendly, attentive service throughout. We got our breakfast within 15 minutes of ordering and everything came hot and very well presented. Every dish was delicious, and everyone in the party was more than satisfied. Will definitely return here again. I went to the newly opened Kitchen Story with two friends the other night before heading to the Castro Theatre. It's an excellent place. The decor is warm, homey, casual, and stylish. The food was tasty and well-prepared. I had the ""Dancing Queen"" of wagyu beef ontop of ginger rice served with some spicy garlic thai long beans that were great. My friends enjoyed their Pad See You and wagyu noodle bowls as well. The service was courteous, but the dishes did come out at different times. I think they'll be working out those kinks as they go along. Definitely worth returning and a good new addition to the Castro. Ate there last night and everything was delicious.   I will definitely be going back.  Service was good and courteous. Great good! Good service! One dish came out a little earlier than everyone else's. The potato wedges are a must!
