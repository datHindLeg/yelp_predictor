Fable 0|4.0|American (New) in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|211|0|4.17322834646|" Went to Fable for the first time last night with a group of friends to celebrate our April birthdays.  What a perfect spot!  Loved the food, the atmosphere, the service.  Loved it all.  It's a shinning star in the Castro and I would highly recommend to locals and tourists.  It's small inside but they are planning on opening up the patio soon and that will allow for a lot more seating.   Don't skip the desserts.  We had a chocolate mouse with chipotle salt and it was incredible.  A great addition to the San Francisco restaurant scene! Nice setup, food was pretty good. The dessert was the highlight for me. It's definitely higher priced than the $$ indicator suggests. This restaurant totally surprised me. . . In a good way!First of all, having spent plenty of time in the Castro specifically and in lots of SF restaurants generally, this one was not even on my list of great places to try (I keep a running list don't you?) Boy it should have been!To start with, the restaurant is adorable on the inside I'd go back just to sit at the bar and enjoy the food! The food was stars, all the way. It stands on it's own just for the strength of the food definitely on par with any restaurant I've tried in the yrs I've lived in the bay (and there have been many!) The only reason for the star instead of  was the deviled eggs appetizer was a miss for me. We ordered  appetizers to share, plus an entree, and all the others were near perfect. However add on the impeccable service, plus the great staff, and Fable stands apart. This is the very first star I've given on Yelp, and it is well deserved. Then, the owner asked about our service on the way out, and gave us a tour of the place, replete with the back patio that will open soon. Too bad no live music because of neighbors, but it promises to be great!I highly recommend Fable, and will be back often! Fable is a great choice for brunch if you find yourself in the Castro on a weekend morning. It's conveniently located between th & th on Castro, so street parking can be tough, but if you go up the hill toward Noe a bit, you may get lucky. The brunch food is fresh and well prepared and the servers are super sweet. There are a couple of tables on the front sidewalk, but the best seats are on the often sunny back patio. They're also open for dinner, though I think brunch is the better kept secret. The service was good. The food looked amazing and done right, but just tasted okay. Watching people try to open the front door with a bad lock/handle was definitely entertaining. Been here twice now and would say that  stars is a great rating for this restaurant the food won't absolutely blow you away, but you'll still get a very good meal. Each time my gf and I have tried the special of the night st it was a scallop and caviar dish that was incredible, second time around it was a corned beef dish in celebration of St. Patty's day. Why mention this? It seems like both times the seasonal dishes were more creative and came together better than the dishes we got off of the regular menu (the scallop and duck confit on the menu tasty but heavy). Maybe it's just luck, but the chef really knows how to make a nice special dish with fresh and new ingredients. The service here is  stars all the stuff you'd expect from a nice restaurant in SF. Overall a good place for a date night/small group dinner in a safe neighborhood where parking isn't too rough. Plus it's never a dull time walking along Castro street. Incredible, fresh, vegan lasagna features more vegetables than pasta for a great low carb option. The chefs table is a great seat to observe all of the action in front of your eyes!The aroma of herbs and spices floating through the air from the au four create a warming ambiance of culinary delight!! Delicious food and great service, but don't ask the waitress for a wine recommendation. Or if you do, ask her the price. We ordered the wine she suggested, discovering at the end of the meal that it was the most expensive bottle they offer. I nearly threw up when I got the bill. As much as I enjoyed the meal, I won't be back because that feeling of having been burned will linger. My daughter & I enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Fable. We loved all the dishes (the duck confit w/ scallop!). . . and the wine (local Pinot Noir) suggestion from our server was a beautiful compliment to our dinner! I plan to search out a couple of bottles : ) We couldn't say enough about the impeccable service, which included ALL the staff, everyone from the host who seated us to our table service, and of course the servers!Fable is quite small, and so reservations are probably a good idea. We did hear their opening a patio area come late spring summer! We'll be back to check out the new outside seating!! This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Castro, and quickly becoming my favorite. It's a shame it can be so difficult to get a table most nights. Finally this location gets a restaurant that is worthy of that beautiful patio, since the restaurant Luna that was here prior just neglected it until the point of complete dilapidation. The food is very good and the menu is constantly changing, something that many restaurants in the area need to take notes on. They keep fruits and vegetables seasonal and the management seems genuinely interested in the feedback from customers. Their wine list and dessert menu is a bit lacking in selection and the wine list is mostly expensive with very few economic choices. The last two times I ate here they didn't even have a cab on the list, a felony in my world. The service is quite good. Tried it for the first time tonight and loved it. The service was impeccable from the moment we entered. We started with the little gem salad (plenty for ) and the garlic bread  both were perfect. I had the chicken breast and my date had the steak. My only complaint is that the sweet and sour sauce on the chicken tasted like one of those Chicken McNugget dipping sauces. All in all a nice experience and a great addition to the Castro. I really appreciate Fable because they always have a vegan entree on the menu. I've had both their beetloaf and vegan lasagna and both were really delicious : ) I love that Fable is just around the corner. I've been several times & have enjoyed every meal. Recently, I was hosted a friend that owns a restaurant, & suggested we dine at Fable. We painstaking planned our meal & wine pairings. We loved every bite. The service, even on a busy night, was really great. Little touches make the experience even better. We left very full, very satisfied customers. PS: Thank you for making me look good to a friend with a sophisticated palate. Fable is so wonderful! The food is great  the service is great! I live in the Castro and I am so glad to have this as a neighborhood spot. Usually when I eat here, we just walk in and eat at the bar  which is fun, because then we can watch the chefs at work. Everything I have had at Fable has been delicious  the salads are great and all the mains I have had have also been delicious. Recently I had their Grilled Angus Petit Filet  which was served with root veggies so good. In the past I have had their chicken which is also so tasty  crispy skin, tender meat. I also find that their wines by the glass are also very good. Really  you should try Fable  it's that good! According to Wikipedia, a fable is ""a succinct fictional story, in prose or verse, that features animals, mythical creatures, plants, inanimate objects or forces of nature which are given human qualities which illustrate or lead to an interpretation of a moral"". Yep, that sure sounds like the Castro all right, where naive visitors are constantly surrounded by animals of all species, mythical and not so mythical creatures, inanimate objects that come to life with a little vodka, and when the clubs close, genuine forces of nature. But I digress as this is a fable of a different genre. It's a succinct, decidedly non fictional place where appetites remain of a human quality that may or may not lead to a moral. Fable is a bit on the pricey side, but the menu is mostly scrumptious (photo: bit. ly/fAJqzb) which probably accounts for the number of young, smartphone adhered foodies waiting against the side wall for an empty table. I got lucky as a solitary diner who was able to secure the closest seat at the counter to the host station. I was a bit in the shadows, but that didn't seem to affect the service level much. Even though I was almost lured by their daily special of deviled eggs, I decided to try the $ Dijon Crusted Braised Pork Cheeks. They were a tantalizing trio of fried goodness covered in lacinato kale, crisp apple, and crispy shallots, all of it drizzled with a cider vinaigrette (photo: bit. ly/muyJzV). Very unique flavors that were a bit on the sour side. Perhaps to compensate for the pig factor, I went to the other extreme on my main dish and ordered the $ Vegan Winter Vegetable Lasagna, which turned out to be quite tasty even without the ground beef I had come to expect thanks to all those years of Stouffer's frozen entrees. It was made with spinach and butternut squash with cashew ""cheese"" and macadamia ""ricotta""  faux cheeses that were pretty darn convincing dairy doppelgangers  and a thick tomato sauce (photo: bit. ly/fojjwM). Accompanied by toasted wedges of rustic bread, this was quite a hearty serving of goodness. Patting myself for such a healthy selection, I paid the price by ordering the $ Pear and Ginger Crisp, a hefty cobbler festooned with walnuts and dominated by a large scoop of Straus vanilla ice cream (photo: bit. ly/jwNGN). Completely undeserving, completely devoured. It was a comfort dessert on steroids. Chef Jon Hearnsberger even came out to serve it to me, a personal touch I appreciated considering how busy they were that evening. So Fable is not a fable in the literary sense, just a culinary treat for all you inanimate objects in need of a moral lesson like stop being such a glutton when you already had two courses. Sheesh. FOOD   stars. . . eclectic dishes with culinary pizazzAMBIANCE  .  stars. . . cozy, a bit too much but still a relatively comforting spaceSERVICE   stars. . . attentive staff all aroundTOTAL   stars. . . there's a moral to be learned here. . . give me a minute Won't go back again. HIgh priced for very little food. And really, you're gonna charge for side dishes? Then at least offer more choices! The food was not all that good. I had the swordfish. It was so so. Not worth the price. The ONLY good thing about the dinner was our waiter. He was very nice and attentive. All in all, I would not pay that kind of money for such little food that wasn't all that. Unbelievably delicious and HEALTHY! So rare to find that combo! The ambiance was so cozy and romantic. . . totally forgot I was in a city. Very welcoming service and the patio is adorable. This one is on my list of favorite date spots in the city. came here on a Saturday evening for dinner not knowing what to expect.  pleasantly surprised, to say the least.  service was excellent. decor and ambiance was very comfortable.  started with a citrus salad which was very flavorful and plenty enough to share for two.  ordered a swordfish dish and their cioppino, both done excellently.  didn't have enough room for dessert so I can't comment on that.  overall a great experience and will definitely return for more! Finally made it back to Fable and they did not disappoint.  Again, great  food made with fresh, quality ingredients put together by a passionate chef results in a tasty and most enjoyable dining experience. Service was very good.  Expensive food, there are other places to try.  This was my second time there.  $ small pork chop, asked for med, got rare.  Very little food, very BIG price.  I guess that's why it's a ""Fable"". Went to celebrate a birthday. Dinner was great, and the service was very attentive, but I had asked upon making the reservation to bring out a dessert for his birthday and they didn't follow through at the end of dinner. Left slightly disappointed that they didn't take the time to pay attention to my request. So I'm visiting from Vegas. And back home we have some amazing restraints, but this place. Wow! Amazing service, beautifully decorated, and the food is phenomenal! If your lookin for a place to try out, this is it! Cioppino was the winner entree but steak could have been a bit more flavorful. Service is good and resto has a cozy feeling into it. Another excellent meal at Fable. They have the best chicken and the vegetables had an amazing flavor and I'm not a vege guy. Also loved the cobbler and dulche de leche mouse. Great service too! .  stars rounded up Deja vu. We created memories in this space's patio once before, in its prior life. Its newest incarnation, Fable, got mixed reviews from us. I'll give you both sides, so you can decide if the New American joint is worth a looksie. Salad with Dungeness crab was not too exciting. Components seemed to be kind of random  pistachios AND oranges? Can't say I approve of chef's pick of ingredients. We both ordered cioppino ($), which I thoroughly enjoyed (garlicky/not too sour), save for shallow portion of broth. Don't expect a deep, heaping bowl. Boatloads of white fish, crab, mussels, clams, & a giant scallop. No ""fishy"" smell or aftertaste, which is what usually deters me from ordering seafood. Before even taking a bite, he commented that he couldn't believe we were paying so much for something we could've made at home. I told him I expect a homemade cioppino dinner tomorrow night. . . doubt I'll get it!We couldn't resist their dessert special: dulce de leche mousse with creme fraiche & smoked sea salt. I enjoyed the flavors & semi thick consistency. He was not amused, & likened the $ glassful to jello. I do agree that their execution leaves something to be desired, but flavors were a ok. There are many yummy sounding dishes on their menu, but I don't think we'll be back because his final remarks were, ""It's called Fable cuz it's a lesson learned. . . never again!"" Yikes. The $ bill (pre tip) did nothing to endear him to the place. Food: /. Superb food. Wife had the duck and I had the tri tip. Both were very good with excellent flavors. Don't need to get a side but I have to say the squash side was amazingly good. Service: /. Attentive, friendly, and slightly awkward. Vibe: /. I really liked the small restaurant and laid back vide. We were seated *right* next to the bar which was a bit of a pity. A truly appreciated departure from the rather icky restaurant choices in the main area of Castro, Fable is comfy and cozy with a menu that delivers. You won't be disappointed. Staff is insanely friendly and accommodating. They're all about their guests and it shows. Beer and wine only, but a selection that's just right. The menu changes regularly. I was secretly hoping that they'd have mac & cheese on the evening I visited. Sad pandas, they did not. Our meal was delicious and we savored every bite: The duck confit salad was lovely. People who say they're weary about duck will change their minds. Perfect for sharing The Cioppino is some of the best I've ever had. Insanely generous chunks of seafood (esp crab) in broth so rich and satisfying you'll think you're eating a King's feast Tri tip is pleasantly flavorful and not too spicy Sides: the roasted squash is undoubtedly one of the the best things we've ever had (we recommend getting one order per person), Cheese grits are good but nothing mind blowingCan't wait to return. Cons (this is why the restaurant is  stars instead of ): Prices keep increasing!  Within the past year they have been open, prices of entrees have gone from around $  to $ .  It's great when a local restaurant makes it, but please don't do it at the expense of locals' wallets.  At the current pricing, this restaurant is miscategorized as a $$ establishment, and instead should be $.  Prices here are comparable to NOPA, which is categorized as $ on yelp.  To see proof of rising prices, take a look at some of the menu pictures posted on Yelp from the restaurant's earlier days then look at the current menu pricing. Pros: The food was really good!  I enjoyed the duck confit dish and pear/ginger crisp.  The waiter was the right amount of attentiveness without being overbearing or aloof.  The set up of the restaurant is cozy, and I liked the bright orange napkins.  Decor is minimal but carefully thought out.  Small outdoor patio looks very cute (there are heat lamps), and after a couple months they are opening about  more seats in the back. Other: Dinner only now, but once back patio is totally complete, it plans to open for brunch as well. Arrived with my BF around pm without a reservation and we were promptly seated. Would've gotten a better seat had we reserved ahead but neither of us are from around here so we were working 'on the fly' from a recommendation we'd received. The service was exceptional and extremely helpful as we tried to decide on our meals and which wine to order. We both decided on the split pea and ham soup as well as the steak dinner option and both agreed, hands down, it was absolutely delicious. The salted butter they use for their complimentary bread adds a very nice flavour to it as well. Neither of us are really wine experts but the Rossese they recommended went very well with the meal. . . lastly, desert was a very refreshing closer to the meal. I had the parsnip cake and was only disappointed when there weren't  more slices waiting for me afterward :P Awesome place! The food was amazing and the service excellent. Reasonably priced for quality place in the Castro. Highly recommened! Cozy backyard!  It was a little cold but the heat lamps worked well.  Food was good and well prepared.  Wine recommended was good too.  Service was excellent.  They had to stop serving alcohol after pm due to neighbors.  Will be back if in the area. We were looking for a great place to kill hunger pangs, and Yelp pointed us to the Castro. The neon sign hanging outside lets you know there's a garden patio in back, and it's worth checking out! I'll let the other reviewers give the details on the food & drink, but we were really pleased with our choices. The chef and owner, Jon, is famous for his $ cioppino, and it was worthy. Mussels, clams, fresh crab, salmon and a large diver scallop in a savory red broth had me fork fencing with Luci N. for last bite. There was a vegan entree that looked appetizing, but we didn't check it out. The standout entree of the night, however, was the chicken! Amazing and one you wouldn't easily recreate at home. Our party of  ate at Fable this evening, and we had a wonderful time.  Their service was AMAZING.  We were late and in a rush for a show, and they were attentive and friendly.  The chicken and pork chop are not to be missed.  We sat outside, and it was LOVELY!  Heat lamps, private, and cute lighting.  Thanks for a great night out Fable! Fable, what can I say I have been here numerous times and never had a bad experience. The service and food has always been great and worth every penny. This small spot is cozy and great for the Castro. It's a hidden little gem. . sh. Anything, you choose will not disappoint your palette I called the night before and asked if they could change my reservation from  to : ( was all that was available on open table). They made the accommodation happily by seating us on the porch, which was warm and comfortable. The waiter was wonderful as was the food. The timing of the dishes, their preparation and presentation were all wonderfully done. The jus with the steak could have been a little bit more plentiful, but was very well prepared. All in all a nice evening. Had to write an update and send my compliments to Jon and his team for the best New Years Eve dinner ever! Every detail was thought out so beautifully and the food was incredible. So often Pre Fixe tastes. . . . pre fixed. . . this was NOT the case at Fable. The food was just amazing, the atmosphere was festive and lively, and we enjoyed every moment. Book us for next  year! So god!  One of those places where anything you try on the menu is really good.  Great, refreshingly innovative dishes.   Really nice staff, too!  The waiter was patient and advised us what to order when we had to dine quick! I don't know how Fable ended up on my radar, but it did. I think it had something to do with a review somewhere saying how weird the decor was, and thinking I needed to check it out myself (it's really not weird at all). I came here with a friend that I hadn't seen it a very long time, and we went on a little dinner date. I hardly ever go out in the Castro anymore, either, so I wanted to find a place that would get me out of my normal haunts. The food was excellent. My friend and I split the dungeness crab appetizer, with orange segments, and it was refreshing and delicious. The portion of crab was very generous. Actually, you could add oz. of crab to any dish, if you wanted. I didn't opt for this, but I was really pleased to have had the option. I had the pork chop with a pomegranate glaze over grits. The pork chop was cooked well, and all the flavors melded together well. It was a good portion size, and wasn't at all overwhelming. For dessert, I had the new to the menu at the time parsnip cake. It was flavored well (think about it as a take on carrot cake), but perhaps a little too moist if you like a drier crumb. I, however, enjoyed its almost pudding like consistency. I had a bite of my friend's apple crisp, and that was also well executed. There's only one thing wrong with this restaurant. . . I left my iPhone there late Saturday night and I cannot reach anyone at the restaurant this morning, Sunday /. It's important that I get it back right away. The iPhone is displaying my phone numbers. If anyone from the restaurant reads this, please contact me ASAP. I will take this post down as soon as the phone is in my hands again. Thank you. (later that same day)Indeed, Fable found my phone and I'm a happy customer. I decided not to take the post down but rather to embellish on it. Satuday night's meal was excellent. We walked in and not only got the WINDOW table on a beautiful evening, but we got exemplary service and even a Pinot Grigio with a pink tint! It was delicious. And everything I ordered included crab (just now in season). . . it's easy to screw up crab, but Fable does not! Check this place out. . . just don't get so smashed that you leave your two day old iPhone S behind! Ta ta for now. How adorable is this place?  First I think mostly of clubs when I think of Castro so to find this really cute dinner spot was amazing!  The decor is so classy and the mirrors on the walls are all pictures of Aesop's fables, like the name. Get it?  I ordered the chicken breast and my friend ordered the beef stew, both of which were classics and very tasty.  Our waiter was maybe a little disappointed that we are not big spenders ordering wine and appetizers and dessert, but he was still very, very nice, like all the other staff at the restaurant.  This would be a great, kind trendy, but not too cool for school place to take a date for dinner.  Super cute, super friendly waiters and good food.  Enjoy! Honestly DELICIOUS! Cutesy romantic little neighborhood vibe place.  It's an amazing find, and not overrun or uber trendified. Great wine list. Nice waiter. Food was outstanding. Caesar with little gem lettuce was zesty and the chicken stuffed w spinach and gruyere was cooked to perfection. I WILL BE BACK. . . often! Warm lighting and romantic vibe with spot on service. Reservations were not a problem. Staff is on point, friendly, and non intrusive. Albeit fork tender, the pork cheeks with salad tasted lackluster and did not live up to its hype. The roasted Brussels sprouts with grapes and pistachios, however, inspired my Thanksgiving offering this year. My friend's crispy skinned chicken was salted properly and well executed. My pork chop was one the finest I've ever had; the rest of the plate's veggies offered fragrant bitter notes to balance out sweet, juicy meatiness. Portions are substantial. Stomachs leave satisfied, but yearning for something a little more inspiring. . . Not impressed. Don't seat us at the fricken bar when we can see  empty tables the entire time we are there. Skimpy wine pours at ridiculous prices and had to lasso someone for service. . ,actually had to ASK some guy if he worked there (it was the CHEF on his day off working on holiday menus. ) Never, ever again. Food was NOT worthy. The Scallop crudo was absolutely delicious, and the cauliflower was very tasty. My friend ordered the Black Cod topped with dungenous crab. This was a suggestion by the waiter, but honestly, it was too much, very salty and adding the crab took away from the crispiness of the cod. I think both the cod and the dungeness crab would have been better separate from one another.  I ordered the vegan beetloaf, which I read some amazing reviews on, but I felt it was very dry and not very tasty (and I love beets). Overall the experience was moderate, and I don't think I will return. Highly improbable. Getting a table on a Saturday night with such little notice. Caramelized Brussels sprouts with incredible flavor at an accessible $ price. Squash that was completely squashed by our appetites. Cod and crab partnering to create a main more delicious than either could do solo. Grilled vegan beetloaf is the only part of the story with regret. Should have done it. Bottles of $ Argentinian red wine to wash it all down. Personality and a consistent yet subtle attention to detail by the staff. Whimsical design touches like antlers accented by lights in an otherwise relaxed and polished environment. That was just the food and experience. If I were to tell you the story of how we got there and who I was with the story would take forever. Improbable and at least for this Fable completely true. To anyone who is looking to have a wonderful dining experience, Fable is your place. I absolutely loved it. The food is to die for. The service is unbelievable. They've been around a year and I only just heard about the place from a friend who has been a few times. I don't know who the chef is but he is a GOD. I don't know who the person was who served us last night but he was amazing. It's a small place and once it becomes popular it will be impossible to get in. Go check it out. It will be a night you will not regret. My new favorite by far. Thank you Fable for such a lovely experience. We dropped in for an early sunday evening meal. I had the braised pork cheeks with kale and other salad type things. The salad part of this appetizer was actually better than the meat, though it was best when both were eaten together. My main was a risotto with fish and tangerine, which was both good and interesting. The gf had a sweet potato curry soup and the caesar salad with added crab.  The added crab part wasn't on the menu, but she read about it on yelp and heard another server telling the group next to us about it. The soup was okay and the salad good/crab fresh, but I don't see why people would rave about it. Maybe we tried to order too quickly, but when we said ""We are ready to order"" the waiter didn't take the time to tell us whether there were any specials or even what the soup was that night (We only ended up with the soup because the gf kept asking if they had any specials or soups of the day she should know about). They also didn't bring out bread until we asked, though since I think I should be avoiding bread more often than not this might be a good policy rather than another sign of a relatively inattentive waiter. Overall the food was very good and the service was otherwise very pleasant.  I forgot to mention desert  the chocolate mousse was really good. I had such high expectations but everything was VERY average and I ended up skipping dessert which is definitely not something I do often!Started with the Caesar that received a lot of hype but even with the fresh crab, it was still just lettuce, shaved parmesan cheese and average dressing. Where were the croutons?! My date got the Pork Belly which was again OK but not something spectacular. I actually enjoyed the kale more than the Pork Belly. As for mains, we ordered the Chicken stuffed with Spinach and Cheese and the Fresh Fish  very average and despite walking in really hungry, neither of us finished our dinners and decided to get dessert elsewhere. Maybe it was an off night but I have a hard time recommending this Fable with nearby options like Frances. I came here with a friend after work who had heard good things about this place. We started out sitting outside as suggested by the hostess but the wind was coming down hard off of Twin Peaks so decided to head indoors. They provided blankets and the outdoor heaters were blazing but we couldn't take it. I liked how the took care of us. Ok, on to the food. The meals that I remember were the pork cheek and the scallops with pork belly. These dishes were outstanding but the portions were on the small side. I only got  scallops and even though they were delicious, they weren't as substantial as you'd expect. The wine we got was so so. I also thought I'd get something a bit more special but the wines seemed ordinary. The service was good overall. I'd like to check it out again sometime I'm in the Castro. Surprisingly good, especially compared to the choices in the neighborhood. My favorite dish of the night was the scallop crudo, which had avocado, diced pear and some hot peppers, that added some complexity with its heat.  Never had a dish like this with these combination of ingredients.  Also good were the pork cheeks, which were more substantial that I would have guessed. For entrees, the black cod served over risotto was good but even better was the pork chop.  They recently changed up the menu so that it was no longer served with grits and a honey glaze. Rather, it had scalloped potatoes on a bed of sauteed greens.  Still quite nice. Don't think they served any alcohol other than wine.  Overall, a very nice place to catch up with good friends. Good food. Nice ambiance. Now there's three good places to eat in the Castro! Tried this on a recent long weekend trip to SF and in short: fable was FABULOUS. We mostly enjoyed every creative dish and there wasn't a plate that left the table without being licked clean.  Plus, the wine list was solid along with the service and delightful ambiance.  We started with the Dijon braised pork cheeks.  While the cheeks were underseasoned, the texture was terrific as was the accompanying kale and pink lady apple salad with the crispy shallots and cider vinaigrette.  YUM.  My pork was perfection:  medium rare with a great sear on the outside and savory juices on the inside; great greens and fall vegetable gratin were sensational sides.  While the appearance was underwhelming, the heirloom tomato and beet salad was solid and the fennel was a delightful bonus.  My vocal Italian friend was sorely disappointed with her so called bed of risotto (overcooked and not arborrio).  But, she loved her black Cod.  The fig and bleu cheese side was also disappointing.  I'd go back here in a heartbeat on a future visit to the Castro. Cute, casual, and non pretentious . . . perfect setting for a fun date night!The food is your standard new American style deliciousness.  Unfortunately for Fable, this is something that other restaurants in SF do really well, so it's hard to stand out. The menu changes regularly, presumably due to the need to jump on the local/ farm fresh movement.  This is what we had on the night we went:() Mint tartare with scallop and avocado.  Actually, the scallops were supposedly the main ingredient, but the mint was so strong I could barely taste anything else.  () Sauteed rock cod with creamy risotto.  So rich, so delicious, and so filling that my date had to finish it for me after he devoured his. . . () Pork chop with bourbon honey glaze.  'Nuff said. () Chocolate mousse with caramel whipped cream and chipotle sea salt.  Despite not finishing my entree, I somehow made room for this and almost single handedly finished what was supposed to be a shared dessert.  Oops. One thing that threw us off was that we had to order all our food at once because the kitchen wanted to pace our courses for us.  Which we found strange, because by choosing our appetizer first while we ponder our main entrees, would that help with the pacing? Also, the wait staff couldn't seem to charge the right amount on my date's credit card.  First, they overcharged him.  Then, they undercharged him.  For the record, this meal, with two glasses of wine and a diet Coke, cost ~$ without tip.  I'd call this slightly overpriced for something that is supposed to be a casual dinner, but maybe I haven't been in SF long enough to think this is completely reasonable. The slowly receding memories last night from my Fable experience continue to linger as dancing thoughts of the banana pudding haunt my consciousness.   The dessert aside, my second visit to Fable impressed me once again.  This time I noticed the chef standing proudly in front of his open kitchen approving and making final touches to every dish that make their exit from the hands of the subordinate sous chefs.  The menu is consistently fresh with new dishes to reflect the current available meats and vegetables.  I was pleased with my prime rib and the original preparation of the potatoes.  The staff are always pleasant and tentative to your needs.  When your feeling like a night out in the Castro hit this place up. My wife and I tried Fable for the first time over the weekend and based on our experience it deserves the great reviews. Here are some of the highlights: The ambiance is warm and inviting. Fable's dining area is an intimate space, with interesting etched glass windows and dark wood throughout. We had a cozy table for two, and although the noise level was ""energetic,"" we never felt like we had to shout at each other to enjoy our conversation (over a great bottle of wine). The food was very good. We started with some wonderful figs with Maytag blue cheese, and for entrees, my wife had a cod dish over risotto, and I had the center cut pork chop. We also shared a dish of the caramelized Brussel sprouts. Everything was excellent. (The deserts were good, but unmemorable  definitely not the highlight of the meal).  We had a couple of minor mix ups with our orders, otherwise, we would have given Fable  stars. The waitstaff was eager to please, though, and offered us our desserts for free, which was very much appreciated. Regardless, based on this one experience, I would definitely recommend this place to friends and it's likely that we'll be going back at some point. Excellent food, excellent service. Nice, intimate ambience. Really enjoyed all of the food  from salad to desert. My date and I tried two different deserts, both of which were delicious and had a touch of an unexpected flavor that worked really well. Can't afford to eat here regularly (yet), but will come back sometime. The patio outside was heated with lamps and just lovely.  Gracious, attentive service by our waiter (with a tattoo sleeve) and the manager.  The food was wonderful and thoughtfully prepared.  We got the beet salad and soft shell crab as appetizers, the scallops entree and scallop appetizer as our main dishes, and the raspberry/pear crisp for dessert.  Went there for our anniversary, and it made for a perfect night.  We'll definitely go back. Went here last night with a group of friends for a birthday celebration. We got the pork cheeks and clam strips to start and a carafe of their sangria. All were fantastic. Like that the carafe of sangria was presented as a carafe of wine + fruit and ice in the wine glasses. The sangria was great, but I thought it overpriced. Wouldn't do that again despite its tastiness. We sat on the back patio, which is really nicely landscaped. Not only do they have heaters, but each chair has a soft, cuddly blanket, too! Very nice touch. For entrees, I got the pork chops, two got the pot roast, and one got a caesar salad with sides of winter vegetable gratin and caramelized brussels sprouts. Impressions: Pork chop: AMAZING. A fantastic crispy crust on the meat, and the bourbon huckleberry jus was incredibly flavorful (nice touch of garlic). It came with spinach (good, not a standout) and the vegetable gratin (could have been very good, but I thought it a bit underdone). I'm not a huge pork chop fan, but I would order this again without hesitation.  Pot roast: Got great reviews! I didn't try it, but it looked lovely.  Caesar salad: Again, didn't try, but it looked great.  Caramelized brussels sprouts: These were FANTASTIC. For the portion size, however, I thought them way over priced. Same with the side of gratin. We ended with the banana wafer pudding, which we all enjoyed. Strong banana presence, and dare I say, a touch of Speculoos perhaps?I would definitely go back. Recently I dined out with two friends of mine who happen to be amazing chefs.  We had an extended discussion about the lack of really great food in the Castro.  Yes, Frances is AMAZING, but you cannot show up there on a whim and have a lovely meal. So after a sub par dining experience else where earlier this week, my hubby and ventured down to Fable to give it a try.  I crossed my fingers and toes that it would be good.  It was not only good; it was VERY good.  I would honestly give the food a .  stars and the atmosphere and staff a  star rating. The interior is intimate and warm with an outdoor eating area (we sat at the chef counter).  Our waitress was lovely and attentive; food was prepared exactly as requested and well paced. You can actually hold a conversation in there without screaming and yet it was not dead pan quiet. Since we were on limited time (movie date night) we kept it simple.  I had the pork cheeks and kale salad (lovely flavors) and the sauteed brussel sprouts (with a balsamic reduction that was fantastic and with roasted black grapes).  The pork cheek salad was well portioned as a small plate and with a side of sprouts was plenty for a lighter meal. My hubby had the pork chop.  Let's just say, pork chops are his *thing*.  He likes them medium rare and most places never get it right.  So he asked for it medium rare to slightly rare, and low and behold it was EXACTLY that.  Super flavorful with a side of bitter greens and grilled pears.  We actually asked the chef to commend his line staff for getting it right the guys were very proud!Desert was a quick banana bread pudding.  OMG. . . we nearly licked the bowl. All in all, a lovely meal.  We will return again.  The moral of the story: try and try again. We ate at Fable on a Saturday  arrived a half hour early for our reservation, but was seated right away since we were there soon after the restaurant had opened for the dinner meal.  The food was really good and well constructed.  Service was impeccable.  The menu selections are varied and the servers are well informed and can answer questions well.  This is a great romantic spot and a thoroughly enjoyable place for a good meal.  Recommended. Loved this spot!Attentive staff. Beet salad with goat cheese was good. A little overdressed for my liking. Baked potato was delicious. I usually don't like sour cream, but this was the perfect baked potato. Brussel sprouts were cooked with the right amount of salt. Pork chop was so good. Not as good as Nopa, but a close second.  A fine medium rare! Tender and delicious!Banana & wafer pudding lacked a little sweetness. . . maybe a caramelized banana would've added a little character. Maybe I should have opted for the chocolate mousse. Would go again. The Caesar looked awesome. Loved the presentation of the other dishes including the scallops and chicken. Just ate here last night. Loving the dark romantic vibe. . . . Food was excellent and so was the service!I enjoyed the braised pork cheeks. . . . served with this perfect marinated kale salad topped with fried onions. . . The crispy chicken was phenomenal. Served with perfectly whipped japanese yam. . . I am definitely going back for that one soon. I also ordered a side of the padron peppers. delicious. Worth checking out ;) I ate at Fable while visiting San Francisco with my family. We all have different tastes (and there is a vegetarian) so selecting a place to eat that has good proteins and vegetarian options can be tricky. Fable reviews looked good (thanks, yelp!) so we stopped in. We didn't have a reservation, but the receptionist was helpful in finding us a group seating at the bar. We were seated, and then a corner freed up so they suggested we move so we could talk easier. I don't have enough good things to say about the staff  our server was excellent and made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy the food. The food. I got pork belly and scallops. The scallops were cooked perfectly. By the end of the meal, not one bit of food was left on anyone's plate. Success! Pretty much the best option for a nice dinner in the Castro. It's not as hard to get a reservation (ahem Frances) and the price point is fair. It's very cozy inside but it never felt cramped. Service was five star and I appreciated that they could accommodate our dietary restrictions. Once upon a time two people didn't make a reservation at Frances and decided to come here instead of waiting in line. They had the pork chop and the pot roast, and while both were good, neither were just right. Food here is good, but not all that memorable. Normally when I see .  stars on Yelp, I expect to be blown away. I either expect a food orgasm with every new dish or an incredible value for my money. Fable sadly offers neither. I've definitely had better for this price (~$ an entree). Three stars for good but unremarkable food and another star for decor and ambience. It's a cute place to bring a date, but given that there are so many great places in SF to eat, I don't think I will be back. Yumm!! Had a great time here!! We had a reservation for , arrived at  and told the staff we had an event at . We were seated ate some delicious food and still made it to our show:). Thank you Eric for being so sweet! Il definitely return Yum! Glad for a great new restaurant in the neighborhood! Hopefully other places will step up their game. Nice space. Food was excellent, service is friendly and professional. O. M. G. The following are to die for:. Braised pork cheeks. Eggplant stuffed with goat cheese. Padron peppers. Crispy chicken with Japanese yamI was beginning to start feeling disappointed in SF restaurants; it had been a long time since I felt totally blown away by one. Thank you, Fable, for showing me otherwise!Great food and great service. I've made reservations to come back. Pretty mediocre all the way around.  One server was very pleasant but batty.  Other server was unpleasant at best.  Host is your stereotypical queen, polite but with an attitude that is ready to strike should you cross her. Food is not bad but far from great. Everything about my dining experience here was fantastic. The service was attentive and everything we ordered was thoughtful, creative and fresh. I think this is a new gem of a restaurant in Castro. . . I would definitely go back! Great new foodie hangout. From the very beginning of entering this gem in the Castro we were treated with excellent service and food that is expertly  prepared. The dishes ingredients are beautifully paired and fresh. We had the tomato salad that had fresh sliced peaches and shiso and a tasty vinegar dressing, it was amazing. My five spice roasted chicken was absolutely delicious and the mashed potatoes and vegetables where a prefect match to the chicken. We are so happy to have a great foodie Resturant in the Castro neighborhood. I can't wait until they open up the outdoor seating. The food was amazing and my waiter was on top of everything. I definitely recommend Fable! Fable is a cute little restaurant just popped up in the Castro. It's a great spot for a date or to catch up with some friends. Someone compared them to Frances but that is really unfair because Frances adds alot of extra creativity to the menu than at Fable. Food here is solid, with highlights and low lights. There was nothing particularly exceptional but it was a good dinner, albeit a bit on the pricey side given the quantity. I especially loved the acme rustic rolls, Cabernet Sauvignon (ouch  $/glass), and side of corn (super sweet and fresh!). Everything else was pretty good  make sure to pass on the Mac and cheese. Great food at dinner.  Pork cheeks are amazing and the chicken was one the best mains I've had this year.  Fantastic service too: everyone has been universally cheerful, positive and competent.  Complimentary dessert as one of the mains was a cold.  Great wine price too.  Wouldn't hesitate to recommend for dinner.  Brunch was much less successful and so I'd probably stick to dinner. This place is a great addition to the neighborhood. I love the food and the atmosphere. The staff are friendly and attentive without being intrusive. Just a great relaxed vibe with great food and wine. We need more of this in the hood. I really want this place to succeed, because the gayborhood needs more nice places to have a great evening and a great meal. The food was fine.  The wine was great.  We had a lousy table, next to a place where plates and silver were being clanged! and banged!, but what can you do?But for the prices they're charging, they need to pay attention to service and attitude.  Some examples:. The host was snotty, both on the phone (you could sniff the attitude) and in person.  We felt really unwelcome before we even arrived. . The server had this totally phony, unpleasant affect.  I don't need to be coddled or fawned over, but I do want to feel that the folks who work at a nice restaurant are. . . Nice. Pleasant  Agreeable.  Professional. The whole staff should go to Frances, which is charging the same amount for a meal, to see what I mean.  Or Delfina, or Firefly, or some other restaurant in walking distance aiming for the same upscale clientele, with lovely staff who know how to interact in a genuine way with diners. . The single most important thing: We arrived at , the restaurant was never full, they were not trying to turn our table, nor were they eager to get rid of us to close the place.  But at least a half dozen times, staff zoomed over to our table to try to take away half finished dishes.  ""Are you done with that?""  ""Can I take that away?""  Over and over again.  This creates the totally wrong vibe: It's not K Pop across the street where the bottom line might depend on turnover.  It's a place where maybe folks want to linger over a meal (again, they weren't trying to turn the table).  Relax! Especially at the prices you're charging. . As we left, our server and another server were out front smoking. That's really a turnoff, and not something you see elsewhere.  If the staff who is handling your food smokes, they usually do it where the customers can't see. Again: Take the whole staff out to Frances.  See how a restaurant charging what you're charging and angling for the same clientele in the same neighborhood gets it all right. So here is the deal, Byron was the best server at a previous restaurant. Now he is here. I trust that this place is amazing. Service alone. . . it's worth coming here for Byron! Loving their wine list and food!Pork Cheeks  amazingScallops  amazing (they were a special)Overall great experience. The entire staff was actually great as well. Came here recently with two friends for the first time. Service was fine, our waitress was attentive and personable. The issue for us was just the caliber of the food for the price. We ordered: Melon salad appetizer Soft shelled crab with an avocado slaw (appetizer special) Scallop and pork belly entree (special) ""Beetloaf"" entree Mac and cheese side dish Caramelized brussels sprouts side dishTotal came to $. The appetizers were just okay, not great but not bad either. The beetloaf, mac and cheese (very watery) and bsprouts (bad/weird flavor  and we're all big brussels sprout fans) were all major disappointments. My friend said that the scallops and pork belly were cooked well, so that seemed to be the winner of the night. For us the food just didn't deliver, and if I'm going to spend $ on  apps,  entrees and  small sides I'd much rather do so at Frances. Great food with a lovely wine list. Each menu selection has a suggested wine pairing. My wife and I shared the soup of the day, corn chowder, and the heirloom tomato salad. Both were amazing. She had the pot roast and I went for the the mixed kabobs. Again, both were very nice. We'll be going back again soon. *Great service. lovely ambiance. Friendly, attentive, patient with our questions, professional but not pretentious. Laid back and sophisticated at the same time!*Braised Pork Cheek  delicious and tender, rounded out well with granny smith apple/cider vinaigrette. *Pot Roast  Great flavor! Loved this dish, really well executed. *Au gratin  good, but the consistency was too thin which made it a bit awkward to eat. The flavor was strong and it tasted great, but it seemed more like a soup with odd vegetables. (large pieces of onion, squash dominated) I ended up dipping my bread in though and it was tasty, not gonna lie. *Risotto was cooked perfectly. Most delicious maybe I've ever had!Can't wait to return. Keep up the great work Fable, Castro needs more restaurants like you! Fable, how have I forgotten to review you?Fable is awesome.  Jon in the kitchen is amazing and Eric runs the dinning room.  The service is professional, and relaxed.  Food is quality, interesting, and delicious.   I've enjoyed dinner here a few times and each time it gets better.  Keep up the good work boys, thank you. Absolute  stars!!The service was great. The food was cooked and prepared perfectly. We order everything from wine and aps to desert and even a few side dishes. Everything that was brought out to us was above and beyond what was expected. I have been telling all my friends and family about this place. MUST GO! We stopped in here tonight for the first time. Anchor was full, and we were on our way to Starbelly but needed to run an errand on the other side of Castro, and the menu posted in front of Fable caught my eye. A bunch of interesting choices, many of them  nicely seasonal. We had no problem getting in as early as we were; the restaurant was filled by the time we left. We had one of those wonderful first time here not a wrong note experiences at Fable. Our starter (a tomato/cucumber/white peach salad) was fresh, light, and summery. The pot roast was as good as my Mom's  a compliment I've never dished out until now, my Mom made great pot roast! The summer squash gratin side dish  complemented the pot roast perfectly.  And the coconut cream cake was to die for. We're looking forward to exploring other parts of the menu in future visits. The service was terrific, informal, friendly, not too prompt, not too slow, just right. The noise level suited the meal  not too loud, but not deadly quiet either. To my surprise, the Castro is starting to become a foodie destination. Who'd a thunk it? In the long hiatus between the time Ryan's closed on th Street and Frances opened, the neighborhood was a culinary disaster, with Anchor providing the only high quality option. I've lived in the neighborhood a long time and usually left it for another part of town when I wanted a good meal. But now, with Eiji, Frances, and Fable coming on to the scene, we can get great meals close to home. Low and mid priced entries like Chow, Burger Meister, and Pica Pica round things out nicely. We had dined here at Fable several months ago and although the service was a little bit awkward, the food was really good. We were very excited to dine here again with our good friend. I had made reservations for the  of us a week in advance. I received a phone call from the restaurant the day prior to confirm and inform me that they will only hold the table for  minutes if we don't call to inform them in the event we were running late. We arrived on time looking forward to a evening of good food, wine and conversation. HOWEVER, the host started to seat us in the front table in the window that is by any reasonable person's standard, barely enough room for . Not to mention that it was a high table and we had to sit on bar stools. I told the host that we were very uncomfortable with the accommodations and ask him to seat us else where. He said that he would try but they had large groups in the back and he didn't think he could, but he said he would try. I believe this restaurant has a lot going for it. Great food and wine list. However, from a service perspective they seem to struggle. A professional host would have informed us that they had large groups and they were running behind. The host would also offer us the option of the substandard table or provide us with some expectation of a more reasonable table and an estimated wait time upfront without me having to ask. We were very disappointed, hungry and although the host thought he might be able to come up with a ""plan"", we couldn't wait and moved on. Luckily we were able to find a place and was able to enjoy good food and wine at a different restaurant without reservations. Slightly reminiscent of the Dot Com days when poor service was the norm in San Francisco. I know that they wouldn't have any problems seating a party of  or  that would be willing to sit in a very uncomfortable space after we left. The service was terrible. Just terrible. Our waitress didn't seem to give a sh*t about us and neither of us, my friend and I, felt welcome at this place. The food pretty good, although more expensive than it was worth, and that's the only reason it didn't get one star. I do not recommend and I will not be eating there again. Ugh. . . I really wanted to like this place. . Rebuffed by the host. (Anyone remember Dana Carvey's host charecter on SNL? ""Wait at the bar, wait at the bar. . . . "") . Our waitress was NOT in the mood. (Don't they realize that it's obvious when your being a bitch with a smile on your face?). Manager couldn't be bothered. (He literally asked if we we're okay from the KITCHEN. ). Food was delicious but not amazing. (For $, I expected more. )Most likely a perfect storm situation.  Worth a try I guess. I had no expectations when I came here for dinner a while ago, and was pleasantly surprised.  Our server was the friendliest and smiliest server I've seen in a while. We kept asking her lots of questions about the menu (they were legit questions, but we also liked talking to her, so had to keep asking questions).  We shared several appetizers and side dishes.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  The bread they serve was a nice crusty one, a free plus. We had dinner here on Friday and the food was very good, the service was great, and an all around great time. We walked in to our pm reservation and the previous group was finishing up. After waiting for less than  minutes, our group was seated. Immediately after sitting our waitress asked if she could get us started with water, wine, and/or beer. The four of us shared a bottle of wine and we ordered a couple appetizers (pork cheek so good!). I had the chicken, which was good. But, my partner had the wedge salad and pork chop, which was amazing. We also all shared a side of delicious mac n cheese. Such a good meal and a great experience! This little place is a great addition to Castro Street.  We shared a salad (blue cheese wedge), two entrees (pork chop and chicken), and glass of chardonnay for $ (including tip), so quite reasonable for the quality of the food.  All selections were fabulous.  Service was attentive and pleasant.  Really enjoyed this place and definitely recommend. evening reservations in the castro. . . quaint, casual, long and narrow fable. . . quite charming and nice. . . simple small menu variety for anyone. . . chicken, duck, lamb, pork, fish and even vegan. . . almost everything near $twenty main. . . simple bread and salted butter complimentary and good. . . under $fifteen starters. . . starting with strawberry salad and pork cheeks to share. . . dainty small plates of sweet strawberry and greens quite fresh. . . . pork cheeks delicious and succulent. . . found the chicken breast to have a nice salted crust and similar on the tuna. . . grilled pork chops flavorful, decent and filling. . . sliced lamb okay, but boring. . . finding the meals quite simple and decent meal overall. . . $one hundred twenty five total for four people. . .

Get the quinoa stuffed portobello mushroom, beautifully charred and offset with some kind of tangy/creamy sauce and grilled squashes. Waitstaff is incredible. So helpful and courteous. Yep. . Your eyes are not playing tricks on you   stars from me for Fable!We went for dinner on our first night in San Fran and had a wonderful time. I had the dijon crusted pork cheeks as entree and the crispy skinned chicken breast for  the main; and they were both amazing. For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse w/ whipped cream and it was well, for lack of a better word. . . quite simply orgasmic. . . I'm still thinking about it now and the pork cheeks as well!Fable serves modern american dishes and their prices are quite affordable + the service is great. They're quite busy so be sure to make a reservation prior to going. . I really enjoy my dining experience here. The food was great, and the wait staff was really friendly and accommodating. I would totally recommend this restaurant. First of all, impeccable service. Secondly, Jesus H. the food is good.  Pork cheeks, halibut, mac and cheese and chocolate mouse I DIE.  All done perfectly.  Plus, I love a space where they let you take your time.  We had lots of wine, lots of conversation and delicious food over a two hour period.  A fantastic date night. Thirdly, patio is coming soon. Boom. GO! EAT! GET IT ON AFTER! I am very impressed by this new Castro neighborhood spot! The ambiance is intimate, and seating inside is quite limited,(FYI, make a reservation well in advance), while the outside seating area has a fire pit that is great to have a drink and wait for your table to be ready. The menu was simple, but had many options for shared appetizer plates, and entrees. The staff was knowledgeable, professional, attentive, and there was good Motown music playing to lighten the mood. I recommend the pork pot stickers as an appetizer, (they were bread crusted and savory), and the braised lamb or pork chop for entrees all were well seasoned and served right. Given how high grade the foodie quality of the food was, the price was quite reasonable. Chef Hearnsberger, the main owner and formerly of Woodfish Grill is an outstanding chef. Fable is a gorgeous little place with a charming interior and lovely patio out back. The food and service really are impressive quite possibly the best restaurant in the Castro and one of the best gems in the city. Regardless of your tastes and preferences in food and dining options, you and your friends should at least give this place a onceover. It's definitely worth it. Meh.  Another offering in line with the neighborhood tradition: an ""all form, little  substance"" Castro dining experience. To be fair, the service was excellent, very attentive.  The food was beautifully presented (very pretty on the plate!) but mediocre in taste, oversalted, tiny portions.  Noisy and crowded.  I'm unlikely to return. Absolutely  stars. But then again my friends own the place and I couldn't expect anything less. But you be the judge. Service is outstanding. The food was amazing. . . try the Pot Roast or the Chicken with one of their side dishes or the Gem Salad. Now one word of advice. . . MAKE A RESERVATION! or you are taking a chance since they have been solid booked since the first day they opened. Went here after walking around Castro for awhile. They didn't have any room but took our number to call when something opened up. We sat at the chef's bar which is always fun. Nice waiter explained some of the dishes for us. Had the calamari & the green goddess salad to start  both very good. Two of us had the crispy chicken w/sticky rice  delicious. One had the pot roast & said it was delicious. The rhubarb strawberry crisp was a little too sweet for me. Overall nice place, would recommend it for a leisurely meal with good service & food, not too pricey & a good wine list  as well. I had an absolutely fantastic experience at Fable Sunday night. We actually only discovered that they've been open for a little while now by checking the web. It was a wonderful surprise to have a new restaurant open in our hood and to find that the food was so good. Plus, they've really improved the decor and ambience of this space. Someone has a good eye for presentation and it shows. We had a couple rounds of tasty wine to accompany our appetizer and main courses. We shared the special soft crab mixed salad, which was fresh, well seasoned, and just enough to tide us over 'til the main event. I had the pot roast, he had the wild salmon and neither could have been more content. The pot roast was obviously carefully slow roasted and produced a really tasty gravy to dip the mashed potatoes and veggies in. There were carrots, asparagus, fava beans, and I believe tiny cherries. It was awesome! Ordinarily I would pass on dessert but I figured I had to top off such a pleasant experience with something sweet. The chocolate mousse w/ salted caramel whipped cream fit the bill. It was light but such a nice treat. All in all, Fable is great and we will definitely be returning soon! The best food I've had in the Castro. I started with the corn chowder, a soup I would normally avoid due to it being more of a gummy paste. This corn chowder was actually soup like and had such a delicious, fresh corn flavor to it. I tried the leg of lamb with potato cake and vegetables. The lamb may be the best lamb I've ever had, and the potato cake was quite delicious. Dessert was the dark chocolate mousse, which can only be described as sinful! Parking is what is is since you are dining in the Castro, but this one is worth the trip even if you don't live in the Castro area! The Castro finally gets a good restaurant!I have eaten here twice and had great experiences both times.  The meat was cooked as I ordered it (which should be a given but sadly is not), the service was good, and it was just an overall pleasant upscale experience. I would ask that they consider not playing music when they are busy.  It just adds to the noise. This place will be even better (and more popular) when they open the patio in the back. This was a great experience.  Yes there was a short wait for our table but the staff kept us informed about the situation, we had our wine and really I do go out to eat to relax and enjoy the company of my friends.  The food was excellent and the service (Thank you Ramsey) was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  I live right around the corner and I'm sure I'll be back often.  They also told us that brunch has been added to the schedule, I predict French Toast in my near future. Having recently moved to SF, I was told that the food in the Castro left a little to be desired. Which is why I was so thrilled to have found Fable on Castro between th and th. Though the menu is not large, each item is well crafted and memorable. The staff also deserves special mention, as all of the servers, clearers and hosts were friendly and helpful. I can't wait to go back! Our party of  made reservations one week in advance.  We arrived about  minutes early and our table was ready on Saturday night. .  We tried many items on the menu and everything was very good.  Service and ambiance exceeded our expectations.   The chef owner even managed time to stop by our table. Fable is still relatively new but they seem to have settled in and have their sea legs.  Long and short of it, Fable serves very good food, provides very good and caring service and is a very nice venue. I started my meal with a sweet corn bisque.  Happily this wasn't some too sweet, cream based diet busting bowl of soup.  Rather it was based on a light broth that was filled with corn, potatoes, and some very nice and subtle spicing that brought the bowl to life.  Great. Dijon crusted pork cheeks came with lacinato kale and granny smith apples.  Bullseye!  Another big winner.  The mustard perfectly complemented the braised, tender, not too fatty pork cheeks.  The kale was a mellowing influence on the plate that was highlighted by the apples.  Wonderful. Next a main of leg of lamb that came with a potato patty and freshly braised vegetables. The lamb was nicely cooked to medium rare but it's taste was so ephemeral that it might have been beef.  The vegetables and potato were nicely done.  So, the weakest plate of my meal was only very good. My pour of pinot noir was generous as were the portions of each course.  Pricing is very fair given the quality of the food. I will certainly come back and you should try this place. Good place and the chef and staff are really making a  percent effort.  Reservations definitely recommended. It's nice to see the restaurant scene in the Castro starting to improve with the additions of Starbelly, Frances and now Fable in the past few years. We had a date night here tonight and the food was fabulous from beginning to end.  We started with the gem salad with green goddess dressing and ahi tuna salad.  Both salads were superb.  Our main courses were the lamb and the pot roast.  The lamb was medium rare and tender.  The pot roast was beefy and tender.  Delicious.  Dessert was the dark chocolate mousse with caramel whipped cream, and sourdough bread pudding in a cherry sauce.  Wonderful. Don't hesitate  go eat here.  You won't be sorry. Oh, service was also terrific from the greeting from the host to our server to the man who prepared our salads and desserts.  We ate at the counter.  The food was prepped and plated carefully and presented well.  We'll be returning. The new Castro restaurant Fable was really good.  Food tends to have bold flavors with some creativity.  Service was good too.  Seating is a bit hard due to demand.  Special fried soft shell crab was very tasty.  Tuna tartare was some of the best I've tried.  Leg of lamb was good and the blue cheese broccoli gratin was quite flavorful.  Usually don't do dessert, but the bitter sweet chocolate Carmel moose with sea salt was worth the $.  Overall great choice if you can get in. I love to cook and silently despise people who criticize my food.  Ironically, I must be a sucker for torture because I silently love their criticisms in the same way, as it allows me to refine my methods to make a better spread the next time around.  Ambiance was awesome, chef/owner was very nice and staff was very attentive.  After having waited for about an hour to be seated (we went to have drinks at another place and they conveniently called us when our table was ready, which was nice) we ordered a few items that seemed very palpable on the menu.  When we received our meals, they were very well presented and looked yummy but (think drum roll from national lampoons christmas vacation/no lights) they didn't taste as well as they were presented.  I ordred the pot roast and my friend ordered the lamb, both of which were just, meh. I loved that the pot roast was served on a bed of legumes and had a nice gravy poured on top of it and the meat was very tender but the flavor was pretty bland (kick the gravy up maybe?).  I can't speak for my friend's lamb but the taste I had was mediocre and left me wanting a richer sauce on that as well.  However, I AM glad I ordered the macaroni and cheese (goat cheese added a kick) and the chocolate mousse dessert was very delish (I think it had salted caramel whipped cream on top, YUM).   In end, I know this is a new place and it shows a lot of potential.  With a little fine tuning, I'm sure this place will become a tasty success. I'll see about coming back in a year for another review. This place is amazing!! Great service and super accommodating. They didn't have a table for us when we got there, but they took our number so we could go have a drink while we waited. The food is incredible  I had the pork tenderloin with their homemade hot sauce and black eyed pea cake best pork I've ever had. My sister had the salmon which she loved, and my friend had the chicken. All great. Nice wine selection, too!Byron the host and Ramsey our waiter were a couple of other highlights so nice and attentive. We literally hugged them when we left!We will definitely be back here, especially when the patio is open in the back. I am ever so glad that Fable is here and that Jon is back! I've been to Fable three times now, and each time I leave more and more crazy about it. We have never had to wait more than ten minutes to be seated (and once was on Mother's Day!) Another time,  I wandered in with a friend during a packed evening, thinking it would be a huge wait, and instead we were seated immediately at the bar, which we loved. The food is amazing  the wine list is interesting and very reasonably priced, and the staff has been lovely. I'm not sure of the name of the host  but he's helpful, fun and professional. This is our new favorite neighborhood spot and we are thrilled. Word on the street (Castro Street) is that brunch is coming soon. Yum. I'm always excited to try a place when it is new. I heard about Fable and made my reservation for a Friday night around pm. We were a little early and were seated right away. The location is convenient and easily accessible at the upper end of Castro. The atmosphere is pleasing. They used the current trendy slate grey with taupe coloring. There is a mural on the long wall. Orange antler horn light fixtures add a pop of color. The bar cozies right up to the kitchen, which is where I will sit next time. The staff was very pleasant and attentive and our waitress was great on suggestions and knowing the menu. Now the food. . . It wasn't trendy enough to be interesting or simple enough to qualify as comfort food. It was tasty enough but not memorable. The restaurant is new and the menu may develop itself.  One exceptional point however was when our plates were picked up, the owner ,Eric, came to our table to ask if we didn't enjoy the macaroni and cheese. We explained there was nothing wrong with it but just not to our liking. When we received our bill, which was very reasonable, the dish had been removed from our bill. That is customer service. When we left, I made a point to express to Eric that his action was exceptional customer service. It is apparent that Eric is passionate about his restaurant. I can appreciate anyone that loves something that much and makes an effort to make it an exceptional experience to the best of their ability. I intend to come back if nothing more than to watch them grow as a local restaurant in the Castro and to show my appreciation for Eric. We had to wait  minutes past our reservation time but the staff was apologetic about the wait.  Other than that glitch, we had a great dinner here. The braised pork cheeks were my favorite, though they are very mustard y.  The kale/apple/shallot mix that accompanies it was really refreshing, I could probably eat a whole bowl of that alone. I got the crispy skinned chicken breast as my main.  I didn't find the chicken to be particularly remarkable but I did like the strawberry salad on the side. Finally, we shared a chocolate mousse, and the salt on top (I think it was chipotle salt? not sure) was a nice added touch. The restaurant is adorably decorated inside.  Great date place, not so much for groups. I wanted to try this new restaurant in the Castro, so I dragged the BF to Fable. After a rocky start (we had to wait over  minutes for a table for two), we were very, very pleasantly surprised by the very nice and attentive waitress and the taste of every dish we had. We had the melon and avocado salad, tuna tartare with (tr especially yummy) crostini, pork chop, and sautéed white corn.  We finished it with the strawberry rhubarb crisp!  I cannot say anything negative about the food or the service!  I am so glad it is there and will most definitely return soon! It's true when people write that we are spoiled living here in San Francisco regarding our choices in dining. But, Fable made me realize that I've also become accustomed to the way dishes are seasoned here in SF. Tonight was a revelation in flavoring familiar dishes.  The North African spiced chicken breast served with a side of ""forbidden rice"" was a wake up call.  I haven't had those spices in a while and it was a welcome change of pace.  The rice contained bits of celery, carrots and fresh, ripe peach.  It was a well thought out dish that paired together unexpectedly for me. The soup that we started with was a cauliflower and parsnip mix.  Served very hot, it was again flavored in a unique way that caught me by surprise. Tonight they offered fresh dungeness crab as an addition to any starter so, we included it in their tarragon flavored green goddess salad.  This salad included little gem lettuce, beets, shaved pecorino cheese and croutons. Service was excellent.  We opted for Trumer Pilsner over a glass of wine tonight.  Dessert was the fresh berry tart. Looking forward to the outdoor space opening soon. Pretty disappointing evening, and it will be hard to think of returning. After having gone to Fable on several occasions, and having enjoyed some very good meals there, we made a reservation weeks in advance for a Friday night. We had to make a last minute change to add one person and were assured there would be no problem to do so. We showed up at pm (the appointed hour) and ultimately left at :, still waiting for a table that was clearly not going to materialize (indeed, as we walked out, the people at the table we were waiting for were being served their entree). In the end, who knows who was at fault, but it does seem that a restaurant that is looking to establish itself in the neighborhood would be more attentive and seek to provide better service. It's not clear what the purpose of making a reservation really is if by  minutes after the appointed hour you are still standing there waiting. To be fair, they offered us a spot at the bar area that faces the open kitchen (although it' s not clear how much longer that would have taken). All in all, really disappointing, especially given how much we had enjoyed the food in the past. Not sure we will return and it's hard to recommend a restaurant with this kind of service given the many, superb options in SF. Really too bad.  But I wish them well. First of all, I must say it is great to have chef/co owner Jon Hearnsberger back in the Castro again!Last night the food was impeccable.  We started with two appetizers, the tuna tartar and the beef cheek, both delicious.  For entrees, I thoroughly enjoyed the lamb.  Probably the best lamb dish I ever had.  My guest felt the same way about the salmon.   For desert, a wonderful chocolate mousse. This is an amazing place. The food was terrific and the service even better. Chicken dish was superb. Likewise the starters/salads. The staff was very attentive and helpful without hovering. This is my first five star rating. Glad I ventured to the Castro for this place!  I wasn't expecting much, but I was blown away by the food.  We ordered all of our server's recommendations, and they were spot on. The food was creative and fresh, and so reasonable priced. The tangerine carpaccio with almond, fennel, avocado and habanero oil was incredible!  Sat at the high bar near the door, which was ok.  Looking forward to the back patio opening in the fall. Took my girlfriend here for a date night.  We'd probably go back. I don't want to be mean to a new business so I'll give them a generous rating of  stars. As you can see, we eat out a lot but on the weekends. It's our thing, we look forward to it. So we've been to a lot of restaurants. And as such we've learned to expect certain things with certain restaurants. Expectations for a taqueria are different than for a French restaurant, for example. With Fable yes we had some expectations. I had to reserve  weeks in advance since they didn't have the time on a Friday we wanted. That very rarely happens to me; usually will get reservations a day or at most a week in advance. Let's start out with the location in the Castro. . very nice. Close to everything. When we arrived, somebody (not sure if he was the host) held up a finger towards us (index) indicating he would be with us soon. And he proceeded to hug his buddies who just arrived (hey gurl!). Never saw him again. Another man appeared, maybe he's the host? I don't know he's wearing jeans and his shirt is untucked. And there's no host stand at the front. Oh we'll just trust him and follow him towards the very back table, by the restroom. Our reserved table!  weeks reservation and we get prime location by the restroom. Yay. So we're at our table.  minutes pass by. . no one says hello, no one greets us. I'm ready to leave. Maybe our server sees this on my face (he's been passing us by this whole time), and finally starts a serving us. He's a nice enough guy; by the end of the evening he's proven himself to be very good and attentive. (But at times also finds his shirt untucked, then tucked again. . hmm this is weird. Same thing with the ""host""). We're looking around. Can't really tell what this place is wanting to project. I see deer and antlers. But they feel like afterthought. The customers are older, mostly gay men. They all seem so serious. And just unhappy. This unhappiness can be seen on the faces of the employees of the restaurant as well. Oh this is not good. I'm starting to get depressed. We need wine!So we order wine. We order some sides instead of the starters as none interested us (they were mostly salads). The mac and cheese and broccoli au gratin. I take out my phone camera to take a pic. . eek you can't tell what they are, so I put my camera away. First sign something is not going to be good: you can't tell what the food is by looking at it. And yup they were mediocre. Mac and cheese was more mac than cheese. The broccoli was more soup du jour than gratin. Neither was cheesy  or creamy enough, and they felt rushed. For main dish I ordered the wild boar sausage, and my partner ordered the pork chops. My generous rating is based on these two dishes: they were very good. And like I said, the server redeemed himself towards the end. I don't however see Fable succeeding, unfortunately. I didn't see passion, excitement, curiousity, or urge to please that most new restaurants should exhibit. This may be one day merely a fable told in a story, and not anything real. Is Fable a dream come true? Not quite but there are some good elements to this story. Positive things+the food was all good to excellent. We ordered five dishes all either starters or side dishes. We had:+the pork cheeks which was the best dish and really would make a good main. three cheeks with a great apple & greens salad. sweet pea soup, it was good but one note in taste and texture & it was served way too hot+grilled artichoke, served with a great aioli and bacon crumble that perfectly cooked and served nice and warm+broccoli and morel gratin, there was simply not enough cheese it in and the morels were overwhelmed by the Béchamel sauce but it was still a very tasty dish mac and cheese. We got the fresh crab with it was an extra  dollars. It tasted best once we mixed it into the mac and cheese. The mac and cheese had a nice flavour but it was missing the cheese and the French Spouse was very disappointed it didn't have any bread crumbs on it and wasn't gratined. We finished with a real French style chocolate mousse which was nice and think the way a mousse is in France and not a pot du creme which is often called ""mousse"" in the US. +The prices are very good for a San Francisco sit down dinner with everything under .  The portions are also good for the price. The less positive super noisy, doesn't appear that they did any sound dampening and everything is hard surfaces, also there was horrible early 's pop Rn'B playing loudly. the host was a bit standoffish when we got there, our server forgot one our dishes, they brought out all the dishes at the same time, food was served way too hot with two dishes. All little things that can be improved. They had almost no non alcoholic drinks not even ginger ale or sprite or sparkling water. The restthe decor is hipster with wall paper that looks like wood, lots of antlers in bright colours and lots of prints of animals. There are mirrors with frosted glass prints of stags which the French Spouse found to be straight out of Vegas but I thought were hipster takes on tapestries. The space isn't large with bar seating and high tables in the front and more formal dining tables in the back. The patio wouldn't be open until the end of summer. All in all, this is a good addition to Castro and is a nice blend of good modern American food at reasonable prices. When I first went to this place, it was so good. . . That I made reservations for the following week, after paying the bill. . . So I never thought I'd be writing this, but. . . The attention to detail is faltering already. . . The plate I ordered last night had  things on the plate, that were each at different temperatures. . . The lamb was cold and of the  sides. . . One was hot and the other was tepid . . . The bread was also tough last night,      Make your own mind up about it. . . But with so many great options available down on Valencia St. . . My advise to the chef is. . . Details, details. . . details. Two of us had dinner at the bar roasted artichoke, chicken, and sole. Every single thing was great, including all the sides. Fantastic! I went last Thursday with my family ( diners in total) and there wasn't space in the restaurant, so they fit us in the bar, right in front of everyone preparing our food. Perfect! It was amazing to see our dishes made literally right in front of us. But this place isn't just about atmosphere the food really shines through. Of all the dishes I tasted, my favorite was definitely the lamb (among the fish, duck, and steak dishes I tried). It just hit all the right notes for me, although it was very difficult to decide which was best. I was a little too nervous to try the Beetloaf, although having tried all those other dishes I'm sure hoping to return and try it. This is definitely my new favorite restaurant in the Castro and hopefully will be returning soon."|2|85|4|Routine Inspection| High risk food holding temperature Inadequate food safety knowledge or lack of certified food safety manager Low risk vermin infestation Improper storage of equipment utensils or linens
Fable 1|4.0|American (New) in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|211|1|4.41666666667|" Amazing food, fantastic service, and the Best duck confit I've ever had!  The staff was super friendly and very professional.  Everyone seemed to help each other out and there was none of that ""This isn't my job"" or ""This isn't my station"" kind of attitude you can get at some upscale restaurants.  The wine and the courses were excellent and would recommend this place to anyone. Can't  wait to go again! It was a Tuesday. A month past my birthday . . . My friend had been promising to take me out to celebrate for a month and we'd finally settled on an evening that we could finally get it together . . .  A Tuesday evening. I chose Fable because the Castro was a convenient area for us to meet up in and we had both been wanting to try it. I made the reservation earlier in the day and the earliest availability for dinner was :pm. It was not our fantasy come true, but we entertained ourselves for a bit before heading over. We were seated at a high table just in from the door. It was a little busy but not distracting. The service was fantastic, our server was a woman who was very friendly and warm and entertained our tangent conversations. We shared most of the food. Grilled Artichoke with bacon breadcrumbs: This was a large whole artichoke split in . It was well done and not over cooked. It had a good flavor and the breadcrumbs added a nice texture. Caesar Salad with Crab: The salad was very good, simple and clean. Split Pea with Ham hock Soup: The consistency was a little watery, but the flavor was rich. I tend to like my split pea a little on the thicker side, but would definitely order this again. Main course, Petrole Sole over spinach and mashed potatoes: This dish came with  fillets which my friend and I split. It was very good, but the piece we split was not as good as the other two pieces. It was a little tough and had a courser texture, so a little inconsistant. Otherwise, it was a great dish. I probably wouldn't order it again because it's not the type of dish I'd generally order for myself. I would try other fish dises though. Macaroni and cheese: This was a small side that we also split. Again, the texture was a little on the watery side, but the flavor was striking. Delicious. For dessert my friend ordered the parsnip cake, similar to a carrot cake but not as sweet. I had the strawberry shortcake. I did not try the parsnip cake, but my friend ate the whole thing without complaint. I think he would have had another piece if it was offered. The strawberry shortcake was simple and refreshing. A shortbread biscuit with fresh whipped cream and strawberries in a sweet sauce. The back patio still isn't open, and won't be until September. I'm looking forward to coming back, especially when the patio opens. The price is a little on the high side, but nothing out of the ordinary. Our bill came to $.  and included a few of glasses of wine. Really great little place; In the old Luna spot. great decor Fable focused paintings line the walls. Excellent Service. Dinner for four included:Pork Chop  DeliciousCrispy Chicken  EXCELLENTPea Soup  DeliciousRoasted Artichoke  Good (slightly bitter)Mac & Cheese  EXCELLENTChocolate Mousse  Good, slightly dense for a mousseDef worth trying out. The patio should be open late summer. Would have a loved a full bar. Beer & Wine only.  Maybe the Menu items could reference Fables:Mary had a Little Lamb Stewthis little piggy pork chopcrispy chicken little. :) Def going back. We found this terrific little place while shopping in the Castro. Totally impressed! Efficient service, napkins that stay on your lap, yummy Acme bread with good salt. The pork cheeks were so intriguing. The composed salad very refreshing. The ceasar was traditional and good. We had the parsnip cake surprising and a little dense but satisfying. The mousse was ok not great but the topping was excellent. Wines were reasonable. New Best restaurant in the Castro! I've been counting on some restaurant veterans to open a neighborhood restaurant in this area. Fable, you have answered my wishes. I've come down here from the hill twice in  weeks (made me the # on the Dukedom list). Onto the food, I ordered a vegan grilled BEETloaf (yes BEET loaf) due to my  weeks meat hiatus. For someone who never had meatloaf in my life, this dish has impressed me a lot. The BEETloaf (beets, flour and lentils?) is nicely grilled and very flavorful. The color of beet is very appetizing. The dish comes with spring onion and garlic mash potatoes, grilled asparagus and tomato sauce garnished with cilantro. They do rotate one vegan dish on the menu (mushroom shepherd's pie, etc. )Dessert menu is simple yet sinful. It encompasses everyone's all time favorites. I've tried their apple crisp with dried cherries and vanilla ice cream  heavenly. Not on the menu is strawberry shortcake (you can see shortcake/biscuits at the counter bar). Biscuits, fresh strawberries, and a lavish crown of whipped cream make us want to come back again. Only  weeks into the business and you've pleased so many customers. Five stars for food, service and ambiance. This is definitely my new go to restaurant. The service was excellent, making a reservation was no problem and easy. When my party arrived, you immediately notice all the adult take of fable characters spread across the whole restaurant. The restaurant is a long narrow space that stretches all the way in and ends at an outdoor patio space. I liked the decor, it's very sophisticated, but yet somewhat playful. Upon our arrival, they let us know that their restaurant was packed so while our table was ready, we were short a chair. That left us one girl standing for awhile until someone managed to bring a chair over. Mind you, that was about  minutes after our arrival. As an apology, they have offered to give us either complimentary wine or dessert. The table ordered the beet loaf, duck, and the pork chops, and the chicken. The chicken was a little dry so that wasn't the favorite. The beet loaf was interesting. It has a bit of a sour tone to it, but I can't say it's completely disgusting. It's definitely interesting, I really don't know how else to describe it. The duck was decent, not the best nor worst. The cauliflower and asparagus side dishes were good. Overall, the food was not bad, the owner comp our dessert so that was nice of them to make up for their mistake. Not a bad place and I wouldn't mind returning, but in order to earn more stars from me, they need to step up their game. We came for an early and there was no wait. They staff including the chef were super nice. The salad appetizer arrived quite expeditiously, however the main course took a pretty long time. They have an open kitchen and its not a big one so perhaps they have a hard time keeping up with the customers. The price is very reasonable and the portions are hearty. I had the pork chop with mashed potatoes and chard (i think) and my husband had the swordfish. We also ordered a side of peas. The pork dish was very well flavored and everything complement very well except the greens were very very over cooked to a point of being mushy. I like food on the salty side but some may find the pork to be a little too savory. The fish was over cooked. The peas were delicious. We also had their parsnip carrot cake which tasted fine but the texture was a little doughy for cake. All in all, really glad a decent eatery joined the Castro hood. A great neighborhood place that won't break the bank! The space is quaint and whimsical (think framed portraits of characters from various  wait for it   fables and fairytales). The service was impeccable, and one of the co owners checked in with us a couple of times. It was not intrusive, it was because he knew we wanted to chat with him about his amazing food. The bread basket was simple, two crusty rolls with softened, salty butter (this scored huge points in my book). We started with the Caesar salad, which was served as a high pile of whole romaine leaves with croutons and a lemon wedge. The dressing was creamy, and the first taste was of lemon, followed by a hint of anchovy. Outstanding. I had the crispy chicken with brussels sprouts and potato gratin. I rarely order chicken in a restaurant and felt a little guilty about doing so in this instance, but all that faded away with the first bite. The chicken was moist, and the skin perfectly crisp. The au jus around the plate dressed the brussels sprouts and complemented the cheesiness of the potatoes. My mom had the pork chop with cheddar cheese grits, and I can honestly say I have never had a pork chop that tasted like this. Our waitress explained that it was locally raised and organic, and was cooked medium. The meat melted in your mouth and had undertones of bacon.  I do not even possess the language to describe it adequately  it was really that good. For dessert, we got both the bittersweet chocolate mouse (complete with salted caramel whipped cream) and a slice of the parsnip walnut cake with cream cheese frosting. The mousse was excellent, but I was sidetracked by the cake, which was like a carrot cake, but better. The cake was moist and the parsnips added a certain spiciness. It was one of the most creative interpretations of a classic that I've had in some time. Unfortunately I couldn't finish it (so, so full), so I took the rest home and snacked on it for breakfast the next day. And it was still awesome. Fable is a special place, where people from San Francisco eat. The menu is not extensive, but there is something for everyone, and the atmosphere is warm. This is a must on any San Francisco tour. goingplacesandeatingthin… THANK you Fable for helping elevate the Castro Street restaurant scene. Like your delightfully charming sister, Anchor you are a welcome staple in our neighborhood. Loved the grilled asparagus, the duck confit, and had trouble resisting the delish salted butter/bread. My husband had a pork loin he enjoyed along with some tasty grits. We were able to score a seat at the bar with no wait without reservations (on a Thurs night) but there were folks waiting in line right after we were seated so I'd encourage a resi if you can. Every seat was filled consistently. The hosts, waiters, chefs were all friendly and engaged with the guests. I loved how they went out of their way to keep people waiting comfortable, whether that was pointing out their future table and how long they'd expect the wait to be, or offering them wine while they wait. Loved the new look of the interior, a definitely step up from Luna. dark, cozy, and warm vibe. They've got a new cake made of parsnips everyone seemed to enjoy. We loved the apple crisp with a nice glass of tawny. Wow! Great food and great service!  Loved the pork chop! Everything we had was fresh and cooked just perfectly.  Can't wait for the back deck to open up. Wow I can't believe someone would say this place is pricy?!?!  This is San Francisco after all and all the entrees were priced under $ and they were all fantastic.  The swordfish portion in particular was  x as big as I have had in other fine dining establishments in SF and just as tasty.  There was nothing that was a dud, we had duck, pot roast and the pork chop as well.  The pork chop was one of the best I've ever had. I hope they can keep up the deliciousness when they expand and open the back patio.  Service was efficient and the wine list was not overwhelming with great price points to match the food.  Will be back for sure. I'm reluctant to write the review, because I don't want the place to become so popular I can't get in again.    A great addition to a neighborhood desperately in need of good dining options.  The service was very attentive, the food very good, the atmosphere fun.  It is a small space, but a good vibe.  Eric, the owner, was on the ball working the place making sure everything was going well.  Give it a try This place is great. A friend and I went and had a wonderful time. I had the duck and he had the pot roast. Both were perfectly done. For all you regular Castro goers out there, we all know that the lively district has seen it's fair share of restaurants come and go. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that Fable stays. Having frequently dined at Luna, which was the previous occupant, I was pleasantly surprised to see that a new owner had moved in, putting good use to the long hallway with stylish portraits of fable characters surrounded by a unique and cozy color palette. While the back patio section, with plenty more seating, is not yet open, we were able to secure a seat via reservation in their indoor dining area. We started off our meal with a refreshing beet salad topped off with arugula and a nice tangy dressing. While their menu changes daily, I highly recommend trying one of their salads. All of the salads coming out of the kitchen looked so delicious. And if you're not a salad person, you'll surely like the complementary Acme bread rolls served with butter and a pinch of sea salt. Delicious!For the main, we decided to share the yellow tail and chicken breast. The yellow tail was quite good with the fish cooked raw in the middle which made for a nice texture and taste. The chicken breast was cooked perfectly with every bite being as savory as the next. We paired both with a side of sweet potatoes which paired well with both meals. And to top it off, dessert. Yes, who can forget dessert. There were so many delicious items to choose from we decided to pick two including the sweet and savory chocolate mousse which every mousse fan should try and the pear and cherry crisp topped with ice cream. Needless to say the dessert was so good, we found it hard not to lick the plates. I'll certainly be coming back for more delicious goodness that Fable has to offer! Had a great dinner here last night. Showed up sans a reservation and host accommodated us within a few minutes.  Thank you! Started with a nice bottle of Amador County (east of Sacramento) wine and the beet and goat cheese salad.  Thanks for adding complexity to the salad by using the tri colored beets.  Love that!  Finally settled on the main dish of pot roast.  I'm a sucker for pot roast.  Very tender and well seasoned.  I'll definitely try that again after I order the pork cheek plate of which I had a bite.  Very good.  This will definitely be a new place to frequent and a much needed addition to the neighborhood.  Can't wait for the patio to open.  It will be a great place during the summer (well. . . an SF Summer anyway).  Congrats on a great job so far and welcome to the neighborhood! I will give this place a second shot, especially when they have the back patio open and they've worked out the menu a bit more, but I thought the food here was only OK. Given the menu I was expecting the food to be much tastier, but it was all very one note. I had the pork chop and it was served with cheddar grits and lacinto kale. I was very excited about the side dishes, but the grits were pretty flat and uncheesy and the kale was kinda dry. For $ a plate in a neighborhood where there are many good restaurants, some which are less expensive, you expect the food to be of a higher caliber. The service was excellent, however. We came here the other night for our dear friend Miles birthday. Let's put it this way, we were pleasantly surprised. Well, maybe I shouldn't be that surprised. I've been following Chef Jon around for a few years now. Anchor Oyster Bar, Woodhouse etc. and I've never had a bad meal from him. We had a wonderfully executed meal. Nothing too fancy but just with enough frill to make it a fine dining experience. We pretty much tried everything on the menu that night. . Pot roast. . Chicken. Beet loaf. Halibut. Caesar Salad. Gem Salad. Pork Cheeks. and all of the deserts including the cheese plate. Needles to say, everything was spot on! I TRIPPED OUT on how good the Beet loaf was! And I'm a carnivore! I'll eat anything that lives! Or lived! I'll get it again if it's on the menu. This item should be an in house feature from now on. I refuse to believe that this is a vegan item! But I was assured that it was from the chef himself. Unfortunately, he would not tell me his secret. I highly recommend this for you non meat eaters out there. The decor is (and I hate to use this word) whimsical and fitting for the intimate dining room. Cute pictures adorn the wall with all of your favorite Aesop characters. I really appreciated the color scheme. Grey's with orange accents. The orange, antler chandeliers were the perfect addition for the theme they're going for. Over all, a very comfortable dining experience. Casual enough for that quaint, neighborhood restaurant we'd would all love to have down the street. Yet fancy enough to be a dining destination. Although truthfully, I hope that this place stays a hidden gem. Fat chance though. It's pretty damn good!My only complaint is the paper napkins. But I was assured they were working on it. The staff is knowledgeable and expedient and it doesn't hurt that they are attractive as well. Lastly, the prices are amazingly low for what you get. I couldn't beleive the price points! Not one entre above $. lb! Seriously! Is this the early ""'s or what? All told, I'll definitely be back. As a matter of fact, I'm going again on Wednesday. I love me some Beet loaf! The boyfriend and I had a wonderful dinner here. Still recovering from the gaping hole left from the demise of Luna, we finally dropped by Fable for dinner. We sat at the bar, by choice, and truly enjoyed ourselves. The pork cheeks were delicious, the pot roast savory and indulgent, and the duck was crispy skinned, savory goodness. We followed all of this with a glass of hearty Cabernet and the chocolate mousse, both of which were fantastic and perfectly paired. The service was attentive and fun, the conversation with John (part owner & chef) was insightful and lovely. I couldn't be more positive about this place. . I truly hope it sticks around, as I'm sure it will become a regular visit for us. Catch, Poesia, & others in the Castro just got some competition. . . and we're glad to have it! This place is beautifully decorated and tucked off the busy Castro and th Street corridor. The front of the restaurant is a bit tight  and narrow with the bar featured prominently. Not much waiting room inside so make a reservation. My friend made a reservation for our group and we still had to wait a bit to be seated. Fable helped with the wait with a few glasses of wine. Definitely an appreciated gesture while we had to stand around!Our table shared three of the salads  the beet in parchment, the endive salad, and an arugula bread salad. The arugula bread salad was the best of the three. We wanted to try the tart but they were already out of it for the evening. I ordered the beet loaf with mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts. The beet loaf was a great, hearty, vegetarian entree. We shared three desserts, the chocolate mousse, the pineapple upside down cake and a pear crumble with ice cream. The pear dessert was the best. The pineapple upside down cake had some macadamia nuts with it that I wasn't a fan of and the chocolate mousse was solid. All of the staff were friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt. Very professional. You don't always get that at a new restaurant!I hear they have a cozy patio out back. I am really looking forward to checking it out. i hope this place sticks around for the long haul. It's off to a great start: Fantastic food, very friendly service, good sized portions, and the promise of more seating when they open their patio space, which is much larger than the interior. The food is very tasty for the price. So far, it's fills in the gap that  left. ;) Jon and your fabulous crew welcome to the neighborhood! We've been waiting for you (literally) and patience has rewarded us. Firstly, I'm so glad you took the chance to venture out onto your own, that you picked a neighborhood like the Castro, and that you saw the opening through to the, uh. . . . well, the opening!The ambiance is right for a scrumptuous meal such as I enjoyed last week. The pork cheeks are amazing, the crispy chicken even better. . . . and who'd a thought I would like kale? Had that the second visit. The staff kudos, and with experience, even more attentive and personable. I like to be surrounded by professionals that are so good I didn't even notice them. . . . not quite that, but with a few more nights open (and hopefully MANY years). . . . it seemed the wait staff was intent on my dining experience pleasure. The space is wonderful, and with further success, I hope you will introduce those of us that haven't had the delight of dining al fresco in the back garden as soon as you can. I'm so glad you're here your creativity, hard work and vision are a boon to me and those who come to the Castro. I will tell all my friends! It's always a little chancy judging reviews on a restaurant that has been open less than a week. The reviews here seemed gushing and with a free Saturday night, we decided to try it. The good: The ambiance is great: not overly fussy, very classy in fact, a nice use of an odd space. The room handles noise well. We were seated next to a loud party and it wasn't deafening the way Starbelly can be. The patio isn't open yet.  The service was mostly attentive. The mediocre: Nothing about the place is BAD. The prices are slightly too high for portions that are underwhelming. The food is okay, but not extraordinary. If the food was great, the portion size would probably be forgiven. There's much better food elsewhere in the neighborhood. We had the savory tart (both my companion and myself remarked that it tasted like leftovers). The twice baked sweet potato was also something that felt more reheated than inspired. The pork chop was the daintiest chop I've ever seen. The pork cheeks were fine. Try it tentatively. The neighborhood has a way of quickly getting rid of the restaurants that aren't great food, good values, or interesting menus. Sadly, this place (at this point) has none of those yet. Every girl dreams of meeting Prince Charming who will sweep her off her feet. I did. Fast forward  years. I read that Prince Charming is actually a certified douche. A douche who marries Cinderella, Snow White AND Sleeping Beauty then cheats on them ALL. WTF! Was he trying to do a FM Gangb*ng? UGH. Damn you, Fables comics for ruining my image of Prince Charming. Forever. Thank goodness Fable, the new restaurant from an Anchor Oyster Bar and Woodhouse Fish Co. alum in the Castro has no remembrance of Prince Charming. Instead, the whimsical dining room with rich cabin woods and orange antler chandeliers has animal portraits adorning the walls. With dim lighting, it's perfect for a casual date. Adorable ambiance and décor aside, Fable is one of the most solid brand new restaurants I've been to having just opened for less than two weeks. The New American menu is small with creative twists to American Classics (online menu: bit. ly/XsHjl). The sampling of what we had proved that the food is solid with well balanced flavors and textures. Say YES to the bread! We forwent it which was a HUGE mistake because as we were leaving, I saw they serve Acme's rustic mini baguettes. *Sad pouty lip*To get a front view of the action, we sat at the chef's counter and started with their special salad of the night, a Dungeness Crab Salad ($) which was crisp butter lettuce nicely dressed with a creamy tangy dressing and topped with generous fresh chunks of crab meat and sprinkled with crispy bacon bits: bit. ly/YiCEE. I'm not much of a salad person but I could eat this salad every day. The Dijon Crusted Pork Cheeks ($) were mouth watering: bit. ly/YIHw. Incredibly tender, the pork cheeks were flavorful and paired nicely with the slightly bitter kale dressed in a refreshing cider vinaigrette, tart apples, and crispy shallots for a texture contrast. Our mains were just as solid as the appetizers except they were both a bit overcooked. Mr. NSS went with the Crispy Skinned Duck Breast ($) which could have been a little bit crispier but the flavor was on point with the honey cider sauce giving it a lovely savory sweetness with a touch of tang: bit. ly/WfedFf. I didn't care for the lentils though as I'm not a lentils person. My Brined & Grilled Pork Chop ($) was well seasoned and tender but cooking it medium as stated (it was more well done) would have made it more succulent: bit. ly/XGxTD. I loved the kumquat riesling sauce and the crunchy toasted pecans made this dish even more divine (close up: bit. ly/XuiKny). The side of Cauliflower Gratin ($) was deliciously decadent but guilt free since cauliflower was used in lieu of evil potatoes: bit. ly/aJekJ. No dinner is quite complete without dessert. The Pear & Ginger Crisp ($) was sweetly satisfying with tender chunks of pear and crystallized ginger: bit. ly/YLRGQx. The scoop of vanilla ice cream gave it that extra layer of creamy decadence not to mention a delightful cold temperature contrast to the hot fruit crisp.  The staff was as wonderful as can be. Service was very attentive but not overbearing. We were checked on numerous times and even the chef checked in to make sure we were enjoying dinner. Nice touch and much appreciated. I'm looking forward to the their back patio opening in hopes they offer bottomless brunches (hint, hint to the owner). Don't worry, I will behave with both my top and bottom on. ;)Oh yah, NO visit to the Castro is complete without stopping by at Hot Cookie one block away (yelp. com/biz/hot cookie …). I bet you Prince Charming wasn't packing like THAT! *Giggles* I had the pleasure of having dinner at this new place.  Exactly what we needed in the Castro.  A really nice, comfortable, moderately priced eatery with outstanding service. We were waited on hand and foot from the minute we entered.  Because our table reservation was not ready yet, we were treated to a free glass of wine and escorted to an out of the way place to wait (which only turned out to be about  minutes). They are still attempting to get a linen exchange for napkins and are using paper which was one of our minor issues but, the server assured us they were working on that.  Just seemed odd but, sounds like they are aware of it.  I had the pork chop which was cooked and presented with perfection.  The other person with me had the duck and said it was perfection. So great we finally have a nice place to eat in the hood now that  is gone.  Also they have done a fantastic job of redecorating and are in the process of opening up the rear patio after remodeling. I will go back soon. // DinnerSolid . Our party of  arrived promptly for the pm reservation. I have to give the architect at McMahon the credit for making this space so beautiful: antler light fixtures, warm apple green wall, cabin wall paper, an an open kitchen. We were seated against the wall right behind the kitchen. The table to be honest was a bit crammed as three of us squeezed in. Ambiance fine and intimate. We tackled the American style menu with quite some gusto. For appetizers, we enjoyed:*Cream of Cauliflower Soup (x): Served in the perfect temperature, not too hot, but enough to warm you on a cold night. The chive and cummin added a nce kick to the very creamy soup. *Beets and Goat Cheese in Parchment: Beautiful concoction. Roasted walnuts crispy, and I always love leeks. *Braised Pork Cheek (x): OMG this is heavenly! Served with diced granny smith apples and a cider vinaigrette. Cheek cooked well and tender, but never stuck in your teeth. Nice balance of sweat and salty flavor. For entrées we had:*Duck Breast: Fat is rendered very well in this dish. Sweet and savory. *Crispy Skinned Chicken: My friend kept voicing his appreciation of the dish. Thinly crusted chicken breast served with a sweet potato puree. *Pork Chop: Thick, plump and juicy. *Pot Roast: Cooked well in cabernet sauce, the meat melts in my mouth*Salmon: Crispy on the outside and juicy insideOur server was friendly, always checking on us but not intrusive. Along the meal we had a bottle of Côtes du Rhône red. The most lackluster item would be the bread, a bit tough and stale. Also for a fine dining restaurant, I recommend Fable to consider linen napkin instead of the paper. Fable is a fine addition to the Castro restaurants and I can see this place do well there. Patio is under construction. I was informed it won't be up running until September for indian summer brunch. Dinner for  $ Enjoyed trying Fable last night. We all liked the menu choices and the use of the inside space that used to be just a hallway in the old Luna. I enjoyed the cream of cauliflower soup (very nice) and my partner enjoyed the pork cheek which I got to try. I had the crispy skinned chicken. Although DELISH, I wanted more of the sides. Felt the portion was a just a tad tiny. There were four of us dining, and two of us were served our entrees. . . then about   min later, the other two entrees was served but my partner's pork chop was literally raw on the inside. They took it back to cook up  but we were almost done with our entrees by the time his chop returned. Waiter should have offered him a free glass of wine for the trouble. Otherwise, we had a very nice meal and will go back. I do hope they consider changing their menu over time to keep it interesting. And it'll be great once the back patio opens. The owner said it should open in about  months. Soft opening tonight. I felt at home in this environment . Amazing service( thanks Keith) very hands on approach to engaging customers. . I'll come back. Food was well presented and thoughtful flavors. A hit!Back to Fable for Valentines dinner. Another winning dinner. Byron definitely sets the tone for the restaurant and the service was excellent. Baby beet in parchment appetizer made me wanting more. I had the pot roast. Flavors blended well, melting in your mouth deliciousness. I spent a good bit of time trying to decide between four stars and three. Let's list the good and the not so good:Good  *The pork cheek appetizer was excellent. It was the first time in my life that I've actually enjoyed kale. *Friendly staff*Meat of duck cooked a nice medium. I love duck, but hate when it's cooked to well done. Plus, the fat was rendered out properly as well. *Tasty chocolate mousse, and could tell it was fresh since mousse gets rubbery if it sits too long. Not so good  *Duck was slightly underseasoned, and skin wasn't crispy. *The latter was probably due to the sauce not really qualifying as such since it was a pool of watery bitter apple juice pooled at the bottom of the plate. *Which may have contributed to the accompanying lentils being waterlogged as well as grossly overcooked. They were closer to a puree state than anything. *As my meal progressed, my server came less and less often (though the restaurant was clearing out as it was past ), leaving me staring at my plates or the counter. I said a word about it to one of the staff who turned out to be the owner, and was then practically bombarded with service, including comp'ing my dessert because of what had happened.  And a recommendation for your next staff meeting, make sure you have a policy on communicating the comp'ing to the guest, as I was told by both the server and the owner that they were personally buying me the mousse. (Does that mean I get two? :D)*Good thing I checked my bill because they had accidentally charged two bottles of wine that I had not ordered to my check, tripling it. I realize that the service errors listed above are all due to Fable being open a grand total of  days, thus this being their first Saturday night. I was still a good girl though and made sure to tip the pre comp'd dessert amount. My overall impression was ""good, but there are some things to fix"", and I figure a three star rating aptly describes my experience. I rarely write yelp reviews because I am in the industry and deal with guests and food for a living.  Last night however was so lovely and perfect that I am compelled to share what Fable is doing right. First, I thought a soft open would mean easily getting a table, they've only been open about   days, how many people could possibly know about it yet?  Wrong.  Packed to the rafters on a Friday night.  Byron did everything right to make the wait for a table a pleasure.  We were offered wine.  We were graciously moved out of the way.  We were seated at the perfect table when we sat down.  Service begins at the front door, and Fable gets  stars for managing the wait beautifully. Our server was attentive, never intrusive, and coursed our meal perfectly.  We always had silverware, we always had water, and there were never crumbs on the table.   stars there as well. The meal itself was perfect.  We started with pork cheeks, beets and goat cheese in parchment. . . unusual offerings that were executed perfectly.  We moved on to Pot Roast and Salmon, again, perfect.  Cheese plate and chocolate for dessert. . . amazing.  Another  stars. What impressed me the most about Fable was the understated elegance.  From the initial greet, to the impeccable service, to the perfectly executed food. . . with lovely ambiance. . . packed room that still managed to feel intimate. . . Fable did everything right. . . impressive when they have only been open for a week.  They have set a very high bar for themselves and if last night was any indication, they will have no problem keeping the momentum. What a great addition to the Castro! The neighborhood has had some mediocre restaurants for quite some time now, so I'm glad a whole new level of food has arrived!The service was awesome!  The chefs know what their doing + the food was really, really tasty.  The  of us enjoyed the arugula salad, beef cheeks, pot roast + chicken.  Overall, the experience + ambiance was great.  They did a great job with the interior + the decor was quite charming. I'll def come back + I look forward to the patio when it opens/along with brunch! What a fantastic addition to not only the Castro, but for the city overall. The space is stylish, warm and inviting, it has the best wine list in the Castro and the food is amazing. I'll write a longer review after going a few more times. After following Jon from Anchor to Woodhouse, I'm not surprised at the quality of the food at Fable. The crispy skinned chicken breast was amazing. It was probably the best chicken I've had in a long time. My wife had the pot roast and it was spot on. It was juicy, flavorful and tender. The duckm, which I only had a small bite of, was the perfect combination of savory and sweet thanks to the sauce. OMG the pork cheek. I've never had pork cheek, nor would I think to order pork cheek. . . but, you know. . . . new restaurant, new things. It. Was. Delicious. Perfect size and super delicious. We sat at the bar and it was a nice opportunity to see how the kitchen staff works. They were very clean, careful, and precise. The chef seems like a good person, and the entire staff seem to really respect him. I'm so happy to have another great restaurant in the Castro! The cauliflower soup was great and I'll definitely be back again for the duck.   Great staff, great atmosphere  you've got to try it! I wandered into this place last weekend. What a great addition to the restaurant options in the Castro.  Happy staff, yummy menu. Two thumbs up on the pancetta & mushroom tart and the pork cheeks!They have a huge patio out back but I was informed that wont be open for a few months. Just in time for the good weather. Last night we went to the soft opening of Fable . This place is where Luna used to be but a total revamp and what a huge difference in the place and I can say a great one at that.  With the Dancing Pig closing or hint of closing   after one year and no shock to me,  the Castro needs places that are going to give us what we need which is style and class for a change. I'm over the the fast crap that has hit our streets and all the store fronts being empty. Maybe things are turning around thanks to Jon Hearsberger ,one of the owners of Fable. Bring it to life and make this a true story with a happy ending and a brighter future for the one to follow. Fable has wallpaper that looks like wood but really is not an called aesop'e Fables murals ,which I have to saw caught our attention as soon as we walked in along with all the beautiful tile work on the wall as well. This place now has a indoor seating with many tables seating up to  so far and a expansion on the back patio to hopefully be done this summer for huge out door parties . The staff was so sweet about making sure we knew that this was a soft opening an that they would love our feed back on things that happen during the course of our stay . Jon came by many times greeting all the tables and even serving some of them to see what people thought of the food and the presentation. We were there for a birthday for a friend and well the opening of a place he has never done before and well Thanks to Fable the total night was a whimsical experience for him and he will always remember this night.  The wine selections were really wonderful and and they had a choice also of beer or other beverages as well. The type of food they had was called California take on American Classic as I was told , but I felt they were to die for in every way. I had the Trout which one would think small ,thin and dry but to my surprise it was like the size of a steak ,looked like a salmon and was so flavorful on so many levels. My friends has the Pork Chop, thick and plump and really juicy which needless to say it was all gone in a matter of minutes. Hearty portions was on the table all around and not one head was saying anything bad about their food but what I did notice not one table was talking while they were eating , that says alot to me . This  seat place many be small in size but packs a huge punch of flavor to where we will be back for alot more of what Jon and his family has to offer the Castro!  Thank you for bring Fable to our hood an adding back alittle more style and grace to the neighborhood once again. Where  open store fronts just on one side of the Castro are may soon to hopefully be filed with more of the same one could only hope for our hood needs more of the same.  Randy /Scorpio aka Randy Moore We had a wonderful evening here!The manager Byron made us feel welcome and chatted with us like we were old friends.  Our server, Brian, made sure all our needs were met.   The owner Eric introduced himself to us and periodically checked up on us to make sure we were enjoying everything. We enjoyed wine, appetizers, entrées, and dessert.    For being open only  days, they sure had their act together.  I look forward to coming back and trying more wines and dishes."|2|92|2|Routine| Moderate risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 5/22/2013 ] Foods not protected from contamination  [ date violation corrected: 5/22/2013 ]
Stones Throw 0|4.5|American (New) in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|333|0|4.47752808989|" Loved both brunch and dinner.  Everything was good! This place was amazing! Loved the atmosphere, very chill and knowledgeable waiter.  Absolutely loved the grilled octopus, amazing how it was not rubbery and had a great, meaty taste.  Loved the cocktails, too, try the one that Pimm's and something. Love the vibe, the extensive beer list, the food. The appetizers and entrees called out on Yelp live up to their billing. The dessert is the weakest link (and not even truly weak)  concept is cute, but give me a childhood fave straight up any day. Incredible food, hospitality, and decor. We had the pork belly and squid ink pasta for appetizers and these were heavenly.  For the main course we had the steak and duck and topped it off with the deconstructed bananas foster. Wow!  The hostess and our waitress were so friendly and paid an enormous attention to detail. One of our best dining experiences in this city.  We were recommended this restaurant by a friend and can now see why  we've been raving to our friends! Really awesome place.  We had some great desert wines and tried the pork belly/pork ears which were fantastic.  Loved their deserts, very creative.  Definitely going back. I organized a dinner for  that was flawlessly executed thanks to the wonderful team at Stones Throw. I found the food unique and interesting in a way I haven't had recently in the San Francisco Bay Area. Though the restaurant resides under the American New moniker it's so much more than the usual pork belly and mac and cheese with a twist. Stand out dishes:Puffed potato and eggsSquid ink conchiglie pastaDuck pate with warm soft pretzelWine was carefully selected ahead of our dinner and included some really compelling bottles that pushed the boundaries  definitely pay attention to the ""bizarrely unique"" section for ""varietals you've never heard of and flavors that'll blow your head off. "" I particularly enjoyed the Domaine Les Loges de la Folie Montlouis sur Loire Brut Nature from the Loire Valley. It's a sparkling Chenin with no added sugar and a captivating taste I could drink regularly. Dessert were incredible  I admit, I'm a sucker for sweets like chocolate bananas foster and peanut butter and jelly donuts. My group tried a very large portion of the menu and I can't say I disliked a single dish. Highly recommended! Any one giving this place  Stars is clinically insane. Duck pate, puffed potatoes, squid ink pasta, da burga. . . INSANE. Party in your mouth, %. It also looks so pretty and inventive and fun. The beer and wine selection is ginormous and the helpful/amazing staff are so happy to help you figure out what you're doing with your life (re: drinks)!If I could, I'd work there just so I could partake in the ""family dinners"" they do before service. I've gone to Stones Throw  times within the span of  weeks.  It's a great find.  My friend had taken me there for my birthday, and I couldn't get enough.  The staff is so friendly, and the food is FANTASTIC.  I'd like to call those potato puffs a ""orgasm in a ball. ""  I could eat about  orders to myself!  I mainly eat vegetarian, but when I'm in group settings I don't like to impose my eating habits upon others, so I try the seafood and meat dishes.   I usually order the mushroom lasagna all to myself!  It's not your traditional saucy lasagna.  Quite modern, actually, with thin beautifully layers of pasta and mushrooms.  M!!  You'll have to try for yourself.  I can't really specify which dishes to order, because then you'll be ordering the entire menu!  You can't go wrong with any of the dishes. Went here for the first time even though they've been open six months.    The appetizers and main courses are creative and really good.     Decor is cool, bar in front, tables in back.   All with good lighting.     Wine list is not bad and reasonably priced. Overall very tasty and a good experience.   Nice job by these owners. I wanted to like this place, but in the end I had a lot of mixed feelings. Ambiance: I really liked the ambiance, including the look of the menu. However, I think the ambiance created a different expectation for me. Even from their website, I was expecting rustic and simple. I love rustic and simple, but this was not that. Drinks: Huge wine selection. We got a couple bottles. Later on I did notice they had a small cocktail list but never did try any. Appetizers: Pork belly and pig ears were really good. Potato puffs were okay. Okonomiyaki and octopus were good. Squid ink pasta was REALLY good  my fave of the night. Entrees: I got Da Burga  pretty good, but felt like it could have been better. The tots were good. My husband got the lasagna  umm, not what we expected. . . It was a different take on lasagna, which was interesting. But the portion was TINY. Even with all the appetizers we got, the portion was so tiny that he wasn't satisfied. Dessert: We got Not your Grandma's Apple Pie. It was very loosely based in apple pie. It was a custard with a rolled wafer and some kind of frozen tart crystal over the top. Very different. Refreshing, and definitely not apple pie. It can throw you off if you were expecting apple pie. Overall: The style of the food (trendy) and the prices for the tiny portion sizes didn't match the ambiance for me. It would have been more appropriate for the ambiance to be closer to something like Hakkasan. I really was expecting something more rustic, traditional, simple with a twist or something. There were definitely some high points and things I enjoyed, but I probably won't be back. Service here is great. Came here for my friends birthday party of . Between us we sampled % of the menu. Favorites: Squid ink pasta, pig ears and pork belly, duck, and chocolate banana foster  all were so delicious! Above and beyond: The waiter got the chef to give us extra crispy pork ears since I loved it so much. The hostess noted that it was my friends birthday, and got the chef to do something special for dessert. Our dessert plate came with ""Happy Birthday"" written in chocolate and a magic relighting candle! We all couldn't stop laughing as my friend kept trying to blow it out. Everyone was on top of their duties from checking us in to filling our water cups. Things to work on: Burger was more medium rare than medium. Salmon was well done instead of medium as requested. Special notes: Parking sucked. Uber, lyft, or public transit it if you can. Great MenuBeer Selection that is beyond Impressive. A must try on the Hyde by Green. I heard it was crazy hard to get a reservation here, but we lucked out and were able to snag one that we had to get to in  minutes.  No problemo, we live a stone's throw away.  See what I did there?  The food was great, although I did think that at some point there was a little too much going on with some of the dishes.  Beers, wine, and wine cocktails only, so no delicious whisky cocktail was disappointing.  The service was ON POINT.  Our waitress was a bit overwhelmingly excited, but she was super cute, and everyone who came to our table to deliver food was crazy knowledgeable about what they were serving us to eat.  I think the owner was even the food runner at one point, a young guy who could easily also just be a server or bartender but he had an air of confidence and pride that identified him as the proprietor of this place. I thought this would be a more upscale hipster spot with beer and cocktails as well as creative food.  But it is definitely more hipster restaurant than anything else.  That's was up these days, and this place is at the top of the pile fa sho.  Octopus was DELICIOUS, but too much comes with it so flavors can be confusing.  My BF was not very happy with his lasagna.  But the Banana Foster was SO GOOD.  I kind of wanted the beignets though, so we might have to go back soon. Food  Service  +Atmosphere   Atmosphere is cozy and minimalist.  Wine selection was excellent. Unfortunately, the food was A OK.  Pork belly appetizers were good.  Unfortunately, the duck pate and duck breast entree weren't as tasty.  The deconstructed apple pie dessert was forgettable. Believe the hype, this restaurant is pretty damn good! Go with a group so you can share family style. Puffed Potato & Egg  wow. . . just wow. A deep fried mini potato ball with a creamy egg yolk! So good we asked for seconds. Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta  flavorful! Must get this when you're here. Da Burga w baked potato tots  definitely worth getting. You can't go wrong with the tots. . think deep fried baked potato skins w bacon! Yum!Chocolate Banana Foster  if you like banana foster, you need to get this! We visited Stones Throw, expecting it to be overhyped but it was simply amazing!Of the things that we ordered, I'd am still salivating over the following because there was a surprising element to each of the following:Potato & EggPatePork BellySquid Ink Pastaand Lasagna. I'd skip the following they are good but did not exceed expectations:SalmonDuckBeignets Maybe it was because it was my th dinner out that week (a coincidentally busy week for me!) , but somehow I wasn't impressed as their food didn't hit my tastebuds in any special way.  I felt like they tried to make the food modern, deconstructed, stylish, but the flavors just were not affecting me.  We had the Japanese pancake (ok), salmon rilettes (pretty good), the duck (now this was good, flavorful, tender), vegetarian lasagna (good but something was missing), pineapple upside down cake (deconstructed, ok flavors).  Service was a ok.  I don't know, I wasn't that impressed overall. The  snacks,  starters, and  entree menu is small and simple with thought out dishes. Puffed potato eggs  This is the best dish of the night. As a lover of potatoes and all things egg, I'm amazed at how they even constructed this dish. The outside is perfectly crispy and once you bite into the potato, you get a slightly running yolk inside. Squid ink conchiglie pasta A perfectly balanced dish. There was enough flavor and salt to compliment the seafood, but not over power it. ""Da Burga""  Very solid burger with a thick patty on a toasted brioche bread that did not get soggy even to the very last bite. There wasn't any faults in the burger, but I wouldn't say it's one of the best I've ever had. ""Toad in the Hole"" Lasagna  The dish looks small, but it's very hearty and you really can't say no to runny egg. The mushrooms layered in this lasagna are very earthy and rich. The greens on the dish helped with presentation, but I didn't particular think they add much to the dish in terms of tasteChocolate Bananas Foster DELICIOUS. Not too sweet even though we got a heavy hand of the caramelized banana and walnut topping. The brownies pieces are small but incredibly decadent. My boyfriend and I were thinking about ordering two dessert dishes, but the waiter suggested sharing just one. He was right. My boyfriend and I split all the dishes above and walked away satisfied with only $ damage to our wallets. I haven't written a yelp review in years and think maybe I was waiting for something so good or so bad.  Thankfully it is the former.  The restaurant has a great bar area for waiting and the flow of the restaurant is well spaced so that all the tables are not too far or too close to one another.  Everything we had on the menu was really good and every person at our table was a happy customer.  What more could you ask for!?They have snacks, starters and then mains.  The snacks are really just snacks, but the starters are pretty well portioned and for the most part are easy to share.  The entrees were also the perfect portions. . . enough to satiate without feeling heavy. We started with the duck pate and the pretzels.  The presentation was just beautiful and it was good but not the star of the night.  We ordered three starters to share.  The Japanese pancake and the squid ink pasta.  Everyone voted the Japanese pancake their favorite of the starters, but the squid ink pasta was so yummy too.  There was something spicy in it that created the perfect surprise of heat and the broth made you just want to slurp up a big bowl of it.  The Japanese pancake had a lot going on on the dish and with the condiments and this was just the perfect case of more is more.  I mean it was finished with a bacon dashi. . . hello lover! For the entrees the five of us were all eying the same things so three of us ordered the duck and two of us ordered the salmon with the uni risotto.  Here. . . you can have the duck.  There was a generous serving of duck with crispy duck roll, rhubarb and grilled fennel.  I methodically cut a bite of the rhubarb and then the duck to create single bites as the rhubarb made the duck sing and visa versa.   Whatever sauce was used to create the culinary swish on the plate was definitely not just for decoration. . . I used each bite to pick up a little sauce in each bite as well and at the end of the dinner my plate was wiped clean except for maybe a small fennel garnish. I tried a bite of the salmon and the uni risotto and boy was that sublime.  Creamy and perfect both the salmon and risotto.  The salmon was pan seared with a slight crispy exterior and a fall apart center with a tiny sliver of coral in the center. . . I mean really. . . just perfection. The desserts we had were the comte crepes, the peanut butter and jelly doughnuts and the bananas foster.  The only thing I wasn't wild about was the crepes but the other two were the cause of us almost taking out our waiters arm for trying to take the plate away before we could lick the serving plate for the remaining sauces. Extensive beer list. . . please make sure you peruse the whole menu!I don't think there is anything here that is a miss. Food ranged from OK to Good. Portion sizes were on the smaller side. Thought it was overpriced. Not a great value. I loved everything about this place, from the starters to the cocktails, the entree, with a delicious dessert to top everything off.  The ambience is super cute and rustic, and the service was fabulous.  It was definitely one of my favorite dining experiences in SF. Having the same thing on the menu everyday is so , so by the time you dine here, the entrees and apps may have changed, but if you can find anything even remotely close to the puffed potatoes, GET IT.  The ones I got were filled with a runny yolk and the cauliflower puree was a perfect pairing to these scrumptious spuds. If I ever spot any cocktail with Pimms, I automatically stop reading the rest of the description and order the drink.  The rule applied here and it was one of the best cocktails I've ever had.  Definitely making my reservations right now so I can try the rest of the menu! This place was jumpin on a Friday night, but calling ahead helped so that we didn't have to wait too long before being seated at the window/bar.  The menu changes frequently, so my friend was a little disappointed they didn't have the ravioli she loves. She opted for the lasagna instead and was satisfied, but perhaps there are a few dishes they should consider making permanent staples. I had the duck breast, cooked perfectly and delicious (it came with a duck taquito that they should have skipped).  But honestly my favorite dishes were the tomato cream wafer appetizer (so unique) and bananas foster dessert.  Service was stellar.  I would likely be a regular if I lived in the neighborhood.  Be prepared to drop some cash, because it is pricey; the only real downside. Excellent place for appetizers and be stingy on ordering the main course.  Their appetizers and small plates are THE BEST! It has been a few months since my last dinner at Stones' Throw.  Dinner last night was amazing!  It was  of us, we are family style and shared every dish.  Everything we ordered were awesome!  Loved the potato with runny egg  it was brilliant. The pork belly dish was memorable.  The mains we ordered the steak, cooked perfectly to a medium rare.  The salmon on a bed of corn risotto was nicely done.  My favorite was the duck.  Skin was crispy and was cooked medium, which was very tender and moist. I say at the back of the restaurant overlooking the huge glass cellar room.  I like those tables at the back of the restaurant better than at the front.  Service was attentive.  I dropped my folk and the server came right away to give me new utensils.  From dropping my folk to getting new utensils was about  seconds. A great weekend brunch option. Nice vibe, good service and food. I liked the unique decor. Go on the earlier side, though, they were out of three menu options by the time we arrived late afternoon. Unbelievable, far exceeded my expectations. A pro ex Michael Mina team is serving up the most current, creative fare I've had north of California St. in years. One of the best SF restaurant meals I've had in the last month! Stone's Throw is on par with  with its beautifully plated dishes and interesting ingredient combinations. * Puffed potato with eggs, cauliflower mousse, chives, crispy chicken skin  $Think soft and fluffy croquettes with soft boiled yolk inside. Delicious!!* Grilled octopus ""okononiyaki"" with bacon dashi + pickled mushrooms, onions, turnips on the side  $The bacon dashi was poured over the octopus and ""okonomiyaki"" at the table. The ""okonomiyaki"" was more like a patty or flattened croquette than an okonomiyaki, but it was delicious nonetheless. The octopus was lightly charred and very tender. The pickles were tasty both on their own and with the okonomiyaki. Also delicious!!* ""Toad in the hole"" lasagna with mushroom duxelles, green garlic puree, asparagus, confit egg yolk  $The yolk was firmer than the yolk in the potato puffs and the right consistency to smear on top of the lasagna. Light for lasagna. The green garlic puree was sharp on its own but perfect with everything else. The side vegetables were nicely cooked. Have I overused the word ""delicious"" yet? My vocabulary is too small. * Crispy  North duck breast + taquito with roasted fennel, braised rhubarb, pistachio butter  $The meat could have been a tad juicier, but otherwise this was very good. I wasn't enamored with the tartness of the rhubarb, but I see why it worked with the duck. The pistachio butter didn't add a ton of flavor for me. I actually remember being confused as to what it was and thinking it was a bland gray mustard. (Not my finest moment. ) Overall, this was also. . . delicious!! % off with Uber receipt to restaurant. I'll be back! And hopefully that sunchoke soup I've read so much about will be back on the menu. Wow!  What an amazing find!  Found Stones Throw while searching open table for an available table and after reading the yelp reviews for this place  I was excited to try it. It was AMAZING!  Food, drinks, service were all great (minus having to wait about  min for a table despite having a reservation) however, the staff was quick to get my group's drink order to help the time pass.  They have a huge beer list!  My group was on a sour beer kick and tried most on the list.  The cherry sour beer was delicious ($ was a bit steep but worth it). Fav food of the evening  potato puffs, grilled octopus, pork belly with crispy pig ear, salmon with sea urchin risotto (AMAZING!).  Can't wait to go back!  stars for the food (we came here for brunch),  stars for the service (our waiter was extremely unfriendly) Things I tried: Puffed Potato and Egg: SO SO SO GOOD! If you're from LA and know Porto's, think potato ball, with an egg yolk on the inside. It was heavenly. The potato and crust was super flavorful and the cauliflower mousse that came with it was just amazing. I could have eaten all four =P  Da burga: Who eats burgers for brunch?? WELL I DID AND IT WAS DELICIOUS! This thing was HUGE! AND it came with the best tater tots I've ever had. Like the description said, it literally had everything. It tasted like it had cheese and chives and other magic ingredients. And the burger, that's a whole other story. The bun was crispy on the top but soft, the meat was covered in cheese, and it had this amazing cole slaw that was just AMAZING.  Asparagus & Duck Confit Hash: two of my friends got this as recommendation from our waiter and they both really enjoyed it. The egg was perfectly cooked and I tried the duck and it was so tender! Definitely worth a try seeing as it's still new and not super crowded yet. I'd still make a reservation just in case. It's definitely worth a try! Just amazing ! The service was perfect and the food delicious ! Can't wait to go back on Thursday with some new friend! I had taken other friend last time and they already went back! I am looking forward for the octopus! And this time I will try ""da Burga"" !If you are looking for a new gem for foodies you have it right there!See you soon !Sebastien Oxner We live in Russian Hill and had been wanting to try this place for awhile. Decided to take a risk and just walk in on a Friday evening. The place was packed! It was never like this when it was Luella. We give our name to the hostess and she says she'll call if a spot opens at the bar. We mosey on down to Bacchus Wine Bar to wait it out and I tell my husband there's no way we'll hear from them. Lo and behold, the hostess (I think her name was Tyler?, she was blond and nice) actually calls and tells us  spots are opening up at the bar soon. Just her calling us on a  Friday night impressed the hell out of me. Long story short  the  women we were waiting for to leave so we could eat at the bar didn't leave for over an hour! We just hung out, had a glass of wine, and pointedly looked at them occasionally. Finally, we sit at the bar  nice and roomy  no one crowding us. Ordered the squid ink pasta  amazing, fresh, interesting flavors, highly recommend. The ricotta salad  really terrific flavors, all green, yummy little bursts of flavor in every bite. The NY Steak  again, it just tasted SO good. We made sure to save room for dessert b/c I saw someone order the bananas foster and it smelled so good I ordered salad for my meal so I would have room for it. Turns out that dessert was the BEST DESSERT we've ever had. It was phenomenal. I would go back every night just for the dessert. We're happy as clams because the food was so good and the hostess and rest of staff really treated us well. Then, we get the bill. And it just gets better because they comped us  glasses of wine, a dessert, and gave us a % neighbor discount. Above and beyond what they needed to do. I can't wait to go back. They know how to treat patrons, especially locals, the food was so much better than some of the overhyped restaurants I've been to recently, and you actually felt like it was a good value. Can't wait to try brunch! Well done, Stones Throw and thanks to the wonderful hostess who really made our experience and represented the restaurant so well. I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday a few moths back.  The food was awesome!We got the Duck Pate & Mousse, Puffed Potato & Egg, Pork Belly & Crispy Pig's Ear, ""Da Burga"", the duck breast, and the apple pie.  I have to say, I LOVED the puffed potato and pork belly.  The service was great and I will definitely be back! Nice spot!  The food had great presentation, flavor and texture.  Da burga  was good and had a nice zing that came with the pickled cabbage.  The tots that came with da burga were a little to flavorful, overly bacony.  I could only eat one. . . The Egg n a hole lasagna was tasty and the presentation elegant.  One negative aspect of this restaurant is the limited menu.  I think they should add a few more dishes or at least have nightly specials.  Over all this place is definitely worth a visit. LOVE the vibe at this place along with the deliciously fresh and filling brunch food. The service is exceptional especially when dining with a small infant (we have been there twice already with our baby) as everyone working there caters to making you feel relaxed, not rushed and welcomed into their restaurant. I'm not easily impressed with most restaurants but this one has my heart as they know how to run a restaurant and keep their customers coming back for more! As for the food, the Kale salad is a favorite and the Brioche is so incredibly scrumptious! I can't wait to dine there again! This place is still pretty new, but already making food that is just a notch above great.  Duck mousse, corn soup, were super flavorful.  Ambitious and unique cocktail menu too!Curious to see what new dishes they come up with in the future. . . I've been here a number of times, because it is literally a stone's throw from my house, and each time I've been impressed. I've focused on the happy hour and brunch times, because we have a young child, but one of the best things I can say about ST is that they're so accommodating. Our neighborhood doesn't have many places you can bring a toddler, and it's nice to have an adult option that is so tasty. Our daughter has fallen in love with the crepes at brunch. My only two cons are: at my first brunch the waiter encouraged everyone ( adults) to order savory meals and then split a sweet among us; we did not take his advice and I'm really happy. It would have been a ridiculous amount of food. Also, no changing table in the bathroom, which is more than big enough. My Baby Shower brunch was held here in March. The staff were attentive and friendly; the food arrived family style at the perfect times and the drinks kept flowing. We had two vegans in our party and the chef even came out to check on us. Outstanding experience! WOW!If you haven't been to this place and you live around the neighborhood, what the heck are you waiting for?WOW!This place is phenomenal. I can see this place winning a James Beard award soon or  atleast Michelin rated. WAY BETTER than State Bird Provision BY FAR. Everything we tasted was so freakin' delicious!From the starters  pig's ears, squid ink pasta and root vegetable salad Pig ears with pork belly and squid ink pasta  both a MUST HAVE. Presentation of pigs ears is so beautiful. Flavors blended so well with the slice of the grapefruit to balance the ""fattiness"" from the pork belly. Toad in a hole lasagna tasted so yummy, better than what I expected and the presentation is gorgeous. DA BURGA is the best BURGA in SF right now. Melts in your mouth. Good choice of bread and some pickled veggies added which counterbalances in a good way the fattiness of this BURGA!Duck  perfectly cooked and very well presented. Dessert ordered ""not your mom's apple pie""  different, really what you don't expect as a typical Apple pie but not bad.  glasses of pinot noir later still flabbergasted HOW AMAZING THIS RESTAURANT is. Service was excellent! Timing of food was great. This is one of my NEW , FAV  SPOTS in the city. Come on down before it gets too popular and you have to wait  months to get in! I've had a lot of wonderful meals in San Francisco but this is one of the best in recent memory. A large group of coworkers and I took over the back area of the restaurant. We had set up a dinner with tastings of some of their greatest hits. . . and great they were! I think I liked pretty much everything I tasted, but here are some of the dishes that really stand out in my memory even a couple months later: Crispy tomato cream wafers and a fava bean dip (a light and refreshing way to start the meal) Pate and pretzel bread Puffed potato and eggs (a bit rich but definitely the overall favorite) Squid Ink Conchiglie pasta Dungeoness crab salad Seared Maine Day scallops (I think this was my favorite dish of the whole night) Crispy duck breast and thigh (duck's not easy to get right in my opinion, but boy did they get this right) Peanut butter and jelly donuts (a nice down to earth finish to a very gourmet meal)There were tons of other things we tried that were also fabulous but start with those and you'll be happy, I promise. The service and cozy, romantic ambiance with great lighting are a perfect complement to the delicious food you'll eat. Go as soon as possible!! Wow. Seriously.  I'm gonna cut to the chase & keep it simple, because there's elegance in simplicity.  And this meal was elegant from start to finish. The potato puffs.  Light & airy somehow. . . Great alternative from the traditional potato side/app.  The pate.  I love pate, so it's always on.  Rich & velvety.  Wish there were more pretzel bites though. The squid ink pasta.  Love, love, love.  Fresh, clean, & light.  Not customary adjectives used to describe pasta.  The flavors w the shrimp meshed so well.  Just delicious. The pork belly.  Everyone knows I love pork belly.  This dish, like the squid ink pasta, was knocked right out of the park.  So tender & meaty.  The sauce. . . pretty effin great.  Elements of what I thought were turmeric & curry.  It rocked. The lasagna.  OMG.  Order it.  You will love it.  Full of flavor.  The egg yolk is the icing on the cake.  Not traditional lasagna. . . better. The bananas foster.  BOOM.  Rich of course.  It's dessert.  Live a little.  You deserve it. The pb&j donuts.  Just do it.  My man remarked more than a couple of times that Stones Throw is a  star venue.  He is the toughest critic.  Nuff said. We got off to a really bad start, as we showed up on time for an pm reservation  which had definitely been confirmed earlier in the day  and had to wait almost an hour for our table. I was basically furious, hungover, and HANGRY as hell by the time we sat down to eat. But, we were visiting from out of town and had walked up a huge ass SF hill to get here, so waited we did. We were eventually gifted a salted beet salad, which was quite delicious. Dungeness crab salad was good but not amazing. For mains, we shared the squid ink pasta, which was quite memorable and definitely good for sharing due its incredible richness. I thought the bur ga was a little too much in terms of salty fatty punch. Likewise, the stuffed tater tots were a bit much for me. However, not gonna lie, I eventually finished both off for breakfast without complaint. Food was surprisingly filling and portions quite generous. Probably wouldn't go back given the poor customer service and generally obnoxious dining experience, but I'll remember the squid ink pasta and beet salad fondly. What a great replacement for Luella on Hyde St. The burger is one of the best I've had. . . very flavorful. Also excellent service, wine/beer list. Three things that struck me about Stones Throw. GENUINE Friendliness. Npt the canned or snarky version you see so often but these people were pleased to have us there, happy to answer questions and a honestly felt ""good night/ thanks for coming by"" upon our departure. IN addition one of the partners in the restaurant came by to check in on us. Flavorful and Creative Food. We stuck with just the Starters. Pork Belly was done beautifully and not the traditional crunchy but it was further enhanced with spices and avacado. Then the squid ink pasta. Wish we got a double order. BAM! I loved it. Then we had the Grilled Octopus ""Okonomiyaki"" which for both of us was the winner. Welcoming Atmosphere. Whether you post up to the bar or grab a table there is not a pretentious seat in the house. I wanted to circle back now that I've had brunch here a few times. The brunch is absolutely amazing! I'm pretty confident it is the best brunch place I've ever been to. At this point, I think I've tried just about everything on the menu. My favorites are the duck hash, lemon/huckleberry crepes, pancakes, and of course the potato/egg yolk puffs.  I'm not typically a huge duck fan bc it can be fatty, but this dish is unbelievable! The duck is crisp and packed with flavor (I'm not taste expert, but it reminds me of a variation on corned beef) which goes great with the eggs, biscuit and veggies all mixed in. The pancakes are huge and buttery  I had no idea it was possible to make such thick and fluffy pancakes!! The lemon crepes with huckleberries are a great blend of sweet and tart and so delicious! The potato puffs are also on the dinner menu (and if you look through the reviews, you'll see everyone raves about them), and for brunch they are served with bacon bits (I'm a firm believer that bacon makes everything better)!  This place is the greatest I recommend it to everyone!! Was bummed to see Luella go  but love this new place in the neighborhood. Honestly don't remember what we had  but remember the chef being very accommodating. Wanted the burger. But they were sold out. Wanted the tots. Sold out. . . but they made them some how and provided to us on the house. Whatever we did have was very good. Great service, great food. We had a lovely dinner at Stones Throw tonight. Our reservation was at : which is a great time to dine if you want to avoid the the crowd that arrives by :.  The waiter and bartender greeted us right away. We ordered a Pimms Cup (delicious) and were then taken to the lovely pine table.  The space is arranged wonderfully. They have high ceilings with rafters and lovely pine tables to dine at. They are set around the room and it appears open and not crowded which we loved. The service was especially good. Our waiter Stuart was very familiar with the menu and helpful without being all over us.  One server in particular  was a young brunette woman who also wowed us with her service and smile.  We tried a number of their dishes among four of us.  For the first course 'snack' one person enjoyed the dungeonus crab salad. While two if us feel that it tasted like onion and salt. . . Not crab.   And our most favorite was the duck pate. . . . . WOW.  Our second favorite was the potato ball stuffed with egg served over cauliflower and fried chicken skin mouse. Of the second 'starter' course. . . . Our favorite of these dishes was the roasted/grilled octopus with a pancake of vegetable served with a bacon ju and accoutrements including pickled watermelon rind.  The pork belly was fabulous, as was crab curry soup and squid ink pasta with shellfish. We liked the duck breast/leg served with Asian spice ju and black sticky rice the best. Two of us had the lamb which was a disappointment at furst. It is served with roasted veggies and a ju.  The plate looks ver dark. . . . the meat looked pretty but perhaps some yellow or orange veggies might brighten it.  The meat itself had the texture of beef. But it had zero flavor! Someone didn't taste tonight?  Anyway. . . . . we were given some  salt and pepper and additional ju, and the meat tasted better.  The veggies were so so.  The waiter offered to bring another dish but, when we added spice it was better. . . . if not great. . . Desert. . . lemon meringue won this course.  But the donuts with peanut butter and jelly were yummy too.  Great wine. Yummy pressed coffee. Our friends had dinner at Frances this week and they enjoyed this dinner a lot more:)It is a very nice restaurant and we certainly will return. Now we know the best dishes too! And. . . % off the check if u take UBeR.  There is no parking:) My goodness is all I can say. One fine Sunday night, a few friends and I decided to have a girls foodie night out and of course, this was our destination of choice. My goodness, oh my goodness. First and foremost, the service and ambiance are spectacular  our waitress was attentive without being overbearing and helpful without being demanding. The entire vibe is warm, intimate and exudes understated class. It's perfect for the romantic date night as well as the classic friends get together! Now for the food. . . it seems like small portions and a plethora of app like mini entrees constitute the evangelized SF New American scene with the additions of , Verbana, TBD, Alta CA and the like. At first, I was quite a protester of such radical change, but it has quickly grown on me and I now find myself seeking such restaurants. And Stones Throw is definitely the leader of the pack in this category!Each and every dish was creative perfection from start to finish  but our group had an unanimous consensus that the Duck Breast & Thigh swept the other dishes out of the sea! Seriously, do yourself some well deserved justice and order the duck. It's tender, juicy, fatty without being lard like and oozing with Halvorson's uniquely concocted flavor. Close contenders were: the puffed potato and eggs, duck pate and mousse and the lasagna. Keep in mind, the lasagna does not look or taste like a traditional lasagna  it's quite quirky but delicious nonetheless!The wine list is great but we opted to bring in  bottles of our own wine  the corkage fee is only $ so it's definitely worth it if you want to crack open that special vintage bottle of wine you're secretly guarding at home! Happy Eating, Yelpers! Arrived with an out of town friend for a long awaited reservation. Waiter greeted us, and offered several bottles of wine. I inquired about the wine by the glass a few times but he kept pointing to the bottle. Finally I explained my friend was not drinking and I was allowed to move forward with the single glass. You are strongly encouraged to put all of your order in at the same time. We wanted to see the portions and general feel of the food and enjoy the dinner in a slow way, so we ordered the appetizers first. He mentioned he could give us more time, and said the kitchen highly recommended that we put them all in. It was awkward and pushy enough that it was clear we wouldn't be having our whole dinner there. Honestly, I think we just rubbed him the wrong way. Two people, at his four top,  minutes late, starting out with appetizers and not a full bottle of wine? In my serving days, I would have been annoyed with us. So, I can only comment on the two apps I had. The puffed egg thing: This was pretty delicious and the texture was great. I think the base of the recipe could still be played around with, while keeping the main feature. The Pork Belly: In general, I try to avoid this fatty meat. However, this was absolutely divine and a treat. The flavors that went into it and each item contributed to the best taste in my mouth all day. I would recommend this place to any girl who has a man in her life who always orders this fatty meat. Four stars: +The pork belly+I think the waiter with % of people is gregarious and a really great person. Working with the public means every once in awhile things don't jive perfectly. +The hostess was so polite and friendly! Really impressed! Totally exceeded my expectations. I hadn't been to Russian Hill for a while, so it was nice to take a spin around the old neighborhood. I'd looked at the menu in advance, and thought it sounded pretty good, but kind of a lot like many of the New American places we already have around here. It was definitely a cut above. First of all, the service was super great. They couldn't seat us until about half an hour after our reservation, but the hostess was really gracious and apologetic about it, and gave us a free appetizer for our troubles. The servers were also really friendly and knowledgeable, and full of helpful recommendations. I asked about the cool looking pottery, and they knew all about where the plates come from (England!). The duck pate and the squid ink conchiglie pasta were probably my favorite things. Really great flavors and textures to them both. The pork belly with avocado and greens was also great. The pork belly itself was really tender and not as overwhelmingly fatty as it sometimes is. The duck breast was very good. I was not really into the lamb, sadly. It was covered in an olive tapenade that overwhelmed the lamb flavor and everything else in the dish. Not terrible, but I wouldn't order it again. The chocolate bananas foster was ridiculous and indulgent and I regret nothing. Would order again, and probably will. had whole menu. simply love all ! This Russian Hill restaurant has fantastic, fantastic food, and impeccable service. Very highly recommended. It's the best restaurant in San Francisco in my opinion. Highlights  Everything! Every bite offered an array of flavors. The service was excellent, knowledgeable and passionate about their menu. The wines made for great pairing and the beer list was impressive and vast. Easily ranks as one of our most enjoyable dinners to date. Drinks  Pinot Noir and Cabernet Starters  Duck pate and mousse, roasted root vegetable salad and squid ink pasta. Entree  Seared Maine day boat scallops, Crispy  North Duck Breast and Thigh. Dessert  Banana Foster, Sight Glass Coffee. Interesting restaurant. Left feeling like I needed more.  The food was definitely high quality, service was fine and menu was enticing.  The duck was fantastic, and would definitely recommend.  I think I need to return for another dining experience to possibly consider a higher rating. Really good, but pricey for its casual atmosphere and tiny portion sizes.  Great drinks.    Dishes felt really fresh and healthy, but not too flavorful.  Waited  a long time  for food to be served, but probably because they were preparing each dish with care. This is a solid restaurant whose chef Jason Halverson was the cuisine de chef from Michael Mina. SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA (Spicy Capers, Clams, Calamari, Tender Greens): My favorite dish of the night. perfect al dente texture to the pasta. Great mix of seafood for the perfect balance of flavors without watery sauce. Delicious!ROASTED ROOT VEGETABLE SALAD (Pear, Kabocha Squash, Cauliflower,Banyuls Vinegar)  pretty solid salad but not exceptionalGRILLED OCTOPUS (Chorizo, White Beans, Braised Radicchio): the octopus was a bit too soft for my tasteSEARED MAINE DAY BOAT SCALLOPS (Fresh Chickpea 'Salad', Spiced Orange Oil, Marinated Calamari): I didn't love the taste of the scallops, a bit too salty. It could be that I was comparing this from scallops from Hokkaido a couple of days ago, which had an amazing sweetness to it. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The wooden seats are a bit uncomfortable for a long dinner. Lighting could be better. This place is in one word AMAZING. The staff (Tai especially) are fantastic, can't say enough about the food and cocktails. Truly a great spot. Keep up the great work! all i saw was a sea of hot white dudes with hot asian brawds all with nice jackets.  I'm a mediocre looking awkward irish mexican that came with my brother wearing gap sweaters.  my butthole clinched up when i ordered a beer. when i sat down the service was lovely, but the food was godly. duck pate with a mustard type mouse with the most beautiful pretzel bread, all of which reminded me of growing up, but with such delicate and rich flavors all of which i will never forget. squid ink pasta that was nice and rich, almost reminded me of a seafood fruit de mar but more delicate and wonderful. the pork belly and crispy pig ears:  ok ok pork belly, so prosaic.  but pig ear?  f yo shit.  surprisingly light for such a dish, and a wonderful crunch along with the richness.  jesus fucked budah to make this dish, he left out muhammad because of the pork, but whatevers, he's got enough followers as it is. finished with some banana dessert that sucked dick, but whatever, we were in san francisco.  when in rome. I rarely come to the Russian hill area and was happily surprised at the cute neighborhood feel. Stones throw is a small neighborhood place, and the whole vibe goes well with the area. The space is small, and the bar area isn't too big, so definitely make a reservation!  Warning: parking can be a bit tricky around here. We were seated as soon as our whole party arrived. Wines were very reasonably priced. We started with a half bottle of a sparkling brut rose at $, then  full bottles of Pinot noir (a lighter California one to start, then a more full bodied French one for the more substantial dishes).  Each bottle was around $, which I found reasonable. Onto food: Potato puffs: a light airy potato ball with runny egg yolk inside? Why are there only  per order ? We debated getting another order as dessert  Pork belly and crisped pig ear:  the curry really made the dish. It had lots of textures and colors and is one of those dishes where you really want the perfect bite with all the components  Squid Ink pasta: I kind of wish the pasta had a bit more of a bite, and a little crunch would have been nice for this dish, but the pasta itself was a beautiful black color, and the flavors were subtle and nice   Grilled octopus: grilled nicely, not overdone, good char. White beans are fine, but the chorizo bits underneath were amazing  Scallops: seared sweet with lots of spring vegetables on the side; this was a great lighter dish   North duck breast and thigh: tender, not too gamey, mild Asian flavors with black rice and vegetables. I usually don't like duck, but this one wasn't bad Toad in the hole lasagna: basically we got this for the confit egg yolk. The lasagna itself could have used more salt and was a bit soft, but the Parmesan crisp on top made up for it. If only there were more of that crisp. . . (We debated asking for more. . . . )Desserts: you're instructed to write your own favorite treat on the menu, and if your idea is picked for try next rendition of the menu, they bring you back for free dessert ! Lemon meringue: tart, I liked the berry with it. It was smooth and light overall Apple pie: interesting version with apple granita, panna cotta, and a crisped straw on top Chocolate bananas foster: this was the best dessert by far. Milkshake in chocolate, chocolate cake, amazing warm bananas with rum sauce which helps to melt the ice cream and milk shake so that it's one gooey hot and cold dessert. This was probably one of my favorite desserts in SF Overall, it's very low key. Our server had a great sense of humor. The tables are tighter along the sides of the restaurant, but the center is nice and open for a view of the kitchen.  Prices weren't bad. Again, love the neighborhood feel. Beer and wine only. Stones Throw is everything I want a restaurant to be. . . innovative and delicious with use of unpopular parts like pig ears with surprising flavor combos, like the curry aioli beneath the pork belly with grapefruit, the artichoke and olive with the lamb. We ate: Snacks: potato egg puffAppetizer: grilled octopus, pork belly w/ pig ears, squid ink pastaEntrée: duck breast + thigh, lambDessert: banana foster and the pb+j donuts.  All were delicious, can't wait to go back. It is always nice to leave from a restaurant and feel content. Stones Throw is one of these places. The food both in presentation and quality is outstanding but what is equally impressive is the service, professional, friendly and warm. These are the qualities that will make you wanna come back to this restaurant. Keep up the good work guys. Stones Throw, great food, lovely staff and location. The Banana chocolate pudding (can't remember name) is the best I have ever tasted. Go and I am sure you won't be disappointed. They have started serving brunch and can't wait to check this out. Stones Throw has been on the to do list for awhile now even thought it's basically a couple blocks away (woohoo, no worries about parking!). Although I could only finagle a reservation for : on a Friday night, the struggle to get into the city made it actually a reasonable dinner time. . . go figure!Our group of  was promptly seated although we did spend a little time at the way overcrowded teeny tiny ""bar. "" Having done my Yelp research, we were ready to order and the waiter was helpful in helping us make sure we ordered enough food. Here's what we got in ranking of deliciousness: PUFFED POTATO & EGGS: Cauliflower Mousse, Chives, Crispy Chicken Skin ($)A must order for sure as you can see by the multiple reviews. Think mashed potatoes stuffed with a runny egg yolk, fried and service with fried chicken skin. How can you possibly go wrong?? PORK BELLY & CRISPY PIG'S EAR: Avocado, Citrus, Moresque Spice, Kale ($)Fatty pork belly topped with crunchy fried goodness contrasted with the creamy avocado. Awesome dish, every bite was amazing. SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA: Spicy Capers, Clams, Calamari, Tender Greens ($)Who doesn't love squid ink pasta? The squid ink gives it, in additional to a cool color, a more al dente firm texture that I absolutely love. Clams and calamari give it a seafoody flavor that packs a punch! GRILLED OCTOPUS: Chorizo, White Beans, Braised Radicchio ($)Perfectly grilled. Most people don't like octopus because it's chewy and rubbery when not cooked right  not the case here. This octopus was tender and the char flavor only enhanced the octopus flavor. If you don't like the octopus here, you're not going to like it anywhere. OLIVE MARINATED LEG OF LAMB: Artichoke & Cucumber Panzanella Salad, Meyer Lemon, Castelvetrano Olives ($)I had read that this was the real standout of the main courses and it was definitely good. Not too much lamby taste. Overall I was more a fan of the snacks and starters but it was nice to get a little more substantial dish to feed the bellies 'TOAD IN THE HOLE' LASAGNA: Mushroom Duxelles, Asparagus, Green Garlic, Confit Egg Yolk ($)Raw egg? Hell yeah! The name ""lasagna"" might be a little misleading because the only thing that made it lasagny was the thin pasta on top. Lots of mushroom flavor and the raw egg gave it a luxurious creamy texture. DUCK PÂTÉ & MOUSSE: French's Mustard, Cornichons, Warm Soft Pretzel ($)This was definitely good but not a super standout in my mind. The soft pretzel was an interesting way to load up on the mousse With all these dishes and a bottle of wine our final bill for the group of  was just a little over $  not too shabby for such an amazing meal! Will be back! Our new found brunch (and dinner) spot!  It's been awhile since a restaurant has captivated me with  stars, but Stones Throw is a solid  and more!   From the decors to the staff down to their amazing food, they are the perfect restaurant of what every new establishment should be. We arrived about  minutes before they open their doors on a Sunday morning.  We left the house a little bit early in fear that parking was going to be hard.  It can be, especially on Hyde St. , but thankfully Stones Throw has teamed up with Uber.  Instead of having to worry about parking, Uber it and show your receipt to your server, % will be taken off your bill.  Not only is that one great way to accommodate your customers, the hostess literally walked outside and welcomed us into the restaurant even before they were opened for service.  The staff all felt that it was too chilly to be outside so although they were still setting up some things, they wanted us to be indoors.  Totally a nice gesture on their part that will be ingrained in my head  we got to stay warm and preview the bar while looking through the menu.  If you are into beers, you will definitely appreciate their  extensive selection.  Not only was the front of the house super warm and welcoming, our server Danielle was amazing too!  Super cheerful and friendly, she's the exact person to help bring a smile to anyone's face.  She was very attentive all throughout our brunch, constantly filling our waters and checking if she could get us anything. Simplicity is the key to this successful eatery.  Their brunch menu is not too extensive, but they keep things simple by focusing on a few small bites, some savories, and a few sweets.  Thanks to the recommendations of Cherylynn N. , we started with the Puffed Potato & Egg and boy, they were insanely delicious (thanks Cherylynn!).  I'm usually not a fan of egg yolks either, but the techniques in preparing this dish made us yearning for more!  The chefs not only managed to get the yolk oozy delicious, but the outer layer on the potato had the right amount of crispiness.  We also ordered ""da burga"" with tater tots and the asparagus w/ duck confit hash which were both just a tasty.  The duck confit by itself was a bit on the saltier side, but once you mix the bite with a piece of the biscuit + the runny eggs, it was solid flavor combination in my mouth.  Da burga was cooked to perfection, we asked for it to be medium and that was def. what we received, one juicy well seasoned burger.  The tater tots accompanied with it is just as amazing!  Bacon, sour cream, and chives blended into each tater tot as if I was biting into a loaded potato. To balance out the savories, we opted for the spiced pumpkin doughnuts with pumpkin butter as our dessert.  The doughnuts were light and fluffy and resembled a lot like beignets.  I'm nowhere close to being a pumpkin fan like my husband, but even I liked it.  It's not often that he finishes his dessert either but when he does, you know it's a great dessert.  The pumpkin butter was a nice touch, he only wished there was more of it and maybe have it filled inside each doughnut.   Look no further, stop by Stones Throw for either Sunday Brunch or a nice dinner, you will not be disappointed! Good stuff. Everything was amazing! Service, food, wine, ambiance, everything! The duck pate is to die for :) And now: BRUNCH! Really, though, you need these pancakes. And if you want something savory: duck hash. But. . . pancakes. Top  pancake experiences in the world a tie for pancake champion. Because pancakes. So I love this place. So many good things to rave about this place that I'm not sure where to begin. To me food is most important so let's start there. We ordered based on recommendations of a friend. Puffed potato and egg: DELICIOUS. I wanted to just eat all of these, give up on the rest of my meal and die happy. Too bad I had to share with the bf. The waiter said he wouldn't tell anyone if I I didn't save my bf any while he went to the restroom. Funny guy! Burger with loaded tots: apparently they only make  burgers a day so if you love them, then get one. You can tell the patty is house made with quality ingredients. Loaded tots were pure fatty goodness. Creme fraiche, bacon, chives and cheddar. It was like a baked potato tater tot! Crispy Duck leg and thigh: crunchy, juicy, flavorful, literally mouth watering as I reminisce. . . I can't talk about it anymore. Just get it! Peanut butter and jelly donuts: plain and simple. Little donut balls with peanut butter and jelly swirls you dip into. Grandma apple pie: Panna cotta, maple ice, rolled wafer, apple pieces, and spices. This is not an apple pie but Apple pie inspired flavors. It was so unique, I absolutely loved it. The flavors and different temperature, different consistency all melded to a whoa what did I just put in my mouth? (in a good way) ; )Plus lots of good wines and beers to choose from! Service: was friendly, a bit slow, but expected for a crowded Friday night at . Definitely make reservations. Decor: loved the repossessed wood look, with cute little bird motifs. Comfy and cozy. I want my kitchen to look like this place! Parking: arrive at least  min early. Or park farther and get Uber to drop you off. The restaurant worked some deal with them. I found parking so I didn't get the details. All in all, I'll be back, if I can get a table. . . . Came for a very satisfactory late dinner. Note: MAKE RESERVATIONS. We made reservations at  on a Friday, and it was still packed. Notable and memorable items:. Puffed potatoes with egg  so delicious. Fried potato puff with a runny yolk inside. To die for. Plus the crispy chicken skin surrounding it added a whole 'nother depth of flavor. I could get a bunch of these and would come out happy!. Squid ink appetizer  flavorful!. Duck mousse pate with  a little smaller, but still a tasty dish. Pork belly and crispy ear  the pork belly was pretty good, but the sauce and the crispy ears were my favorite parts. MM!!To skip:. Lasagna entree  this one was okay only. nothing too specialAnyways  make sure to check this place out! Great for drinks and appetizers as well for the lighter appetite! overrated. sad to see a nice place like luella swapped out for this. nothing on menu for the healthy conscious diner. Pricey, but worth a date night. Delightful good, good atmosphere. Great people. Can't go wrong. Limited menu, but very tasty. . . :)On your next visit, arrive in an Uber and receive % off your billA+ I chose this place for a friend's birthday based on the  star reviews on Yelp.  Well this is excellent example of what my ""non Yelper"" friends would say. . . Can't believe everything you read!  stars for the renovated decor & ambiance; definitely an update to it's predecessor, Luella.  The bartender was super friendly and attentive so another  stars there. Unfortunately I thought the food was just good not spectacular.  The popular snack or starter: Puffed Potatoe and Eggs. . . was good, but didn't wow me.  Well to their defense, I'm not a fan of egg yolk.  The squid ink pasta was delicious, as well as my entree: scallops.  I think what turned me off was our unfriendly server.  She rarely smiled and was inattentive.  It was Tuesday night and the place was packed, and yes we were a table of . . . but customer service should not be taken lightly regardless of how busy the restaurant is.  It's the nature of the business, and I think every server should always have a smile on their face and be more engaging.   I always pay at least % tip regardless, but when customer service is lacking, I feel somewhat cheated, which is a huge turn off to me.  I kept reaching out to another server just to get drink or food orders. . . the other server was really nice. Phenomenal service is one of the top reasons that fall on the list of reasons to come back to a place.  SO many other fabulous restaurants in the city to return to. Not sure if this is one of them. A well deserved  stars! Stones Throw is definitely my new and favorite restaurant! :)We decided to be spontaneous and have dinner here on a random Tuesday night. We had a pretty late reservation (:PM) as all the other times were all filled up. Per the reviews, we gave ourselves enough time to find parking in the area. Man, parking was a pain! We circled for quite awhile and managed to find a spot on Lombard Street. A couple of blocks of walking was actually not too bad because the view was amazing at night. We could see Crooked Street (Lombard Street), the Bay Bridge, and the Coit Tower! :)Anyways, we sat down exactly at our reservation time. I was quite surprised that the whole restaurant was packed when we first sat down and when we left. It just shows how good Stones Throw is! We had already knew what we were gonna share/order:Puffed Potato & Eggs  Placed on top of cauliflower mousse, chives, and crispy chicken skin. This dish was pretty amazing. Inside the puffed potato leaked the yolky egg. The puffed potato was so fluffy, soft, and warm. I really liked how the breading of the puffed potato was just thin enough. It wasn't too heavy too!Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta  Came with spicy capers, clams, calamari, and tender greens. Love love love this dish! A generous amount of seafood was provided. The pasta was cooked al dente and was very flavorful. It was actually a perfect portion size because if we were given more, I think it might have been a little bit too much. Pork Belly & Crispy Pig's Ear  Loved this dish as well. The pig's ears were so crispy that it reminded me of chips. The pork belly was lean and not too fatty. This dish was also served with avocado, citrus, moresque spice, and kale. It complemented the pork belly very well as it was refreshing. Crispy  North Duck Breast & Thigh  Came with black rice, asian pear, celery, and peking spiced jus. A very generous portion of the duck breast and thigh. Unfortunately, it was a bit overcooked, but it was still good. I enjoyed the thigh part more though. I thought the black rice was a bit interesting. It kind of reminded me of risotto. I usually don't like cooked fruits (pear), however, Stones Throw cooked it very well that I actually really enjoyed the cooked asian pear!Sadly, we were stuffed from our meal and didn't get to order dessert. (Also, because we had ice cream at Swensen's before dinner. ) However, I am absolutely sure we will be back to Stones Throw again. Overall, it was a delicious and affordable meal. Service was excellent and friendly. Everything was well executed and our water cups were never empty. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant %! Just an FYI, if you do drive, make sure to give yourself plenty of time to look for parking. Otherwise, Stones Throw does offer % off your bill if you take Uber. :) Our date nights are usually enjoyed in silence: Mr. NSS on his phone reading articles (how rude right?) while I have a foodgasm. . . by my lone self or drafting a review in my head about how craptastic the food is. ""How's everything tasting?"" asked our waiter, Dave. Mr. NSS: ""This is the B E S T restaurant we've been to in a long time!""Me *thinking*: WTF he talks?!?Mr. NSS: ""Toastmasters, baby!"" he said to me. Even though Stones Throw has taken over the Luella space for four months now, I held off visiting because of the parking situation and I'm kicking myself for it (thank you to my friend, Bonnie for the encouragement. )I have to agree with Mr. NSS that Stones Throw IS the best new(er) restaurant we've been to in a while. It's even better than  and Verbana which I loved. TBD and Alta CA? Um, they don't even come close to the finesse of Stones Throw and in hindsight, I was too generous in my ratings. The former Michael Mina chef has created a fantastically creative, New American menu that's small yet focused with  small bites,  apps and  entrees. I was a little concerned about the portion sizes from the earlier pics posted on Yelp but I had to doggy bag half my entree so it seems they have beefed up their portions. Expect to spend about $ for dinner for two (including a glass of wine each, tax and tip). ~ * ~ F O O D ~ * ~*Puffed Potato & Egg w/ Cauliflower Mousse, Chives, Crispy Chicken Skin ($)   STARSbit. ly/gVqIiuThe most amazing first bite I've had, I'm still scratching my head as to how they got the yolk inside the crisp and fluffy potato and how it managed to stay deliciously oozy. So foodgasmic that this is an absolute must order. *Pork Belly & Crispy Pig Ear w/ Avocado, Citrus, Moresque Spice, Kale  ($)   STARSbit. ly/lZblpGreat textures and flavor profiles, the combo of the moist yet lean pork belly (with crispy skin), wisps of crunchy pig ears, buttery avocado, garlicky aioli, and burst of citrus worked incredibly well. Make sure to eat each component together. *""Toad in the Hole"" Lasagna w/ Mushroom Duxelles, Asparagus, Green Garlic, Confit Egg Yolk ($)  STARSbit. ly/ozvI've been trying to eat less meat and I didn't miss it with this dish. The mushroom lasagna was hearty and you can never go wrong when it's topped with yolk porn. I think a drizzle of béchamel on top would have elevated the lasagna and tied everything together. Just my two cents. *Olive Marinated Leg of Lamb w/ Artichoke & Cucumber Panzanella Salad, Meyer Lemon, Castelvetrano Olives ($)  .  STARSbit. ly/OAvwmKA stellar entrée, Mr. NSS completely wiped his plate clean. The lamb was a perfect medium rare and was very tender. I usually despise olives but it was subtle enough that it seasoned the lamb well. If you're a carniwhore, get this!*Chocolate Bananas Foster w/ Chocolate Banana Shake & Warm Brownies ($)   STARSbit. ly/PTEOHI'm not a chocolate person but Dave, our waiter sold us on this dessert with his enticing description. The picture doesn't do it justice as the brown sugar caramel soaked bananas were spooned over table side so it altered the clean presentation. The banana milkshake was INSIDE the brownie so it was like a lava cake except the milkshake was still cold. How did they do that?!?! Seriously impressive. ~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~The staff was most excellent and everything you would want in a solid neighborhood restaurant: warm, friendly, attentive, and non pretentious. Dave, our waiter made great recs and was able to get in another order of the potato puffs (yes, it was that good!) on the fly before our entrees arrived. The proactive manager, Thomas graciously took the time to check in with every single table to ensure dinner was going well. Always a nice touch. ~ * ~ A M B I A N C E / D E C O R ~ * ~The space has brightened up a lot from the former Luella space with the use of neutral colored tables and furnishings: bit. ly/iGHb. There's about seating for  with additional seating at the bar. I appreciated that the restaurant absorbed sound well so we didn't have to scream across the table. . . when we did speak to each other. Highly recommended for a date place. We had an early dinner last night and it was a full house by the time we left before  pm so definitely make reservations. ~ * ~ P A R K I N G ~ * ~Street parking is impossible after : pm   pm on weeknights and there are no nearby parking lots. Expect to spend   minutes looking for parking. And even if you find parking somewhere in Chinatown or Van Ness area, making your date hike up and down 'em hills would be mean. If you know what's good for you *ahemWINKWINKahem*, Uber it because Stones Throw offers a % off your bill. This was a recent date night, and it really delivered for that! The food was really delicious, and the wine selection was phenomenal. This is definitely on the ""places to return"" list. Although there wasn't anything specifically vegan on the menu, when the reservation was put in, inquiry was made, and we were assured that they would be able to provide for me. When we sat down, we let our server know, and he was gracious and accommodating. I often worry about being a problem customer because of dietary restrictions, but I was made to feel like I was no worry at all and they were in fact happy to provide me with something. We got the roasted root vegetable appetizer, which was really good, and full of unique vegetables. We actually struggled with placing what some of them were one was pickled radish that had been roasted! Everything was interesting and stimulating on the palate, with only the cauliflower being slightly overdone to being soft, while everything else was perfect. For dinner, I got a bountiful assortment of vegetables, some of which I could not identify (always exciting!). They were mostly sauteed, I believe, and all had great texture and flavor, and none of the natural flavors were drowned out by oil or salt the seasoning was perfectly balanced. They included a few dollops of a white bean puree, and a few dollops of their green garlic sauce. That green garlic sauce stole the show, hands down! It was in my dish, as well as on my companion's meat, and it was just SO. GOOD. I'm salivating a little disgustingly right now while I think about it. You don't even know. Go eat the sauce. Do it. Do it now. As mentioned, the wine list was great, with hilarious commentary under the different headings. It's creatively organized by genre of wine, rather than color of type, so you can browse by things like trusty wines, unusual wines, traditional wines, and so on, plus a ""bargain bin"" of super spendy wines that aren't going very quickly so have been reduced to really great prices. Our server was really helpful with steering us toward a bottle of wine that would match with both of our meals. The dessert menu looked killer, but we were far too full to get any. However, they solicit dessert suggestions, with the chance that your favorite recipe will go on the menu and you'll get to come eat it! Very fun. Overall, a beautiful, nicely laid out little neighborhood restaurant with a great personality and food and wine good enough to make it a destination from other neighborhoods. My one regret was not getting the Bordeaux I was ogling on the bargain wine list but I guess that just means I'll have to go back! This place is amazing, I just wish it were in my neighborhood! I was treated mightly to an evening where dish upon dish was brought to our two large tables, so I have no idea what a normal evening would be like here (y'know, with starter, main, dessert). Instead I had starter , starter  oh look another starter , is this my main? No it's starter , then main , main  and a third main followed by dessert, with an apres meal coma (coma of BLISS). Basically, I got to try around  dishes shared amongst a larger table, and I can safely say they were all divine. Also, when I let a waiter know I was gluten free, there wasn't even any fuss or sigh in making a few 'personal' dishes for me when the main ones being shared with the table weren't gluten free. I was very, very impressed by the staff. The crab? So sweet and delicious. The scallops? Melt in the mouth. The pork belly? MORE PLEASE. But the best dish of the evening had to be the beef which was both sweet, delicious, melt in the mouth and MORE PLEASE. It was the final dish served, at which point I was getting too full, but not too full for as much of this beef as I could have without being rude whilst sharing. If I lived in SF, I would come back here for a 'normal' meal shared with a partner or good friend, and probably struggle to choose only one thing for each course from their menu. I have been spoiled. Come here in a big group and you'll be fed like kings and queens. The staff, again, get a mention for being wonderful; and the beef. The lamb, squid ink pasta with shellfish and carrot soup were all excellent. The menu was small: only  small apps,  starters and five mains, but it was nicely balanced and I like that focus. Service was perfect. I'm a bit picky when it comes to lighting. . . I found it to be a tad too bright. Stones Throw is great!  I was happy with everything we ordered and felt comfortable in the space.  It is a definite upgrade from Luella although they should have done something with the floors in order to create a warmer atmosphere.  We will be back!  Loved the dessert beer and the extra pretzels! So, Stones Throw is probably on its way to being one of the best restaurants in  in SF.  It's THAT good.  Proof can be seen in how packed it was when my friend Brittny and I showed up on a Thursday night.  Thank God for reservations!We had a hard time figuring out where to stand while we were waiting for our table, and was invited to stand at their center table while we waited.  A little awkward, but hey, who doesn't like being front and center?  Once we got seated, our really friendly waiter came by and checked in with us.  It was then that we were informed about the items that were his favorites and what were the traditional picks.  After mulling over things, going through a session of girl talk, we ordered the following:Appetizers: Dungeness Crab Salad Pork Belly & Crispy Pig's EarMains: Toad in the Hole Lasagna Crispy  North Duck Breast & ThighSo, a few things.  I'm not a huge dungeness crab person. I'm more of a shrimp girl, so ordering this dish was a risk on my part.  Pork belly, on the other hand, is usually my go to item when I see it on a menu.  The result couldn't have been more surprising.  The crab salad really just nailed it.  That's not to say the pork belly wasn't good (loved the crispiness of that pork ear), but it paled in comparison to the crab salad. Second item to discuss, I love duck. I love duck at fancy places (La Folie) and I love duck at casual places ().  And throughout my meal, I thought to myself, ""Wow. This is really great. Especially that crispy duck skin. gimme. "" And then it happened. Brittny kindly forked over a sample of the lasagna, and I knew right away one thing had happened: Eater's Remorse. My tastebuds got suckerpunched. I immediately had wished that I had gotten this, especially since it's a seasonal item and the likelihood of me having this again is somewhat unlikely. If you're around when they have this, do me a favor and order it. Kthxbye. Finally came dessert. I had managed to sneak off and tell the restaurant that my beautiful friend had just gotten engaged. Our waiter recommended to us the banana's foster, despite my friend's craving for their peanut butter & jelly beignets.  The banana's foster came accompanied with table side serving of the super hot caramel sauce being poured over.  Amazing. And then, the beignets showed up with a nice little message that said ""Congratulations!"". Overall, I think Stone's Throw has serious potential.  If you're a beer freak, this place is for since it's beer list is long and respectable.  The food here speaks for itself, and the place really gives the neighborhood a nice cozy feel without the need to be pretentious.  I will absolutely be coming back here! Let me make this simple and to the point. . .  stars for Stones Throw!  I only share my  star experiences so congratulations Ryan Cole and team!Started with Puffed Potato and Eggs  topped with cauliflower mousse, chives and crispy chicken skin  Heavenly surprise with a creamy egg yolk inside each one.  A must have for everyone to try!  Next was the Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta with Clams and Calamari  Insanely delicious and worth the cheat during lent for no pasta:)  Nothing like it!  For the main entree. . It was tough to choose while checking out what everyone else was having and I went for the scallops!  Super fresh and seared perfectly.  Fancy dish!  As for dessert. . . Chocolate bananas foster AND I had to go for some sample bites of the pb&j donuts to really send me over the edge and it was well worth the extra calories!  Love that they have  beers by the bottle ranging from $ to $ which takes the experience to any level you're in the mood for.  Excellent wine list with a wide range to choose from. The ambiance is casual and fun with a high end menu!  I **heart you** #MichaelBauer but the stars you gave #StonesThrow need to shoot higher or I'll meet you there for Take :)  I'm ready to go again!! Loved our late dinner here, it's spacious, no elbowing actions between tables. Octopus: very tender, almost too tender for our taste. But very nice with the chorizo and beans. Pork Belly with crispy pig's ear: best thing we had that night. Loved the avocado puree with anise, such a refreshing flavor combination. Duck Breast and leg confit: the leg confit has a surprise green onion stuffed in it, which lifted the supposingly greasy meat so nicely. In all, really nice place to get inspired from. Our waiter was super enthusiastic about the food, which was a big plus. Really really great addition to the Russian Hill neighborhood!  I made a reservation for : on a Tuesday and we arrived  minutes early and were seated right away.  I'm not exaggerating when I say we had  or  different waiters/servers/bus boys throughout the course of the meal and all of them were SO friendly, made conversation, and had real opinions about the food on their menu!  So much so that my girlfriend and I went with three of the recommendations from one of our waitresses.  We ordered the: Grilled Octopus (WOW, best I've ever had. It actually tasted like tender meat with a perfect char on the outside not tough or chewy at all), the Squid Ink Pasta (THE SAUCE OMG YOU NEED TO SERVE BREAD WITH THIS SO I COULD HAVE MOPPED IT ALL UP, no shame), and the Seared Scallop dish (perfectly cooked, but not as over the top impressive as the previous two).  We sat right by the kitchen, so I kept seeing TONS of people order the little potato puff balls and the burger.  Next time I come, those are % on my list!! The wine and beer list is impressive, and I can see why it was PACKED on a random Tuesday night with some of the most fabulously dressed diners I've seen in a long time. LOVE. This was our first time at this fairly new restaurant.  The food was amazing, and the SERVICE was the BEST. The Host/Owner Tai is so nice, polite and helpful, you would think you were a guest in her home.  Other than the parking (which is not very good) I would highly recommend this to everyone.  Bob & Gloria Wow, a  star experience!  My bf made reservations for a Sat night @ pm  people the day before. It was that easy to get a reservation, probably because this restaurant is only a few months old. Upon arriving, they were pretty swamped. We got there on time, but weren't seated until maybe :pm. However, once entering, we recognized Thommas, our favorite waiter (once captain) from Michael Mina. It turns out many of the people from the Michael Mina group (Ryan, owner of Stones Throw, the ex Chef de Cuisine of Michael Mina, and our host Thommas) had jumped ships to this new American restaurant in Russian Hill. Thommas immediately gave us champagne while we were waiting for our table. Highlights:) Duck Pate & Mousse with Pretzel  closest thing to foie gras you can get in this state! So good. . . pretzel was to die for too. . . it was super fresh and soft. Not your typical Auntie Anne's! ) Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta with clams. PERFECT FOR ALL YOU SQUID INK PASTA LOVERS! The pasta was cooked perfectly, al dente, with yummy seafood touch from the clams. Can't come here without ordering. My only complaint is that I wish it were an entree, rather than a pasta. Too small for someone's meal unless you really eat like a bird. ) Fish. . . which I believe was Halibut. They Sous vide'd it, so it was cooked perfectly, very soft and pretty much a poached fish. They took this one off the menu though unfortunately, I couldn't find it! =() Lamb was ordered twice at our table. It was very good  I typically don't like lamb, but this was cooked in a way where it did not taste like lamb (the best). If you are a lamb lover, order this dish!Ambiance was young, loud, dark, fun, similar to Pesce. Food was phenomenal. However, parking was awful. My bf and I ended up hiking up the hill from Van Ness in the rain, not the best way to end your Saturday night! Do yourself a favor and allow  mins to find parking. If you get there early, treat yourself to a cocktail!Can't wait to return for a family member's birthday! I don't write reviews often, but I felt compelled to after the amazing dinner I had last week. My friend Lisa (she's also on Yelp and will include more extensive review :) and I came as part of our monthly dinners just the two of us. We're always looking on the Eater Map for the hottest new SF restaurants and Stone's Throw had been on our list for a while. Here are the three reason's why I loved Stone's Throw:. Our waiter was extremely friendly, knowledgable, and attentive. When we asked for recommendations, he asked us what we traditionally liked, and how the dishes may be different from what you'd normally expect (ie: the lasagna). . THE FOOD. We ordered the dungeness crab salad (melts in your mouth), the pork belly with crispy pigs ear, Lisa had the duck, and I had the ""toad in the hole lasagna""  entrees. I can honestly say the lasagna was one of the best entree's I have ever had. All of the unique flavors meshed together wonderfully. The absence of a traditional tomato sauce was not missed, and the ""white sauce"" was completely and utterly amazing. And it had an egg on it! An egg for crying out loud. I HIGHLY recommend the lasagna. But go quick our wonderful waiter told me it's seasonal :)We had the banana's foster for dessert again, completely superb. We also had the peanut butter & jelly donuts, which they brought out for us to celebrate my recent engagement :). The ambiance. The restaurant is wonderfully decorated and has such a great vibe. The executive chef delivered our appetizer, and everyone I spoke with who worked at Stone's Throw was enthusiastic and friendly. I even asked if they have ever done a rehearsal dinner, and they haven't, but I'm highly considering to be the first :) What a wonderful find. I used to live a block away and now I regret moving away! With its clean lines, dark stained wood, and mixed set of beautiful dishes, you get a sense of the effortless seeming incredible attention to detail that went into putting this place together. I had a great meal and look forward to coming back. RESERVATIONS: Love that you can make brunch reservations! Despite brunch being a Sunday only thing here, luckily it hasn't taken off too much, so it was easy to find a time that worked, and I even changed it a few days beforehand when they called to confirm the time. THE SERVICE: Excellent, excellent. Very friendly and chill. My good friend and I just sat and caught up for an extra hour after were were done eating and did not feel rushed at all (granted, there wasn't a wait for tables either). Our water was always filled, and the timing throughout the meal was impeccable. THE COST: So affordable! $ total per person for  app and  brunch entree. SNACKS* Puffed Potato and Eggs  .  stars(Cauliflower Mousse, Chives, Crispy Chicken Skin. $)pic: yelp. com/biz_photos/ston…cross section: yelp. com/biz_photos/ston…Wonderful. Each puff has a thin, grainy, light yet crispy breading. It was SO fresh that the server warned us to poke it with a fork first, or it might pop open (I should've listened). The filling consisted of a layer of mashed potato, which was super soft, and within that a gooey yolk filling. Delicious. SWEETS* Butter Fried Pancakes   stars(Strauss European Style Butter, Vermont Maple Syrup. $)pic: yelp. com/biz_photos/ston…These pancakes are HUGE! You get two that fill the entire plate. This was very fluffy but not dry. Simple and delicious, but I did need syrup with each bite. We didn't ordered this but actually made friends with the group at the table next to us. They couldn't finish this and let us try it. I tend to like pancakes with more toppings/fruits/filling and found this a little too simple. SAVORY* Butternut Squash & Duck Confit Hash  .  stars(Fried Eggs, Buttermilk Biscuit. $)pic: yelp. com/biz_photos/ston…A very delicious savory dish  I love the autumn hints (butternut squash, brussels sprouts). The biscuit was dense and had a perfectly moist texture while just slightly crisp on the outside. Snacks menu: yelp. com/biz_photos/ston…Sweets/Savory menu: yelp. com/biz_photos/ston… Sunday Brunch has never been better!!A group of  came and had amazing food and service. The chef prepared special dishes for strict vegans in our group, and the mimosas were delicious!  It was a wonderful experience! Can't wait to come back for dinner! Not only is the place great overall, but they were really nice to us when I started to feel sick during our short wait. Thank you for that. I'm still full from my dinner there  nights ago! For the sake of time of dining with a rather large group we ordered ahead of time so we could try a little of everything from the menu. It turns out a little of everything= a lot of food!The starters and the desserts really shined from the menu. I tried a bite of a few of the entrees, but wasn't really feeling it. As for what I'd order again next time. . . Starters: Puffed Potatoes and Eggs Duck Pate and Mousse  Squid Ink PastaDesserts: Chocolate Bananas Foster Peanut Butter & Jelly DoughnutsAnd that's just about / of the food we ate. Can you see why I'm still stuffed?They had a lovely wine list as well. It also proved to be a great spot to dine with  people (we split up among  tables in the back). There's so many great restaurants in SF that I don't return to many of them often, but this is one I'd be thrilled to go back to for some more wine, apps & dessert! Had reservations at : on a Sunday night.  We ordered the following:PUFFED POTATO & EGGS: Cauliflower Mousse, Chives, Crispy Chicken Skin  I'm not a big egg fan and was hesitant when I saw the egg oozing out, but it actually tasted yummy, not a heavy egg flavor and the crispy chicken skin made it taste even better. DUNGENESS CRAB SALAD: Artichoke Chips, Garlic Cream, Anchovy  Probably my favorite dish of the night.  Right amount of crab with crispy artichoke chips. SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA: Spicy Capers, Clams, Calamari, Tender Greens  Had a sweet taste, with al dente texture, good amount of seafood. CRISPY  NORTH DUCK BREAST & THIGH: Black Rice, Asian Pear, Celery, Peking Spiced Jus  Cooked medium rare.  A bit too rare for me.  My bf said the duck thigh tasted better than the duck breast. SEARED MAINE DAY BOAT SCALLOPS: Fresh Chickpea 'Salad', Spiced Orange Oil, Marinated Calamari  Sorta felt the scallops weren't cooked enough since it had strong seafoody taste compared to other places I've had scallops at. NOT YOUR GRANDMA'S APPLE PIE  I liked how it had different textures and temperatures all mixed into one dish.  The shaved ice on top of the custard made it a unique dessert. Overall, I think all of our appetizers and sides tasted better than our main dishes.  I'd like to come back and try some of the other dishes.  Note, parking is very difficult!  We actually had reservations a month prior to this date and were unable to find parking and as a result had to cancel our reservation. Came by for dinner this past Friday and liked the atmosphere  very lively. The restaurant itself seems pretty standard SF yuppie (not a putdown just a statement  I'm a card carrying member)  reclaimed wood tables, high ceilings, and those half silver painted clear light bulbs. The food offerings are not very vegetarian friendly and were overall hit or miss  like other reviews have mentioned, the squid ink pasta was very good (first time I've had non linguine squid ink pasta!).  On the other hand, the grilled squid was not that great  similar to Nopa, they seem to slow cook it in a pouch (I'm know what its called but that word sounds ridiculous), turning the normally chewy octopus into more of a fish cake.  No more trying grilled squid at ""Contemporary American"" restaurants. Finally, in keeping with the SF yuppie comment, prices are high (small dishes $+, mains $+, bottled beers $+) and portions are small (we expect to order ~ dishes per  people).  High prices coupled with small portions and hit or miss dishes means while it was worth checking out once, we won't likely be back. Loved this place! The service was impeccable and the food was fantastic. My favorite items: + Squid ink pasta  Deliciously flavorful but petite pasta dish with a myriad of seafood. Highly recommend. + Potato puffs with egg yolk  Wonderfully doughy and decadent. + Bananas fosters  This was sent over by the staff on the house as a surprise for being patient with the wait. What a gesture! Warm chocolate with bananas and ice cream. Perfect end to the meal. Overall, a lovely experience. :) Friendly atmosphere, delicious food. I had the Lamb roast and my friend had the vegetable lasagna. The lamb was a greek fusion delight with olives and meyer lemons. Very fresh and nicely paired with the heavy meat. My friend's vegetable lasagna was great with Ducelles mushrooms stealing the show. Would go back again. Love the experience  great food, service, and ambiance  happy they've come into my neighborhood! Party of , we had puffed potato & eggs, grilled octopus, scallops, and ""not your grandma's apple pie""  everything was great, but grilled octopus was particularly standout. Seriously, can't wait to go back. Delicious! Great cozy spot with delicious food, great wine and beer, and impeccable service. Came here on a Saturday night and had made a reservation. Unfortunately we still were left waiting for about  minutes before we were seated. hmm. . . isn't this why you make reservations?? on the positive side, the food was absolutely delicious. The appetizer with crab salad, the carrot/ginger soup, root vegetable salad all so good and with fresh ingredients. one stand out was the octopus appetizer dish, they really knocked it out of the park with excellent flavors. I believe I tried a lamb dish as an entree which was also excellent. washed it all down with a nice cabernet. Unfortunately, the food took so long to come out, and the wait was so long even after the reservation was made, that it was a bit off putting. I don't think I will be hurrying back, but I'm glad I tried it. Also the ambiance/decor is very nice, it's a good special date place for sure. The restaurant is smaller in terms of available seating. We had a : reservation but tables weren't leaving at the rate expected, so we ended up standing at the bar for  minutes. However, the host was extremely cognizant of the situation. After   minutes he brought over some complimentary sparkling wine. After  minutes, we were starving so we put in a small plate order, which was also comped. Issues like this happen in restaurants all the time, so to know that they cared and were working on a solution put us in a good mood on what could have otherwise lessened our entire meal experience. While we were waiting, I did order the Tai One On cocktail, which was reminiscent of a French , tart with just the right about of bubbly. For the small plate we ordered the puffed potato & eggs, served atop cauliflower puree, chives and crispy chicken skin. The chicken skin almost tastes like bacon, so it's no surprise this dish also appears on the brunch menu. When we got seated we order some wine after requesting recommendations from the server, who was very helpful. We ordered pretty much every small plate on the menu. My favorite after the potatoes was the salt roasted beets with burrata, lemon and crackers. I hadn't had beets served with a citrus twist before and it really complemented the sweetness of the beets. The Dungeness crab salad with artichoke chips, garlic cream and anchovies was surprisingly flavorful. The duck pate and mousse was a pleasant surprised. The pate and mousse were layer and it was server with warm pretzel balls, so the pate melted right on like butter. The starter plate we ordered (not to be confused with the ""small"" plates) was the squid ink pasta and was my favorite dish of the night. It was well balanced and even though the dish included calamari, clams and capers it wasn't overwhelmingly seafood tasting. My second favorite dish of the night was actually their burger. It comes with all the fixings and thick layer of cheddar cheese. The end result is that it basically melts in your mouth the second you bite in. If you're a burger fan, this is not one to miss. I wouldn't be surprised if it starts popping up on ""Best Burger in SF"" lists in the future (along with the totally under the radar burger from Bistro AIX). The burger comes with stuffed tater tots, which are amazing. We also ordered a ravioli main dish which looks like it's not longer featured on the menu, which is fine because it was under whelming and forgettable (I think it was pumpkin or chestnut maybe?). We didn't end up ordering any dessert as we were way too full by this point but I adore their concept behind the dessert menu. All patrons are asked to fill out a piece of paper at the end of the meal with their favorite childhood dessert. If the chef feels inspired by your suggestion, an upscale, modernized version could appear on the menu. Current desserts include chocolate bananas foster, apple pie and peanut butter and jelly donuts. Overall the meal was pretty affordable if you're following the ""sharing is caring"" philosophy. We ordered about half the menu plus several glasses of wine and didn't feel bad when we say the check. I'm adding Stone's Throw to my list of favorite neighborhood spots and can't wait to go back any see what kind of spin they take on brunch. Came here for the first time for dinner last weekend.  The restaurant has a cozy and inviting atmosphere.  The service was pleasant, but the food was great.  For such a casual unassuming place, the food was such a standout. We had the duck pate and mousse which was good, not bad, but not memorable, then the grilled octopus and the lamb as my entree, both were delicious, but man, that octopus knocked my socks off it was so good.  It was prepared in a Spanish style with white beans, and cooked perfectly. The not your grandma's apple pie was also an unexpected treat.  The cold custard and flaky pastry were really really good, and I loved the modern take on such a traditional classic.  The portions aren't very large, so I would suggest ordering a bunch of things and sharing, which is what we did. I would recommend this place for a date or to go out with a friend to catch up over a delicious meal and some strong beer (they have a good selection of beer, yum!) Overall a lovely dining experience, and will definitely be coming back! Great food!   The duck pate and the pork belly are standouts. My new favorite Russian hill eatery. We started with the puffed potato and egg bites with cauliflower cream and crispy chicken skin ( party in your mouth). Next the squid ink pasta with calamari and clams (seafood goodness). rd course was the carrot soup with Dungeness crab (perfect creamy warmth for a rainy SF winter night). We ended the savory part of the meal with the sea bass (before they took off the menu) flavored with a wasabi cream and a vegetable medley. We managed to squeeze in the PBJ donuts (sweet heaven). A classy neighborhood spot with innovative flavorful cuisine. This place is absolutely amazing, we came here for valentines day and were just blown away. They had a prefixed  course meal with an optional wine pairing for each. My fiancé went with the wine and I had a beer from Netherlands. I went with the oysters, risotto, short ribs and bananas foster, she went with the crab rolls, asparagus soup(so delicious!) ahi tuna and a bread pudding. The wine paired really well with each of her choices and our waiter explained everything in detail. Even though we spent well over $ it was totally worth the experience! Although our first two starters were amazing I have to give a  star review due to the Pan Roasted Arctic Char being so bad. I'm not sure if it was a fluke but the fish was unseasoned, extremely undercooked, had no flavor and the farro was also extremely bland. I was tempted to complain to our waitress because it was so bad but my boyfriend pleaded with me not to. In the end we still wished we would have said something to the waitress. Despite the bad dish our starters were incredible. Highly recommend the Grilled Octopus and Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta. The octopus was so tender and delicious. The service was good and the starters were amazing but that one main dish really ruined the whole meal. Hate to give it  stars but our expectations must have been too high after the great starters. This is one of those great restaurants that make you glad you live in (or near) San Francisco.  The room is really beautiful in a spare way, the food is truly inspired, and the service is very attentive.  Even in the very best restaurants, I've found the service to be less intuitive than we had at ST.  Our server always seemed to be on hand when we needed him, but in no way was he intrusive. So why not five stars you ask.  The noise.  When we first arrived, we actually had to consult one another on whether we'd be able to stand the noise level during what we'd hoped would be a quiet dinner to talk and catch up on our weeks.  I was ready to leave; my husband said we should sit down and give it a try.  I do not understand why a restaurant of that caliber feels the need to play loud rock music.  It was totally out of sync with the experience.  Someone must have asked for the music volume to be turned down, because a little while later they did lower it.  The people at the next table then were able to stop screaming, deafening us and making it impossible to have a conversation, so we could then talk. Still, being near the bar, as the evening wore on, that area got very crowded and the noise level went back up to, if not above, what it had been.  It was an easy decision to say no to dessert; our ears just couldn't take it any more. Bottom line, we may go back (to try sitting in the back room and hope it's quieter), but there are enough other fantastic restaurants in the immediate vicinity where I won't be cringing in anticipation of the noise factor; so, honestly, we'll probably take our business elsewhere. We had a fantastic dinner there ! Most creative food Chef Jason and his team have created a fun , casual restaurant where you can enjoy some if the best food in SF ! We will be back This restaurant has delish food!  I was very pleased  and our waitress was honestly the best.  She was super sweet and attentive and had great recommendations!The only  wierd thing about this place is the decoration, the tables remind me of cheap picnic tables which I found odd, but I dont go to restaurants for table quality so its really not a big deal to me at all. we came here for dinner recently based on the yelp reviews and we were pretty disappointed. . the appetizers and mains are quite small and pricey for what you getpork belly and pig ears was ok. . grilled octopus had a nice char but in no way was worth  bucksmy lamb was relatively bland and was dry (probably overcooked)my wife's duck crispy but was gone after a couple bites. . I love that this place is right in my neighborhood. Literally a stone's throw away. Get  of everything on this list ;) Dinner. Puffed potato and egg. Duck pate and mousse. Da burger (I didn't get this but I was eavesdropping on a couple that had it next to me and they said it was heaven) . Crispy North Duck . This cocktail with wine in it that was amazing but I forget the nameBrunch. Butternut squash and duck confit hashI want to go back and try everything else. Enjoy! Great atmosphere, staff, and food. The only reason I am giving this  stars vs.  stars are the prices. They are a bit high. That said, you are missing out on a great SF dining experience if you don't go to Stones Throw. What a wonderful restaurant on green & Hyde. Every dish is visually stunning. The potato puffs filled with egg yolks, the crab mousse salad, the charred octopus, and deconstructed desserts. YumThe maitre d will be legendary.  The bartending team is brilliant. The beverage list first rate, and a young Rachael Ray waitress look alike. The menu selection is not large, food is ok, unfortunately didn't meet our expectation.  We had the duck pâté (our fav dish here), squid ink pasta (had many good reviews but it didn't meet my expectation due to review), grilled lamb and da burger. . . They are good food, but not wow. Sorry. We had high expectation after reading the reviews, but it didn't quite met it.  Not your grandma's app pie was good but not wow. . . Sorry again.  There are definitely better places to dine.  Service is super though! Wow excellent service here, and really beautifully presented, delicious food.  It's hoppin' but the staff is on their game, cool and gracious. The menu layout is smart and the beers! Oy. We loved the beets and the octopus, and the duck pate made my moms eyes kind of roll back in her head.  Lamb, cod and duck entrees all tops. Easy A+. New Restaurant in the neighborhood!!  It's great,yummy food, wine cocktails were excellent.  The egg potato puffs we divine.  Also had pork belly,,deelicious.  Chestnut Ravioli, very fall and rustic.  Duck,,nice as well.  Dessert was a banana chocolate love fest,holy shit it was so good.  We will be back,, thank you. Sat at bar,,service was great. I only wished we were included in their safety meeting ;) What a great find!  We decided to go outside of the current neighborhoods that we love and found this gem.  Our reservation was at :, we arrived on time but the table wasn't ready but they went out of their way to find us a table at the bar, uncorked our bottle for free and sent over a complimentary starter.  The cauliflower mousse/potato/egg dish  it was delicious!  Once we were seated we had impeccable service, lots of recommendations and superior food!!  We started with the beet salad, which was refreshing. . . but really in a beet dish all you taste is beets.  Next we shared the squid ink pasta  this was too good for words.  In fact we would come back just for that.  Then to the entrees, my boyfriend had the ravioli and loved it.  Sweet, savory and just plain tasty.  I ordered the duck. . . and it was easily the best duck I have ever had.  Cooked perfectly with every bite better than the last.  We finished with the bananas foster, which was wonderful. . . I'm sure I could say more about it but at that point we were done with our wine and feeling a bit warm and fuzzy. We will definitely come back and I'm sure we will enjoy it as much if not more as we try new dishes. This is tricky one!  .  stars for the food which is delicious and a  star for having to wait for + minutes even though there was an empty table that could seat us and they were not even packed or busy. We made reservations for  (couple plus baby) at  PM on a sleepy, rainy Sunday just hours before the Super Bowl. Showed up on time and were told that the they were waiting on a table to pay so would we please wait at the bar. Ordered  drink and waitedThe table clearly was not leaving and  minutes later we were told that they were held up waiting on a to go order which didn't make any senseAll the while a  seat table was still empty and they still hadn't figured out if they could seat us thereFinally around : they figured out that they could give us the  seater and escorted us thereNo apologies. No we will comp your one drink or something. Nothing. All the service staff acted like nothing had happened as if this was to be expectedAnd the kicker  the party of  at the table that we were supposedly waiting to leave to be seated still hand't left when we left at :Like I said food was absolutely delicious but didn't enjoy this part of the experience Everything we had here (which was most of the menu) was delicious and our waitress was so sweet. Recommend dung. crab salad, burger, potato & egg, duck pate with pretzels. Yum. I will definitely be back. Finally trying out the new kid on the block, after hearing rave reviews from some close friends  in fact, one of them had just mentioned Stones Throw to me during lunch, so along I came, wanting to treat my mom to a nice dinner before her flight home. Rather than getting full off of entrees, we focused a bit more on appetizers instead, ordering their:* Squid Ink Conchiglie Pasta  Fantastic dish, and easily our favorite part of the meal. With every bite you get massive in your face flavor goodness, which gets stronger the closer you get to the bottom of the bowl. If you don't make a point of stirring every now and then, it actually becomes a little too overwhelming, so, be sure to do so. The best way to describe the flavors of this dish? Pasta in a seafood chowder. But fancier. * Pork Belly & Crispy Pig's Ear  I, admittedly, found my first two bites of this appetizer a bit boring and uninspired, until I made a point of eating the pork with a bit more sauce, and a bite of fruit, which suddenly made for this fantastic, balanced blend of contrasting flavors. As is often the case, all the ingredients are served together for a reason!* Crispy  North Duck Breast & Thigh  Not quite as tasty as our appetizers, especially given that we've had legit Beijing duck before, but, still enjoyable, albeit a bit salty. Could have definitely benefited from less heavy handed saucing, or larger portions of the rice and pear. * Peanut Butter & Jelly Doughnuts  My reaction to this dessert started at wtf, and quickly shifted to resigned disappointment, as I wondered how we went from fantastic savory dishes to a lackluster dessert. To be fair, this platter of fluffy beignet doughnuts and fanciful condiments was not terrible, but, given the complexity and contrast of flavors in our previous dishes, the singularly sweet nature of this dessert fell disappointingly short. But, despite our dinner ending on such a low note, I still have to give Stones Throw a solid , if not almost .  stars. One of the more notable dinners I've had recently, and one I can see myself treating myself or someone special to again, if not just for that pasta dish alone. *Accessibility Info*Venue  Disregarding the excessively steep and numerous hills in the immediate vicinity of Stones Throw, which you may have to traverse depending on where you ultimately find parking, the venue itself is perfectly accessible, with a large, open floor plan. Bathroom  Given how new Stones Throw is, it's not really a surprise that their restrooms were up to spec. Stones Throw is a fantastic new restaurant in Russian Hill. We loved everything about our experience when we went there for dinner last Saturday. The atmosphere is great and the location can't be beat. It feels like a casual and professional restaurant that you can relax at during the week and also go there for a night out on the weekend. I usually don't comment on the service first, but it was truly top notch here. Servers were helpful, attentive, and professional. It was a great combo of fine dining and a casual atmosphere. The food was amazing. Literally everything we tried I would order again. For apps we shared a few things but the highlights were the squid ink pasta and the grilled octopus. The octopus was so tender and tasty. The potato puffs and eggs were also small and a great starter to share. For entrees we had the lamb and duck. The duck was above average, the lamb was really great. The meat was so tender and I loved that they served it in thin pieces. So much flavor. The wine and beer list were  extensive, whatever your interest is you will be able to find something great. As far as things to improve, we tried a few desserts. They were good but not sure if they lived up to the previous courses but by this time we were expecting a lot. It is also is a bit bare bones in the restaurant but maybe to be expected since it's so new. We will surely be back to Stones Throw. The location and atmosphere are great, perfect for San Francisco. You can tell the food is fresh and of the best quality. This is a great place. This place is great. I love the neighborhood (though parking is a bit of a challenge, they offer you a % discount if you arrive with Uber which is a nice touch). We started with the cauliflower mousse/puffed potatoes/egg thing which is really cool. You cut into the fried potato and then an egg yolk bursts out, which both surprised (and entertained) me. We got the dungeness crab salad  holy cow, it was superlative. I wish I had eaten the whole thing instead of sharing. The duck pate was on par  it was one of the best I have had. From top to bottom, there were slivers of cornichons sitting on top of a thin layer of yellow mustard (my favorite), on top of the pate. It was served with two warm and delectable pretzel rolls. For our main course we ordered the lamb, which was cooked perfectly and named accurately  the meat had just a hint of olive. We also got the black cod, again cooked perfectly. We finished up with the chesnut raviolo  probably my favorite, though all three mains were really excellent. We passed on dessert and went for ice cream up the street (probably not the smartest call). Service was good but bordering on a little slow  to be fair, we had a baby with us, and took her out of the restaurant a few times so the progression of food was probably lost on me. They were very friendly despite the fact that she was the only baby in the restaurant. A final word on drinks  I appreciate that the menu is split into different categories/descriptions of both beer and wine. The apostrophe is their version of a Manhattan and it is really delightful. Would definitely come back. Came here because of the reviews. They were right. Cool place, hard to park . But great food and wonderfully friend sly staff. Had the chestnut ravioli and it was very delicious. Also the lamb was delicious and the de burger very special. lemon meringue very good Every now and then a buddy of mine and I go out and treat ourselves.  Really glad I did it here.  The burger sells out regularly one bite and I get why so god.  Other dishes (octopus) were excellent as was dessert.  Excellent quality and presentation value added compared to price. I worked service industry for ~ years.  GM works extremely hard, but makes it look effortless to most and was very nice rest of staff also very on point.  Place has a warm atmosphere versus some of the upscale dining in city leaves has left me feeling less than welcome. I'll be back. At the end of my second dinner at Stones Throw I thought to myself that this is a wonderful place.  The service is great.  The food is great.  The atmosphere is great.  And the price is great. Roasted carrot soup with crab, vadouvan curry, citrus sections and almonds was perfection in a bowl.   And I could close my eyes and know that it was carrot soup that I was consuming, and that is the test of all vegetable based soups so far as I am concerned. . Roasted root vegetable salad with pear, squash, cauliflower, and banyuls vinegar was as good as anything I have had at Greens or Millennium.  And that is saying a great deal.  Finally, their burger.  First, they allowed me to substitute roasted vegetables for the tater tots.  Thank you for being patron friendly Stones Throw.  And whilst being medium rare the burger had char.  That is hard to do and it made the burger superior.  In fact I liked the burger here better than what I have had at Nopa or Marlowe.  And again, that is saying a lot. Overall, the food served at Stones Throw is comfort food prepared by a chef with real haute chops. Excellent food, attentive service, great ambiance, possibly the best burger in the city. Negatives: no takeout, heavy fare, no full bar. Fantastic!  I'm actually glad that the parking is so horrible here, it makes it more of a neighborhood gem. I can rave about it all but I need to call out the chestnut ravioli. . . It was the most delicious thing I've had since the chestnut soup I had at Francis. . . I guess I have a thing about chestnuts!  Anyway, the menu is inventive without being too prissy and delicate.  The only complaint I would have is that I walked out smelling like the kitchen, but I'd happily risk it. I came here for my birthday dinner, and they made me feel extra special with b day wishes and a birthday card! We had the crab and the beets & burratta for an appetizer, each were perfect sizes for  people to share. Everyone ordered entrees which were large and delicious. Full but not that ""too full"" feeling they don't fill you up with any bread and butter at the beginning which is probably a good thing.  The dessert menu left something to be desired as there was no chocolate option, but maybe that's just me! Entrees we all agreed were a thumbs up: Burger  Truffle Ravioli  Duck  Lamb ChopsI will definitely return! Really good food, but did not like the rushed service.  I'm kicking myself for not saying something to the manager right then and there. To give an example:  Was asked , yes  times in  minutes if we wanted dessert (we clearly hadn't even looked and were still enjoying our bottle of wine).  Waiter was visibly frustrated that he couldn't turn our table and the either GM or owner who was inappropriately working front of the house, was doing the same.  This put a damper on being able to enjoy the different dishes, wine, and desserts we ordered. The wine list is confusing in that it is in groupings, but no explanation of what those groupings are (Example: The header of one of the groups talks about having wine that will make you feel better after getting off of a dirty city bus. . . not very helpful in terms of flavor profile).  Upon asking the waiter for wine recommendations, he picked  of the most expensive (hello. . . you are upselling) and then gasped when I picked something else.  Dessert menu is the same.  No explanation of what the desserts actually are. Very young, energetic crowd and while the space is better than Luella, it still leaves something to be desired.  Quick overview:Ordered potato puffs, squid ink pasta, duck breast entree, peanut butter and jelly beignets, and their ""cheese course"" which was a comte crepe.  The crepe was the only thing that was not good (and I love cheese).  Everything else was delicious, but could have been hotter. Extensive beer and wine list.  Good luck sifting through the wine list on your own (and try not to get our waiter if you want any help at all). My dinner date and I had  different ""wine cocktails"" (made with sherry, vermouth, and homemade Pimm's), they were good, but real cocktails would have been better. Overall, won't go back due to the unsophisticated service and inability to enjoy the experience. Unfortunate, because the food is really good.  To put things into perspective, went to The Cavalier last week and spent more time there, but had amazing service despite the place being packed.  The comparison made Stones Throw feel less about what dining out should be about: relishing in flavors and enjoying your company. Sad. What a delicious meal! I never want to repeat restaurants but I would for this place! Must eat Good food but nothing special that would draw me back.  Just feels like another one of the newish SF restaurants sprouting everywhere.  Menu is sparse.  Beer menu extensive.  No cocktails which is a big downside.  Decor is lacking.  Thought the tater tots and duck pate were highlights. Fat Angel is a go to spot, so I was supercharged to give Stone's Throw a try.  Other than a bit of lag at the waiting stage, it was fully delightful.  Staff is fun, enthusiastic, knowledgeable.  Food made me googly eyed.  Potato puff egg things, beets, octopus:  all are tickets to Yum City!  And the final stop on the trip, dessert, was clever and cool.  Donuts (more like beignets) were m m good.  Buying a return ticket ASAP. Made reservations for dinner here before a show.  Gave ourselves .  hours but told our waitress that we need to be out the door by :.  She made it happen.  We were never rushed, even had time for sharing desserts and the evening was very enjoyable.  Our dinner was a great experience and am looking forward to coming back!Here's what we had:Appetizers roasted beets, burrata with  small crispy flatbread:  delish grilled octopus:  was very delicious.  Had a bite and wished I order this and not the salad. duck pate with pretzel bread:  didn't try it but everyone else loved it roasted root veggie salad:  it was only okay.  some roots were not roasted enough and too al dente for me.  not that you would have noticed.  my plate was clean. Mains duck:  heard it was very good lamb:  heard it was very good arctic char:  was great.  Served with crispy skin and farro, leeks, baby carrots. chestnut ravioli:  Star of the show.  It was fabulous!Desserts lemon meringue  must order! PB Jelly donuts  must order!  and eat while it's super hot! oatmeal cream pie  skip itThey have great wine and beer lists. Service was impeccable and loved the ambiance.  Our server has dark curly hair.  She was very professional and helpful with drink recommendations. Thanks Stone's Throw! Pretty good overall. The space needs a little work (at least add some more art to the walls) because it's a little too stark for my taste. Now on to the food:Puffed potato: This starter was not nearly as good as other yelpers said, in my opinion. Lacked flavor. Duck pate: Great dish, and I don't even like pate!Octopus: My friend said it was very good compared to other octopus she's had, not too toughSquid ink pasta: Highlight of the night for me but be aware that it has a slight kick to it, if you don't like spiceArctic char: Cooked perfectly, root vegetables on the side also goodOatmeal cream pie: Boring, not happy with this dish. In addition, while I like the idea of the ""homemade dessert re imagined,"" I would like a better description on the menu. For example, I was about to order the apple pie until the waiter happened to mention that it has a panna cotta texture. If the restaurant continues to change the menu with the seasons, I will definitely be back!PS While I like the neighborhood trivia on the menu, there have been unofficial reports that Filbert is in fact not the steepest street in SF. Food was really really good.  My group and I had some really amazing apps.  The Octopus was good but wasn't impressing.  It was tender but it lacked something else.  The Peanut and Butter donuts was absolutely fantastic.  Something so simple but genius.  Pig Ear and belly, great.  For some reason the vibe reminded me of the Momofuku's in NYC.  Would definitely come back for dinner. The highlights were the stuffed potato eggs & grilled octopus (so tender!). The pork belly and the da burga were also delicious but the burger and the tater tots were a bit too salty eaten together. Everything was perfectly cooked. Service was wonderful, our waiter was very knowledgeable and gave us great recommendations from the menu. I really liked the space too! Went here for my birthday. My farro was undercooked. We asked for a coke but the waitress forgot. Also, we had an appetizer that was really under seasoned and not very memorable. On the positive side, the duck was very good and so was the crab salad. Oh, and the octopus. I'll be back soon to try them again. One of the best meal in sf in a while! So glad the restaurant in sf is finally stepping up again. From start to finish not a disappointing dish. Great services, creative dishes, great taste , and good presentation. We ordered:Duck pate . / good flavor, great use of mustard. Nothing I would crave, so the end. Potato puffery egg . / taste a bit like Chinese dim sum. A mix between turnip cake, taro puff, and dry shrimp bites. Yum!Pig ear& pork belly . / I mean it's pork belly. Squid ink paste . / good portion of seafood. A tad salty for me but everyone loved it. Another must dish. Hazelnut ravioli . / hazelnut never tasted so good. Just do it. Duck . / duck breast was good but the thigh was amazing. I had an moment. For that one piece alone I would order again with no hesitation. Crepe . / for someone who doesn't care for cheese, I was sold. Apple pie . / a creative version of deconstructed apple pie. when every component of the dish is in your mouth, it becomes true my reminds you of your childhood( wait, I'm from hong kong, we don't do American apple pies there. . . )We already made  more reservations over the next  months. With new restaurant popping up every week in sf, this is a bold statement. Loved it.  Had the Beets starter and the Duck Pate (with Yummy Pretzel Rolls).  Followed by the every healthy Da Burga. . . really delicious.  Finished with the Lemon Meringue. . . which was fantastic.  Terrific atmosphere. . . really great, energetic staff with excellent wine selection. I am a yelper that only yelps when I have a great experience, and so I did at Stones Throw! The friendly vibe is my favorite part about this spot. Drinks and food are both top notch. Great all around! I had a reservation here with a friend for :pm. When we arrived the place was packed and we waited for about  minutes past our reservation time. Luckily the manager, sensing that this situation could irritate potential customers, brought us out some complimentary champagne to make the wait go by faster. My friend and I shared a few items and enjoyed a bottle of wine. The service was friendly and prompt and as some other reviews stated the burger is very very good. My friend and I concluded at the end of our meal that anything and everything at Stones Throw that contains potato is a hit. . . A dash of Michael Mina plus a pinch from Fat Angel, and you get one of the hottest new restaurants in San Francisco.  I definitely started my first Friday of  right with a dinner at this spot. First things first: you're in Russian Hill, and you know parking will be horrendous.  Stones Throw is situated on a cable car line, but if you're feeling fancy or running late, an Uber ride will also get % off your bill. The menu did not disappoint.  I arrived a bit late to share a final piece of a crunchy, crispy, and spicy chicharrone.  YOU MUST ORDER THIS  absolute flavor explosion. The table had the puffed potato and eggs, pork belly and crispy pig's ear, and grilled octopus to share.  I especially enjoyed the puffed potato and eggs, as it take delicate skills to make a perfect runny yolk enveloped in the puff.  I hope this isn't one of the seasonal items and stays on the menu ALL THE TIME. I couldn't decide what to get for my main course, so I went with the pate and the pasta (diet will start. . . sometime in ?).  The pate came out looking gorgeous, almost dessert like in terms of color and presentation.  The flavor combination with the soft mustard pretzel was a match made in foodie heaven. I saved the best for last.  The squid ink conchiglie pasta was cooked al dente, and mixed with clams and calamari for texture on texture on texture. I know it's only been two months and there may still be kinks to work out  the main one for us being the lag time between courses  but this was all around a fantastic meal.  yelp. com/biz_photos/ston…Total damage for five: $ This place is terrific.  Food is unusual but not bizarre for its own sake.  Service was excellent. We shared several appetizers and each one was great. We've already made plans to return. We had a great time. The service was good and the food excellent. I loved that they will pair wine or beer with your food. And they have selection of interesting beers available. I'd really give this place .  stars. . . pasta was great, duck very good, a couple of the appetizers were just OK. This place feels like it's always been in the neighborhood fold. A warm welcome with genuine smiles from the professional staff. Decor isn't over done like so many hip Spots on the revolving door of Valencia St. This place isn't a four barrel taxidermy knock off wanna be salvaged wood over priced SF fortnight foodie venture. Serious talent and passion for imaginative and perfectly executed dishes. Spotless service from folks who could be your neighbor and treat you as if you are :) I was really impressed! Everyone must try this place before it's too crazy busy. Order the octopus, potato yolk thingys, the pate, fuck it order everything! i am % thoroughly pleased with my experience at Stones Throw and have been raving the shit out of the this place since i went! for starters i did a super asshole move and came in with Peet's tea. my tea was still blazing hot and i'm at the beginning stages of sickness so i didn't want to toss it yet. most restaurants understandably frown on outside food or drinks but twice someone asked if i wanted my tea refilled with hot water. and it didn't seem like they were saying it in a snide condescending way either, they seemed to genuinely just want me to have hot tea. the service otherwise was excellent. each person that i encountered from the host to anybody who approached my table seemed to be sincere, enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the food. my server checked up on me quite a bit to make sure i was enjoying myself and offered her opinions as well. i had a clear view of the kitchen and could see that everybody was working hard and remained quite silent for the most part. this tells me that the team indeed works as an actual in sync TEAM with the understanding of each persons role and time constraints. i could tell they were operating like a well oiled machine. i treated myself (birthday dinner!) to an indulging meal of four small courses which ended up being five because the kitchen sent out their soup just to be nice. maybe it's because i was by myself or maybe it's because i had my DSLR with me, clearly taking photos of their food (could they have mistaken me for an actual somebody? don't think so but one can dream. haha), but i (of course) welcomed the extra dish. puffed potato and eggs/cauliflower mousse/chives/crispy chicken skin holy hell! the gnocchi like potato was thin and light. you slice into the puff and out pours the lusciously divine egg yolk. eaten with bits of crisp chicken skin and creamy cauliflower mousse, this was what dreams are made of. sunchoke soup confit egg/green apple/black walnuts a single egg yolk is presented accompanied by finely diced apple and walnuts. poured tableside is the earthy smooth sunchoke soup. a very nice soup. at this point i'd eaten the equivalent of five yolks which is a whole hell of a lot. . . whew. squid ink conchieglie pasta spicy capers/clams/calamari/tender greens. oh my god i could eat this for days. the pasta was perfectly cooked and had a nice texture to it without lacking bite. the sauce was super buttery and full of flavor and the seafood was just right. so so SO SO SO very good. pork belly and crispy pig's ears avocado/citrus/Moresque spice/kale. soft, tender, rich pork belly with creamy avocado and citrus to cut through the fattiness of the dish. the pig's ears gave it some textural balance. one of the better pork belly dishes i've ever had. not your grandma's apple pie which was really a maple panna cotta with apple granita and a paper thin rolled cookie topped with a maple sauce and finely sliced and decorative apples. this dish was super light and very balanced. it wasn't too sweet and had all the right flavors of your favorite apple pie. i die! such a good meal! i was so very impressed by every aspect of this restaurant that i gave my server a % tip for all of it's awesomeness. Excellent.  Superb food, service and drinks at a killer price point.  God knows Ive spent way more for way less at some of San Francisco's more ""exclusive"" spots.  We'll be back for sure. Stones Throw had some big shoes to fill replacing Luella. . . props to them for a successful initial execution! We had a great meal here last night  inclusive of good food, great wine, and a fun ambiance. Here's what happened: Salt roasted beets   stars, I had to search for the beets and burrata. . .  Potato puffs  as delicious tasting as they are sounding (and on the house, such a treat!) squid ink pasta  delicious and a perfectly sized app arctic char  could use some improvement, a little salty but added a nice light option to the menu My fellow diners tried the burger, chestnut ravioli, and duck, and all gave good reports Apple pie and beignets, both great, fun to look at and eat! I was pleased with my first visit here, and I'm hoping they expand the menu a bit, in which case, I'll be making a return visit.  Also, props to management for hiring and training the outstanding staff (special shout out to the sweet hostess on duty last night, she was the best!) Following a friends recommendation we dined at Stone's Throw last night. The menu upon first glance seemed eclectic and small but boy oh boy, the dishes were incredible. We started with Duck Pate, puffed potato and eggs and crispy pork chicharrones. The Pate came with little pretzel buns and was amazing, the chicharrones were ok but the star of the starters were the puffed potatoes. We ordered a second round  do not skip them!Then we continued to share Squid Ink Pasta, Octopus and pork belly and crispy pig's ears. All three were outstanding. The octopus was so tender and delicious and the pork belly rich and delightful and the crispy pigs ears like very fine french fries. We also ordered the Duck as an entree as well as the Rib eye and the Ravioli. The Duck melted on your mouth, the rib eye was incredibly tender and flagrant and although the ravioli were the least memorable dish of the selection it was good fare. For dessert: oatmeal cream pie and the most amazing (not your mothers) apple pie ever. I will be back. Perfectly executed from start to finish.  Tables are well spaced, decor is minimalist, attentive staff, great cocktails, wide wine assortment, and the FOOD is wow. We had SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA ($), CRISPY  NORTH DUCK BREAST ($), GARLIC THYME ROASTED BEEF RIB EYE ($), and GRANDMA'S APPLE PIE. . . . BUT NOT QUITE ($).  Each dish was perfect!Only downside, prices are a bit steep for the portion size.  However, I suppose quality costs $.  Highly recommend, will frequent Stones Throw. We brought some good friends, visiting from out of town, for brunch a few weeks ago. (Are they still doing brunch? I hope so!) The menu seemed a bit odd at first  short and desultory, which is very weird in SF, where short menus tend to be ""themed""  but now that I've tried the food I LOVE the menu! It's almost as it they were thinking ""let's say  friends with totally different hankerings each wanted the best brunch ever"" and built the menu from there!The burger was phenomenal (our friend said it was the best burger he's ever had) and (I never eat pancakes but) my friend's pancakes were huge enough fur us all to nibble on and insanely good. Love the creativity of duck confit hash! Love that this is a few blocks' walk from us!Will definitely take guests here and come on dates! No one could say the food here is not phenomenal. Every dish is a treat, from the creamy duck pate with mini pretzel rolls to the deliciously tender octopus. But the portions are tiny. The service is mediocre. And the decor feels half finished somehow. We got off to a shaky start: We set a reservation for :pm, arrived at :pm, and were seated around :pm. To pass the time, my friend and I asked our waiter to recommend a wine. He brought out a Chianti; I was dubious, but agreed. And unfortunately it was sweet and light  the complete opposite of dry and full bodied, as I'd described. At that point the manager came by to offer us champagne to apologize for the delay, but we'd ordered our drinks already. Wish he'd come by earlier. . . My friends and I ordered a bunch of dishes to share, to sample a bit of everything.  SALT ROASTED BEETS WITH BURRATA = Came with  crackers (not ideal for our table of ) and some minced beets mixed in with burrata. This was my least favorite dish of the night  a bit sweet for my taste. It was also tiny. $ PUFFED POTATO AND EGGS = Again bite sized, but crazy delicious. Perfectly crispy on the outside, with oozing yolk inside, served on some creamy cauliflower mousse. Wish there were a few more of these! $ DUCK PATE AND MOUSSE = Still dreaming about this. The creamiest, most delectable duck pate ever. Unfortunately, it was served with  (only !) mini pretzel rolls. Our table of  had to slice each of these pretzel rolls in half so we could each get half a bite of bread. Which brings me to my next point: Why skimp on the bread? In fact, why didn't the restaurant start us out with a basket of bread? I just felt a bit . . . deprived at this point, considering the prices we were paying.  $ SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA = One of the star dishes of the night. This is listed as a starter but could easily serve as an entree. The veggies were so tender, the flavor was rich and the pasta was perfectly cooked al dente. $ GRILLED OCTOPUS = Raved about for a reason. As others have said before me, it's the the most tender octopus I've ever had. Mixed in with chorizo, lemon and white beans, it was just perfection. $ CRISPY DUCK = Crackling skin clung to juicy (without being fatty) pieces of duck on top of moist black rice. Really tasty. $ CHESTNUT RAVIOLO = Not as flavorful as I imagined, considering its ingredients (chanterelle mushrooms, roasted brussels sprouts and truffle butter), but still really good. But there were only two pieces of ravioli. $Quite an expensive dinner for very little food. Honestly though, if the environment suited the prices, I wouldn't have minded. The walls were pretty bare (I understand they've only been open for  weeks, so I'll cut them some slack on this one), but the tacky red flooring (reminiscent to my elementary school cafeteria) was unforgivable. There was just nothing special enough about the decor or overall dining experience to justify the bill. I will give Stones Throw the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they just need a few more weeks to get their sh** together. But for the time being, the food is this restaurant's only saving grace. I haven't reviewed in a while, but since Stone's Throw is new and I had such a good time there, I feel like I have to share the love. The food is awesome.  We started with the cauliflower egg puffs, which were different and delicious.  A great snack to whet your appetite.  Then we moved to the duck pate/ mousse snack. I LOVE pate, and this did not disappoint.  It is served with soft pretzel style rolls and cornichons and everything about it is lovely from the taste to the presentation.  The portion is more than fair considering the price and the listing as a ""snack"".  We moved on to apps after this, settling on the pork belly citrus salad and the squid ink pasta.  The pork belly salad had a nice mix of savory meat, citrus, veggies (rainbow kale, how SF) and crispiness the salad was topped with crispy pig's ears.  Now, for me, the showstopper was the pasta.  It was perfection. The pasta itself was delicate and flavorful clearly homemade.  It was topped with pickled kale, shrimp, mussels, and clams and was in a clam sauce and cauliflower mousse.  I can't really describe how much I hearted this dish.  I live in the area and can easily foresee myself having this pasta and a glass of wine solo at the bar.  Like, regularly.  Between these  dishes and the delish bread, we didn't feel like we needed to try an entree. . . so we skipped straight to dessert and shared the pb&j beinets.  I'm not much of a sweets gal, but these were good.  Now, for the service.  It got off to a slightly rocky start we had made reservations weeks prior, but still ended up waiting  minutes for our table to be ready.  We ordered a bottle of wine and hung out at the standing bar table, where there were two other couples who were in the same boat reservations, but no available tables.  Not sure what that was all about.  Also not sure why the other two couples were given snacks as a thank you for waiting thing and we weren't, but whatever.  Maybe they were waiting even longer?  If so, Stone's Throw really needs to step up their reservation game.  So while at the communal table, after the other couples were sat, I spilled a glass of wine.  Super embarrassing.  It was just one of those things where I was talking and not paying attention and just set the glass down wrong.  It wasn't a huge deal the glass was only a third full and didn't break or spill on the floor just on the table.  I apologized profusely, but the waiter gave me some 'tude.  I know, I'm the jerk here, but seriously, not that big of a deal.  When we finally were seated, our waitress was great. . . super friendly and nice, and knowledgeable about the food.  Her recommendations seemed sincere and she actually seemed excited to be there.  I liked that. Overall, the restaurant is a great addition to the neighborhood and I'm excited to go back.  If the reservations snafus are figured out, I'd be happy to increase my stars. First things first.  Parking was TERRIBLE!  We went up a street then down a street, back up again, turned around, took a left, then a right, went back up, came back down, took another left, then a right, stopped, waited, continued on, passed  or  fire hydrants, waited at a stop light, saw a car pull out a driveway, got excited, found out he pulled out of a garage, then got mad, then hungry, then starving until finally maybe  blocks away we found a stall!We walked up a steep hill, crossed the road and two buildings down was. . . . . wait for it. . . . . . STONES THROW!We had a PM reservation.  Checked in and found out they didn't have our res.  It was opening night and just so happened they somehow squeezed us in for a table!  PLUS PLUS PLUS for Stones Throw!On to the food.  Holy COW!  Like who is their chef (s)??  They must have had some kind of culinary experience from like dreaming or something.  There were flavors I think I never tasted before.  Every dish, be it an appetizer, entrée, dessert (cause we ordered pretty much the entire menu) was as we say here from Hawaii ""BROKE DA MOUTH!"" (Something so tasty that you want to eat it all at once)At this point the parking situation we forgot about. The place is clean.  New restaurant.  Go figure.  It's a really small place.  You can hear peoples conversations.  Couldn't help but eavesdrop.  Price is price.  Bring lots of money.  Your gonna need it to have a great night out of town for a nice dinner.  Bring your better half.  Your friends too.  It's that kind of place. Staff was wonderful.  It's a new joint.  They had to be.  But waitress was on time everytime!    To sum it all up.  HmDAMN the DUCK was unreal! I'll begin with a complaint my feet are cold because the experience knocked my socks off. While I may have granted Stones Throw five stars, the galaxy could not contain the number of celestial orbs that this fine establishment deserves. Our dining experience was so extraordinarily exquisite that my tastebuds were unprepared for the sensuous melding of flavors. The cozy comforts of home, an exquisitely chosen wine list complete with insightful and witty writing, and the attention to detail among the skilled staff are some of the many reasons to quench your thirst and satisfy your hunger here. While it may be called Stones Throw, the distance between it and other dining halls is infinite. P. S. Get the squid ink pasta. It rocks. Overall a great experience and I will definitely come back to try more of their menu. Here is how I rate the experience by courses:SNACKS   starsSalted beets + burrata  excellent, interesting presentation where it looks like tartarePotato puffs  BOMB status, GET THISPretzel with duck mousse/pate   stars & BOMB status, GET THISAPP   starsThe crispy pork belly  salad was actually not that amazing. The pork belly was kind of dry; however, everything else in the salad was awesome, especially the fried pork ears. (I heard the octopus was amazing and will get that next time instead)ENTREE  . We all got ""Da Burga"" ( stars) all around the table. First few bites were amazing  really good quality meat, yummy brioche like bread, loaded with cheddar. BUT, it gets a little too rich and a bit much after a while, and this was probably the only burger i didn't finish in life (not due to portion size but due to the heaviness/richness). The twice baked potato tots that came as a side were also a bit rich (and a little salty), and I couldn't finish them either. (Next time I'd want to try the duck or rib eye)DESSERT   starsPB & J donut/beinets  YUM! really goodDef recommend and I look fwd to coming back! Are you kidding me? How the heck is this place a + star average?  Gimme a break. I couldn't figure this place out. First of all, it's as bare boned as it's predecessor, Luella. So don't expect any innovation there. Ambiance wouldn't be such an issue to me if the food shined. But sadly, it's doesn't. The menu looks very nice (keyword = looks!)  elevated New American, maybe?  But ""inspired fare"" this is not. We started with the tater tots (good) and roasted root vegetable salad (very good). Things started going downhill when they served the that tired Raviolo. It's two large raviolis served over vegetables. Maybe it just wasn't my night. The inside of the raviolo looks and tastes like refried beans. I asked the waitress what it was and she told me ""chesnut blended with truffle oil. ""  Oh kay, so where is the truffle?  I couldn't taste a damn thing. But the worst part was that the ravioli was not cooked properly.  It was hard!  Not even al dente!  Had to send it back :(  (And this girl was HONGRY! So that ain't good)Now onto the interesting desserts. What a disaster. I'm sorry  inspired by childhood favorites  and tastes like them too?  EWW!  I'm sorry, but I don't want an oatmeal cake that tastes like Little Debbie cakes from back in the day.  And I don't want a freaking apple pie that is actually a creative panna cotta that is supposed to taste like what?  Apple pie?  Then just give me a really good apple pie!Oh and here's the kicker. . . Dessert menu comes with a paper and pencil for you to write in a favorite dessert you'd like to see on the menu.  My response:  ""How about something fresh?""  My waitress came right back to me with an attitude to explain that everything is fresh  just inspired by childhood faves.  Oh kay.  Coulda fooled me!Two stars is generous. We were so sad to see Luella go, but could't have hoped for a better replacement. It has all the charming neighborhood qualities you'd hope to find around the corner. . . but the food is anything but neighborhoodie. Duck Pate and Mousse is something to write home about. Octopus was exceptionally well prepared. Service was amongst the best we've had in San Francisco. Get in now before it's too late. I'm still basking in the glow of last night's dinner. . . Quick, get your reservation and eat here before the whole city finds out about it!We ordered:Duck Pate and Mousse  What an awesome dish to start with. Octopus  WINNER! This one was the BEST. We couldn't stop ym ing. Duck So tasty. My second favorite. Raviolo The most savory and flavorful of them all. Roasted beef ribeye  I'm sure if it didn't have to compete with all of the above it would have been really good. Drinks: Great wine and beer menu (no cocktails)Overall  great great food. Ambience was just right  not too loud, not uptight. Good service. My friends and I all agreed we would all come back again for sure. Best meal I've had in a long time! Fantastic neighborhood restaurant. Loved every thing we ate. Everyone was very friendly. Can't wait to go back!!  Pâté  amazing! Squid ink pasta was divine! Best duck I've ever had! Will definitely return.  Stone's Throw is a great replacement for Luella. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. PUFFED POTATO & EGGS ( stars. these were delicious. We almost placed a nd order they were able to make them without chicken skin for the vegetarian in our group)DUCK PÂTÉ & MOUSSE ( stars. Great for anyone who loves foie gras terrine. it's the best imitation.  Pretzels  GREAT call)GRILLED OCTOPUS ( stars. BEST. we've. ever. had. We never thought grilled octopus could be so tender)GARLIC THYME ROASTED BEEF RIB EYE ( stars  the guys got these. they both thought it was good. probably not best they've ever had)CHESTNUT RAVIOLO (.  stars. GREAT vegetarian option)SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA ( stars. even though it's a starter, I got this for my entree and it was delicious and definitely filling enough for an entree. WIne lists surprisingly not out of $ range. Had a $ bottle of syrah and two half bottles of sparkling rose for only $ each. We also brought a bottle of our own wine! Score on getting reservations on Friday for a Saturday night!  I came with a few of my best gf's and we were all pleasantly surprised.  I really liked the Salt Roasted Beets, Crab Salad, Squid Ink Pasta, and Raviolo.  The burger was good but nothing memorable.  Just ok  Duck Pate, Pork Belly SaladI'd pass on the Puffed Potato snack.  It's a nice open space, service was great and prices are average.  Parking is tough in this neighborhood so plan on going early! Stones throw was a great meal!  For starters, the pork belly dish was divine!  It wasn't really a salad, nonetheless it was delicious and had a great flavor contrast.  We also had the octopus as a starter and it was cooked to perfection! For dinner, we had the chestnut ravioli and duck.  Both were unique and full of flavor. Lastly, I really liked how they had their wine lost organized. It was easy to read and creatively put together. Lovely neighborhood restaurant ! Parking can be tricky, Uber is a good alternative. Service was excellent and food was very good. Beets. good but just a bit under seasonedCrab Salad,outstandingSunchoke soup, greatRoot vegetable salad, good but would have been better without the pear in itKing Salmon (in December ?I but they said it was fresh , tasty but a tad overdone. (Maybe it was frozen ?) But nonetheless it was good. but not excellent. Lemon meringue pie, very tasty. Wines by the glass were decent except for the French Peillot, either open too long or just plain not good. Overall it was a very pleasant dining experience . Also considering they have been open for less than a month. Sure it will get even better in the future. The service was great.  Most of the food was delicious. This is a very nice  neighborhood restaurant.  The sauces stood out with wonderful flavors and interesting combinations, but some of the basics were just okay.  Stellar:the hamburger (not so impressed with the tater tots)the sunchoke soupthe lemon meringue pieOver all quality of serviceMedium:steaksalmonroot saladInadequate:Debbie's oatmeal cakeThey do not serve bread with the meal even if you ask for bread. Wine recommendations are over priced considering the knowledge of the servers about the wine they are selling +stars!! Amazing addition to the Russian Hill neighborhood. Great menu selections in addition to an extensive beer menu and wine. Chestnut raviollo was a favorite! Not to forget, a very hospitable crew! Must visit!! Yes Please!I went to Stones Throw last night and it was a great experience. For those who are looking for the quick recommendations  here were my favs: Duck Pate  Perfect in every way. Loved the warm pretzels! Squid Ink Pasta  if you like seafood, order this. Has a perfect kick.  Pork Belly Salad  NOMZ! Perfectly cooked Pork Belly  Any dessert  they're all deconstructed and fab. The longer review. Showed up a few minutes before my pm reservation. The host gave us a 'proactive apology' that there would be a delay as they were very busy along with  glasses of Champange. Ended up sitting down around : and staying until  or so. I admit that we went a bit overboard with ordering but wanted to try everything!Aside from the four items I wrote about above, we also tried. . .  Puffed Potato and Eggs: Good but not INCREDIBLE Dungeness Crab Salad: Again, this was good but I probably wouldn't order again. It was a bit over seasoned in my opinion and I was hoping for pure Crab especially since it's crab season in SF! Raviolo: I had never had a Raviolo, i. e. a giant Ravioli but this was worth trying. Very rich and hearty and something that I'd recommend sharing only because it's so heavy.  Salmon: YUM! big fan  good mix of flavors.  Da Burga: The potato tots are GREAT  yum!I look forward to heading back in  weeks :) We had  dishes,  were great,  was okay. We had an : reservation and unfortunately the table we were waiting for took their sweet time paying their bill.  The mgmt  provided us with a complementary glass of cava while we waited and we were greeted with dish #, also on the house, as an apology for the wait. Dish #: stuffed tater tots.   stars.  kettle chip crust filled with whipped potatoes with bits of bacon, chives, some other stuff that was delicious. Dish #: Grilled Octopus.   stars.  Perfect char on the octopus, chorizo really worked well with the octopus.  Very flavorful and interesting.  Second best dish of the night. Dish #:   Puffed Potatoes and Eggs.  Was savory, but that's about it.  Flavor was okay, but no wow factor.  Not really noteworthy.  Dish #:  Pork belly salad.  First small bite of the belly I had was okay.  Second bite, I loaded up my fork with all the ingredients on the plate and it really shined.  The avo, belly, citrus and kale came together in a flavor and texture symphony.   Third best dish of the night. Dish #:  SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA.  Spectacular.  Flavor was amazing.  Pasta was perfectly cooked.  Best seafood pasta dish I have ever had easily.  Must order.  Best dish of the night. Service was good and the host/GM did a great job of turning our wait, which could have been a negative, into a positive. *.  stars*I really feel that I need to stop saying this with each new restaurant that I try because each time I say it, it lowers my credibility, but for some reason, it keeps being true: this is my favorite new restaurant in SF. These new restaurants have been KILLING it in San Francisco recently and there hasn't been a more exciting time to be trying new places in the city. Stones Throw is just the most recent addition to this list and, for the most part, it stands triumphant. The decor is ultra minimal (feels like an art gallery without the art), the atmosphere is intimate yet lively, and the service is INCREDIBLE. Perhaps it's just the honeymoon stages of a new restaurant (before exhaustion and tenure lead to jaded indifference), but every employee that we came into contact with was cheerful, friendly, and absolutely on point. Even the busboys were chatting up a storm with us, asking us our favorite dishes thus far and adding in their recommendations. I'll call out our server, Dave L, specifically, because he was awesome  our wine and water glasses were always filled; his food descriptions were excellent; and he was honest with us about a couple of dishes to avoid for the night (which I always appreciate). FOOD:Puffed Potato & Egg = GREAT. Nice crisp, delicious subtle flavor. Duck Pate w/ Pretzel = GREAT. Smooth and creamy pate, nice salty touch from the pretzel. Squid Ink Pasta = EXCELLENT. Never had squid ink pasta shells (it's usually in spaghetti or paella form), but this is amazing for squid ink lovers. Grilled Octopus = GOOD. Good flavor but wasn't grilled enough. I prefer the grilled octopus at Mason Pacific. Pork Belly Salad = EXCELLENT. Perfectly cooked crispy pork belly with a nice sweet kick from the pickled onions. ""Da Burga"" with Loaded Tater Tots = EXCELLENT. Love the oily brioche bun; the meat was a juicy and perfectly cooked medium rare; and the loaded tater tots were addicting as hell. Grilled Rib Eye = OKAY. This was the one truly disappointing dish of the night  the rib eye wasn't very tender and the flavors were actually pretty boring. I wish I had listened to my gut and went with the duck that everyone raves about. DESSERTS:I was on the fence with the desserts because even though I understand and appreciate their idea of adding a fancy twist to old childhood favorites, some of them just didn't really work. In particular, the ""Not Your Grandma's Apple Pie"" is a complete deconstruction and then molecular gastronomic reconstruction of ""apple pie""  so instead of a warm, crumbly apple pie, it's a cold apple flavored pot de creme with a crispy wafer roll. It wasn't that the flavors weren't good (they were), but it's just not what I was expecting and I think the dessert is done a disservice by being compared to an apple pie. The PB&J donuts were good, but the donuts weren't airy enough. The Oatmeal Cream Pie didn't really stick out as memorable either  it just tasted like an overly sweet. . . well yeah. . . Oatmeal Cream Pie. Stones Throw has the potential to be one of the best American Contemporary restaurants in SF. It has the talent, the service, the menu, and actually quite reasonable prices. If it weren't for the Rib Eye and the strangely uninspired desserts, I would've easily given this place a resounding  stars. I'll definitely be back though, and I'm pretty confident that once it gets it's gears going, Stones Throw is going to be among the very top of the SF restaurant food chain. I am not sure what the raves are about. . .  We gave it a try bc it has .  stars here and it's a new place.  We came with very low expectation and it was worse than what we expected. . . The puff potato and eggs were NOT what it was described: light, rich, fluffy, crispy.  They were exactly the opposite:  heavy, bland, doughy, chewy on the outside. The pate and mousse was too dense to be pate and mousse.  The mini pretzel buns were a little tough.  The pork belly salad was a rip off. . .  it's boring.  The pork belly pieces were cooked well but it was not exciting!  Three little pieces of pork belly and  leaves of veggies,  citrus supremes,  small avocado wedges, a small dollop of dressing and a few slivers of pigs ear for like $ or $!We were told the octopus was the best and most tender bc it was sous vide then grill with great char. . . .  It was sous vide for too long in too high of the temperature that the octopus was completely broken down to mush and ""stringy""!!  Our server was super nice and tried real hard.  She said the octopus was super tender and cuts like butter!  I was like no kidding it cuts like butter, it was it's way over down to mush!  Maybe I will return in  months if i was in the area and try it again but this place is nothing like what everyone says it is.  We didn't expected we will be wow'd by the meal but we were very very disappointed and went somewhere else instead to finish our dinner. Excellent food, even better service. Must orders: Beets appetizer, grilled octopus appetizer, filet entreeJust ok: root vegetable salad appetizer, crab salad appetizer, salmon entreeI would give this place five stars, but the decor is really drab, especially the floors. I will say that the service is absolutely outstanding  we had a great waitress and the rest of the staff were very friendly and attentive. We went here the first week it opened and I couldn't be more pleased to have them in my neighborhood!  Oodles of yummy small plates and the burger was amazing.  It's a tiny bit cold but have a glass of wine and everything's good. Amazing meal. . . seriously, everything we ordered was outstanding. Service was excellent too. We started with the squid ink conchiglie pasta and the grilled octopus. I'm a sucker for squid ink anything and this did not disappoint. Hubby and I fought for the very last bits. We almost always try the octopus if it's on a menu and this one was superb. There was a tiny morsel left on the plate and Hubby protectively hovered his hand over it when the server asked if she could take it away. He had the duck and I had the salmon as entrees. It took me  minutes more to finish my entree because I was savoring each piece of farro hoping it would last longer. Finished with the deconstructed apple ""pie"" and some grappa. Highly recommend (if you can get in!). Can't wait to come back. Luella location is now called Stones Throw and is seriously good food. Mucho Michael Mina influences with former chef Jason Halverson plus others from Fat Angel. Pork Belly salad, Duck breast and stuffed Raviola were our choices. Pleasing wine list with several by the glass. Brunch will be coming soon and the bar area will expand so more dine at the bar seating. Dined at the bar with excellent service and advice on the menu.  Selection seemed light but everything is highly recommended.  Ambiance a bit rustic but works for this neighborhood.  Parking is challenging, take Uber or cab. The food. . . . what can I say?  I don't typically order pate but theirs is rich and creamy and sinfully delicious. The puff potato and eggs were something I want to consume every day of my life.  Pork belly salad = life changing. Raviolo . . . . Epic. And THEN let's discuss the oatmeal cream pie: Totally my new favorite dessert in SF.  Love it. Our server really made us feel like we were having a meal experience and why the food was prepared and plated the way it was as if we were part of the process.  Fantastic wine and beer list.  They really hit it out of the park from day one!  Can't wait to return. I was so excited to try this place and we ended up having a great time.  The service was good and our server was super friendly. The sunchoke soup with the confit egg was super tasty as was the pate (my favorite appetizer!).  I got the rib eye, which was perfectly cooked, and my hubby got the raviolo which he really liked.  It had tons of flavor and was pretty filling. The apple pie dessert is amazing, but warning  it's not hot!  The icy apple makes it interesting but part of me wishes there was some warm apple to make it really satisfying on a cold winter night!  The flaky ""pie crust"" was SO GOOD.  Overall, yummy!! This place is AMAZING! You must try if you have not yet been there. I live in this neighborhood and it is full of people everyday! Make a reservation if you are going. Everyone is friendly and the food is so so so yummy!! For this price, it is very high value and I will definitly go back frequently. Here are my favorite:Snack. . . DUCK PÂTÉ & MOUSSE Starter. . . SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA Main. . . CRISPY  NORTH DUCK BREAST Dessert. . . APPLE PIEStone Throw begins to serve Sundy Brunch too. I heard it is good! It is on my schedule for this Sunday. . . . :) I can say, AMAZING. The food, people, plating, space. Just beautiful. Amazing food! Love the food, good service! Must go there! They get a lot of drinks too! Owner Cyrick is very nice! They also have a bar call fat angel at Fillmore! I love that place too! We were so excited to try Stones Throw, and we knew it would not disappoint thanks to former Michael Mina sous chef chef Jason Halverson! Even on a Tuesday night, Stones Throw was packed and continued to stay packed until we left .  hrs later! The restaurant is beautifully designed and felt warm and homey. We were promptly seated after we arrived. Every single person who works at Stones Throw is polite, courteous, knowledgable, helpful, and happy! I love this, because I feel that it translates directly into the experience you have. The service is impeccable! My twin sister and I enjoyed every minute of our dining experience. As for the food, WOW. I am still having daydreams about the duck and grilled octopus. And my sister's beef ribeye was phenomenal. We also tried the duck pate, dungeness crab salad, puffed potato and eggs, and the sunchoke soup. Everything was delicious and extremely pleasing to the eye thanks to Jason's signature plating. It's hard to describe how good something tastes in a review; you'll just have to come and try for yourself :). Unfortunately, we did not have room for dessert, but we will definitely be back for the deconstructed Apple Pie that I keep hearing so many good things about! They even ask you for a childhood favorite to potentially add to the changing dessert menu! As for attire, I think casual trendy is the way to go! And as for parking, I would not try to park in the neighborhood, as it is extremely difficult to find a spot. I will be back! :) (Congrats Jason!) Just another good addition to the Russian hill where it's all about new resto openings around these days. I got a chance to try their octopus salad, rib eye steak and not your grandma's apple pie last night. Food was delicious, what I liked the most was the garlic, vinegar combination sauce that they poured on steak as the final step at the table. Dessert was definitely named accurately! It was creative and unexpected in a good way. My honest two cent would be, their starter menu is the weakest side and main dishes were not too exciting except the steak."|2|96|2|Routine Inspection| Unclean nonfood contact surfaces Improper food storage

""We want people to walk out and say they got their money's worth. ""I have to give credit where credit is due. The food was excellent. Everything my girlfriend and I tried (puffed potato and egg, chestnut raviolo, PB&J donuts) was excellent, but thats what you expect when you see the restaurant atmosphere and their prices, quality food. My issue is absolutely % with the portions. $ for ONE ravioli. . . . I mean at the very least throw  more on there so I don't feel like I got completely ripped off. We would have been better off getting a few more of the ""snacks"" than one of their main dishes. The only reason we purchased a desert that night was because both my girlfriend and I were still hungry. Absolutely do not come here if you are hungry and looking to leave satisfied. Not unless you can afford to do so, but as a Russian Hill resident paying enough in rent, I don't appreciate paying $ for a plate of food that I can't even remotely share with anyone else at the table nor can confidently call a ""plate of food"". Beers on tap are good and the bottles are great as well. Like I said, don't make the mistake in walking in here hungry. You'll leave angry and feeling used. We went to the ""friends and neighbors"" opening last week and it was great. Wine was flowing freely, small bites to go along with the wine, staff was super accommodating and nice, introduced themselves  all in all, a terrific first impression. We decided to go back to check it out ""for real"". Hated everything about the dinner service tonight, from the android like bartender, to the humorless host, to the rib eye cooked grey on the outside and bloody on the inside, to the bill: $ per person?! I don't think so, guys. . . My friend ordered the beet appetizer and her plate looked like a Picasso  is this the eye? Where's the nose? it was a GREAT soft opening, I totally agree. They didn't show any of that warmth or welcoming tonight. We got there at :. First ones there asking for a spot for two. The host was cautious about offering us even the bar. Which is fine for me and Anne as we usually love chatting up the bar folk. Managers and Supervisors of some sort were hovering around staff making EVERYONE uncomfortable. My friend's appetizer promising ""burratta"" had less than  tsp on the plate (said plate measuring about  inches in diameter) for $. And why not try to schmooze with people who actually choose you in your first two weeks of opening? The coldness was rampant except for the one gal with the glasses who we all liked the night of the soft opening. I won't be rushing back. Miss Luella. Period. *  *         Stones Throw, a modern Californian & American restaurant and bar in Russian Hill neighborhood, in the former Luella space. It's less than  seats spot with about  seats at the nice wooden bar, warm, and inviting. Stones Throw team is a mix of industry veterans from Michael Mina (chef Jason Halverson, GM Ryan Cole, andTai Ricci) and beverage from Fat Angel team, all coming together to open this beautiful spot, serving stylist food of fine dining restaurants but with a casual and comfort scene.        We come in because of chef Jason Halverson, knowing him since his day as Chef de Cuisine at Michael Mina SF and Bourbon Steakhouse SF, so glad to see where he's at now, very well deserved.       The wine list is about  by the bottle and about  be the glass, very reasonable price point, we ordered a bottle of Sancerre for $, quite nice. The cocktails list is pretty good but we didn't get to try this time, we have to come back soon for it. ONLY $ each, UNBELIEVABLE PRICE, food can't be this good and this low price!

Congrats chef and Stones Throw for a job well done. Love it! I like to scan Yelp for the new restaurant openings and I'm so glad I caught this fresh new spot in its first week. For a spot so new, you expect that some of the operations are still being perfected but everything about the food and service was spot on.

I predict this restaurant will be hard to get into unless you've made a reservation a few weeks in advance. Wanted to introduce my BF to my old neighborhood, so the opening of a new restaurant in the much missed I Fratelli/less missed Luella space was a good excuse. He (Phil S) already reviewed last night's dinner, so I will just add that given the crowded, th night trial, I think this could be great.  A bit more confidence with seasoning; more wines by the glass to match the extensive beer list; and maybe a bit of sound absorbing cloth (curtains? wall hangings? anything to muffle the roar). . . we're not the target demographic, but I hate saying ""what"" ten times during a meal. A very nice restaurant. Had a heck of a time parking (!) but the hostess held the table. Very friendly staff.  Had the roasted beet salad, grilled octopus, puffed potato, and rib eye. Nicely prepared and presented, steak was great. The potatoes could have used some depth of flavor but were a kick anyway.  An enjoyably  eclectic beer list, and a couple of good deserts.  Aside from the high level of noise, this is a success. Will go again. Suggest taking a cab! Stones Throw is such an amazing addition to Hyde Street and SF restaurants in general. Everything we tried was so delicious and the attention to detail was spectacular. They remodeled the old space and it has a very nice clean/modern yet comfortable and approachable feel to it. FOOD:Duck Pate and Mousse  So delicious! It had a nice twist of mustard in it and served with two small soft pretzels. Very interesting and good. Sunchoke Soup: Very good! It came served with chopped up nuts and crisp apples with a farm fresh egg yolk in the bowl. The server then poured the soup over that to keep it nice and crunchy. The egg gave it a nice creamy texture. Duck: My friend ordered the duck. It was so juicy and good and I'm not even a duck fan usually. It wasn't too rich or fatty. Chestnut Raviolo: One big giant ravioli filled with goodness. It had some really great roasted root vegetables around it and some nice slices of parmesan around the plate. All of the food was impeccably served and had interesting and unique flavors in everything. SERVICE:Everybody from the hostess to every server who came to our table were very friendly, knowledgeable, and fun to talk to. You would think they have been open for several months like a well oiled machine. Loved the menu and the descriptions of the wine. Even gave a nod to the dirty Geary  bus which is hilarious for us locals. Very nice well rounded wine menu. The dessert menu were all a play on childhood favorite desserts. We were too full to try any. The only very minor detail I would like to see there are some candles on the tables. It lacked a bit of warmth from the overall lighting of the restaurant. Can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu!! Well done Stones Throw! Stopped by on their second night and had a grand time. The space is nice and friendly, great big floral arrangement in the center and panels on the walls that deaden the sound (how nice to be able to actually hear and have a conversation). The tables were full when we got there but we were immediately seated right at the bar seats by the window so we could people watch! Dinner and a show. Service was fantastic and attentive; everyone was really knowledgeable and friendly and it really felt like a neighborhood spot. Food was great: egg appetizer, roasted vegetables and pear salad, duck for the main course, and the standout entree raviolo (big, singular ravioli). Would highly recommend, glad we stopped by. Had the pleasure of trying Stones Throw, and be the first at their grand opening last night before all the industry professionals join in at the crowded bar.  Despite the love and loyalty I've had w/ Ben, Leila and the old Luella crew, I managed to go in w/ an open mind. After a round of Pimm's cocktail  my favorite w/ ginger beer, we decided to sample their snacks & starters from the seasonal menu and leave room for desserts.  We had SALT ROASTED BEETS and DUNGENESS CRAB SALAD as snacks, and mistakenly thought the beets were compliments from the chef since it was not quite a snack order portion w/ tiny bits of beets to warrant a $ price tag, guess I was wrong.   Unfortunately the dungeness crab salad came loaded w/ salt (and I'm a salt freak!), but I was more distracted by the shells I found in the crab salad.  It's a pet peeve of mine when I dine out thinking I would pay premium to leave the work for the pros so I can enjoy my favorite crab shell free, guess not.  I have to say the artichoke chips accompaniment were mighty delicious and it's too bad for the shells since they got the portion right!We ventured to have a few starters next.  SQUID INK CONCHIGLIE PASTA, WARM PORK BELLY SALAD and ROASTED ROOT VEGETABLE SALAD.  The pasta was so well made, al dente and satisfying, it was too bad that the clams and calamari were so tiny that left me wanting for more of the seafood.  The pork belly could be a little crispier to contrast w/ the tender juiciness inside, but the pairings of the citrus and avocado really lighten things up and cut down on the fattiness for a perfectly executed salad.  My friend's roasted root vegetable salad came w/ such a generous selection of root veggies and pear, it was a feast for the eyes. I was eyeing our neighbor's PEANUT BUTTER & JELLY DONUTS, but decided to go w/ GRANDMA'S APPLE PIE. . . . BUT NOT QUITE and LEMON MERINGUE PIE.  Let me just say if you left Stones Throw without trying their version of a deliciously deconstructed apple pie, you'll need to turn right back around and order that alone!  It's absolutely brilliant. . . I won't spoil the surpirse for you but you'll thank me for it :)  Lemon meringue was so light and not overwhelmingly 'lemony' but I'll still come right back to their apple pie!All and all, the old Mina crew didn't disappoint on taste.  With such a solid team in place, I can see Stones Throw will quickly establish themselves as the neighborhood gem that their predecessor once was and cherished by all. I was honored and lucky enough to be there for their soft opening.  I was with a friend so we shared some dishes. First off we got the avocado chip, which was fried artichoke with some kind of fresh crab mixture. Very very good, not overpowering at all. We also got the duck pate/mousse with pretzel bed. Definitely the best dish of the nice.  The mustard seed was a nice touch and brought a bit of brightness to my palette. We then go the pork belly salad, which included oranges, two kinds of leaf lettuce, fried pork rind and something else, but all in all, it was delicious. Our entrees was their burger, which was juicy and delicious.  Also their mushroom ravioli was quite pleasant, with some sort of soft cheese spread i think, and finished off with truffle butter. For dessert we had an oatmeal cookie with grape/raisin spread.  Very good, not dry at all. And also we had quince  ways  picked, layed with a strong and delicious cheese and a sauce, like apple sauce but not as sweet. There was also a wide selection of wine and beer, but alas i don't drink so I can't comment."|2|79|6|Routine| Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 11/22/2013 ] Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils  [ date violation corrected: 11/22/2013 ] Inadequately cleaned or sanitized food contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 11/22/2013 ] High risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 11/22/2013 ] Improper food storage  [ date violation corrected: 11/22/2013 ] Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities  [ date violation corrected: 11/22/2013 ]
Wako Japanese Restaurant 0|4.5|Japanese in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|89|0|4.59459459459|" Eating at Wako is like finding that extra $ (or in my case $) bill in your jeans   totally unexpected and extremely fulfilling. I needed a new restaurant to take my girlfriend (who demands/deserves only excellent fish) on an overdue date night. This was the perfect spot to seal that deal. Made reservations the day before and got the first seats for the night at pm. Shortly thereafter a nice elderly Japanese couple came in without reservations and was able to get a seat next to us (in case you're thinking of living life on the edge and trying to get a table for dinner on a Friday night without a reservation). One word: OMAKASE. If you are a die hard Japanese cuisine fan such as my girlfriend and myself, you won't be disappointed. We decided to forgo our usual ""inner fat girl selves"" and go with the minimum  course option along with sake & beer. Surprisingly enough  it was was more than enough to fill us without feeling that comatic state after walking out the restaurant The two small plates that introduce you to the meal are . . . just that  small. However, you quickly forget the disappointment you feel from your first course when the grilled butterfish climaxes in your mouth at first bite. From then on, you are on a ecstasy roll through fish heaven with every taste of those  nigiris. They were light, fresh, high quality, and exactly on point with the rice:fish ratio. The nigiris are also prepared with soy paper/sauce and wasabi so you don't have to worry about your fish being drenched while you're crying those tears of sushi happiness. Last, but not least, go for the red miso soup to finish off your meal. It is the real finisher of the meal. And everyone needs to have a good finish right? By the end of the meal, we were so pleased with the service, food, price (very reasonable for the quality!) and atmosphere that we made plans to come again within the next month. We NEVER do that. So do yourself a favor: grab a table at this place before the hipsters, who will eventually take over this place, do. Happy to see these kinds of sushi restaurants popping up over the city. I was skeptical but it was actually quite good for the bay area. I don't think I saw this on the menu, but we had the sushi omakase.  We basically had all the fish they had available that night. My only gripe I would have to say is that the chef could be a tad heavy handed on the wasabi and some items were a tad salty.  Oh and their fish selection seems limited. They had  kinds that night but were kinda basic. Tamago was on the house. Yay! It's the cakey wet kind.  (If you know which one I'm talking about. )  It had notes of coffee,  I thought. Other than that, the quality is decent and is fresh enough. The desert was good as well.  The matcha cream filled daifuku mochi was delicious. The outside mochi is soft and the red bean is smooth and doesn't overpower the matcha.  It had the perfect balance of flavors.  It was $.  The peach panna cotta was also good but small. But there hasn't been a panna cotta that I haven't enjoyed.  The decor is minimalistic and they play elevator music which is pretty usual for these types of sushi bars. Very authentic.  Servers were friendly and helpful.  Nice to see a sushi restaurant that rivals those in LA and NYC in terms of quality.  We both had omakase.  It's not cheap, but I came away happy. Amazing! Make reservations since this place is tiny! Sit at the bar, and order off the fresh fish of the day menu. Chefs are fun to chat with. Had chawanmushi for the first time here, and it was delicious! Would compare this place with Akiko's and Sushi Ran. $ for pp  pc,  appetizer,  entree, and dessert. What a great sushi restaurant in the Richmond district! Yes, it is pricy but it well worth it. The sushi is very fresh and the presentation of the food is gorgeous (for those who appreciate art). We tried their set menu and was not disappointed. The handmade mochi is the best we've ever had! Had to order a second round of them because it was so tasty! I was very surprised to see all the  star reviews, hardly ever happens and definitely never in new restaurants as they are working out their kinks.   But it's a few blocks from my house so I wanted to support my hood. My hubby and I went for a Friday date night. We were excited to try something new and creative and we're all about food adventure. Unfortunately the food just wasn't great, the dishes were a bit bland and the portions pretty small and since fish is light, we ordered many but still walked away hungry. The miso black cod had tons of bones in it, which just shouldn't be served in a fillet and the portions small. We had the monkfish liver pate, it was interesting but a bit dry and lacking in flavor. The hand rolls didn't have much fish.  The best part of the meal was the nigiri, however they were pricey at $ /piece.  The service was very slow, didn't refill our drinks and the rolls took forever, we waited over  minutes, while the hot dishes came out fairly fast.  The waitress apologized for the bad service and said hoped we'd come back again.  In this situation they should have comped some of the food and given us something on the house while we waited. After dinner we went over to another place for dessert and drinks, and if it wasn't so late I would have shared an entree as well.  The bill came to $ with tip, given the great meals you can have in SF for that price, including great sushi, it just wasn't worth it and I'm not looking to come back again. We came excited  a new restaurant with solid  star reviews. The higher expectations made for a harder fall. Service was very slow. We waited  mins for our last rolls (after asking about them too). The food was creative/interesting but just not great. Wrap it all up in a high price tag. I'll come back in a year or two. Let them work out their kinks. Too much good food all around. It's actually .  stars but I'll round up.  The city lacks really good authentic Japanese cuisine, so Wako is a much needed addition to the restaurant scene here.  Service, decor, and atmosphere feels exactly like some of the Japanese/new sushi places I've been to in Tokyo.  The night that we were there, about % of the patrons were Japanese.  If I had closed my eyes, I sort of could imagine that I was back in Japan again. Let's get down to the food.  We ordered the  course omakase, holy moly, it was a ton of food!  Wako's strong suite is definitely their cooked dishes.  The grilled fish, uni chawanmushi, ankimo, and tofu.  All were great, well except the ankimo was a bit overdone but the flavor was spot on.  Sushi was good, the technique's there but the quality was just OK.  He didn't have higher quality cuts of fish, and when asked about copper river salmon (it was in season), the chef said that it was an expensive fish.  It is an expensive fish, but other restaurants like Koo manages to serve it.  All of the sushi we had were prepared and seasoned nicely though, so the mediocre quality of the fish isn't as jarring versus if it was prepared the traditional sushi way.  This isn't to say that they have bad quality fish, their fish are leaps and bounds above places like elephant sushi and anami.  I would place it the same quality standard as Roka, which I am a fan of also.   Also in the beginning the sushi rice was really fresh, so it was a bit warm, which heightened the vinegar flavor.  The texture was great though, and after the first few pieces the taste improved dramatically as the rice cooled.  The dessert was amazing!  I'm usually not a dessert girl but I could eat a whole bowl of the panna cotta that they served at the end.  I also want to go back to try their matcha mochi, it looked amazing!We will definitely be back, order a bunch of hot plates and order a bit of sushi if in the mood.  I'm so happy to have a true authentic Japanese restaurant in the city and be able to do this, usually we're stuck with the options of only sushi or only hot plates.   If Wako improves their sushi, it might be my favorite Japanese restaurant in the city :) This place is my new favorite for new school sushi!  I've been to all the good spots and used to work in a Japanese restaurant and I am very impressed with this place!I'm coming back here next week for my birthday. I was a little bit suspicious of all these rave reviews on Yelp, but I was totally wrong. This place is real. I don't usually drive to the city just for sushi, as there are other good sushi places in the peninsula too. I might change my habit now! Amazing! We had the omakase dinner and it was delicious. Every course and the way each dish was plated was absolutely beautiful. Great service and great dining experience. Wako is delicious, their omakase was the bomb! I just wish they weren't so crowded already. Found Tomo!  He opened his own restaurant  So exciting!  I will eat sushi here more than anywhere else  perfect balance of taste, environment and price.  Excellent fish and shari. Shari was so good, very impressed.  We get the go all out omakase where you end up eating almost every available fish, either as sashimi or sushi.  We loved it all.  And, and, in addition to passing the rice test with flying colors, they pass the tamago test too  the tamago is exquisite, tastes like castella (Japanese cake. ) The best sushi restaurant in the bay area. Top quality foods and services. If you want traditional Japanese food, here is where you want to go. Better order the  course omakase if It's your first time there so you can trying everything. (Order  course because it comes with a dessert that  course doesn't come with) All there desserts are hand make. Basically you won't be able to have the same thing you had here from other places! Highly recommended! These guys are awesome, previously from Sanraku  Atsushi and Tomoharu are an amazing team.  We left our selection up to Tomo San and all of the sushi and cooked dished were wonderful.  My favorite was a jalapeño Mexican inspired tuna sushi. Go there soon before it becomes impossible to get a reservation. Excellent omakase, sushi restaurant! I live in LA and was lucky enough to try this gem while visiting. I've eaten at Sasabune, Matsuhisa, and Urasawa in LA and this place is right up there with these brand names in taste, creativity and quality, but without the price tag and stuffiness. $ vs $+ is a smoking deal! Food:  stars course omakaseEvery single dish down to the garnish was amazing! I was especially in love with the red snapper tempura with rice crackers. You can tell the food was made with heart. Atmosphere:  starsModern wood decor, beautifully designed. Check out the bathroom, you wouldn't want to leave! If I lived in San Francisco, this would be my go to sushi joint! Great neighborhood for a authentic, delicious sushi restaurant.  We were able to get seated for  adults and  kids at pm on a Saturday evening.  It's not a huge restaurant so we were really lucky.  We ordered  omakase and shared several small dishes.  They were really receptive to the  young kids.  The sushi was super fresh and very delicious.  I'd definitely frequent this neighborhood gem. I hate the typical Yelp review that starts, ""I've never had sushi before, but this is the best restaurant!""  I've eaten a crapload of sushi, both in the Bay Area and in SoCal, but I have to admit that I haven't eaten at any of the other newish high end places in San Francisco.  My partner lived in Japan for six years, and I may have picked up some of her fussiness about Japanese food, but I'm really just enthusiastic without being deeply knowledgable. That said, this place seems like the real deal, with very traditional menu, and delicious fish with awesome texture.  Service was prompt and reasonably friendly.  It was certainly the best sushi I've had in San Francisco.  (Although now that I've read a few more of these reviews, I may be checking out the competition!)Koshihikari Echigo beer is ubiquitous in the Southland, but a bit tougher to find up in the Bay Area, so I was happy to see it here. Nakamura san, thank you for serving the best Edomae sushi in San Francisco.  I knew from the moment my husband and I sat down at the sushi bar, that ordering off menu and just asking for your sushi/sashimi omakase was the way to go.  The freshness of your ingredients, your amazing rice, and your subtle flavors  all I can say is thank you. Order what you will, but do yourself the pleasure of sitting back and putting your trust in the sushi master.  The man is an artist, and the sushi is worth every penny. I never write reviews. . .  But, I certainly think Wako deserves my very first review!While the whole town is hyping over the opening of Kusakabe, Mr. J and I decided to try this even newer, shy of a month old joint first.  I got home around : pm on Friday night after a long streak of working weeks and was telling Mr. J that we haven't had time to really enjoy a meal together.  So, maybe we should go somewhere nice for dinner.  Mr. J was laughing at me and said no good place would have an open reservation on a Friday night.  Well, I decided it doesn't hurt to try and gave Wako a call to see if their sushi bar is available at  pm.  I won't lie, but I was surprised when the lady over the phone told me that they are available.  And there, Mr. J and I rushed out the door.  On the drive over there, we kept thinking if we made the right decision and will we be disappointed at the end of the night. When we walked into Wako, I immediately fell in love with its cozy and inviting environment.  After identifying ourselves, the server sat us down at the best seats in the house with the reserved sign.  There are  seats at the bar and we got the perfect front view of Tomo san and Atsushi san!  Wako offers four or seven course omakase option and Mr. J and I went for the seven course one and added a few a la carte items as well.  I won't go into too much detail of our dishes as I believe a picture is worth a thousand words.  But, there are a few things worth mentioning. * Rice  Mr. J and I are very particular and picky when it comes to the sushi rice.  We both agreed that the sushi rice at Wako is probably the best we've had in the bay area. * Size  Some might find their nigiri to be on the smaller side.  But, I find them to be the perfect size to be eaten with hands in one bite. * Rhythm  Tomo san always asks if he may start preparing the next sushi.  And, every nigiri is prepared right before served.  I really hate to compare Wako to Maruya since Mr. J and I like them both.  But, we've seen fishes been sliced together beforehand at Maruya the last time we were there at the sushi bar. * Tamago  Not your typical tamago at the sushi restaurant here.  The type they served is Kasutera, the kind that look and taste like the Japanese Castella cake.  And, it's Mr. J's favorite!  Tomo san asked if we had this kind of tamago before and wanted our opinion.  After I took a bite and he saw my big smile, he said no words are needed as he can see it in my smile. * Dessert  I cannot express enough the importance of a dessert at the end of every meal.  I don't care how good of a meal I had if their dessert is weak.  A great dessert = a perfecting ending to a meal.  Mm, I am still drooling over their house made matcha daifuku!Tomo san and Atsushi san are both funny and interactive.  They totally made our night a happy one!  Mr. J and I were the last two to leave with two very full and happy tummies!  We'll be back soon!! Words cannot express how delicious our meal was; simply put, I felt like the crevices of my taste buds were being delicately caressed with love and excitement. Will be back sooner than later. Love.  Love.  Love. This is not a Japanese restaurant you should go to if you want something cheap, don't appreciate/like raw fish, or only like untraditional rolls. A and I went this past Saturday for dinner.  We called a couple of hours earlier to make reservations, although, technically, we didn't need to, because our table was the only one available when we walked in, so we probably would've gotten it anyway. I have a feeling this place is going to be packed once the word gets out.  So sh. . . keep it down. We both got Omakase Option # ($).   Small Plates ()  Braised eggplant and housemade sesame tofu Bincho Grill ()  Grilled Cod Nigiri ()  Bonito, Snow Crab, Uni, Salmon, Otoro, Aji, Hamachi Miso Soup  option of red miso or housemade miso.  Ala Carte Hamachi Yuzu MisoEverything was high quality and so GOOD!  The highlight of our night was definitely the nigiri, with the otoro being our absolute favorite.  Everything is pre seasoned so no soy sauce is needed.  In fact, there is no soy sauce on the tables, although I think they will give it to you if you request it.  We did not. It's a little pricey, but you get what you pay for.  We will definitely be back!$. for two.  No drinks. The restaurant decor is a mixture of woods and tiles, simple, cozy and  tastefully done. Chef Tomo and Atsushi put traditional Sushi into art form. Omakase is the way to go, you won't be disappointed. Originally was planning to eat superstar, and they sent us to bstar. Thankfully they did as we passed this little gem on the way over. Just opened and this traditional Japanese restaurant is great!My friends opted for the four course while I opted to get a few small plates and a roll. The yuzu hamachi was light with the right amount of citrus while the cod was amazing. The chanwanmushi was delicious and not overly salty like some places. I will say the roll was a little forgettable, but overall the traditional small plates were great. Would definitely come here again. Nice interior and ambiance. Very authentic and traditional Japanese taste. Tamago was like sponge cake, and different but I liked it. Presentation was also very lovely. Staff was helpful too. A bit pricey but I would come back again. I found my go to sushi spot. Simple, traditional Japanese sushi. None of that Philly Roll nonsense. Rice. Fish. Simplicity. I only recommend this place for elite sushi eaters that understand the true Japanese tradition and acknowledge the rare art of sushi. Expect only the finest quality fish. One should never put a price on quality seafood. Raw fish is not meant to be cheap. I felt as if I was back in Japan. And I thank the sushi chefs for bringing sushi back. .  STARS Finding a solid, REAL Japanese restaurant in SF is like finding a good man in SF. Amidst the cockfest of douchebags and losers, there's a real gem. . . somewhere. If you look hard enough that is. That gem is Wako. Quietly opening on May th, Wako took over the old Murasaki spot and is the th high end sushi restaurant to open in SF after Akiko, Maruya, and Kusakabe. Wako's opening was not published anywhere and I happen to stumble upon it on Yelp after going through + of sushi listings. My friend had mentioned that Clement doesn't need another sushi restaurant. I initially agreed with her but after thinking about it, Wako is one of the few authentic, Japanese owned and operated Japanese restaurant in the area (Okina is another). Hailing from Sanraku, Wako's owner and sushi chefs serve up traditional Japanese fare. On the menu are nigiri, maki rolls (no dragon or gross bukkake rolls), binsho grilled items, and izakaya dishes. All nigiri is individually seasoned and sauced so no soy sauce or wasabi is provided. Beware that the nigiri is charge by the piece and not by the pair so your bill will quickly rack up if you order strictly nigiri. Expect to spend about a $ $ pp. They have an excellent sake and beer menu. Our waitress recommended a great junmai (I forgot the name but it was $/glass) which I guzzled down. She also recommended the best beer I've ever had (and I don't usually like beer): bit. ly/xOAqR. It was pricey at $ a bottle but I've never seen this banana beer before. It was smooth and light with a nice, sweet banana finish. Get this!As suggested by the sushi chef, we decided to go with the smaller omakase so we can add additional a la carte items from the menu. Omakase Option #: Two small plates,  binsho grill,  piece nigiri &  miso soup for $ or you can do the Omakase Option # that adds sashimi, tempura & dessert for $. OMAKASE OPTION # ($)*Braised Eggplant  & Housemade Sesame Tofu: bit. ly/ubIkt*Gindara: Grilled Black Cod: bit. ly/TNYXoa*Nigiri: Tai, Aji, Bonito, Canadian Salmon, Uni (Hokkaido), Otoro & Anago: bit. ly/xOdMW*Miso Soup: bit. ly/lqni*Complimentary Matcha Dusted Chocolate Truffles: bit. ly/xOjSXEThe eggplant and tofu were great subtle openers. Loved the custardy texture of the tofu. As most of you know, I despise cooked fish but the generous portion of gindara was perfectly grilled and the flesh was super silky and moist.  The best part of the omakase (as always) was the nigiri. The progression was on point: from light to fatty fishes. The fish was pristinely fresh and each nigiri was individually seasoned and garnished with items that best complement the fish. Our favorite was the otoro; it's like sex in your mouth!We had a choice of housemade miso or red miso for our last course. We received one of each to share. The red miso is a lot saltier so I liked the regular miso soup better. It was a bowl of comfort with velvety cubes of tofu. The complimentary housemade matcha dusted chocolate truffles were like crack! They need to package and sell these babies!A LA CARTE ITEMS:*Tempura ($): bit. ly/jmvAz*Gindara Tu Nasu: Braised Miso Black Cod ($): bit. ly/staNT*Chawanmushi: Steamed Egg Custard w/ Uni ($): bit. ly/iqJEr*Ankimo w/ Ponzu Gelee ($): bit. ly/pnYPcc*Otoro ($/piece): bit. ly/hRfcMd*Matcha Daifuku: Matcha Mochi w/ Red Bean Paste ($. ): bit. ly/SCIQIXBecause no Japanese meal is complete without tempura in Mr. NSS' eyes, we had to get an order of tempura which was one of the best I've had. The batter was airy and super light. The gindara tu nasu was bowl of savory, umami goodness and would have been perfect with a bowl of steamed rice. I loved the silkiness of the chawanmushi but the uni was a bit too brown for my liking. Back to cold dishes, the ankimo was deliciously buttery. Not Ino san status but still very good. I liked the nouvelle touch of the ponzu gelee. The second otoro piece was sexlicious as the first. This is a must order!Do order dessert here as everything is housemade. The matcha daifuku was bomb! It had a fantastic chewy, carblicious mochi exterior with a delicate matcha flavor and red bean filling. Lolia S. would definitely approve. The staff is sweet, attentive, and friendly. Feel free to chat it up with the sushi chefs as they're super nice. Reservations are recommended as Wako only has  seats at the sushi bar, five  tops, and one  top. Do sit at the sushi bar for all the nigiri making action: bit. ly/ljgfR. Parking in the area sucks so it's best to come on weeknights. Having previously lived in Inner Richmond, Wako is breath of fresh air to the plethora of pseudo Japanese restaurants in the area. *ahem Ichiraku ahem* Just be prepared for the sticker shock for the area. Well, I guess that's what the ramen budget is for. It's gonna be ramen bowls for days now. . . =/ We were so happy with our decision to try out Wako last night. My son did the ordering as he was most familiar with traditional Japanese food. Everything was so fresh, beautifully arranged & tasty. I experienced Chawanmushi (savory Japanese custard) for the first time. It was the most delightful dish, I will probably order it every time now! The new decor is lovely. Service was excellent. Hard to believe it's only been open two weeks. Notice: the positive reviews of Wako are long. The poor reviews are short. I will counter this by making a positive review short:I have eaten at pretty much every high end to cult favorite sushi place up and down the west coast and a fair number in Tokyo. We had the Omakase (plus as few a la carte items) and on a dollar for dollar basis Wako holds it own  and its only been open for a bit more than a week. Is it on the level of Saito or Urasawa? No. But it's coming in at a third or a quarter of the price, and you don't need to speak Japanese or wait a month for a reservation. I do not doubt that in a year this will be a destination restaurant. Excellent traditional sushi bar, with small menu of beautiful small plates and rolls. Nigiri averaged out to about $ per piece, so it's marginally pricier than competitor sushi places in the neighborhood. Fish was fresh and included some local selections (I believe the uni and salmon were both local), as well as some fish imported from around the world. The Norwegian mackerel was among the highlights. I will definitely be back. So great to see a traditional Japanese restaurant in the neighborhood. It's beautifully decorated with a sleek design  though it's quite small so I would call ahead if you have a large party. My boyfriend really enjoys nigiri and completely devoured anything that was placed on his plate. This is a fresh fish place so if you're looking for rolls or chicken teriyaki  this may not be the place to go. Great service and atmosphere  will definitely be coming again. Went to Waka Restaurant on Thursday night with a friend. The inside is so traditional Japanese style that I got the feeling that I was in Japan. The waitresses were very cordial and polite and the Sushi Chef was fun to chat with. Of course the reason I went there was because of the food. The presentation is absolutely beautiful and too good to eat. The fish is very very fresh and the other customers commented on this is what they were impressed with. Japanese restaurants run by other nationalities other than Japanese is fearful if you are looking for Sashimi or Nigiri. I have gone to other restaurants such as Sanraku Metreon and I would say that the price is quite reasonable for the quality you get. I will definitely go back again and recommended this restaurant to many others especially the caucasians and other nationalities who really know the true Japanese cuisine like in Japan. SF is so fortunate to have this amazing new restaurant. I ate here on Thursday night with my girlfriend; we have been having omakase at all of SF's best sushi restaurants and Tomo and Atsushi are setting a very high standard with Wako. We came here on their rd day and the food, service and atmosphere were all exceptional. As is our custom, we like to have omakase (chef's choice) to give the chefs the chance to put their best foot forward in their own personal shock and awe campaign. The Omakase began with a few special dishes then sashimi before being served edo mae style sushi (preseasoned by the chef). All was of the highest quality and creativity. If you are looking for a fantastically authentic sushi experience, Wako is tough to beat in this town. Tomo is from Shikoku (smallest of Japan's four major islands) and was trained in Osaka, which is known for having some of the best cuisine in all of Japan. This training really shines through in the authenticity and quality of the dining experience at Wako. I expect it will soon be very difficult of get a seat at Wako. Wako is an experience.  Reflecting the beauty and intimacy of a traditional Japanese restaurant/sushi bar, you feel welcomed the moment you step into this upscale establishment.  The fish is fresh and delectable and award winning chef Tomo san's creations are a feast for the eyes.   Folks in the Inner Richmond district are very lucky indeed to have this gastronomical delight, but my husband and I will gladly travel from the South Beach area to share in your neighborhood gem. After going to Sasakisan for so many years I had to try Wako. There's definitely no comparison to Sasakisan.  The sushi was average and limited on the menu. Unfortunately nothing special about this place except it was expensive for what you get. Don't think I will be back. Wako  A Japanese & California CuisineTuesday, May th was it's first official opening day of business. This place is a very Traditional Japanese Style environment. From the moment you walk in. . . . you are greeted and you get a hot towel to freshin up prior to eating. The Chief is a friend of the previous chief that had passed away a few month ago, and has reopened with a newly remodeled restaurant. The Sushi is very fresh and very tasty.  The Chief makes high recommendations, so if your not sure what to order. . . . his advise is awesome!!Here is what I had:Blue Fin TunaYellowtailChinook SalmonKonnyaku to kikuna no kurumi miso  Yam Jelly, Chrysanthemum Leaves, Walnuts and MisoTekka Roll  Hon Maguro, WasabiNegi Hama  Hamachi ScallionsChief Surprise HandrollChocolates for desertLoved the Blue Fin Tuna best of all!!  The Chief has his own Wasabi mix so there is no need to mix the Wasabi and Soy Sauce.  Everything was very fresh and tasty.  Seaweed was nice and crunchy. . . . . got to love the Handrolls when the seaweed is like so!!Sushi is individually priced. Highly recommended . . . . I'll be back for more!! the food was really fresh and tasty. the portions were a bit small though. I'd go back."|1|100|0|Routine Inspection|This inspection has no violations.
Cocotte 0|4.0|French in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|246|0|4.09278350515|" Wonderful diner we had last Saturday . Place was packed so I recommend make reservation especially on week end. It feel like we went to Paris ! Though the food is fairly solid, Cocotte consistently does not honor their stated business hours. Open till pm? But close at pm? This practice does not lend itself well. If you want to spend your entire dinner turned around trying to make eye contact with the server to grab his attention, and not enjoying your meal or your company, then this is your place.  Took  minutes to even take drink orders. When I asked for a wine recommendation he just quickly directed us to the most expensive glass at $ without any description or nd recommendation. We had the duck platter appetizer. Eh, it was mediocre. The entrees were very average.  Two of us had the beef Wellington and the other had the special which was a steak with blue cheese. Nothing special. The sides were very good. Brussels sprouts in lemon were great and the potatoes au gratin in goat cheese was also very good. The highlight was the banana creme brûlée which was amazing. Everyone seems to agree. Knowing it would take half an hour to get the server's attention again we ordered the creme brûlée and asked for our check at the same time. It only took  more requests for the check before it arrived. The server sensed my agitation as I eyed him down as he moved through the restaurant. He finally arrived and tried to be cute by saying ""voila!"" as he presented the check. Sorry buddy, not remotely funny, and no I will not ever come back to your restaurant even though I live just a few blocks away. Food was average with a few bright spots. Food alone deserves three stars but the service took away from the experience so much that this was definitely a one star dinner.  Don't come here. Way too many other good restaurants out there in this city to bother with this one. Food is consistently excellent. Service is always great too. This is the first restaurant I bring visitors to when they are in the city. . . And the banana creme brûlée is delicious! Food is a bit too pricey for what you are getting but very delicious. Atmosphere is very corporate. . . Maybe that was just one night, but I came here on a date and it was neither cosy/warm nor lively. . . I would come back for the food but only with my colleagues or on a work dinner. Was having dinner her a few weeks ago and found the experience to be far less than what other yelp reviewers had suggested. We seemed to have multiple waiters all at the same who not only would interrupt us  mins after previous interrupting us or their co worker have interrupted us, and then seemed pissed that we had not made our selections from the menu. That really ruined it for us, and the food was ""just ok""; frankly it was a bit too salty for my tastes. Another important note if you're thinking about this restaurant: there is ZERO parking around the area, especially in the evening. I ended up parking a few blocks away on the street, and it took me  mins of driving around to find that spot. There are no parking garages and its a really busy area. Appreciate this is only an issue if you drove in, but still, allow time for it. This place is very nice. Great setting and the foot was delicious, especially the bread!! Highly recommended Cocotte is a wonderfully cozy French restaurant, perfect for dates or small groups. To start off our indulgent meal, a friend and I shared a cheese platter. It consisted of three types of soft and hard cheeses, along with a side of jam, nuts, and an arugula salad with pistachios and balsamic vinegar. I highly recommend tasting the hard cheese with nuts, spreading a piece of bread with brie and jam, and pairing bread with the goat solo or with jam. For my entree, I ordered the coq au vin  the chicken was placed upon a bed of vegetables and potato gratin. SO flavorful and juicy, pairs beautifully with a glass of red wine. My friend ordered the scallops with squid risotto. Had a taste of it and oh my gosh. Definitely ordering this the next time I dine here. This entree had some amazing textures and is great for anyone who loves seafood! We are locals and tried Cocotte for the first time with the Rotisserie take out.  Fabulous whole chicken with its accompanying three delicious sauces.  Two cocottes  peas and carrots and cauliflower gratin.  Superb.  We will definitely make this a regular treat. The chicken and sauces are the best I've had. Went for Valentine's this year,LOVED: The bread. This is important to me. It's what I get to eat when I'm hungriest.  The ambiance. It's simple and warm, but romantic and chic. Not your corner French bistro.  The Valentine's prix fixe menu. Nothing too elaborate, but pretty delicious and with sizes worthy of a man. . . who's not too hungry. I actually couldn't finish the main, though it likely was because I ate so much of that bread. OK: Service. Definitely more positive than negative. Didn't feel like we were being rushed. Also, in their defense, the place was absolutely packed. It must make it harder to be extra nice and attentive.  Personal space. Proximity is part of the warmth and vibe of the place, but it's definitely on the you are also dining with your neighbor side. NOT LOVED: The famed banana creme brulee. Coming from a Caribbean person who loves banana in anything (with soup, next to steak, in omelettes), you have to trust me on this one: it's not for everyone. They had an orgasmic chocolate dessert, so, do yourselves a favor. Overall, wonderful place. For a point of reference in SF: much better on my record than Bistro Central Parc. In town for my birthday weekend and enjoyed this fabulous restaurant with my parents. Cozy, great decor, amazing menu and excellent service. The banana creme brule was out of this world, too! And loved that the chefs and kitchen are open for you to add to the family feeling atmosphere. I felt transported to France with the adorable and sweet French waiters  an amazing dinner and I would highly recommend this restaurant for a date night or any celebration! Great food and service! Seating is a bit tight, especially if you are taller but a nice place to grab dinner! Excellent dinner. Offering French classics as well as specialties, Cocotte has warm atmosphere that made for a great evening. Duck leg confit, half roasted chicken, filet beef wellington, potatoes and goat cheese, and a bordeaux. I will be returning. Fabulous! So glad I found this place!! My boyfriend and I walked in at . pm last night and were able to get a table. So impressed with the food and price! We shared half rotisserie chicken, lobster salad (great!) and THE BEST Brussels sprouts I've ever had! They had lemon in them. . . Too good. Best thing is they do takeout so this could be one of our new weekly dinners, healthy take out with the rotisserie chickens and sides! It is pretty loud in there tho as its a pretty intimate space but don't let that scare you! :) Excellent service with a very intimate atmosphere. I had the Beef Wellington and it was delicious. Cooked to a perfect medium rare as requested with a crispy puff pastry outside. If you ever make a reservation here and they call to ask you to reschedule, then you should either go with the new time or cancel. I made the mistake of wanting to stick to the original time. The table we were given was arguably  the worst in the restaurant. It was a noise attractor. We could hear conversations from everywhere but couldn't hear each other. I would have put up all this if the food was good, but both meals were terrible. I had a seafood stew that was practically forced on to me by the waiter and my partner had the beef steak. Both were so salty and that the only thing I could taste was the salt. Moral of the story: don't piss these guys off by not going with the time they want you to have dinner! Despite of pains finding a parking around the neighborhood this is a gem that is worth it!We really liked the ambience, service and of course a nice selection of wine, appetizers and main entrees. This is a really good spot for a romantic dinner or just hanging out with a few friends. Thank you to everyone, we truly had a great time and will be back soon! Great little gem! We really enjoyed our meal here. The place is tiny but the ambiance is really nice. The creme brulee is really amazing. Pricey but worth it for a nice date night! Wonderful date night! The space is very intimate. Dinner included: duck platter, lobster salad, sea bass, pork belly, side of cauliflower/espelent gratin, and dessert was an apple tartin. For wine we shared a bottle of Medoc. The duck platter was really a trio of duck which included duck sausage, duck rillet, duck belly, a warm walnut loaf, mustard,and pickled onions. This dish was a wonderful start to our meal. The lobster salad was generous in the lobster and burrata,m.  hour pork belly ober lentils, no brainer selection. Their apple tartin was simply Devine, not too sweet perfectly soft apple.  It can be very noisy and be prepared to overhear some of your neighbors conversation. In a nutshell it's great local spot that I hope lasts. small intimate place with european decor.  service was great but the food was a let down.  we ordered the duck platter, mussels, sea bass, beef wellington, fries and red wine.  everything varied from bland, chewy to salty.  AND that included the wine.  maybe we missed the mark on our order or we lack the refined french palate but i dont get all the rave reviews. Such a good find by my friend Jenny!Intimate and cozy atmosphere with romantic (but not too dark) lighting and an open kitchen.  Saw mostly ""girls night out"" tables here but also great for date night. My beef wellington was great, although my bone marrow that came with it didn't have much more than  tiny spoonfuls of actual marrow in it.  Coq au vin was also excellent, as were our potato gratin and brussels sprouts sides.  We finished the meal off with a refreshing banana creme brulee. All in all a great meal and the perfect fix for a French food craving. I felt like I was in France during our dinner at Cocotte.  The service is excellent and we loved everything we ate.  It was my first experience with bone marrow yum!  I will be back!! I almost dont want to write this review as this place already can be hard to get a table at but I just cant help myself. Awesome little French restaurant in Russian hill. Great cozy atmosphere, good for dates! Wonderful food ( love the duck pate and rabbit flat bread) and wonderful service! I'll keep coming as long as I can get a table! Fantastic food,service and wine list. The roasted chicken is superb. Great place for a romantic date night. We had an excellent meal at Cocotte. The restaurant is warm and inviting; our waitress was all smiles and friendly. It was a fab time. We shared the duck platter to start which was awesome. Duck saucisson sec was tasty as was the smoked duck breast. I've had better rillettes but this variation was still quite good. I had the coq au vin (yum!) but also got a taste of everyone else's mains (roast chicken, pork belly, rib eye steak). All were cooked perfectly. The sides were my favorites though. Cauliflower cheese had that nice chewy golden brown cheese topping. Potato gratin was nice and creamy. Brussels sprouts were good too (but lacked a little oomph). Fries were good albeit slightly soggy but were more than made up for by the excellent aioli. We shared the molten chocolate cake for dessert. This was probably my least favorite dish of the meal. There wasn't anything inherently wrong with it but it didn't have the wow factor of some of the others. I'd definitely come back though! Cocotte has that quaint, European vibe that makes it an ideal date spot. My girlfriends and I were surrounded by lovey dovey couples, but we didn't mind. Our attention was focused entirely on the food. We shared a couple bottles of white wine and the following: Green bean salad: Comes with fried potato and goat cheese beignet, need I say more? You can ask for the anchovy dressing on the side, if that's not your thing (but I adored it!) Rotisserie chicken: To die for, with delicious dipping sauces (especially the porcini mushroom) and sides (get the lentils!) Potato gratin cocotte: Surprisingly my least favorite dish we ordered, in spite of the restaurant's name and my love for potato and cheese. It was rich and yummy, but still ultimately outshone by everything else IMOComparisons with Limon Rotisserie seem inevitable. I still favor Limon overall, but it's better for parties/groups, whereas Cocotte is more romantic and intimate. One of our favorite places to eat in sf. Excellent ambiance service and the mussels are delicious . divine. Super cozy little French restaurant on a quaint little stretch of Hyde. The food was great (I ordered the coq au vin) and the wine list has some nice French picks. The chocolate cake dessert was alright, but the coffee was good. Oh, and the cheese plate was killer! It had great variety, plenty of different types of cheeses, as well as unique fruit and nut additions that I don't typically see. Definitely not your boring, average cheese plate. Great for date night, girls night, etc. We went on a Tuesday and had made reservations earlier, but it seemed not super busy. It's a smaller space, so plan ahead if you have your heart set on eating there especially on a busier evening. The wait staff definitely approach service with a French flair . . . they take their time and give you yours to enjoy your meal and wine. Don't expect a speedy dining experience. Unhelpful , rude.  Valentines I could not eat what was on their heavy, rich, valentines menu because  I have severe medical restrictions (many gastric surgeries).  When I told them I'd like to order something from their regular menu (which I had deliberately checked out before coming) they declined.  They wouldn't even give me a green salad or something simple like a plate of vegetables, so I sat there, no food, while my date ate.  More than once I suggested I eat something but it was all or nothing for them.   To top things off they rushed my date through a three course menu in less than  minutes.  Ruined our valentines, rude, unaccommodating. I was torn between ordering the  hour pork belly and the beef wellington, but as two other people in the party ordered the latter. . . I went with the former. Never having seen the beef wellington before, we were surprised that it looked a lot smaller than we'd thought. For dessert I went with the oh so praised banana creme brulee. Everything was okay, but I'm not sure that I'd ever pick this as a *go to* spot since parking was next to impossible. The staff was pleasant, which is always appreciated. It was strange being able to hear the kitchen in the restroom and might I suggest providing seat covers? Really intimate setting.  Its a small restaurant with a pseudo open kitchen, but I really enjoyed this meal.  I was with  other friends and we ate family style.  That is the way to go at this place.  We ordered the lobster salad, clams, roasted chicken,  sides and the tartufo, and I was surprised at how reasonable the price of the meal was after we split everything  ways (+ a bottle of wine).  The chicken was so tender and brussel sprouts were really good.  I would definitely come back to this spot. A wonderful, attentive French bistro. The food was delicious, the service perfect and the setting cordial. The prices are reasonable for the quality of food and service. It's a wonderful venue for a special event J & I were lured to Cocotte by DAT.  I totally did not realize that Cocotte used to be Hyde Street Bistro (which I had dined at during a previous DAT, and left unimpressed). AMBIANCE: Not much seems to have changed between the days of the space housing HSB and now Cocotte.  As other Yelpers have mentioned, space is tight  I had difficulty getting into my seat (the couch side) without booty bumping the neighbors. . . even after shifting our table over.  Oops. SERVICE: Friendly. . . friendlier than when it was HSB for sure.  But also did not seem entirely genuine.  J & I ended up being seated in the somewhat romantical alcove thingy (the small, private space under the stairs?)  It felt at once more intimate, but it also meant that we often felt ignored/forgotten by the staff. FOOD: J ordered off the DAT menu while I chose an entree ala carte. From DAT ($. ): Seafood puff pastry thing: Like seafood pot pie  decent, pretty rich, nothing amazing.  Pork osso buco: This was fine.  J was not impressed, but I felt that it was par.  It came with a few sprigs of broccolini as well as some polenta.  Banana creme brulee: Delicious, as it was when the restaurant used to be HSB. Ala carte: Scallop with risotto ($):  scallops that were on the smaller side seemed like a marginally stingy portion for the price.  The risotto was alright  slightly mushy, but that's ok with me.  Flavors were good, and I enjoyed this dish more than the pork.  Brussels Sprouts ""cocotte"": Eh.  Nothing special.  Portion size is small for $. OVERALL: I left satisfied, but not impressed.  I need to remember that there is no need to return, when there are so many other wonderful places to try in SF! Dine About Town is an excellent way to try restaurants that are new or under the radar a bit like Cocotte!  It's on the lucrative cute section of Hyde Street where there are cozy, mom n' pop restaurants that are fine dining that are reasonably priced.  Cocotte serves yummy French food.  We had the leek potato soup of the day, which was creamy and comforting.  We ordered the coq au vin, which is slowly cooked chicken so it was tender, moist and tasty  most enjoyable!  We also had a side of brussel sprouts, our fave!  Service was cordial and attentive and they answered all of our questions nicely. It's not a fancy place, but the food is definitely delicious!  We had the chicken liver pâté, excellent. And their tarte ta tan (sorry spelling?) the apple pie, is so authentic! The best in sf and outside of Normandy!  Will def return!! This is a cute place with a french twist. :)I came here with  friends for DineAboutTown but realized that the actual menu is actually better. We ended up ordering just  DineAboutTown portion and  entrees of the reg menu. The appetizer, oh my, was this puff pastry stuffed with an assortment of seafood. The dish was drizzled with a savory white sauce that kept the dryness out from the pastry. We got  different entrees:  Hours Pork Belly  bombombombomobmobmobmb, The pork belly was so savory and literally melted in your mouth. Once you take a bite, your mouth explodes with fantastic flavor. I mean it should. . . since it took them  hours to marinate. This was paired perfectly with a bed of lentils. Duck Leg Confit This was my dish and I loved it. The duck meat was tender while the skin was crispy. It couldn't help but lick the plate clean. Salmon ""koulibiac""  This was salmon stuffed in a puff pastry. This was good but I'm not a huge fan of fish when there's duck and pork belly around. For dessert, we all shared the Apple Tarte Tartin. I'm not usually a sweets person but I could eat this all day. It was warm yet cold. It was soft yet crunchy. Just everything in this cute little dessert with a blast of apple. Went for Dine About Town on a Sunday night and had excellent service. We ended up waiting for one person to show up for about  minutes, and the servers were very patient with us despite the kitchen wanting to close up for the night. I felt like they treated us very well and had very generous portions for a nice French restaurant in nob hill. We came here for Dine About Town but ended up ordering off the regular menu because I was in quite the mood for steak. Everything we ordered was off the charts good! The kitchen is open so you can watch your food get prepared, which adds to the atmosphere of this smaller restaurant space. The host and servers were French with thick accents which add authenticity to the experience. I ordered the steak with a side of fries and the Shisito peppers to start. Their wine list is very affordable as well! All in all, one of my favorite new places in the area! + week reservations are required though, so make sure to book in advance. This place is awesome. Came here last night with a friend. It's a small place, and it was pretty hot inside because part of the kitchen is in the same room as the dining room. Other than that, the intimate atmosphere was great for a  person dinner  not too loud or crowded despite the size. The food was amazing. I had the coq au vin and my friend had the steak. Both were perfect cooked perfectly, and so flavorful. I've never had chicken that moist and tender before  it was probably one of the best meals I've had in San Francisco in the  years that I've lived here. Great place for a date or special occasion  I recommend it and will come back! I celebrated my birthday here. Unfortunately, the place is too small for big groups and the staff seemed overwhelmed. We were seated  minutes later than the reservation which is very uncomfortable for me as host. The food was great overall once we finally sat down. The unpleasant surprise came with the bill when the tip wasn't included with a party of  people as it is generally the case. We had to come back and pay an additional amount. Definitely an unpleasant experience for me. My recommendation is go there as a couple, but it's too small for big groups! I came here for the Dine About Town specials with a friend. The place is VERY small. In fact, I requested to sit outside to avoid being elbow to elbow with my dining neighbors, but was told I could not. The atmosphere is nice and dim, so it would be good for a date (and apparently meeting new people sitting right next to you. )As for the food, I recommend the osso buco entree and chicken pate appetizer. We also dined on the salmon dish (with flaky top like a pot pie!), apple tarte, banana creme brulee; all of which were pretty good.  They serve bread with an olive tapenade, which I didn't care for. I just ended up using the bread to dig into my pate like an Italian heathen. It felt like we were transported to a little country farm house in france. There was a rustic feel from the space to the food and all the way to even the service. Everything that we had was great. I especially liked the duck confit, housemade pasta and the seafood vol au vent. Banana creme brulee and the apple tarte tatin were great as well. The chicken however was less impressive. I wish it didn't depend on the sauce as much and would stand on it's own more. Limon's rotisserie chicken is still my standard. Dine About Town is not the way to go here. If you break it down, it would have cost the same ordering everything separately. In some cases, we would have saved money ordering separately. Service was great overall. My only gripe is that at times we felt rushed. The space is really small but it didn't feel small. Street parking really sucks in this area. Love this Hyde street addition  it fits the atmosphere and reputation of the street perfectly with its quaint, warm, and relaxing interior and beautiful open bar/kitchen concept. Came here for dinner during Dine About Town and was not disappointed. We tried the mixed seafood and soup appetizers. These were both good, but neither were hot when they arrived.  Entrees were the salmon and lamb osso bucco  again, no complaints but could have used a few more minutes in the oven.  For dessert we tried the apple tart and banana creme brulee.  Everything was enjoyable and not too heavy. My only other feedback was that I wished they offered their rotisserie chicken as an option during DAT! Service and wine were both great as well! I'd make a return visit to try the chicken. Excellent neighborhood restaurant.  We were coming to the city to go to the theater, our daughter suggested this restaurant.  She described it as a nice cozy restaurant with really yummy food  a favorite of hers.  I can see why!  We were not disappointed.  We started with the duck platter  duck salami is a must!  We also had the scallops with the squid ink risotto.  Best scallops we have ever had.  Cooked perfectly, melting in your mouth.  The basil foam adds the perfect touch.  The flat iron steak was cooked exactly as ordered, paired with the potato goat cheese gratin  wow.  Profiteroles with rum raisin ice cream was the perfect end to a perfect meal.  Service could not have been better.  BTW, next time we are trying the rotisserie chicken, pork belly, cauliflower and banana Creme Brûlée (our daughter's go to favorites!)Restaurants like this are what we miss about the city. Beef wellingtons are hard to find in San Francisco. When this dish was prominently featured on our favorite show of the week (Master Chef: Junior), we just had to get our hands on these coveted wellies. We came here as a party of six for the boyfriend's birthday and feasted on halibut, pork belly, brussel sprouts, wine, almost every dessert on the menu, and of course, the star of the show beef wellington. Since the dim lighting and candles are well suited for more intimate settings, our rowdy ragtag gang stood out from the rest of the patrons. . . who were definitely on dates. The quality of the food is enough to warrant four stars but the patience that the entire staff showed us (again, a rowdy ragtag gang) reinforced the positive experience. . It's a small place so small group works best. If you have your  friends and their dates to dine together, go ahead and rent out the whole place. . Order whatever you want, but you MUST finish with the banana creme brûlée. It'd be the best decision you'd ever make. Oh, and go ahead make that decision for your date as well. Mine really appreciated it!. If you're ordering more than a glass of champagne, you might as well get the whole bottle because it is more cost effective. . We had great service. BUT we get that everywhere because we are kind, charming, and compassionate eaters, well not for the animals we eat. . Have you decided on the banana creme brûlée, yet? MAKE THAT DECISION. NOW! very cute spot on Hyde. However, they KEPT trying to rush us out of our tables.  This are has bad parking and fine. . two of our party guest s was  mins late, but the people that DID arrive ontime, we ordered wines, so its not like we were wasting their time.  We came here for dine about town.  The puff pastry with scallops and shrimp was amazing, and so was their osso bucco with a side of creamy polenta.  Food really was superb, but I cannot get over how rude they were in rushing us out.  Half our party ended up ordering first. . and granted, two girls were late, but that's saying if we were to have a relaxing dinner here. . we can't stay for any longer than what, an hour n half? Location: tough to parkInside: small, clean, cosy, wooden tables very close to each other. Food: scallop over squit ink risottos highly recommended. Chicken liver was good. Service: not attentive. Not personal. Robotic. Value: not good, which is what you expect from any French restaurant. Overall: I would come back only if it was convenient. I would not return due the food, service, or the value though. This place has a couple of things going for it rustic feel and decent wine list. Unfortunately that's pretty much it. The food is okay, at best. You are getting what you pay for. It's a far cry from fine French food. The selection looks interesting on paper but what you get is Applebee's sized portions slabbed together on a plate. There is nothing complex about the flavors and little effort at the presentation. We had the beef Wellington and the Butcher's cut. They were *okay*. There was absolutely nothing special about either dish. The menus are stained, the tablecloths too. Our waiter spilled wine on the table while pouring it for the BOTH of us. He was fillin 'er up like he was topping a glass of Coke. Oh, and when you get wine there, hold your glass up to the light. You'll enjoy gazing at all the lint fuzz from the aged rag they probably used to give the glass a quick wipe down. Gross. I expect more from a place that claims to serve fine French food. First and last time for me. If you are thinking this is a thoughtful, romantic place to dine, it's not. I had dinner at Cocotte last night for a friend's birthday. The chickens were delicious, the beef wellington tasted hella British (in a good way) and showed up with marrow, the sides (scalloped potatoes, cauliflower, and brussel sprouts) warmed my soul, and the wine warmed my heart. The service was great and we walked out full. My husband and I came here on Christmas Eve, it was a set menu and it was a great experience. The server was super friendly and perfectly attentive which really added to the night. We had the crab and avocado appetizer which was really fresh and flavorful and the pate which went great with our wine. The main courses were great too, the fish had crispy skin and came with lentils and a yummy cream sauce that was not too heavy. overall GREAT, we will be back. Stupendous Christmas Eve dinner. Delicious lamb shank and an amazing sea bass were highlights. They followed superb appetizers of crab with avocado and potato goat cheese beignets. Great wine selections and, though extremely busy, we had excellent service. Will definitely return. WILL NEVER EAT HERE! I made a New Year's Eve dinner reservation a few weeks ago for  people, and the restaurant called to verbally  CONFIRM the reservation Christmas Day.  Come the evening of Sunday, Dec . . . I get an email from Open Table saying the ""Cocotte has cancelled your reservation"".  I called them right away to tell that there must be some sort of mistake??  The fellow who picked up the phone was VERY RUDE, and said. . ""We're a small restaurant and can't fit your party of  anymore.  Also, we're busy right now so I can't deal with you at the moment"".  What do you mean anymore?  I insisted that someone from Cocotte called me on CHRISTMAS DAY to confirm the reservation because they are a small place.  The guy's response?  ""Like I said, I'm too busy to deal with this now. There's nothing I can do for you. ""  and then he HUNG UP!!  How do you cancel someone's NYE dinner reservation for  PEOPLE just  days before without even the courtesy of calling?!!  What if I never even saw the email??Wish I could give them ZERO stars! We shared a Lobster Salad which was excellent and the Beef Wellington was very tender and tasty. The Brussels sprouts were sliced which I was concerned that they might be over cooked but they were quite good and sautéed to perfection. Highly recommend Loved this great neighborhood find!Cocotte is great.  It has a small and cozy atmosphere with delicious food and all really reasonable.  We were shocked at how low the tab was when it came.  The staff is great and friendly and helped us pick out a perfect Cote de Rhone to complement the meal. We loved the chicken.  It was perfectly done flavorful and juicy.  The potatoes au gratin were also a must.  Would definitely come back! super good place, really good food, come here a lot with friends and always have a great time! One of the few restaurants, not located in a hotel, that is open on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day! I had a really hard time picking a restaurant for my meat and potatoes, if he had a choice we would be eating at McD's brother, me (half the time I plan my trips around what three star michelin restaurant I can get a reservations to) and his roommate to eat Christmas Eve dinner. I finally settled on this place because while it is french, they did have things I thought my brother would eat on the set menu (beignets and beef wellington). I thought we were in trouble when he asked me what hors d'oeuvres meant. Seriously?! Are you sure you weren't switched at birth? When I explained it was a very common term for appetizer, and that many of the ingredients in the fancily named dishes were things he liked he seemed to be more open to the experience, but I could tell he was reserving judgement till the food arrived. Luckily for me, the food was delicious and he actually ate most of his food until he couldn't eat anymore. Hallelujah! It's a Christmas miracle!The waitress was really sweet and did not laugh at my brother's butchering of each dish's name (although I did). The service was excellent! Attentive and welcoming. . . just as it should be on Christmas Eve. As for the food, I had the Dungeness Crab appetizer, Sea Bass entree, and the Banana Creme Brulee. My brother's roommate ordered the same appetizer and dessert but had the Lamb Shank instead of the Sea Bass. My brother had the Green Beans an Romaine Salad with Beignets, Beef Wellington, and the White Chocolate Napoleon. Even though I chose the lighter appetizer and entree, the three course meal was quite filling and befitting of a holiday meal. The creme brulee is banana creamy custardy heaven in a ramekin and torched by the gods (It is really that good and I've had a lot of creme brulee in my life. . . It's the dish that prompted me to study french and it's the first dessert I ever made when I was ). Everything was delicious and plated beautifully, with one exception. The dungeness crab appetizer was awkwardly plated. While it was delicious, the plate it was on was really big and very brown. This resulted in the three elements on the plate being really far apart from each other with a big brown abyss between them. Also the brown didn't really complement the color of the sauce or the radishes. But that's a minor cosmetic flaw in an otherwise perfect meal. Merci beaucoup Cocotte! You accomplished something that my mom has only accomplished a handful of times in thirty years  gotten my brother and I to like the same food establishment. The only reason I'm giving this review is the incredibly rude service. The food was good with the exception of overcooked duck but here's the breakdown in service:I brought two bottles of wine. When we called we asked what two bottles would cost to cork, they told us and thought nothing of it. When we got there, we were then told we had to buy a bottle or they would open only one bottle. Really? Then we spent hundreds of dollars on dinner. Just paid the bill and was asked how dinner was and was immediately asked to leave. . . . One of our guests didn't even get a chance to go to the bathroom. That may be ok to do in France but this is America and you can't be a rude douche to people that just spent a bunch for dinner. There were a variety of ways to handle that situation, they picked the wrong one. I know they were busy and needed the tables but it wasn't our intention to ""loiter"". I'll never go back and will tell all my friends to do the same. There are ton of french bistros that are amazing and respect their patrons keeping them in business. Small, cozy atmosphere with excellent service and food. Can't go wrong with that! While everyone could order their own, the accompanying side dishes are quite share able, which is a great way to try a little of everything.  Also  save room for dessert, the apple tarte tatin and banana creme brûlée are  star worthy and particularly délicieux!À bientôt, Cocotte! I love the venue and the lighting. It was a cold and stormy night when my partner and I stopped by. The wait staff was outstanding!! And I love that they speak French at that restaurant, makes it very legit. The duck confit was very dry. The chicken was decent. We got a side of the cauliflower which was creamy and good. Sadly, if the mains don't steal the show. . . I can't justify coming back. Omg this place was great! The scheduling is off and there was quite a wait for our reserved table BUT the food was awesome, wine was great and the service was superb.  The tab was amazingly low!  It is a great value for really good food.  Probably best to be early or late in the evening. . . it gets kind of over full in the middle' Been here a couple times for reliably good, casual French food.  The wine suggestions pair well, and the whole meal is fairly priced for SF.  I recommend for a nice dinner in a warm atmosphere. Dinner was fabulous. The beef Wellington and mussels were my favorite. Chicken with mushroom gravy was great too. Desserts were also terrific. All those  star reviews! Oh well. I will make it brief. Service was poor. The Busser  kept picking up used silverware off our plates and placed them on bare table in between courses. Courses served one on top of another. Rush rush rush. Food average at best. The staff needs to understand that joking with clients cannot overcome poor service.  stars is a far too generous of a rating. . Cozy small place with a warm aura. Quite loud.   of us were in a small corner but as all of us are under '"" it worked.  The food was richly flavored  I enjoyed the coq au vin which had a wonderful full mouth feel and fell off the bone.  The serving was not large but was enough.  The service was kind and prompt.  It is more of a .  star for me. So good! I love this place. It's cute and cozy and the food is delicious! The beef wellington is so good! I can't stop thinking about it :P I have also tried their fish and chicken dishes and they were very good too. MmM! It was a slow Sunday night with no wait and great service.  We started with the smoked salmon plate and I'm not a big fan of smoked salmon, but this was excellent!  Then we split the beef Wellington and pork belly.  My favorite was the Wellington and the dipping sauce.  Lastly finished it up with the apple tart, which is amazing. Overall this place rocks and is one of the best date/dinner spots in the area.  I am looking forward to returning here. amazing, a must go! Good food.  Good Service. Yay, finally got to eat here after a failed attempt on my st. Came here with the bf and it was amazing. Granted, we had to drive around the area for / hour to look for street parking  do come early to look for parking or hope that you are super lucky that day. Also, make reservations beforehand!!We ordered the  hour pork belly and half a chicken. The pork belly was fantastic, the skin was crispy while the rest of the meat was soft and literally melted in your mouth. I have no idea how they managed to have such different textures for a piece of meat. Judging from the reviews, it seems that the pork belly is not getting enough credit! We also got half a chicken. Super amazing as well, absolutely no fats on it, and was roasted to perfection. But honestly, I loved the pork belly way more. We also got the two sides  brussel sprouts and potato and goat cheese gratin. I wished I had the dessert that everyone raves about. . . but I was too full for it :( Hopefully I will come back here again next time. This place was fantastic! Came here with my girlfriend after being turned away at Seven Hills because we did not have a reservation. The owner found us a seat on a very busy Friday night. The service was prompt, as well as accommodating. The meals were lovely, however, what I will take away from this place was the creme brûlée. It is to die for. I have been craving it ever since I left. I see it in my dreams. . . I was very pleased with Cocotte, even though I still don't know how to pronounce the name. It is in a nice location (even though parking is near impossible here) and is a very small and intimate restaurant with an open kitchen and friendly staff. The food is above average and is very reasonably priced. They are very well known for their rotisserie chicken, which is a great deal, but the other items on the menu are great as well. I had the Osso Buco special for the night and it was exactly what I wanted and expected. The other diners at my table all had the / rotisserie chicken each, with comes with  sauces and a side of your choice for just $. I tried a piece of chicken with each of the sauces and it was cooked well and very juicy. The wine list was also impressive because, while it did not have any bad bottles of wine there were plenty of affordable bottles along with the pricier ones, mostly from France and California. I would definitely recommend coming here for dinner and plan to be back myself. The only bit of criticism I can give is that they need another waiter/server on duty because there was only one and he seemed to be a little overwhelmed. The environment it very good. It can be a little cramped but if you don't mind tables being a little close together, I strongly recommend Cocotte. We had the seared scallops on squid ink risotto. So good. I took a look at other dishes and they all looked very good. The server was nice and attentive but the star here is the food. Just spent the wkend in SFO for foodie & wine getaway.  I'm so glad my BFF Michele found Cocotte on yelp!.  It was AWESOME.  If you see B. N. 's review, I don't need to say anymore Everything was fantastic, including the service and the view into an open kitchen where the chef's were completely in tune, no fuss or problems with a totally packed restaurant.  Just beware, you are only allowed one bottle of wine per group, no matter if you have  people or .  Please try Cocotte, you'll not only love the food, service, ambience and location, but the prices were great! Sorry for the late review.  Came here last Saturday night with another couple.  As soon as we entered we instantly were smacked in the face with food aromas emulating from the open kitchen area.  Sure enough we were seated close to this open kitchen area.  We started off with the chicken liver mouse, the assorted duck charcuterie platter, and  rabbit ragout with gnocchi.    What a HOME RUN!!   My wife and friend ordered the beef wellington, our other friend ordered the scallop dish, and I had the  hour pork belly.  I also ordered a side of the brussel sprouts and scallop gratin potatoes.  We all shared a small bite of our  entrees and were equally impressed with everything we had.  Desserts were very good also and it was easily one of the best dining experiences we have had in SF.  We will definitely be back the next time we visit SF. Cocotte is a fabulous little French rotisserie in Nob Hill. We ordered the half rotisserie chicken (because, when in Rome), and had the sea bass bouillabaisse. The sweet potato and pumpkin seed side was my favorite dish. Cocotte has great service, and a friendly, local vibe. It's casual but romantic at the same time. It's small, so make a reservation if you can but you should be able to walk in on a weekday evening. Lovely small French bistro on Hyde street. Found it by chance during a pleasant walk back to the hotel. No tables available (would recommend a reservation for dinner) but were able to snag a seat the bar which is also quite nice. Good wine list, fair number of french reds available of good quality. I had a Cote du Rhone and Bordeaux, both good. BF had the lilet apertif, sweet and yummy. Crusty bread with a pesto type dip brought out which was delicious. For dinner, he had the New York Strip with french fries and I had the Duck Confit with cauliflower. Absolutely delicious, everything. Some of the best steak I've ever tasted. Cauliflower was cheesy and rich, fries superthin with parsley and well salted. Confit also delicious with arugula salad on the side. For dessert we shared the molten cake and each had a glass of port. Wonderful  not so rich that was too much, melting chocolate coming out of the inside, warm cake. We consider ourselves lucky for bumping into this place. We love french food and have had some very good examples of it around the country  this is one of the best. My favorite neighborhood spot. Cozy, intimate ambiance. I like how I can see into the kitchen. The chicken for  is pretty decent. Overall, pretty decent food for reasonable prices. Really delicious meal here.  We had the crab salad (delicious and HUGE portion), the gnocchi with rabbit (also good, but I'd say crab salad was better), and then shared the chicken with brussels and gratin.  Sides were AWESOME  brussels were perfect.  My only negative comment was that the chicken was a little salty for my taste.  Wine list, ambiance, and service (especially our French, hilarious waiter) were also great. It was all around a great dinner. The atmosphere was very cozy and great for a date night. It was rather affordable too. We had a $ bottle of wine,  appetizers, I side, pork belly and sea bass, as well as dessert for around $. For  people in the city with  courses I would say that's pretty good. Highlights of the night were the sea bass, served as a whole cooked fish with bone in. Also the pork belly was so buttery and amazing along with the au gratin potatoes. But the most amazing part was the banana creme brûlée, reminded me a bit of bananas foster but better. Everyone who goes there must try this dessert!Given that I live a couple blocks away, I will definitely go back. I recommend everyone to give this place a try! The  hour pork was so soft, moist and delicious. The accompanying veggies were fabulous! The brussel sprouts were the only thing that could have used improvement  they were too salty. The duck appetizer was delicious and my bf had the beef Wellington which he LOVED and raved about. The service was fine, attentive, not super welcoming, but not unfriendly either. The Napolean dessert was good, but not great. This place is a neighborhood gem! The food was great! One of the best meals we had in our SF visit! Second visit to this somewhat trendy neighborhood restaurant. , confirming there are better choices in Nob Hill. The food was good, not great and pricey especially for a restaurant featuring and open kitchen with line cooks and no chef. The service is where Cocotte really falls down. The wait at an uncrowded bar was over  minutes without being offered a drink; that would have been a good cue to leave and go elsewhere. When the meal was served the appetizer took  minutes to come and was presented in a very hot dish without a word, resulting in a minor burn through accidental contact with an arm. The entree was so slow that the desert order was requested not by one but by three different people before the entree came. The entree was clearly forgotten because after  minutes when asked again it appeared  minutes later. The manager // owner seemed to be aware of the problems and offered a weak apology. The check totaled just under $ pp with tip, including a glass of wine and appetizer and entree and no desert. There are many other great choices in Nob Hill such as the Nob Hill Cafe offer much better value and service. I am really disappointed with Cocotte. A group of  of us went on Friday night and were treated very poorly. I do not recommend going here with a group, or really at all. We brought three bottles of wine to enjoy and they would only let us open one ($ corkage fee). We were not planning on going home after dinner so we had to lug around bottles of wine all night. They completely neglected our table, knowing that they were just going to slap gratuity on our bill at the end.  stars because the food and the ambience were ok, but I will not go back to a restaurant that treated our group the way Cocotte treated us. Go to Seven Hills or Frascati down the street. There you will find top notch food, great ambience and wonderful service. Great little place, please order the Lobster Salad, SO good. Have been here ~x for brunch and once for dinner. I'd recommend both, but brunch is probably my favorite: there is never a wait, and they offer deliciousness that stands out from the usual breakfast options  the verde omelette and the soft scramble are my favorites. Also, free bread! Refined carbs and butter for breakfast? thas what i'm talking about. Dinner was good too, but probably more of a four star experience. We ordered the chicken liver parfait ( stars), duck platter ( stars), rotisserie ( stars; I've had better), the coq au vin ( stars. MEH), potato gratin ( stars; creamy and delicious), cauliflower gratin ( stars. . . tasted like the potato gratin. . . ), scallop risotto ( stars!!), steelhead ( stars), banana creme brulee ( stars; I tasted no banana), and chocolate cake ( stars).  da mayor. Brunch at Cocotte must be still a new secret . . . half tempted to keep it that way!  Came here on Sunday and had a thoroughly enjoyable experience with the food, service, décor, pricing, you name it!We had a :am reservation and was shocked/happy/confused to show up to a completely empty restaurant given I the lines I saw dinner all the time.  Brunch must be a new thing  so i'd suggest getting your fill in before everyone else finds out and the famously long SF brunch lines come to Cocotte!Everything we ordered was fantastic and unique, and priced very affordably: Lobster salad ($)  lots of lobster, sweet corn, crisp lettuce.  Made for such an uber refreshing and unique breakfast treat.  I will order again! Duck confit omelet ($)  lots of savory duck, good omelet Pulled Pork Benedict ($)  lots of pulled pork (they are generous with their protein)  great smoky pork flavor.  Croque monsieur ($, with egg)  probably the least impressive thing we ordered, but still a solid sandwich especially given Cocotte's really super yummy bread. Service was great.  Décor was cozy.  New favorite brunch place. Small and comfortably located on lovely Hyde St. in my neighborhood (Russian Hill). First of all I looked for a place to have a pleasant conversation with my friend on that day. And such it was, an important option we so frequently need these days to hear and to be heard. Now to the food, we shared chicken liver for the starter, a decently sized and tasty portion. My friend choose to try the rotisserie wonders while I opted for coq au vin. Not disappointing at all, portion size was reasonable and fries with garlic sauce were lovely. All was accompanied by a nice light Cote du Rhone. Prices are reasonable and in general atmosphere is relaxing, don't feel the usual weight of ""visiting French restaurant""  BTW  Parking is impossible to find after pm but cable car runs nearby (powell hyde line). Definitely consider to come back and interested to try some nice weekend brunching. Great place.  Nice and cozy.  Food is quite good.  Definitely a nice find The food at Cocotte is quite good, but tonight's service left a lot to be desired. Our server announced within the first  minutes that service would be delayed. The ""kitchen was understaffed and wasn't equipped to handle the reservations,"" he said. Very poor planning and frankly the issue tonight was the sub par service and nothing to do with the kitchen. As an SF resident, I'll expect more next time!  As an aside, we can all see into the kitchen and it wasn't that packed! When you see Yelp display the category ""French"" for any establishment  one starts thinking about a meal that will drain the wallet for some petty portions.  Don't get me wrong  I love French cuisine and appreciate that the things their food does for the palate cannot have money governing it. The wait staff and servers were very kind, knowledgeable, and professional.  My girlfriend headed in first for a seat as I knew it would be a journey to find parking.  After about  minutes I walked into the nice, dim lit restaurant to see that we had a pretty awesome table  a little nook behind some curtains with a candle on the table. We glanced at the menu and already knew what we had to get  duck platter for starters, half chicken, pork belly, potatoes gratin, and the fries. The bread is delicious here, but if you ordered what I ordered do watch your intake.  The duck platter sports a lot of delectables but what stood out the most was the duck breast  this was absolutely delicious with the accompaniment of pickled onions and whole grain mustard. Now onto the generous serving of half a chicken.  I sliced this thing up and each piece looked like it was sweating  that's how juicy this chicken was.  I tried each of the sauces but really appreciated the original rotisserie flavor of the chicken  I ate most of the chicken without any of the sauces.  The potatoes gratin I got for a side dish were absolutely amazing  I never had gratins cut so thinly; it is delicious when it is this thin. The pork belly is chalked full of flavor  it actually came off a bit too rich for our tastes but who can blame it the dang pork belly was cooked for  hours.  The fries ordered with this were probably some of the best french fries I have had at a sit down restaurant. Topped with  glasses of wine and champagne, this was a great meal for a random date night in the nice area of Nob Hill. The place is small, snugly warm and comfortable. We missed out on dessert since we came in late for our reservation after many wasted minutes finding a parking spot; so be on time if you want a full experience. Thankfully we were able to finish our course when we received our check, otherwise it would have been awkward still chewing our food while being asked to leave. I ordered half chicken and it was very good. I will definitely come again for it and hopefully on time next time. I was trying to find a nice restaurant on a recent trip to SF and found Cocotte on yelp. I made a reservation here for a Sunday night and it wasn't too busy at pm. The place was super small and dark but cozy with a nice ambiance. Food: They give you complimentary bread and tapenade and it was excellent! That spread was an amazing mix of olive oil, olives and capers. We ordered  entrees: the scallops with squid ink risotto ($), a half chicken with fries ($), and pork belly with potato and goat cheese gratin ($). My absolute favorite was the scallop dish. I've had squid ink risotto before and this was out of this world! And it doesn't turn your teeth black. The rice was cooked perfectly and was rich and creamy and topped with basil foam. These were all flavors I had never had before. The scallops were succulent but a little on the salty side. The pork belly was my second favorite. Thick slices of pork were served on a bed of greens and caramelized onions and veal au jus. The broth was full of flavor and I liked how the pork belly was very lean. The gratin was decent but nothing spectacular. The half chicken was my least favorite. I thought the seasoning/spices on the skin were good but again, nothing special. The meat was also a little dry and the  sauces that it was served with did not stand out. The side of fries were tasty and I loved the aioli is was served with. Prices: Reasonable for french food. Service: We were very pleased with the service. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. Bathroom: The area outside the bathroom was an eyesore and smelled bad because the dish washing area is right in front of it. The bathroom itself was nicely done but the door is tiny. Good thing I'm little. Parking: This was a challenge. You probably won't find street parking since it's located in a residential area but we were able to find a space   blocks south of the restaurant. Enjoyed a nice brunch here.  C had the coq au vin which came with three tasty sauces, and I opted for the eggs florentine with a side of house smoked salmon.  I found their salmon to be rather fishy.  Not sure I would return for bunch, but some of the dinner options sound fantastic  I would come back to try the seafood pot pie and/or bouillabaisse. Really a fantastic spot on Hyde. Very cute but tight squeeze. We went on Sunday night and it was full. Had the muscles for an app, really fantastic broth! Then we split the whole rotisserie chicken with potato and goat cheese gratin. Chicken was really good, and organic! Came with some good sauces. Chocolate molten cake was delicious. All in all, great small neighborhood restaurant. Will come back for sure! I had the Coq Au Vin and the cheese plate, both were beautifully prepared and tasted excellent. The ambiance was great as well. Overall, I enjoyed the small restaurant atmosphere, but it would be nice if the tables were a little farther apart. For such high quality food, the price was excellent as well. The servers were very nice and friendly and understanding that there was difficulty finding parking as I was over  minutes late for my reservation. Overall, this is an excellent restaurant and very enjoyable. Nice little restaurant up Nob Hill.  Friendly staff.  Great rendition of half chicken with various sauces on the side.  Very good meal. Cocotte is one of my top  favorite dinner spots in San Francisco. They check the box on literally every category that matters: () Food  Check; () Ambiance  Check; () Service  Check (note: VERY friendly French servers); () Price  Check; () Everyone leaves feeling like they got a great deal  CHECK CHECK CHECK. I've been here  times and still never tire of it. I highly recommend this place to anyone. Absolutely fantastic.  Wine, service, food, dessert.  Highly recommended. Enjoy this hidden gem of a French bistro!  The portions may be small, but it's just right in terms of flavor and finesse for fine dining with a cozy, quaint and humble ambiance.  Try their Loch Duart salmon ""Koulibiac"", Bloomsdale spinach, maitake , basmati rice, lobster bisque for a seafood version of chicken pot pie with salmon.  Save room for any of their desserts whether it's their banana crème brulee, warm black cherry ""clafoutis"", vanilla chantilly, clafoutis, or Molten chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream, red berries & green tea coulis. The staff is friendly and helpful.  It's a great feeling to sit in a room with a high energy vibe in front of their kitchen.  Bon apetit! Nice little restaurant in a hotspot with no parking. Did get a bit full at  on a Friday so make a reservation. The waiter was patient with us because someone from our group had a difficulty parking. We ordered quite a bit of things; we ordered the duck platter which was alright. I personally am not a fan of salami so the duck salami did not appeal to me but the duck breast and rillette was good. For entrees, I'd recommend the beef wellington and the duck confit. Yum! The bone marrow that came with the beef wellington was delicious and fatty. The rotisserie chicken did not stand out to me, it was a delicious chicken that I would probably compare to costco or boston market (sorry!). For the sides, I would recommend the fries and cauliflower. The potato gratin was a bit weird to me because of the goat cheese but it was still good. Lastly, for dessert we got the apple tart and the creme brulee. Apple tart was amazing and I absolutely loved the caramel! The banana creme brulee was such a disappointment! The creamy base was more of an egg tart than anything. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a small french restaurant. Good service. Good food. First of all, I love small independent restaurant like this. Very under stated, not much hypes, and they let their food do the talking. This is a total pleasant surprise. I was visiting SF, and my friends and I planned to go to Sons and Daughters, but something came up. We had to cancel our dinner. I did not want to stay at the hotel by myself, so I randomly pick a place near my hotel by Nob Hill. I sat by the bar, the manager was very attentive and friendly. He made a few suggestion from the menu. I ordered roasted chicken with side of potato gratin and a glass of Russian River Pinot Noir. My dinner was beautifully presented. I love the ambiance of the place. It's very cozy and lively. I would definitely come back. This place was so adorable.  I recently lost my job and the gentleman I'm seeing was also looking for work.  We tossed around the idea of going to Paris.  Fortunately (well. . . unfortunately), he got a job super quickly  so we settled on going to eat some French food.  Cocotte was where we decided to go. I made a reservation, and they put us in a corner section with super comfy chairs (and some drapes we could draw if we felt like having some privacy  which we didn't use).  The place was absolutely ADORABLE.  I was slightly afraid of the restaurant seeming too fancy/pretentious, but it was exactly the opposite.  The staff was attentive and considerate, the food was just incredible, and the ambiance was spot on.  We were even sat next to a table of French people who drank wine and talked the entire night.  It was a very immersive, very french experience. I highly recommend this place.  I will definitely be adding it to the list of places I frequent. Arrived for our  PM reservation to see only one other party at the restaurant.  They sat the  of us underneath the stairwell, which they painted dark brown and boarded off on three sides. The table faces to the kitchen so we felt secluded and unable to see what else is going on or see any sunlight.  A bit strange since there were about  open tables.  We requested to be moved and they so graciously moved us one table over just out from underneath the stairwell, but still felt secluded.  (Their dining room did not fill up and they had about  open tables when we left so I doubt they had other reservations for the other tables that would prohibit them from seating us elsewhere).  Servers were friendly and attentive. The food,  I loved the rabbit app.  My friend enjoyed his lobster salad.  For entree, I had the beef wellington with bone marrow. . This was my first time having bone marrow.  It seemed to lack flavor and had a thick layer of salt on it.  The beef wellington did not have much flavor either, a bit bland.  The puff pastry was burned in places.  I asked for it medium rare but arrived more on the med well side.  I liked the area the restaurant was located but there is NO PARKING.  We had to circle for   minutes and went several blocks in each direction to find parking.  Not sure we would go back A solid four stars. I came here on a Saturday night for a girls' night out. My gf had made reservations a few days before, and we got one for  at : pm. It was during the Dine About Town season, so I made sure to check out the menu beforehand and was excited. When we arrived (on time) our table wasn't ready yet; took about  mins to get seated. We ordered a bottle of the pinot blanc to start, and decided between the  of us, we would order two DAT sets and add an additional entree and share the appetizers/desserts. We got the Frisee salad  I love this salad in general, and the sliced pieces of duck complimented the salad really well. I also really liked the dressing. Mussels  Good, but just average. My gf commented that the sauce was a little bland for her taste, but it was fine for me. Pork osso bucco  I really loved the polenta. The pork was OK  I felt it wasn't as tender as I would've liked. Banana creme brulee  one word: yum!Chocolate cake  Not overly sweet  we all loved this. Would definitely come back again to try their regular menu. Our waiter was also very attentive and provided good recommendations. A note of caution  we took Lyft here, but I know this area is difficult for parking, so be prepared if you're driving! What great neighborhood gem. I almost feel bad writing about this place  I want to support it and keep it in business, but I don't want other people to find out about this place, so I can always get in. Selfish, I know. Everything we had was great, the duck platter, the half chicken were solid. The coq au vin blew my mind! We also ordered the halibut which was tremendous. I wish they had a full bar, but there wine and beer selection is good. I love how they serve in cast iron skillets and Le Creuset dishes. I plan to become a regular, and with the reasonable prices, that might me easy. I stumbled across this restaurant on yelp & open table.  It looked reasonably priced for a french menu & family dinner.  Decided to go with it.  We were able to get the st reservation on a Sunday evening for .  The menu was simple and at the time they also offered a pre fixe menu for the dine about town event going on.   of us opted for the pre fixe which was ok for the price.  My husband seemed to have the best dish off the menu and he opted for the chicken with the cocotte gratin.  My pre fixe was decent  kale souffle and their banana creme brulee was delicious.  My mom enjoyed the mussels and gnocchi starters and we all shared a confit spread.  Parking could be tough but prices are truly reasonable. This is a hidden gem in San Francisco; the food absolutely delicious. I live in Alaska and haven't had the opportunity to try much French cuisine, but Cocotte made me want to change that! The cheese gratin appetizer was divine, and my dinner scallops with basil foam and risotto was fantastic. I am looking forward to my next visit! perfect place for a french dinner. the restaurant is small ish so it's not super loud inside. the food is slow. we came with some old friends to catch up, so this is perfect for us. we stayed until they were closing, but they didn't rush us to finish. the food is also very good but nothing spectacular. the duck was good. the wellington was ok. the pastry wasn't puffy or thick enough, but the steak was good. the rotisserie chicken was alright according to my friend. you should definitely get the molten chocolate cake for the dessert. you know do what the french do. eat multiple courses, hang out, have long conversations over wine. and you know that it's good french food when the servers speak with a heavy french accent! You just can't believe how good this chicken is until you are stuffing your mouth and wondering if it is wrong to order more. And the sides are terrific! If you can, and you are on a date, try to get the little private table that is tucked away. I sort of hate myself for giving this place such a great review because I don't want it to become overly popular. NB: This is a French restaurant! The service is slow and French, so don't expect a peppy American waitress checking in on you every second. My friend's co worker recommended this place, so I met her here after she got off work in the financial district. I drove up from San Jose and, luckily, found a parking spot on Hyde. I made the reservation for two at pm on a Wednesday evening, and we had no trouble being seated. The interior is cozy and clean. There is a small bar on the right when you enter, perfect for a quick drink after work. The seating area is modern yet tasteful: wooden tables, proper chairs, and just the right amount of light. This place would be great for a date. It's the perfect size, in my opinion  really great layout. Our waiter was French, so it was hard to understand what he was saying most of the time, but we managed and smiled. I ordered the / chicken and butter beans, while my friend ordered the halibut. We are both picky eaters and we loved our meal. The fish and chicken were excellently prepared. She ordered another bean side dish that looked better than mine. I think the butter bean ragu was a little unimaginative, but fresh nonetheless. I didn't like its aftertaste. After only two small entrees and sides we were stuffed! Overall, the total came out to $ with tip, which is not bad for this city! There was a sign that said it's now open for brunch, so we might head back and try it again. Tip: We didn't drink, but the wine list looked tempting and extensive! If you love wine, check this place out. Service was slow. The place is cosy. But the food was very good. The rabbit for starters was amazing. Will definitely come back. This restaurant dazzled us!  The food, service, ambience i unrivld. . . we will be back soon and often! The appetizers were good, I had the rabbit a la coutarde;  my friend had the butter lettuce salad. They were out of the coq au vin at  pm on a weekday,  so, my friend ordered their Creekstone rib eye steak, which she has asked for medium; however, it was over done and a bit on the salty.    Beef Wellington I have ordered it med rare; it came as more on the medium to well done, the brown sauce was salty, and it was not good at all, and Burnt on the pastry crust. The beef was a bit dry. The pastry crust was burnt.  It had few large slices of mushroom.   These dishes were simply disappointing, and my friend felt the same about her creekstone ribeye. Both of their beef dishes were simply not done well, and I don' t thinks I will go back again since there are too many French Restaurants in SF.  I would recommend they work on their meat dishes or just not serve it at the restaurant. Boutique restaurant with delicious French food  we savored every bite which reminded us of our time @ Paris. Everyone was helpful and the ambiance was romantic. Reasonably priced   people with appetizers, entrees and bottle of wine for $ inclusive of tips. Will def go again! WOW! So good. My bf and I walked in on a whim and decided to eat at the bar. I had the half chicken while he had the coq au vin. Everything was great. Especially the dipping sauces that came with the chicken. The vibe was casual yet great for a date night. I will most certainly come back! great atmosphere, yummy food, great service I really enjoyed this restaurant. The service was spectacular, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was very charming. My boyfriend and I shared the chicken liver pate (which was good, but not the best that I've had), a delicious frisee salad and a very tasty half chicken. We also got a side order of spagetti squash, which was unfortunately very oily and barely eatable, and an order of roasted potatoes, which were also a bit greasy for my liking. Aside from the squash and potatoes (which were minor parts of the meal), I really enjoyed this dinner. A neighborhood gem!  Great food and great service within walking distance of my apartment. Who knew rotisseri chicken could be so good. Decent restaurant for the neighborhood. Not necessarily a destination must go place. Food was not bad not good. Good butter lettuce salad and banana Creme brûlée. Found a piece of wire in the beef Wellington. If you live in the hood it's an option place. Couldn't ask for better food or service in SF. So upset I live on the east coast. . . ; ) Beef Wellington is spot on. Great sides, even better dips, wine selection is superb! Romantic date spot. Will be back! Love this little hidden gem! Affordable french food, good wines and great athmosphere. Tips: on a sunny day you can enjoy the outside seatings: ) Great service, but food was just OK. Nice ambiance for a date. Great atmosphere and good food. Not everything I tried here was a hit, but I'll be back to try more things on the menu. We shared a couple of standard French restaurant appetizers. Both were good. * Farm eggs Meurette (egg poached in Pinot Noir, served with bone marrow, brioche, salad)  $* Duck platter (duck and sunchoke rilette, duck salami, house smoked duck breast, walnut muffin, pickles, grain mustard)  $* Halibut with asparagus, peas, morels sauce  $Perfectly cooked fish. Delicious sauce. There were a couple of things we tried that I would NOT order again: * Beef Wellington  $The beef was a bit dry. The pastry crust was burnt. Instead of a layer of mushrooms, duck liver, and prosciutto or bacon between the beef and the puff pastry, there were only a few large slices of mushroom. Luella serves a much better beef Wellington. * Broccoflower with lemon oil and anchovies  $A bit dry. I didn't really taste the anchovies or the lemon oil. * Sorbet trio (apple, strawberry, lemon)  $Yummy! Service was fine, but our server was a bit pushy when making recommendations for food and wine. He told us exactly which appetizers he thought we should order, and he overruled our wine choice too. My family had an amazing dining experience at Cocotte. Everything was the best of the best from the food to the service to the affordable prices. What a great addition to the neighborhood!I tried many dishes and my favorite was the half chicken with cocotte/side. You get to pick a side from a list with things like potato gratin, butter beans and broccoli. I got the french fries as my side and they were excellent! The chicken is a must try, and half a chicken is bigger than I thought. I also tried the roasted cauliflower and it came out piping hot and delicious. Next time I want to try the pot pie. . . The service was very good, attentive, but not pushy. They have many affordable bottles of wine to choose from and we enjoyed the one we picked. Overall, we really enjoyed our meal and will be back! I was very pleasantly surprised when dining here for the first time. First off, they were willing to accommodate my last minute party size change (I added one more person). The service was very helpful and genuine. The wine list was affordable and great!All in all, a very AFFORDABLE neighborhood gem!Order the following:The duck plateRotisserie duck with truffle (this was a special for the night)Duck confitOh gee, can you tell i like duck?!?!I just love love love the fact that you can dine on good French food in the city, and still not break the bank! Such a cute place in Nob Hill! I didn't even know it existed until I was looking for something French in the neighborhood. Good service, good atmosphere, and good food. The Farm Egg Meurette was really interesting and tasted good! Served with bone barrow. I highly recommend this dish. They had a special for appetizer also. . scallops carpaccio which I liked, and pretty presentation with watermelon radish. For dinner I ordered the half roast chicken, a cocotte (side dish) of potato and goat cheese gratin. They also give you  sauces for dipping. Wow I really liked the chicken. . cooked perfectly and tasted really good! I can see why they are known for this dish. My partner had the Hedgehog Pot & Pie. . which is a mushroom haha! It was good but too tiny I think. For dessert we shared a chocolate cake fondant which was yummy. Overall I really liked this place. I liked the sense of adventure we felt in not knowing what some of the dishes were. And their menu is inventive and I think playful. How very French! Excellent!I started with a glass of Sancerre and the Frisée salad accompanied by the bread. It was wonderful. I followed this with the scallops and black ink risotto. It too was absolutely  great. But to end the meal in a most heavenly manner was the banana creme brûlée, Perhaps this was the best rendition of brûlée that I have ever had.  The service was spectacular so I am unsure of other comments that were not good. My waiter was very attentive and the other waiters would be watching as well to take care of my meal without any  requests. They were never too attentive but ""just right. "" Stop by here for a wonderful meal. The half rotisserie chicken has incredible flavor.  I also recommend the beans with ragu and the potatoes au gratin.  Definitely returning here. Such a great ambiance! The restaurant isn't very big and the tables are definitely close together. However, the lighting is perfect and the rustic feel of the restaurant complements the  food. I had the bone marrow appetizer and the rotisserie chicken for my entree. If you're a bone marrow kind of person, I highly recommend! It came with a pinot noir poached egg that made the entire mix just absolutely fantastic. The chicken was good, but I've had better.  All in all, I think this restaurant is perfect for dates. We'll definitely be back soon. Solid French bistro in the Nob Hill area.  Same location as where Hyde Street Bistro was. All the reviews here about this place are pretty much spot on.  Loved this little romantic spot. We started off with some lapin à la moutarde in kale, which was a surprising combination that worked well.  Quite tasty. I went with the Coq Au Vin, while she went for the scallops in ink risotto. We also had a couple of glasses of the burgundy pinot. Finishing things off, we had the tarte tatin along another glass of red, but of the recommended Malbec. EVERYTHING was excellent.  Seasoning was optimal and everything came in hot (not lukewarm. )Service was a definite highlight.  As in VERY GOOD.  Pleasant demeanor and not once were we rushed.  In a town that is all about turning over tables . . . it was very refreshing to feel like . . . back in France actually where you'll have the table for the evening if you want. All in . . . we came out ahead I'd say for around $ + tip.  I gave a pretty good tip considering the unusually strong service. So I actually highly recommend Cocotte, given the overall quality and experience. No real negatives really.  If anything, maybe the decor is just ok, but I thought it was appropriate for a bistro like setting. Moist and wonderful chicken with great sides. It's like the best of a rotisserie place within a swank/classy wine bar/trendy cafe. Highly recommend. After take a nice walk down through Chinatown to Little Italy for gelatto! Ambiance  cozy, intimate, lively, rustic, dark furnishings with warm lighting. Enjoyable with a date or one or two good friends. Food  I ordered the half chicken, mostly white meat. It was well seasoned and came with  different dipping sauces (nutty, pesto, buttery tasting). My friend ordered the steak, cooked medium. Juicy and cooked to order, and great paired with a red. There is a good selection of by the glass. The banana creme brulee was yummy! The caramelized sugar on top had a nice twist to it with slices of soft ripe banana, and the creamy dessert underneath was heavenly. Ironically, I bookmarked this place on Yelp to try the beef wellington and coq au vin but tried neither this time. I would return to try them. Apparently cocottes are simple side dishes. Interesting name and cute concept to name your restaurant after the simple, underemphasized part of your menu. In a word: Fantastic! We loved this place. Parking is a chore given the location, of course. But we arrived right at opening time without a reservation and they sat us a two top in a little romantic nook. We shared everything: a whole chicken, roasted potatoes, cheese plate, wine, and salad. The chicken was some of the best I've ever had. We will likely be back again and again to this romantic little spot on Hyde. I really enjoyed it here. Good service. Great food. And reasonably priced. The frissee salad was super tastyRabbit ragu over spaetzle was unique and deliciousA half rotisserie chicken; moist in the middle crispy on the outside accompanied by three nice sauces. DO try the banana creme brulee!I was impressed. Its not that often that I go to a restaurant and want to try everything on the menu. I'd give this place .  stars. Loved the atmosphere  as other said, tables are close together, but that didn't disrupt us. There is one cool table in this little alcove area, we were sat right next to this one, and because of the design, their conversation was amplified, but still wasn't too distracting. Service was a mixed bag  the waiter was great, very friendly, French and initially it was off to a good start, but it was nearly impossible to get his attention throughout our meal and he never came back to check on our drinks. Even when he would come to grab something off the table when clearly, we could barely catch him to point out empty wine glasses and request another glass. Same thing with the water. We sat with empty glasses for a while before finally flagging him down and asking for another bottle. He just wasn't very attentive and they're probably missing out on additional drink orders. As far as the food, we split the frisee salad with quail eggs and pork belly. This was delicious  a lot of pork belly, though I would've prefered the eggs closer to poached than hard boiled like they were. The bread they serve is really good. For the main, my husband got the rotisserie chicken with a side of poatoes and I got the duck confit with lentils and a side of cauliflower gratin. We both agreed that salad was the best thing we had, but our mains were solid. My confit could have had crispier skin, but the meat was still tender which doesn't always happen. The lentils were a nice compliment and the cauliflower was good, but probably wouldn't go for it again. My husband enjoyed his chicken. We ordered the chocolate lava cake for dessert and while we finished the whole thing, I wouldn't exactly call it a lava cake  even when you got to the center, nothing oozed out. I guess it was a little over cooked. It wasn't bad, but not as indulgent as we were expecting and definitely didn't live up to the name. I think this is a nice choice, but they could improve upon their overall service of checking on you throughout your meal. Can't explain how happy I was to discover this tucked away charming restaurant. The ambiance is rustic, simple and warm. Loved the exposed kitchen, felt very intimate with the chef preparing meals right there. Large wine pours. . . need I say more?The food was delicious. Definitely order the mussels to start and the butternut squash spaghetti side I promise no disappointment there. The rotisserie chicken is perfectly prepared juicy large pieces of white meat accompanied by three ridiculously tasty dipping sauces. I plan on being a regular at this place! J'adore! Cocotte was a solid .  stars but the price pushed it up to  stars for me.  I am slightly biased towards French food but this means one of two things: If it's mediocre, I won't be back; if it's delicious, I crave it until I have it again. This fell closer to the delicious side for me and the wine cemented its place further. The wait staff was attentive and very knowledgeable about the dishes and wine list. Their menu was somewhat limited regarding entrees but the options they do offer are flavorful and filling.   Also when I go to a good French place, I expect that it could take the better part of  hours for a meal, because it's French culture. Not saying it took that long but be warned, don't come here if you're in a rush We started things off with the cheese plate which had a fair assortment of french cheeses and both my date and I liked them all (especially with the bread). We ordered the half chicken with two sides (potatoes au gratin and broccoflower) and  and a bottle of their Malbec. In a word: delicious. The bill at the end came out to an almost even $ for two people (which is less than it would have been for just about any other French place of note in SF).  I will most definitely be back and would recommend this place to people who enjoy fine dining and good wine at a reasonable price. Tried out this restaurant since they were featured in SF's Dine About Town.  Good service, Great Food at a reasonable price.  Everything was delicious from appetizer to dessert.  Their creme brulee was soo good. . . very fattening and full of calories, but it's worth it.  You should come to this restaurant just for it's desserts, if you like sweets as much as I do.  =) dinner was good, simple, clean. The rotisserie chicken w/  dipping sauces was definitely the highlight of the evening. The roasted chicken is fantastic, and well priced. The entrees are more expensive so I'd recommend just going for that chicken with some sides and appetizers. I'd order one side per person and share. The cheesy cauliflower is amazing. Had take out food  nights ago and I am here to give it a thumbs up!  I ordered half a chicken with a romanesco broccoli and potato with the chicken drippings side (one side of your choice is included with the price of the chicken). The chicken also comes with  types of dipping sauces, which I thought was an interesting gimmick.  But after trying them all out, I'm here to tell you that this gimmick rocks!  Though my favorite is the garlic and parsley (gremolata) sauce, both the roasted pepper (romesco) and the mushroom sauces are also quite fantastic. As for the chicken, it was moist, flavorful and meaty.  Everything you'd want from a roast.  The sides have subtle flavors so as not to detract from the star of the meal but were still able to be enjoyed distinctly.  The sauces were used whenever we felt the urge to dip with all  dishes, with very satisfying results.  So, what are you waiting for? Good food. Nice ambience. . . . . . This is sort of typical for a smaller place but just something that drives me a bit nuts. . . . . I really do not want to hear the next table's conversation or be sitting  inches from the next table! (I'm just saying)! Other then that, the cheese plate is great and my clams had a very good sauce. The service was good, a bit on the slow side getting started but otherwise the staff is helpful and attentive. Cocotte is definitely a sweet neighborhood spot, no question. I was excited to dive into the menu after perusing all the reviews and photos. We had a : reservation on a Sunday night and when we got there the place was poppin'. It's cozy and intimate, the menu reads all kinds of deliciousness and the wine is mostly French, yay! Ultimately, the I find a fair value in this place, given that San Fran can be pricey. The food was nothing revolutionary and the service could use improvement, but all in all it was good. We started with and order of mussels and smoked salmon. My only memory of the mussels is that they were unremarkable. There was nothing really notable about them. I expect more from the bay area. The smoked salmon on other hand was easily the highlight of the evening. Served with blood orange, creme fraiche and dill it was buttery perfection. Three of ordered the roast chicken to share. It comes with three sauces  gremolata, romesco and mushroom  I enjoyed all of them . There was plenty of chicken for the three of us and for real, it every bite was juicy. Was it the most flavorful roasted chicken ever? No. But it was a solid roasted chicken none the less. We also ordered spaghetti squash and goat cheese potato gratin for side. Both were tasty. I would've liked to taste more goat cheese on the gratin, but it wasn't a deal breaker. Service was a bit disjointed. We were seated, the server took drink orders literally one at a time and brought them to the table one at a time. Perhaps because the bar was at arms length from out table? Still. . . . awkward. . . and inefficient. He disappeared a lot throughout the night and really hurt his check average because I could've easily ordered more vino. , but if ya snooze you lose. All in all, Cocotte, is a nice, but in a city that offers so many culinary and service experiences, I won't necessarily be rushing back here on my next visit. If I live in Russian Hill, I'd maybe I have been to Cocotte twice and will be going back. The first time I ordered take out and ordered half a chicken, the goat cheese potatoes, French fries, and spaghetti squash. The food was spectacular. My friend and I were basically fighting over the chicken. It falls apart effortlessly and is so well flavored you don't even need the sauce they give to you on the side. It is a pretty good deal if you share half a chicken and some sides. The second time I went I ate there. I made a reservation and was seated right away. The service was great and the waitress was really helpful in guiding us through the menu. My mom and I split the chicken and again it was outstanding! I usually shy away from eating meat on bones but not with Cocotte chicken. It is divine. My dad ordered something else on the menu and although it was good he said he would get the chicken next time since it was exceptional. The goat cheese potatoes are also a personal favorite. Great place to eat! The service was excellent and friendly, the food also excellent.  This is a cozy small family owned restaurant, my favorite type.  A nice find.  They specialize is rotisserie, mostly chicken, duck and quail.  The wine list is great. Phenomenal! You absolutely can not go wrong with anything on the menu. The Egg ""Meurette"" (Pinot Noir poached egg and a side of roasted Bone Marrow) was very very good and the Beef Wellington was incredible; cooked to absolute perfection. The Rotisserie Chicken was perfectly cooked (moist and the skin was nice and crispy. ) The Coq Au VIn was very good too; very flavorful and not soupy like how most places serve it. Their Chocolate Cake and Apple Tartine was a perfect end to the night. The wine list consists of a very good selection from all over France and Local Napa varieties. Service was outstanding! What a gem that we stumbled upon during a poorly planned Saturday night on Hyde. Despite our Open Table neglect we were able to slide into an : reservation while down the street and I'm so glad we did! We ended up sitting at the tall table with stools up against the wall where the kind French Maitre d' offered us to sit while we waited for a proper table in the dining room  but honestly the spot was comfortable, and the vantage point was great, overlooking both the bar and the dining room, and, well, we were hungry, so there we sat. Features included service as unhurried as proper French service should be. A nice terse selection of French and Californian wines by the glass. A rotisserie and cocotte menu meant to be shared. We ordered the half roast chicken with frites, and I couldn't resist the coq au vin. Simply divine prep, incredibly tender chicken across the board, and my coq came on top of gratin potato that was to die for. I almost forgot  the meal started off with a delicious and substantial frisee salad with hardboiled quail eggs and big chunks of pancetta. The whole evening summed up one of the reasons why I love SF dining so much  surprises abound in every neighborhood and sometimes, a poorly laid plan can result in a wonderful experience. David, our server, was lovely. There when you needed him and not bugging you when you didn't. The food was divine. Four of us had the mussels (insane!), cheese plate, rib eye, Wellington and duck absolutely everything was cooked to perfection and delight. Suggested wine pairing was superb. Can't wait to go back. Seriously the best food we've enjoyed in California in years. Excellent! We had the cheese plate, two half chickens with the roaster cauliflower cocotte and fries, and shared a delicious banana crème brûlée. The place has a nice mellow vibe, we'll be back! It's easy to review Cocotte: good food; good service; good value. I started my meal with a bowl of butternut squash veloute (soup to you and me).  The serving was very ample and most importantly I could close my eyes and know what I was eating.  That to me is the test of a soup. An endive salad with dungeness crab and avocado was very well done.  Again the serving was ample and everything on the plate was fresh and delicious.  That is me test for a salad. Coq au vin was also very nicely prepared.  The chicken was falling off the bone and the vegetables were tasty.  For a stew like this my test is whether the vegetables retain their taste or whether it braises away.  Here everything retained taste and texture as well. A side of cauliflower gratin was lovely and my pour of pinot noir was generous.  Cocotte is a winner. Nice  remodel and very yummy chicken. My crab salad starter had an atrociously long hair buried in it.  So minus one star. Our new favorite neighborhood spot. We used to live in Cow Hollow and haunt Gamine, and we are thrilled Cocotte is nearby our new place. Sit at the bar. Drink Chateauneuf du Pape. Eat the liver pate and beef filet Welli. Sigh. Relax. Re do following week. We had a Christmas Evening dinner reservation for pm. Let me repeat that. pm on Christmas. When I walk in at :pm, I expect to be seated within   minutes. . . because guess what? Thats why you make a reservation. When we walked in, we knew this wasn't going to happen. Three other couples with reservations were at the bar waiting for a table to open up, too. This was going to be a   minute wait. . . with. . wait for it. . . a reservation. . . on Christmas evening. Not acceptable. So, after the pudgy bartender/waiter/hostess told us we better have a drink from the bar because the wait will be a while, we left. No apology, just a smart ass offer. If this were  in a saloon, I would have grabbed his bowtie from across the bar and reminded him what the word ""reservation"" means through a Clint Eastwood esque whispery tone. May I remind you, it's Christmas. Here are some tips for Cocotte:) If you expect it to be crowded, make your reservation intervals longer than  min. ) Don't accept reservations. Be like a Chinese restaurant in Inner Sunset and use a white board as a waiting list. ) Apologize when you make people with reservations wait. Especially on Christmas. . . ) Close shop. I'm telling everyone I know to go to Chapeau. My co workers and I went to this restaurant last night and I don't think it will be worth the money or the time to go again.  The service was terrible and the food was mediocre.  We were the first customers to arrive when they opened for dinner, there were  of us and waiting on  more to arrive.  We got seated and offered something to drink while waiting for our other friend to arrive. The waiter kept approaching us to ask about what we wanted to drink after we said ""just water for now"". Then started pushing if we wanted to get some appetizer. We ordered the dine about town and an extra appetizer so he'll go away.  Soon after that our friend came and our meal started to come.  In the middle of dinner, they switched our plates for clean ones since we were all sharing the food.  Which was a nice gesture, all but one friend.  When she requested/asked why she didn't get a clean plate the waiter replied, ""because you got the scallops. . . "" Wait. . what? You should have seen our faces in disbelief.  So she demanded for one and he brought one over. We weren't even done with our food when the waiter kept coming back to our table to ask if we were done with the dishes.  Um. . . no!  We still have food in there!! So towards the end of our dinner we had some leftovers and we asked the waiter to put what was left in ""to go"" containers.  The waiter brings the food back in which seems to be a used or old plastic container.  When we asked the [manager/owner?] if we can get another container because . the top of the container didn't close all the way and . it looked like a used container.  He told us ""this is the only one we have"" then walked off.  I guess no one else for the rest of the evening is going to get a ""to go"" container because ""there's no other ones left""?Anyway, this restaurant was a total joke for what we paid for.  And on top of everything we experienced the waiter had the ordeal to add % on top of our bill.  We did not have a party of . . . !  There were only the  of us. . . . maybe he needs to go back to school to learn how to count.  ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS people. . . . ! Went here and had the half chicken with my family. The owner was there and was very friendly. He gave us great recommendations on wine and some of the side dishes. The chicken itself was amazingly tasty and even for a big eater  the half was plenty of food. I hear you can get take out chicken, which I am definitely going to do some night on my way home! Since we only had time for one DAT choice this year, I finally chose Cocotte after poring over multiple restaurant menu choices.  We had reservations for  but still had to wait about   minutes since the place is small and was completely packed so reservations are definitely a must on a weekend if you have your heart set on this place.  Despite our intentions of just doing the DAT menu, I ended up reconsidering while going over the regular menu as we were waiting.  Everything looked so good that we wanted to literally try everything but settled for a sampling of  dishes.  Food:  Hubby ordered from the DAT menu while I ordered  apps and an entree from the regular menu.  .  DAT App  Goat cheese spinach souffle which was a light, airy, and savory souffle that I wish was on their regular menu.  Hopefully the owner is reading this and will consider adding it on as it was that good!! .  Chicken and liver parfait  Creamy and rich ""pate"" and so deliciously complimented with the red onion and marsala jam.   We could've used an additional piece of toast so you might want to save a small piece of your regular bread for what doesn't fit on your levain toast  .  Farm Eggs ""meurette""  One egg poached in Pinot that again could use more brioche to absorb all the delicious egg yolk that mingles so well with the bone marrow.  I literally did take one of the pieces of baguette from our bread basked and wiped up every morsel of flavor left on that plate .  DAT Entree  Porc Shank Osso Bucco with potatos gratin and cauliflower  Although good, it wasn't as tender as I expected and not as flavorful as our other dishes and therefore the least memorable of all so for DAT entrees, you may want to go with one of the other two choices which the couple next to us raved about. .  Coq Au Vin  I rarely order chicken when I go out since there's usually something else that catches my eye so I was pleasantly suprised at how much I enjoyed Cocotte's Coq Au Vin.  It was fall of the bone tender with a stew of carrots and mushroom that blended so well that sometimes you visually can't even tell if the piece you are spearing with your fork is mushroom or chicken so just let your taste buds talk to you.      . DAT Dessert  Banana crème brulee  Visually, this is a dessert for the eyes as much as the stomach, so much so that the couple next to us changed their order once they saw ours.  (BTW, if you were the couple next to us on Sat, would love to friend you on Yelp for more of your great recommendations).  Unlike most creme brulees, they had a thin layer of bananas on top before torching it so the bananas are still warm when you first bite into it and the rest of it still cool and creamy. Parking:  Unless you have great parking karma, allocate yourself at least   minutes to find parking and expect to walk a good   blocks so wear comfy shoes or get dropped off at the restaurant.  Service:  Although we had to wait a little bit even with reservations, they did periodically come by to give us updates which was nice and definitely make reservations.  Ambiance:  Because it is small, once it is packed, it is noisy and the spaces between the tables are small so may not be the best place for a quiet romantic evening out UNLESS you get the  person table in the alcove or maybe if you go right when they open.  But if you're there for the food and the energy, it's got both. Love it!  Owner is a nice guy. Cook  is hot :) And food is delicious and good size of portion. We were happy with what we paid for. Will definitely come back  to try other dishes. Ingredients are fresh. I'm loving the reinvention of the old Hyde Street Bistro. Cocotte is wonderful! The roast chicken is amazing  a total must try. Their selection of French wine is also great. We've been to Cocotte twice and will certainly be back. The service could be a little more friendly but it's definitely adequate. They also do a to go option of roast chicken and sides! Before the December holiday madness reached a feverish pitch, I booked a table at Cocotte for five. Despite the space being small, it ended up being a great pick for a group. We skipped starters and moved right into a whole roast chicken, coq au vin, seared scallops and sides of roasted cauliflower, dripping roasted potatoes and spaghetti squash. The roast chicken comes with three sauces  gremolata, romesco and porcini mushroom  my top pick was the mushroom sauce by a mile. The standout dish at Cocotte for me was the coq au vin. Their rendition departs from the classic but is as tasty as any coq au vin I've tried (I'm a big fan of the dish). Service was rushed in the end  confusing given the tables wouldn't turn again (our reservation was at :). And we ordered the lava cake and profiteroles to share but the profiteroles never arrived. All in all though, I enjoyed Cocotte and would return, especially if I lived in the neighborhood. Totally reasonably priced French restaurant on Hyde street. The interior is cute and quaint, but just a little small. If you're having dinner for two be prepared to hear the conversations from either side of you. We decided to share some of their appetizers and entrees. Originally we were going to do Dine about Town but decided that we preferred their other dinner options over their DAT options. Appetizers:Chicken liver parfait: If you have read my other reviews, you will discover that I LOVE chicken liver parfait. The chicken liver parfait at Cocotte is not bad, but definitely not the best I've ever had. It comes with a sweet jam (which is typical) and a couple pieces of bread. I would have preferred a little more fat content in the Chicken liver parfait, but it definitely satisfied my cravings after not having it for a while. Farm eggs meurette: Bone marrow with egg poached in pinot noir? Sounds intriguing. The bone marrow was tasty, but a little small for my liking. Not a huge fan of the wine y egg, but it was definitely unique. My favorite part of this dish was scooping the marrow out of the bone with bread. Entree:Duck confit: Flavorful duck over a bed of lentils (?) and pork belly. Very little pork belly, but generous portion of duck. My only gripe is that the duck was a little dry. However, the skin was crispy and done well. Overall the meal came to be around $ which I believe is a steal compared to the dishes we tried. I'll definitely come back to try some of their other options (definitely scallops with squid ink risotto!) and whenever they decide to bring lunch. Dine About Town, my favorite time of year :)There were many new restaurants on the DAT list this year, Cocotte included.  The space is pretty small, including a table tucked away in a little nook.  We were seated quite close to our fellow diners  and they were having some interesting conversations!From the DAT menu I ordered:. Mussels Provencale. Steak Frites. Apple Tarte Tatin. I had mentioned that I would have loved to make the three appetizer options into my entire meal  they all sounded fantastic (the mussels, spinach and goat cheese souffle, and a duck salad).  The mussels were a great choice, though  very flavorful, and a generous portion as well. Unfortunately, the meal was downhill from there.  The steak was overcooked (I had ordered a medium and it was completely well done and stringy) with standard fries and an over dressed side salad.  The tarte tatin was very sweet, with nothing to cut the sweetness  a scoop of ice cream, a dollop of whipped cream, perhaps?Service was fine. . . when our waiter was able to get to us  he was running around frantically!  He was the only waiter (in addition to a sommelier and a host) and this restaurant sorely needs another. My one star rating doesn't have anything to do with the food at this place.  Unfortunately, we never made it that far.  Had a reservation yesterday for :pm.  Showed up on time, and was told that there were no tables available, so there would be a ""short wait. ""  When asked how long, they told us about  minutes.  We waited. . . . and waited. . . and waited. . .    minutes later, the host/server/bartender  guy came out and told us there were still no tables.  And that he had no idea when anything would be opening up.  By this point in time, I'm starving and starting to get annoyed.  The host was pretty apologetic, and invited us to come have a seat at the bar.  He offered to pour us a couple of glasses of wine while we continued to wait.  So finally,  minutes after my reservation time, we went inside to discover there were two spots open at the bar  but only ONE chair.  We stood there for a while, waiting for someone to take our drink orders, and no one ever did.  Finally, we flagged a passing server to ask for another bar stool, and she replied with a shrug, said they didn't have any more, and walked off.  That was the final straw.  We left. Maybe their food is good. . . and the ambiance seemed nice enough.  BUT COME ON!  They need to learn to manage their reservations better.  Any place with service this bad doesn't deserve my business. Cocotte's DAT menu looked pretty amazing, and they got pretty stellar reviews but unfortunately the food was overshadowed by the atrocious service. Cocotte  not worth it even during Dine about Town, unless you enjoy the bad after taste of poor service. To begin, it took at least  minutes for the waiter to even stop by, and when he did he was visibly irritated and gave us attitude as he took down our order. Side note: food came out slow as molasses too. * Wine: The wine's are pretty affordably priced (~$ ); a Yelper warned he was scolded by the waiter for trying to order wine before his entree, so I waited until after I placed my order but the waiter walked away without taking drink orders, and could not be flagged down for another  minutes! Great. More waiting. * Mussels: I was impressed by the hefty portion of (mostly) fresh mussels, simmered in a flavorful sauce that goes perfect with the complimentary bread. Don't judge, but I hate being wasteful so I asked to wrap up my leftovers (which I usually toss later anyway). My waiter responded with something like, ""Really?! Are you serious?? You know you will get sick, and if you do, don't even try to come back and complain to us because I told you so. "" That was the cliff notes version, tried to cut him off as he publicly dismissed me in front of everyone, but he talked over me. He might have been right, but it was so absolutely rude and unnecessary. * Flank Steak: I liked the sauce wasn't a thick puddle of gravy like at most French restaurants. There were  pieces on the plate, one was cooked perfectly and I have to say I enjoyed it, the other was overdone. The fries were fried in what tasted like  day old oil. My friend asked for her steak to be cooked longer, and instead of taking it back, he proceeded to school her on what medium rare is and how she didn't know what it is. After an awkward and tense exchange between the two, he took the plate back and returned with overcooked steak. * Salmon in Puff Pastry: What a unique and interesting concept, I loved the contrasting textures of the buttery pastry and the salmon. The flavors were good but the salmon was slightly overcooked. * Banana Creme Brulee: Way overrated. Needed more banana flavor and the texture was grainy, not smooth. * Apple Tatin: This wasn't so much a tatin, as it was a roasted whole glazed apple on a thin crust. Disappointing. * Chocolate Mousse: Meh. The food might be pretty good, but you can find other restaurants that serve the same quality at an equal or lesser price point. Though I came in knowing the waiter might be a bit mean, I still got yelled at. Do not come to Cocotte. Very cute & cozy place for dinner. It's a tiny restaurant but serves quality food. The waiters and staff are all very nice. They walk you through the menu if it's your first time here. Two of  my friends ordered the scallops and squid ink risotto and it was delicious! We also shared an order of  potatoes and goat cheese cocotte and it was amazing! I ordered the rainbow trout and mussels in lobster bisque based upon the recommendation of the waiter after I decided I should order something different from my group. Unfortunately, I was not impressed by the trout and barely ate any of it. The waiter noticed and asked me how my trout was. I was polite but honest and told him I wasn't crazy about it. When he brought us the check at the end of the night he informed us that he did not want me paying for food I had not enjoyed. I was not expecting this at all and thought it was above and beyond what they needed to do. In summary, I will be returning to cocotte and recommending it to my friends :) LOVE. Used to come before the name and decor change and it's even better than before! Some of the most authentic french food in the city much better than all of the ones in the FiDi. We sat next to a group of about  French people last time if that's any indication. Everything I've had is delicious $ chicken liver parfait I mean you can get bad spring rolls for that price. They let us stay well after closing time one night even suggesting dessert  when i'm sure they all wanted to call it a night. . .   bookmarked . . Let's get the bad out of the way.  They need more servers and cooks.  There seems to be a lag in between drinks and courses.  Long, noticeable lags. And. . . onto the good.  We started with a butter lettuce salad and the farm eggs meurette (yelp. com/biz_photos/coco…).  The salad portion was big enough to share, and the meurette was the highlight of the night.  Eggs poached in pinot noir.  AND bone marrow.  What's not to like?I had the roasted quail (yelp. com/biz_photos/coco…) stuffed with chanterelles, grapes, and drizzled with chicken jus.  This little dish is rich and jam packed with texture and flavor.  You won't regret it. Glass or two of viognier for $ a pop.  Good complement to the meal. So, add some staff and it'll be a solid five. This my new favorite restaurant in town. Wow, the food was exquisite (don't use that adjective often) and the atmosphere is romantic and relaxed. This place serves the type of food that I want to cook  refined but rustic dishes full of soul and love. We arrived on the dot for our reservation and were seated immediately. Our waiter showed us to the best seat in the house, a two seater round table in an alcove. That certainly put a huge smile on my face, definitely a huge plus!! He went over the relatively short menu with us in some detail and offered a few suggestions. We decided on the duck platter, the trout and the half chicken with cauliflower gratin. The duck platter had duck salami, house smoked duck breast and duck terrine. Three slices of a warm, heavenly multi grain biscuit. My favorite was the terrine, it was delicate and well balanced. The duck salami was my fiancé's favorite  it wasn't too fatty and packed a punch with intense flavor. The smoked duck slices was almost like prosciutto. It was a bit too salty for my taste and drowned out the delicate natural sweetness of the duck. All in all, a great start to the evening. After the waiter cleared the appetizer from our table, our mains arrived quickly. The fish skin was so crispy and not fishy at all. The flesh tasted buttery and the wonderful seafood sauce perfectly complimented the delicate fish. The mussels and potatoes were yummy, also. The chicken came with three amazing sauces  mushroom sauce, romesco sauce and a gramoleta. The chicken was moist and flavorful it didn't need the sauces to be a great dish, but the sauces took it over the top. I've had romesco sauce before, but nothing as good as this, it's a bit nutty, a bit sweet and % crack. I could put that over frozen patty of dry veggie burger and it would be good. The cauliflower gratin was fantastic too. The cheese compliments the natural sweetness of the cauliflower and the cauliflower itself wasn't mushy. From reading the other reviews, I couldn't resist and ordered the banana creme brûlée. It was heavenly. The banana were thinly sliced and a bit overpowering on the first bite, but the vanilla flavor really comes through after another few bites. The custard was smooth and not too sweet. It was certainly a great end to the evening. I love this place and hope to come back soon!! It's a true neighborhood gem and I hope it all the success :) Cocotte is a hidden gem. It's a cute and cozy neighborhood bistro that has somehow remained under the radar and fits nicely into the Hyde Street restaurant scene. My girlfriend and I have been to the restaurant twice and have ordered their rotisserie chicken to go. We're generally quite picky with restaurant choices and have been looking for a 'go to' neighborhood spot for reasonably priced, high quality and delicious food with a laid back atmosphere. The ambiance is understated, but warm and casual and the staff friendly. It's a french bistro through and through, so If you're looking for a more upscale and refined dinning experience, I'd recommend Frascati up the street. But for a more casual neighborhood experience with good food and reasonable prices, Cocotte fits the bill perfectly. The menu is varied and everything we've tried has been well received. The highlight so far has been the Farm Eggs 'Meurette'  poached in Pinot Noir with bone marrow, brioche, frisee salad, raspberry vinaigrette  which should be a strong candidate for the x top  dishes in the city in my opinion. The endive salad with crab is a great start and we've found the chicken to be moist and nicely cooked with the trio of sauces a perfect complement. Oh and if you live in Russian or Nob Hill and are tired of Lemongrass, Aux Delices or your standard Asian takeout option, they have an awesome rotisserie chicken meal to go. A chicken, with three different dipping sauces and  sides cost $. For sides, the cauliflower or potato au gratin should definitely be in your order. Pick it up on your way home and you'll have enough left over for lunch the next day. I was a big fan of the owner's previous restaurant in this location, Hyde Street Bistro, and they have indeed built another great restaurant in it's place Cocotte.  They recently re opened after completing a charming renovation to their restaurant on Hyde St between Jackson & Pacific. I have been unable to dine in house yet, but we recently had a fabulous take out dinner of their new 'signature' rotisserie chicken dish and it was fantastic.  A whole chicken roasted with delicious seasonings and accompanied with  flavorful sauces.  Additionally, they feature a number of side dishes for $ each most are various styles of potatoes, and vegetables.  The sides are small enough (and inexpensive enough) that you should order a sampling of at least   with a whole chicken (for a dinner for   people) so that you can experience a few different flavors.  Bravo to the new Cocotte!  I'm a fan and I will see you again soon! Excellent service, food, and atmosphere.  Enjoyed the small, alcove seat for discreet couples; ) very nice! overall good. I enjoyed my dinner here at the restaurant. We had to wait for about  mins even with a reservation, but didnt mind. The decor was great! it was cozy, sophisticated and intimate. the service was also superb. food: great! we enjoyed everything but their chicken. I rarely get a chicken dish at a restaurant, but since they were making a big deal out of their rotisserie, we decided to give it a shot  I thought it was a bit dry and flavorless. Tomato tatin and egg appetizers were really excellent. . and I thought the dive scallop with squid ink risotto was just heavenly. I would definitely recommend this place for a romantic date although it could be a bit noisy. DELICIOUS!! My boyfriend and I dined here this Christmas and it was magical to say the least! We had the sea bass and the vegetarian option of the night, which was an amazing pastry filled with mushrooms. We also ordered the Buche de Noel and Banana Creme Brûlée, both of which were incredible. While I was said to learn Hyde Street Bistro closed, I was happy Cocotte is carrying on the torch. The decor and seatings have changed for the better.  Like the rustic look, soft lighting, the bench seatings. . . Our waiter was very helpful and friendly.  After asking if it was our first time, he went over the menu with us.  The bread is warm and served with a small dish of something like a tapanade. What we had:Mussels mariniere, white wine, shallots, garlic, parsley, salted butter  $  good, mussels were plumpBelgium Endive Salad, dungeness crab, avocado, pomegranate dressing, herbs  $  very good and refreshing.  A mix of cut endive, crab & avocado is served over endives with a light pomegranate dressing with grapefruit wedges. Seared day boat scallop, squid ink risotto, basil foam  $  good, a little on the salty side for me but hubby said it was fine for him.  The basil foam is flavorful and the squid ink risotto is different, cooked right. Roasted quail, stuffed w/ chanterelle mushrooms, grapes, chicken jus  $, served in a small cast iron dish, it was delicious!  The skin was crispy, the meat was tender and the juice was sweet but wonderful. Profiterolles with rum and raisin ice cream, hot chocolate sauce  $  goodThe host was very friendly and has a sense of humor. Look forward to returning soon. This place caught my eye driving by it every day for work. I decided to give it a shot and incredibly glad that I did! Absolutely everything we ordered was fabulous I had the rainbow trout with mussels, my party also had the lasagna, the chicken and the wellington. We could not get enough of each other and our own dishes so we ended up sharing everything. It was fabulous! I wish we had had room for dessert! It's small inside but very charming. I definitely recommend this place! I went with a group of seven. The waiter forgot two of our entrees, which were not brought out before the rest if their party finished their meals. Then, we were informed that as an ""I'm sorry"" gesture we wouldn't be charged for the two meals that were never brought out to us. Truly despicable and shameful customer service. This would have been a prime opportunity to turn an honest mistake into a positive and instead led to a foul experience. This is such a cozy restaurant, the service is excellent and the food and wine are also great. We ordered three cocottes to share and the roasted chicken I especially loved the brussel sprout cocotte, but thought the cauliflower one could have been a bit more flavorful. Fortunately, they serve four very flavorful sauces alongside the chicken and a really good tapenade with the bread. I'm glad we made a reservation because I imagine the wait can be long since it's such a small space. I wanted to love this place, I really did. We showed up on a rainy cold night and were literally the ONLY people in the place on a Saturday night. Although it started filling up by the time we left, it was still pretty empty. There were three of us, so we decided to just order an assortment and share. We got the sheep's milk ricotta salad ($), ravioli ($), rabbit ragu ($) to start. The salad was so small that the three of us only got about  bites each, but it was delicious. The ravioli was more of a soupy mess with some pasta thrown on top of the small dish, not very good, but the presentation was enough to ruin it for me. The rabbit ragu, however, ended up being the biggest disappointment of the night. Not good or inspired and quiet expensive for the  bites we each got. Don't get me wrong, I know these are small plates, but it just felt over priced for the quality. For the main we shared a whole chicken ($) which was very delicious with the  special sauces it came with. We got the side of fries with the chicken which came with garlic aioli, which was a hit at the table. We kept passing the aioli around the table :)The service was ok, but being the only ones in the restaurant, it was very surprising when they forgot our rabbit ragu until the end of the meal and when everything came out at once instead of in the right order. It also felt a little pretentious for what it was. Overall, there are so many better restaurants in the neighborhood that people don't need to go to a mediocre place for food. Sad. I have mixed feelings toward Cocotte. We made reservation for  on a saturday night. It was my first time there so I didn't know that Cocotte was so small. The guy, whom I believed was the owner, was surprised when we said we had a reservation for three. . . . . . because their system had assigned us to a  people table even thou it said  next to my friend's name. To be honest, that tiny little table was a bit small for . . . . how did you expect that to seat  people? And I think they were fully booked so that's our only choice. BUT. . . . food was awesome! The eggs ""meurette"" was so good pairing with the bone marrow. Beef wellington was delicious. The beef filet was finely cooked (medium) and the meat was so soft. The rainbow trout was not fishy and tasted so good with the lobster bisque. The day boat scallop dish was a little too salty, but portion was generous. Desserts were good too~ We had the apple tart tatin and banana creme brulee. The apple tart tatin was a bit too sweet for me but i liked how they made it. I was a bit disappointed with the banana creme brulee but it was still pretty good after all. One comment  if coffee is on your menu, you should always have brown sugar instead of just white. I don't know if i will come back. . . . . . it took my friend  hour to find a parking spot in that area. . . . . . . and with that tiny little table. . . . . . but I will miss the food for sure! I'll never understand a service business that doesn't do everything it can to make customers feel comfortable, welcome and valued.  Here's a tip for the management at Cocoette: pushing four  top tables together does NOT create a table for .  Our group of  made a reservation at Cocoette weeks in advance.  We arrived spot on time for our : reservation and stood outside waiting for our table until :.  When we were finally seated, our table had been created by pushing together four little rectangular tables for two.  For the benefit of Cocoette manegement, I'll help with the math at this point.   x  = .  Had we been a group of  adults,  children and  pygmy marmosets, this arrangement would have been great.  We were, however, a group of , full grown adults. I alerted the manager to the problem and he came up with a brilliant solution.  He had the waiter rotate each table  degrees.  This had several effects:) The overall table length was improved by about  feet (again, adequate space for a pygmy marmoset, but we left ours at home and brought friends instead). ) All of the plates, glasses, silverware, etc were relocated as the tables were rotated.  No, no, don't bother moving things back to where they belong . . . we'll do that ourselves. ) The WIDTH of the table was now extra skinny and there was no room between my wine glass and the one accross the table. )  If you weren't one of the lucky  people sitting at the end of the table, you had the unparalelled pleasure of eating dinner with your plate sitting on the seam between two tables. In short (too late for that I suppose), when I make a reservation for , I expect a table for .  Cocoette provided a table for , and it detracted from our comfort and thus our enjoyment of the meal. Oh, and the food?  Adequate at best.  It wasn't bad; just unremarkable.  You have effectively unlimited choices on where to dine in San Francisco.  I recommend you choose elsewhere. This place is wonderful. The food is good and so is the atmosphere. I selected the Beef Tar Tar, Rotisserie, and Fondant. Five stars for each course! I'm a huge fan of Cocotte.  I arrived a little before my new culinary friend, Victoria C. , and took that time to enjoy a glass of wine. I explained what I was looking for and the nice man poured me exactly that. The owners/staff make you feel very welcome, like you are coming into their home. The space is small and intimate  perfect for a date! Victoria C. has beaten me to this review so I'll keep it short. We shared the ravioli for our appetizer.  It was delicious but I would probably order something else (like their rabbit ragu). Coq au vin was definitely the star of the meal. Traditionally made with chicken, root vegetables and potatoes. The sauce is TO DIE FOR. Beef wellington was good but didn't blow me away like the coq au vin did. Flaky pastry crust and quality meat cooked perfectly medium. Bonus points to them for that. We went for the apple tart for dessert. I would definitely recommend this! SO good! This place is so cute I want to stuff it in my pocket and take it home! I ate here for dinner on a Saturday night, and found the staff to be very friendly, accommodating, and French which only added to the cuteness factor. The menu had a wide variety of options, and you can find a lot of reasonably priced options if you're not in the mood for a large entree type dinner. We had the cheese plate (amazing), ravioli, and half roasted chicken with green beans. Everything was cooked well, and the chicken was moist and tasty. We didn't have room for the dessert, but from the other reviews, it sounds like we really missed out. Overall, a great little spot in a nice part of town. I'd gladly return, if only for some cheese and a glass of wine. Stopped by early last Saturday on whim with my brother in town and a friend.  It seemed that everwhere was busy and fully booked that night.  We popped into the newly opened Cocotte and were offered  seats at the bar.  This turned to be the best decision that day.  Wonderful service and all three of us were happy with our meals, coq au vin, / chicken and I had the wonderful  Farm Eggs Meurette (  poached in Pinot noir, bone marrow, brioche, frisee salad, raspberry vinaigrette) with the potato and goat cheese gratin.  Delicious!  We talked with the very enthusiastic owner afterwards and truly enjoyed the experience.  I will be back! Don't let the size of this place fool you!  Not only does its popularity fill up the joint after about  PM, but its food keeps them staying. My new friend Sara P. and I decided to try this place after it appeared on our ""New Places in San Francisco"" feed.  After I saw that they had Beef Wellington, I was instantly drawn in and wanted to try it so we thought we would try it together.  That's Yelp people for you.  Kind people that want to make friends and try good food.  My kind of people indeed.  You wanna make friends?  Join Yelp. It wasn't an easy feat though, considering our schedules and the fact that the holidays are almost upon us but it was sure worth the trip!The authentic French staff is so friendly and welcoming.  Get a drink at the bar first.  They have a great selection of wine and their specialty cocktail is a must try.  They don't have a cocktail list above and beyond this one drink, but this isn't really the place to sit and drink.  This is a place where you will be whisked away to South West France, where the food is good and the wine is plentiful. We tried the ravioli appetizer which was a bit different from traditional ravioli.  Much thinner.  Almost like a wonton.  It had some type of beef in it, as well as mushrooms.  I felt that there was too much lemon in the broth, not the ravioli, but it was still delicious.  Especially for an appetizer. The COQ AU VIN is a MUST try!  The sauce is so delectable and pairs really well with the Beef Wellington.  I recommend getting the Beef Wellington, eating half of it and mixing it with the COQ AU VIN sauce.  In fact, just request that they put the COQ AU VIN sauce with the Beef Wellington.  So delicious.  Back to the COQ AU VIN though, the meat was ok.  Dark meet that came with a few carrots and gratin potatoes.  Incredibly delectable.  I loved it. The Beef Wellington was cooked to perfection.  A flaky pastry puff filled with beef.  I got mine medium, which I don't normally do but I think for this dish you really need to get it this way.  Only because the pastry is so delicate that you need to the beef to be softer.  Too tough and it throws off the balance of the dish.  Comes with mashed potatoes and some sauce stuff that wasn't really as good as the COQ AU VIN.  So really, request the COQ AU VIN sauce!Dessert was good but I didn't want to eat too much so we got something light.  The GOLDEN DELICIOUS APPLE TART TATIN was the perfect amount of dessert.  Basically just baked apples with a very thin crust/pastry at the bottom.  The perfect end to your meal. I really enjoyed this place.  I had great company, I really got to know my new friend, atmosphere and menu weren't too intimidating, staff was great and the food was just so delicious. I highly recommend to anyone in San Francisco.  Whether you are visiting, have people visiting or just want a delicious holiday meal.  Try it.  You won't be disappointed. Amusez vous! J'adore cet endroit. Came here with a small group of friends on a Sunday evening and the restaurant was not crowded.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  Food was delicious and nicely presented.  We ordered the chicken liver pâté as our appetizer, sea bass, roasted quail and roasted duck breast as our entrees.  The chicken liver pâté accompanied with toasty bread and red onions with marsala jam was a pretty good substitute for the foie gras that is now banned in CA.  The quail was served in a cute little cast iron pan which well preserved the heat of the meat and kept the skin of the quail crisp with a delicious and not too heavy chanterelles mushroom and grapes stuffings.  The sea bass was grilled to the right texture, slightly crisp on the outside, moist in the center.  The typical oily consistency of the sea bass was not presented, the flavor was excellent.  Didn't try the roasted duck myself but from my friends' comments, it was well prepared and tasteful.  We also ordered their profiterolles (rhums and raisins ice cream on puffy pastry. . .  yum yum!!) and chocolate cake fondant (moist and flavorful) to finish our meal with a sweet and satisfying touch.  Price was reasonable and will definitely come back to try out some more of their dishes. I left a stellar review for the original, Hyde Street Bistro, and Cocotte continues to earn the five star distinction.  The service, food, and ambiance is impeccable for the reasonable price.  I arrived  minutes with a reservation for two, but they sat us without hesitation in a cozy nook in the back  perfect for a romantic dinner.  The server was a French gentleman who kept us entertained with his frank assessment of each dish.  We tried the rabbit ragu, which was to die for  easily six stars (out of five).  We also had the hand cut beef tartar, which was delicious, though following the rabbit, didn't overwhelm.  For the main, we died the / chicken rotisserie with three sauces with a size of brussel sprouts and french fries.  The chicken was deliciously moist, and the sauces gave us each something to love. We each had a glass of wine.  I wasn't too impressed with their wines by the glass menu, but can't speak to the bottles.  All together, I couldn't have asked for a better meal.  But then I got it  with dessert.  The banana creme brulee was perhaps the best thing I have ever eaten in my life.  Absolutely unbelievable  you must get it, no matter how full you are.  (see photo) Love, love love,Nice neighborhood gem.  Comfortable, good food,good company.  Unpretentious  country French, with wonderful food.  Definitely a return in the future. I was a little bummed originally when they rebranded as ""Cocotte"", as I was always a fan of the Hyde Street Bistro.  It was nice to be able to get some old school country French food amidst the preponderance of uninspired California/Continental cuisine in Russian Hill.  That said, we went to Cocotte last night for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised by the way they updated their concept without losing what made them unique in the neighborhood.  It's the same staff, % of whom are right off the boat from France.  They do an authentic French rotisserie chicken, which sadly we did not sample but will certainly do the next time.  They also put a bar up front with a focus on generally inexpensive French wines and cocktails. We tried the lamb ravioli appetizer, which was excellent. Truly differentiated and perfectly done.  For dinner, my wife got the sole special, which was prepared lightly breaded and pan sauteed.  Light and delicious.  It was like taking the classic sole meuniere and making it lighter for the California palate.  I ordered a duck breast with fig slices and some kind of pork belly crisps.  Obviously super rich and over the top, but as to be expected.  At $ it was a steal.  We got the Brussels sprouts side dish, which was a tad salty for out tastes. The wine list looked interesting too, but I was getting over a cold and my wife is pregnant, so we did not get a chance to sample any.  It's mainly inexpensive bottles from the big name regions and vintages, where it's always fun to look for value.  Bordeaux, Rhones, Sancerre, etc.  Looking forward to trying them all out on the next visit. Great food  great prices  excellent service  minus one star for being a bit salty or it would be a five. So let me start by saying I'm a bit jaded to this whole process as someone who both works in the industry and finds that far more people endeavor upon this just to vent their ""justifiable"" rage than actually provide an objective review; though I am aware that objective review is basically an oxymoron. With that said I will now join the throngs who need to have their voices heard in hopes that I can be part of a solution to this problem. My wife and I have been trying to find a reasonably priced high quality place near our neighborhood (Tenderloin) with no luck. During a walk one day we stumbled across Cocotte, which granted isn't quite our neighbor, and surrounded by other establishments that I know are of good repute. Either way it was walking distance so we gave it a shot. Definitely worth it. The place is a quaint (ten tables and and a small bar) French place known for its Rotisserie. When we walked in the host was very pleasant and sat us in a dining room that was a bit dated looking, but I think that was the intent. Ill take dark and minimalistic over obnoxiously modern anyday (pardon the overt subjectivity. )The server took a little while to approach the table, but he was clearly busy. Now I understand that the server in me is making excuses for what is a poor decision in staffing, but I say this more to point out that he was working hard opposed to just being nonchalant or lax. The server took our wine order and while I couldn't ascertain his level of knowledge for wine because he was rushing, the pleasant host/manager was happy to talk to us about the bottle. The wine was great though the glasses were a bit underwhelming. I don't mean to nit pick but nice service vessels, of all sort, are a touch that really makes a different in the overall aesthetic appreciation of a restaurant. Cocotte really could use an upgrade here. My wife and I are a bit gluttonous when we dine out so we ordered our standard three apps, two entrees and a side. Apps: Cabernet poached egg on brioche with bone marrow, a sheeps milk ricotta salad with beets, and chicken liver mousse. ) all three were very good, with the poached egg being the highlight, liver is hard to botch which makes its execution actually a bit scary but they nailed it. Park Tavern has the best but this was very good. The salad was tasty but nothing to really espouse about. Entrees: Beef Wellington, Rotisserie Chicken and a side of Cauliflower. The Wellington was very good, the meat was cooked properly and the pastry was perfectly textured, I would have liked the sauce to have a bit more vibrancy to offset a dish the is a bit muted by its nature, but once again just a preference not meant to really be a criticism. The chicken was great, it's not easy to ensure with chicken that it retains its flavor once you go sub dermal. This chicken had flavor to the bone.  It came with three sauces: Bordelaise,creamy porcini, and roasted bell pepper. All three were tasted though the bell pepper seemed out of place. Cauliflower was salty but good. We skipped dessert. Opting to imbibe a bit more. All together our experience was very good. The food was consistent, tasty and well executed. The service was friendly though a bit rushed. Our bill was less than a $.  for everything. Well worth a visit. Like reuniting with a long lost friend, having a great meal just a stroll down the street was very welcome.  Been a fan of the Hyde Street Bistro for years and was excited to see them reopen their doors (new huge sliding glass doors) and be greeted by one of the warmest and most welcoming maître d' in the city, Philip!   The new setup has the entire experience spill out on to Hyde Street, great for warm evenings! It also provides a more open feel and the bar area is very enjoyable.  Not to mention the food. . . beef tar tar, butter lettuce salad (great dressing!), the scallops are fantastic and don't forget the profiteroles (to die for) to finish things off. I'm so happy this place is right in my neighborhood! Spent an awesome Saturday night filling up on wine and beef fat :) Cocotte has taken on the modern, causal, hip atmosphere, but instead of struggling to find new permutations of brentwood corn, heirloom tomatoes, and little gem lettuces like every other new SF restaurant, this place is making tried and true french bistro food. And it was so refreshing to see!RECOMMEND: Farm Eggs ""Meurette"" is a beautiful thing.  Perfectly poached, wine soaked egg to spread on brioche toast with some roasted bone marrow. I know bone marrow is having a moment in SF restaurants right now, and I think this might be the best version I've had. I know egg yolk and bone marrow sounds a little overkill, but they work together beautifully! Tartar with quail egg: great! Flavorful, but not over seasoned so you can still taste the meat. Steak Frites: perfectly medium rare, juicy rib eye and deliciously crispy salty fries for dipping in all that green peppercorn meat juice. Simple. Happy. Apple Tarte Tatin: More like a soft apple cake than the flatter tart I was expecting, but it was delicious! Love the simple sauce of creme fraiche.  Paired it with white dessert wine (of a name I had never seen before and of course forgot). ATMOSPHERE:  I really like the casual atmosphere. Have to walk through the kitchen to go to the restroom. . . which I like for some reason. It was a little noisy.  We ended up opting for seats at the bar since we were afraid we wouldn't be able to hear each other if there was a table between us. *Bar seating could be improved a great deal if there were coat hooks under the bar!  Purse and jacket just ended up in a pile on the floor. . . . : /SERVICE: A little disorganized upon our arrival. Although we made a reservation, they table wasn't quite ready.  We opted to sit at the bar, so there's no telling how long the wait might have been.  Bartender was very enthusiastic and friendly, but I had I had to help him out a bit and request menus and a wine list on my own. Since they just opened, this is totally understandable and I'm sure this will quickly improve. I used to come here back when it was Hyde Street Bistro, they had the best happy hour mussels, but for dinner the place was a bit too stuffy before, for me, at least. . . NOW, it has been remodeled (same great chef) with more of a rustic modern feel, and the restaurant itself looks great. . The feeling you get when you walk in there is much more appealing than before. . As for the food and service this is where the  stars come in. I decided to try a lobster arugula salad they had as a special that night which was very tasty and not too pricy, and then I had the beef tartar. I had the beef tartar there once before and it wasn't that great, but I noticed that they had it with a quail's egg this time (instead of a regular egg) so I wanted to see if the makeover of Hyde street Bistro to Cocotte was also in the new recipes or just the restaurant itself too. The beef tartar was exquisite! It was already mixed with the spices that are normally served on the side, and I thought they did a perfect job on it. I hope that they don't change the beef tartar! It was really, really delicious. I also had a couple of glasses of wine, the white I think was a pinot blanc, which was pretty good, and the red, was perfect. It was a Syrah, I think, from Oregon. The red wine was absolutely delicious and reasonably priced. Although, I did end up leaving there with two apps, two glasses of wine, and a dessert for about $.  (not including tip), so, it is definitely a splurge for me, not an every day thing (although if they had a slightly larger selection of cheaper wine I might be there every week!). Now, I know that the chef (and I think owner as well?) is the same, and he has shined with his exceptional taste and knowledge in french food, but I have to give credit where it is due to the wait staff as well. The cheery Host at the door with a helpful and kind demeanor greeted me with a big ""Bon soir"" and sat me at the (new and improved) bar. And my server/bartender Phillipe exceeded my expectations as a server. He was knowledgeable, patient, and extremely friendly but let me enjoy my meal as well, and made my dinner so pleasant! Really, he made the whole experience so much better! I have had him as my server once before when it was H. S. B. and he has always been absolutely perfect. I am so happy that they re did the place and I can't wait to come back for the mussels, and to try one of their delicious looking main dishes as well! Good job to whoever designed the place! It was definitely a good move. Even the bathroom looks better!I will be back soon!Bon Apetit!"|2|98|1|Routine Inspection| Permit license or inspection report not posted
Cocotte 1|4.0|French in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|246|1|4.33333333333| A new favorite in a familiar spot.  The old Hyde Street Bistro got a facelift, a new look and new name.  The new menu has a few old favorites and some great new additions, including whole and half chicken that you can see slow roasting in kitchen.   You can see the French Chef hard at work in the kitchen from you table which makes things cosy and give the restaurant an artisanal feel.  The service was impeccable and the addition of a bar is awesome. Will definitely go back:) Cocotte is definitely a keeper.  A wonderful attentive staff.  Great water, bread, and tapenade.  The menu is the real deal.  The chef is into the details.  The coq au vin is divine.  The Eggs 'Meurette' with bone marrow is something you don't usually find outside of Paris.  My favorite.  The lobster bisque was delicious, seasoned to perfection.  We live part of the time in Paris and this is the first restaurant in SF in a while, that was a perfect Parisian bistro with a chef that cooks with finesse. Nice appropriate proportion and reasonable prices.  And love everything served in little French pots! Will be one of my regular go to places, along with Cotogna. Just came from a nice neighborhood dinner. My partner and I stopped in early as we had no reservation (and it is Saturday). . . . st day open for Cocotte. The food was quite good. The marrow/egg appetizer was exceptional. GET THIS! I WILL DREAM ABOUT THAT MARROW.  Even the basic butter lettuce salad was good. Scallops on the squid ink were delicious. Coq a vin was tasty only negative is that the potatoes were noticeably undercooked. Dessert was profiteroles, which were made with rum/raisin ice cream. . . . . good modification. Would have liked more chocolate sauce on the profiteroles, but otherwise it was great. Lastly,  things ) Nice Big Pour on the drinks. MUCH APPRECIATED )Attentive A+ service  )Get an espresso machine. We'll be back! Thank you for a great Saturday night.

Monsieur Benjamin 0|4.0|French in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|146|0|4.18367346939|" What can I say? It's near perfect. First of all, it's open until am. Every. Day. You can count the number of good restaurants open that late on one hand in this city. Secondly, the food is stellar. It's not inventive or creative, but executed flawlessly. The Steak Frites is by far one of the best pieces of meat I've ever eaten  and I've had it  times since this place opened. Their cocktails are tasty and on par with other establishments. I'm not a wine guy, so I can't help you there. But you'll enjoy the cocktails, which never overpower the food. The ""Ace"" is delicious. Their palmier ice cream is something out of this world. I never thought a minor dessert item that nearly every restaurant serves without much interest could be so incredible. I've forgotten about all the other places in the city that serve the ""best"" ice cream. It's here. After all the other delicious things you'll eat. At am  because they'll serve you then. And that's really my favorite thing about this place: the service and atmosphere. In a city filled to the brim with good food, it is rare to have servers and ambience that make you feel welcome  where the restaurant is honored to have you as a guest, not the other way around. I've been to lauded places in the city before only to feel like it was a privilege for me to eat there. It shouldn't be. I should just feel happy and full, like any good meal. And I do here every time. Monsieur Benjamin is French Bistro reinvented.   Rather than the cramped bistro of yesteryear, Monsieur Benjamin is new, sleek, wide open, and really quite beautiful.  Given that the place is relatively new, service was good, although the timing between courses seemed just a bit excessive.  And rather than the customary favorites, here all of the newest techniques are employed to produce a lighter version of the classics. I started with the oeufs mayonnaise (deviled eggs to most of us) that were just a bit astringent and encased some herbs.  This is a knockout dish that stimulated the appetite, something so many meal starters fail to do.  Seafood sausage encasing bits of lobster, shrimp and pine nuts sat in a puddle of a lovely sauce that managed not to overwhelm the mild seafood.  How you respond to this depends on whether you might prefer bistro sausages accompanied by an assertive grain mustard or something more subtle.  I would have liked something a bit more assertive. Leg of lamb steak is cooked sous vide (on the bone) and then grilled to finish it off.  It comes with nicely prepared artichokes. The steak was lovely to behold, ample in size, but as to taste it was not at all compelling to me.  It didn't taste of lamb; it was a large portion of protein that was just too subtle for my aged taste buds.  And the sauce that accompanied the steak was likewise subtle and failed to provide a taste lift that might have helped.  I should add that the restaurant was near full early Saturday evening and everyone about me seemed to be enjoying their repast hugely.  So my response is that of an older person who will choose differently on subsequent visits. Inspired by Parisian bistros, Monsieur Benjamin gives a modern, San Francisco influenced take on French cooking. Owner Corey Lee, formerly of Per Se, Benu, and The French Laundry, gives the quintessetually French dining experience a modern twist by using dark wood and leather, big windows, and black subway tiles in his understood dining room in the newly constructed Ivy building in Hayes Valley. Chef Jason Berthold continues this trend by deftly reinventing French classics for today's era. The menu features modern takes on time honored French bistro dishes with seasonal ingredients. The whipped chicken liver accompanying the pommes gaufrette ($. ) was light and ethereal. Accompanied by small chunks of garlic sausage, the steamed mussels ($) were delicious. Extra hunks of toasted sourdough bread were required to soak up all the broth that remained after the juicy mussels all too quickly disappeared. With perfected turned steamed potatoes, Paris mushrooms, and pearl onions, the blanquette de veau ($. ) was creamy and satisfying. Despite his many successes, Berthold's dishes were not all sterling. Sporting wild rice and sprouted grains, the house made chicken and vegetable soup ($) was a little bland and needed to perked up with the addition of salt and pepper. Moreover, Zuni, Nopa, and Marlowe need not worry about losing their burger crown to Monsieur Benjamin: for $. , the hamburger with pommes frites was small and uninteresting. With mostly French offerings, the wine list offers ample, well priced selections by the glass and by the bottle. The full bar churns out classic french cocktails as well as some more interesting concoctions based on traditional ingredients. The ""Pass the Hat, with aged rhum, Aperol, fino sherry, bonal, and lime, ($) was a standout. Service was friendly and efficient. Shared dishes were split in the kitchen. Dishes arrived with good pacing. Used plates were promptly whisked away. With his pedigree, one should expect nothing less than near perfection from Corey Lee.  And, in Monsiuer Benjamin, he delivers. Food is good, but portions are small (duck liver mouse is like  oz of whipped mouse, not enough to get through the potato crisps).   Bistro fare at super high end prices.   For the price, there are so many places I would prefer to eat at. i would like to point out that Corey Lee is as cute as a button. the one Chef I have a crush on.  Corey Lee, are you listening? I'd probably go .  stars, but I don't think it deserves  stars.  Overall, it was good not great.  Staff was very professional  from check in, bartender, and wait staff.  I give them five stars. Cocktails were also tasty Way Back When was yummy.  The Ace was also tasty.  Wine list was marked up a good x over retail.  Food was generally good.  Seafood Sausage and the Steak Tartare yummy.  Escargot good.  Sweetbreads and Croquettes both just ok.  Lobster Spaghetti and Sea Bass were tasty.  Blanquette de Veau was very tasty although quite sparse.  In general, even for SF, the portions were small.  And like many restaurants are now going more Steakhouse style where you also need to order sidesthe noise level was extremely high, so talking for our table of six was challenging.  The space itself is very nice.  Overall, I found it enjoyable but would not rush back Review #!  To be honest, I never thought I'd get this far, but I might as well go for , now!To mark the milestone, Monsieur Benjamin seemed like the perfect choice from my ""to review"" list.  I had long wanted to check out Corey Lee's cooking, so after trying his newest restaurant, why not pick it for my review?  Especially since I had one of my favorite dishes of the year here (see entree below). Unfortunately, I couldn't check out the restaurant before joining my friends (they were already seated when I arrived), but I liked what I could see from seat.  The kitchen is wide open, so you can watch the staff do their thing, and the décor is modern yet semi casual, just like the menu.  There are a lot of great looking dishes to choose from, but none of them came off overly formal or pretentious.  RAW OYSTERS  Beausoleil, NB ($.  each) and Shigoku, WA ($.  each)(yelp. com/biz_photos/mons…)Both tasted so fresh!  My friends favored the slightly sweet Beausoleil over the brinier Shigoku oysters, but I thought each was good in its own way.  Plus, their flavors contrasted nicely.  POMMES GAUFRETTE with Whipped Chicken Liver Mousse. . . $. (yelp. com/biz_photos/mons…)While toasted bread would have been nice to spread the mousse, I liked the slight saltiness and crunch the pommes gaufrette added.  As for the mousse, it was flavorful but not overly rich and that the consistency was silky smooth.  CAMEMBERT BEIGNETS. . . $(yelp. com/biz_photos/mons…)Although the dish wasn't bad, I wasn't impressed either.  The porcini dust that was sprinkled on each was good, but the beignets themselves felt a little dry and burnt (for lack of a better word).  STEAMED MUSSELS  MB Biere, Garlic Sausage. . . $(yelp. com/biz_photos/mons…)I could eat a whole bowl of these!  The mussels were cooked perfectly, the sausage added a slight kick, and the broth was the perfect complement.  The only (minor) quibble I had was that the broth could have used a little more body.  SWEETBREADS GRENOBLOISE with Sweet Onions, Capers, and Brown Butter. . . $. (yelp. com/biz_photos/mons…)As much as I liked the mussels, this was my favorite starter.  The sweetbreads were meaty, tender, and delicious and the capers and onions added a slightly sweet acidity to cut against the brown butter.  I would definitely get this again!  LOBSTER RAGOUT  Spaghetti, Mirepoix, Bacon, Fines Herbes. . . $(yelp. com/biz_photos/mons…)The star of the night (I done picked good!).  The spaghetti was spot on al dente and there was plenty of lobster with every bite (I liked that it was cut small).  The sauce was just as impressive though; a lot of flavor and depth from the herbs and bacon.  LEMON TART with Mint Chantilly. . . $. (yelp. com/biz_photos/mons…)The crust was pretty hard and crunchy (I liked it, though others may not), but it was delicious.  There was a nice balance between tart and sweet, and the somewhat thick consistency was great!  GATEAU MARJOLAINE with Creme Anglaise. . . $. (yelp. com/biz_photos/mons…)The dish didn't impress, though I think it was just me.  The cake felt a little dry (the crème helped), but the taste was fine.  Really, I think the buttercream and its consistency just got to me after a while. All in all, I thought the food was a very solid four.  Despite not being high on the Beignets and Gateau Marjolaine, I loved the Mussels, Sweetbreads, and Lobster Ragout.  However, even if they were closer to five stars, I would have had to round down for the service.  Our server may not have done anything wrong, but he wasn't very helpful, approachable, or personable either. Regardless of the service though, I'd certainly come back, especially for the mussels, sweetbreads, and ragout.  I just might have to make a quick stop at Benu first! GF and I went here to try it out after all the hype and overall I was disappointed. We didnt see any mains that we were super excited about so we went alacarte and got a few apps to share. mussels the most anorexic mussels I've ever seen. Like the meat of the mussel smaller than a penny type small. Also the broth was about  inch on the bottom, not even enough to keep the mussels nice and hydrated the broth itself had too much wine it in, i could taste the acidity of the liquor. #fail. Pomm frites for a ""french brasserie"" these were really sad. SAD! Like mcdonalds french fries. Sad. I dont even think they were hand cut, as they looked like processed out of a bag. Again, sad. $ sad. Crispy sweetbreads. Plating was pretty but for a $ appertizer, there should be more than , yes TWO pieces of sweetbreads on the plate. I know its corey lee but $ for  piece of sweetbread? when you break that in $ per pound, that is more costly than osetra. Come on now. Steak tartare. Good, but not blow your mind good. Best is still bix. Enjoyed the crunchy cracker that came with it. Again portion was small. Overal it was ok, but I think this is more of a happy hour, have cocktails and wine and small bites type place vs dinner. For the price tag, not worth it, I personally think for such high prices you should at least go home somewhat satisfied. We would have kept going but it just wasnt attractive to us. Service was attentive but the waitress kept on pushing us to order more and seemed dismayed when we skipped dessert. Dissapointed by the above three, GF and I went down the block to sushi and enjoyed some delectable sushi rice ala hamachi belly to satisfy us. Then topped it off with Smitten. Oh yes!Nice try but won't be coming back. Arrived at :pm on a Thursday evening (w/out a reservation) with a few tables available and an overall busy feel. Service was terrific from start to finish; everyone was professional, friendly and prompt. The evening started with cocktails, Ace (easy drinking, a little sweet)  + The Top Hat (rum based drink with slightly bitter finish) along with the Potato and Leek Croquettes . The starter was delicious and exactly what you would imagine, tasty veggies with a breaded crust, not too oily,  and a tasty dipping sauce. Next up, Little Gem salad. The dressing was tangy, light and savory. The lettuce itself was too smokey for my taste, but is just a preference issue. Wood Roasted Vegetables for me and the Char for my husband. According to the man his fish was silky smooth, with both sweet and smokey flavors.  The veggie dish was fantastic once I worked past the top layer, which again, was too smokey for me. The greens, and artichoke were mouth watering good. I wish I had more fennel because the sweetness was a fantastic pair with the smokey tomato sauce and farro. The evening finished with a lovely lemon tart, the crust was perfectly firm crumbly dash of sweet and salty, the texture was lighter than a panna cotta with just the right amount of acid. Thanks for a great night! What a delightful spot. We loved the delicious stuffed quail even though I was initially surprised to see its feet sticking up from the plate. The ice cream was also delicious. Great work by the kitchen and waitstaff. Will be back. We were a group of four, so we decided to order several things and share.  We got the: croquettes, escargot, bone marrow, chicken wings, pasta with the lobster ragout and  duck confit.  Everything was excellent, but the pasta was the most popular in our group.  I liked that the escargot was not in the shell, but still flavorful without being chewy.  The duck skin was crispy while the meat was juicy without being gamey or overly oily.  The bone marrow was also well seasoned and great for sharing.  We all raved about the bacon jam that came with it.  The aioli that came with the chicken wings was also fantastic.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised that every sauce we tried was wonderful. We had no room for dessert after all that, since we also had  glasses of wine and a bottle of French cider that were excellent.  I thought the total was reasonable considering the quantity and quality of the food.  Also, I want to buy all their dishes.  I will be back, maybe late night on a weekend. Corey Lee is the man.  Most intelligent cook out there.  The word Soigne and dope ass baller come to mind when we eat his food.  The things he does at Benu make us all wonder why the hell we we don't have Xia Long Bao stuffed with Lobster Roe every day?  But alas, this is about his new digs.  Monsieur Benjamin. . .  or Bouchon . . (sorry TK, please don't strike me down as I type this). Room looks amazing.  Door handles are rubberized so it feels soft on the hands when you enter.  That's the thing about Corey, he thinks of everything.  You see the bar?  Where's the booze?  Where's the dude with the mustache and the suspenders taking god knows how long to find the tinctures to pour into your barrel aged whatever?  None of that.  Just clean Japanese inspired asthetic with good old American know how used to create a bar that really isn't.  Check out the coffee machine, wtf is that!?  WE had all the cocktails, my companions gave them all a thumbs up.  I myself, having just recently kicked a Fernet addiction of  years was compelled to more sophisticated sipping from the wine list. Lighting is good, wallpaper looks great.  The chairs are light but sturdy as all hell.  Wood carved I believe.  The table cloths, or lack there of, have been replace with what should be butcher paper, but something else, textured.  Elegant for a bistro.  Plateware is customized, whimsical, and completely appropriate for the food placed upon it.  And now the food. . . Ate everything on three visits.  When I say everything, I mean it.  Pluses. Croquettes, Pickles, Beignets, Chicken Liver, Bone Marrow, Sweetbreads, Escargot, Duck Confit, Seafood Sausage, Artic Char, Chicken. Lets talk about the good.  Camembert Beignets.  Lord have mercy these are good.  A true cheese puff.  Setting the standard in SF.  Sorry Melissa, your granny got nothing on this Asian boy.  Frances is great, these are the new hotness. Chicken liver with waffle chips.  Aerated, herbed and salty spread of chicken innards, closely resembling a foie gras mousseline, but without all the moral and ethical ambiquity.  Sweetbreads.  Great to have a version that are not nuggets.  Chef treats the product as a steak and in doing so, retains all of its moisture and flavor.  It is a beautiful dish and one that showcases the cooking skills of his staff. Escargot.  Damn bro, why you gotta do that to us.  The usual suspects are over buttered and garlic crushed.  This maintains the intergrity of the snail, slightly chewy but melts in your mouth.  The herbed bread crumb on top is what makes this a CoreyLlee joint.  It soaks up all the butter in the pan and just makes the dish complete.  Your snail is coated in parsley breadcrumbs versus butter bathed. Duck Confit was crispy outside, soft and melting on the inside and not overly salty at all.  The sausage sitting beside it was unnecessary but I would not kick that out of my bed, so thanks. Dude, sausage seafood, had pine nuts in it and I tasted the seafood.  Who woulda thought that a seafood sausage could have distinguishing flavors within it other then shrimp and fish scraps?  A revelation of sausage making.  All done without piggy parts. Last one, Artic Char.  Dude this was so dope. I couldn't get over how much better this is then anything in any French bistro within a hundred miles of it.  Trout Almondine is it's progenitor, but Corey uses a beautifully thick piece of Artic Char to top the perfectly cooked green beans and the wonderfully rich Buerre Blanc.  The kicker is his use of sunchokes to add some earthy sweetness to the dish and to give something more then the buerre blanc to enrichen it.  Less  butter, complements the fish completely and gives us a surprise note that plays hand in hand with the almonds.  This dish was great in it's simple reinterpretation of a dish done by thousands of cooks forever.  It sets the standard. Now for the bad. . . . there was none.  No seriously, there was a couple that misfired but I know chef and his boys are on it.  The Lobster was lost in it's ragout sauce.  The Watson Lamb leg was in need of some tender loving care and acidulation in the sauce work.  Nothing egregious, but with a menu this large, something had to give. Best part about this restaurant is that it is open tillam.  Great for tweakers and cooks.  The price point will keep most tweakers away so it'll just be us cooks and drunks. We had intended to eat at another restaurant a couple blocks from here, but their kitchen was closed by the time we arrived, darn it. . . It was our last night in San Francisco, so we desired to eat at a finer eatery. Did not mind forking out the extra mulah to experience a ""fine dining experience"" here in San Francisco. Fortunately we stumbled upon this fancy looking French restaurant. We came around : in the evening on a Sunday. Very decorative place with an open kitchen. We were promptly greeted by a hostess and seated at the corner of the house. Apparently this place has only been open for about a month, if that. Although I am not a local, I always get excited for trying out new and upcoming restaurants. There was only a handful of Yelp reviews for M. B. so I decided to try out various dishes, in order to write personal reviews for them, and of course, because I was hungry. My brother and I ordered a few appetizers to try out before our main courses.  We ordered the ""Camembert Beignets"", ""Steak Tartare"", ""Pommes Frites, Aioli"", ""Marrow Bones (Blue Ribbon) Bacon Marmalade, Country Bread""  Camembert Beignets Tastes like puffed up fried ""cheez its"". Would not order again, but would recommend to try at least once.  Steak Tartare Not your conventional tartare, but nonetheless, pleasantly delightful.  Pommes Frites a. k. a. very fancy name for french fries. Easily frozen potatoes that lacked any seasoning. Aioli that came with it was mediocre. As if McDonalds fries were being served back there.  Marrow Bones The texture of the marrow was exactly how I imagined it to be when I ordered it. Prepared deliciously with cilantro topped on it. Their robust bacon marmalade was flawlessly balanced with sweetness and smokiness as well. We ordered their Lobster ""Raqout Spaghetti, Mirepoix, Bacon, Fines Herbes"" and the ""French Dip Sandwich. "" Spaghetti Lobster Pasta was cooked al dente. Sauce was spot on. They even gave a decent amount of lobster. The dish was infused with rich flavors.  French Dip  I ordered this, simply to indulge in something I'm familiar with. For the amount it cost, I was hoping for something extravagant or at least different in taste than a commercialized sandwich chain. It's a small sandwich, but just the right size after eating all those appetizers. Don't look for presentation on this dish. Apparently since it's the cheapest thing on their main courses, they have the excuse to present it as it is. Anyways, I take a couple of bites, it's on the salty side. I took that third bite and it's as if I bit in to a highly concentrated area of saltiness. Asked my brother to try it, and it was not just me. Made sure to let the supervisor on duty aware of my situation. He took it back and asked if he could make me another one. I kindly rejected the offer because I already lost my appetite from the sandwich and did not want my brother to wait for me. I waited for my brother to finish his main course so we could move on to desserts. Another supervisor later came back to tell me that the chef did in fact try the sandwich I ordered and indeed confirmed that it was too salty. Unfortunately, my dissatisfaction of the sandwich, ruined my overall experience there. The waitresses were awesome and the decor was magnificent. But that high a caliber of restaurant, you would expect quality food. Appetizers were great for the most part. The desserts we ordered, ""Gateau Marjolaine"" and the ""Crepe Facon Gateau"" were slightly above average. For the prices of the entrees, you're not going to get your money's worth. As wonderful the waitstaff and amazing the decor is, the prices are too high for the quality and presentation of the food. The food simply does not give the place and service justice. We were given three complimentary mini scoops of ice cream for the salty French Dip sandwich case. A kind gesture. SHOUTOUT: Our waitress Meagan was helpful when describing various items on the menu. It appeared that she had to leave, so Heidee took over. Heidee was cheerful and an overall pleasant waitress. Would I recommend this place? I can't say I would. I'm aware this is a new restaurant but first impressions are KEY and they didn't quite cut it. There are just too many better restaurants out there to settle. I preface this review by disclosing I am fan boy of Thomas Keller and those who have followed in his footsteps.  With Corey Lee, I experienced a Ratatouille moment when I dined at Benu.  So needless to say, I was giddy as a school boy when I heard he was opening up a late night (SF wise) French bistro. Side notes first. So the decor and ambiance fit the modern styling of a casual but upscale SF eatery, especially those found in Hayes Valley. The service was friendly and welcoming, they made us feel like we were at a dinner party with a large group of extended friends. The drinks were tasty. 'Nuff said. This meal was a bit pricey, however, my friend and I did not hold back this night.  We had numerous cocktails, oysters, appetizers, entrees, a dessert and the cheese plate.  So we weren't really surprised that the meal came out to over $ a head.  More importantly, I didn't have any regrets and had a good time. Main notes. As expected, the quality of the ingredients were excellent and the food was executed at a very high level. We started out with the oysters, and they were delicious.  Super fresh, and I highly recommend adding some of that magical horseradish. Appetizers came next with our selection of the steak tar tare, sweet breads and whipped chicken liver with chips.  The beef's texture was very nice (hand chopped vs ground), and the plate was dressed with golden kisses of warmed/barely cooked egg yolks.  The whipped chicken liver was really interesting.  It was light and airy, it was almost like a foam that the intricate grids of fried potato goodness scooped up. The sweet breads were a highlight dish.  Lightly breaded, perfectly seared, balanced with a light sauce with the contrasting tastes from the pickled onions. For the entrees, we had the Quail and the Duck Confit. The Quail was good.  I'd order that or the fish for myself next time I visit. Other bistros have Duck Confit, they're not as good.  It's most evident with the taste and feel of the skin.  Golden, highly crisped with no signs of an over searing, while maintaining the richness of the duck meat. Home StretchI opted for the Gateau Mariolaine and my friend ordered the cheese to finish. The Gateau was nice, it came with a light, hazelnut sauce,  I looked at it for a while, appreciating the work that went into it (see picture) before I quickly dispatched it. Overall it was a good night.  For bistro fare it goes beyond what I expect.  I'm eager to see their prix fixe as well as brunch menu.  With anything, it's all about what you like.  To me, what Monsieur Benjamin offers is a friendly neighborhood bistro with a kitchen that executes at a high level. Would I come here again, yes.  Should you come and try this place, definitely. I called to make a reservation and was told that they have an : and : open.  neither of those times worked great for me, but after thinking about it, i said ok i'll take  the :.  the person i spoke to said ""ok, thank you"" and hung up.  i then realized that i hadn't given him my name, phone number or any other info other than my party size.  how could he put down my reservation with no name?  i was still a little worried about the : time, so i decided to wait until i talked to my family to call back.  i called back a couple days later, and they told me that (obviously) there was nothing put down for a table of  for : and also that now no reservations were available.  ugh.  later they had a manager call me back, and when i explained the story he basically told me that all of his staff is trained enough to be able to make a reservation. . . essentially insinuating that there is no way that his staff could have made a mistake and that i am clearly either lying or i messed up somehow.  not really great customer service.  i guess i'll have to celebrate my birthday elsewhere. Delicious, pleasant and fine service. Arctic Char was excellent.  star restaurant trying to get away with  star veneer. I really wanted to love this place  it's trendy name and decor. But it has a bit of an identity problem in terms of its food/menu. Charging high end prices $ $ entrees for $ $ worth (at best) small portions and average quality. No bread with meal or chef treat, etc. Left crumbs and mess on our table w/o the usual crumb sweep before next course for a better restaurant. Underwhelmed by the ""what you get for what you pay"" ratio of every appetizer and dish we tried, except for the dessert which was quite delish. Server not knowledgeable about the wines and also recommended the chicken liver mousse appetizer which was definitely not good  tasted like chicken liver whipped into egg whites or jello or something, but put into  a terrine dish  ew.  Tartare tasty but meat overwhelmed by seasoning and heavy use of chopped bell peppers. Dinner for two with no alcoholic drinks well over $ before tip.  In contrast, had just had an amazing Michelin star meal at State Bird Provisions, with stupendous glass of wine and dessert, for $ pp all in including a % tip. Not fair to compare, but reality. But because they were nice and space is hip and pleasant, go for desserts and drinks. Or you will appreciate if you aren't a foodie and just like a cool urban scene. Maybe it's just new restaurant identity crisis. Will wait a year and try again. I went again and it was just as marvelous! The front of house staff are universally excellent and so was the food! Came here a week after it opened and was loved the set up and decor. I thought the standing bar counters on the left hand side looked rather low and the  gentlemen eating there looked really awkward and out of place because of it. Bone marrow: best I've had in a while. I loved the simplicity of it as I strongly dislike restaurants that smother marrow in breadcrumbs. The marmalade complimented the dish very well and it was a good portion to share. Croquettes: Hot! These weren't bad but felt a little under seasoned to me. Duck terrine: Great dish! Blanquette de Veau: Severely under seasoned and utterly bland. Even the mushrooms and onions were tasteless. I was extremely disappointed. French Dip Sandwich: My friend did not like this. He took maybe   bites before giving up. He said the spinach ruined the texture and overall taste of the sandwich. Palmier Ice Cream  Way too sweet for me; there was just too much sugar and syrup on here. This is also a triple scoop of ice cream so good thing we only ordered one dessert. Personally, I would be happier getting ice cream at Smitten's around the corner. Someone came by to apologize for our entrees and offered to take it off the bill. I really wanted to like this place and was excited walking in. The starters were solid but the main courses really need work. That said, service was great and I would be willing to come back again to give them another try. When I saw that Corey Lee had opened up MB, I knew I wanted to get in before it becomes impossible to snag a reservation.  Three weeks in and already it is a packed house which shows that he definitely have a following.  Food:  Everything looked so enticing that it was hard to choose so we ended up with a bunch of appetizers/small plates and only one main course. Camembert Beignets  Comes with  one inch square beignets and it is not camembert filled beignets but is baked into the dough so you don't have to worry about making a mess biting into it but like most beignets, beware of the powderface if you exhale while eating it.  Personally I would've liked it filled and have the camembert ooze out of it when you bite into it to give it more of a flavor punch.  Pate de Campagne  This pate is not spreadable pate but is a hodgepodge of pork that just works.  It could've used an extra piece or two of bread though. Steak tartare  One of the highlights of the meal as I liked the multiple pieces of partially cooked egg yolk giving it a creamy texture and a nice balance to the saltier tartareEscargot Bordelaise  I did not hate it like some reviewers but I also did not love it.  I guess I am more of a traditionalist when it comes to escargot, simple served in butter and garlic.  I believe there might've been some mushrooms in the sauce and for some reason I seemed to taste an essence of tea from the dish similar to the tea leaf salad at Burma Superstar which threw me off a little.  Seafood Sausage  Blend of shrimp, scallops, clams, and supposedly lobster in this sausage with a little pine nuts for texture, this is one sausage you won't find elsewhere.  Yes, pricey at $.  but try it at least once.  Arctic Char  By the time this came out, I was already full as French food tends to be richer and heavier.  Had only a bite of it and loved the nutty flavor of the almonds crusting the fish and the sunchoke that hits your taste buds in all the right places. Unfortunately too full for dessert which I guess means I have to return again before the word gets out although it seems to already be out!!Note:  It would be nice if we get a basket of bread at the table as I could've used another couple of slices with the pate and a slice or two for the escargot ""sauce"" It is so fun to go to a restaurant that makes great food . Food that you could never make at home. My wife had the  seafood sausage that was to die for.  My app was the mussels in the beer that is restaurant brewed. Her main course was the arctic char and I had the quail. Both were outstanding. Happening venue and excellent service. The chocolate dessert was off the hook. Will come back soon. What a food experience!   We were so excited for Chef Corey Lee's new restaurant and had to try it.   My wife and I made reservations for dinner and we were not disappointed. Duck was delicious, steak tartare was perfect, seafood sausage was a great recommendation, mussels had a wonderful sauce, the beignets were nothing to rave about.  Wine menu was extensive. Great wine recommendation the Ace cocktail was splendid! There are a few reasons I couldn't give this place  stars.  The first being the location I was sitting.  On more than  occasions, the waiter/staff bumped either into my seat or bumped my head trying to get to the corner table.  I tried moving my seat further  over or in, but the tables were so close I had limited space. That was extremely annoying and ruined parts of the dinner.  The other complaint was our waiter. It initially took approximately  minutes before she came to offer water or take drink orders.  Also our food service was slow as we observed our neighbor who came in well after us receive their food shortly after.  Our final complaint is her attitude.  After our meal was complete she was clearing our table.  Since the space was so limited my wife was trying to help and hand her the plate.  She reacted extremely flustered and rudely said ""I GOT IT!""  What a way to end our dinner.  We didn't feel like staying for the dessert. Our overall food experience was wonderful, but the service was not terrible, but needed some improvement. I would definitely come back possibly in a few months when their staff has a little more experience. Monsieur Benjamin is a treat!  Definitely recommend this spot for celebrations, and a usual night out.  My friend called the restaurant to make reservations as soon as she saw the press announcement for its opening (she's cool like that!).  Since it just opened, reservations are a tad bit hard to get, we needed a table of , but I recommend trying and going on off days.  Also, I believe they are on Open Table. Drinks: We brought our own wine.  Corkage fee is $.  My friend is moving, so she needs to put her collection to good use. Food: Delicious! No too vegetarian friendly.  Only thing on the entrée menu that catered to vegetarians was roasted vegetables, kinda sad and boring.  Especially once you ask the staff what the vegetables are (turnips and such, I can't handle turnips). Dessert: Must try the crepe (with strawberries, strawberry sorbet, mint, crème fraiche and a whole lotta goodness) and Palmier Ice Cream w/ calvados caramel (this is about  times better than the Birite Salty Caramel)Staff: Amazing!  I didn't get our server's name, but probably the best person we've had in the city till date.  Super easy going, great with recommendations, super friendly, made our experience so much better!A great alternative to the pricey pricey Benu. The restaurant is a bit cold but the service warmed up the experience. The food is good for the most part and some items don't work too well. They are new so they will fix it. Best dish for us: Escargot, Duck Terrine (pricey though) and the Artic Chard (great take on the truite amandine). Their GM (Thomas) does a great job as running the restaurant and added the right touch to the restaurant. I came here on opening night and had a really good experience. I love the interior of the restaurant, the decor is contemporary, but warm and the colors are great. Our waiter was a little snarky, but service was fast. The food came out very quickly and everything tasted pretty good, especially the steak tartare and scallops. Lobster pasta was quite nice too. Also enjoyed the wine and cocktails. I would definitely come back some time. Oh we were lucky to slip in here early last night . . . . . . before all the smart locals with reservations!We loved the full array of appetizers and side dishes; settling on the innovative Seafood Sausage with its crunchy exterior that explodes into soft, buttery seafood morsels in your mouth! Then the Oeufs Mayonaisse with its puréed parsley and peppery chervil glided onto our table and we knew we were in very capable chef hands. Next we enjoyed the soup, a French masterpiece with small chunks of fresh vegetables in a savory chicken broth that dazzled our eyes like Cezanne does. The main dish, the French Dip Sandwich was a handsome match of roast beef and horseradish layered with gruyere and dipped into a salty beefy gravy. We savored the special talents at work here, in our first meal at this exciting new Hayes Valley hotspot. Good food, good cocktails.  Especially liked the oysters, beef tartare and duck confit.  The lobster ragu was unimpressive and overcooked.   The interior is beautiful but very sterile. I really enjoyed my meal, especially considering the restaurant just opened. Standouts include the Whipped Chicken Liver (served with potato chips), Steak Tartare (similar to a deconstructed hash. . . . m), Sweetbreads, and the Crepe Gateau. We ordered the Lobster, which tasted good, but for $ the lobster bites should have been bigger vs. the small dice. Personally, I think if you are buying a high end protein, you want to know the dish doesn't just have juice/essence of the protein in there, so there should be some larger bites. My friend had been there before and had similar feedback on the escargots. The stem on my wine glass broke, and they quickly expedited me with a new glass and extra pour. There was a small wait for our table, even with a reservation, but once we were seated the staff was very attentive and did a good job checking in with us as the meal progressed. Overall, there are some small kinks, which need to get worked out, but I expect this restaurant to be one of my favorite new openings of the year. I'm already looking forward to going back and trying more of the menu. Overcooked small burger.  Good fries.  Croquettes were underwhelming. I would walk a few doors down and go to Chez Maman if I was looking for a good french bistro. Best thing about this place is its cute fox logo. The quality to value ratio is definitely not there. Great place to catch a meal before the Symphony. Service: friendly, attentive, knowledgeable, and had good wine recommendationsFood:Beef Tartar  light, airy, well balanced flavors with delicate eggSweetbreads  lightly breaded and quite flavorfulQuail  super tender and moist, crisp skin, wonderful mushroom sauce, amazingLobster Ragout  noodles nice and al dente, ragout was flavorful and complex with nice lobster sweetnessGreat dining experience and definitely would return to try the other dishes on the menu! Having dined at benu previously I was concerned that this restaurant might be all hype & not much else. . . thankfully I was pleasantly surprised! The  of us shared escargot, seafood sausage, mussels & croquettes for starters & the seafood sausage was the absolute standout! The broth of the mussels was equally delicious with layered flavours. For dinner  of our party had the Arctic char, one lobster ragout & one burger. Everyone claimed their dish was the best. The fish was perfectly cooked, the almond addition just took it to another level & the light smear of sauce under the fish was simply delicious. The lobster ragout. Wow. The layering of flavours was just wow. A good sized portion with a good amount of lobster & apparently the burger was pretty good too. All in all we had a great night enjoying delicious food! Had high hopes about this new french resto in Hayes but left the place in disappointment to be honest. Good things first : decor, open kitchen, friendly host, starters and the cocktails. Meh. things: Ordered lamb steak thinking it would be served with artichokes and bunch of other ingredients written in the menu but what i found was a steak sitting in the middle of a plate and topped with molecular size chopped ingredients to the point that you need a magnifier to identify which is which. Same problem with lobster pasta which is one of the most pricey main dishes in the menu: super small pieces of lobster and herbs on angel hair pasta. Very disappointing, come on guys you could do better than this! especially when restaurant industry is highly competitive around this time. Beef tongue and escargot were satisfying however again, don't expect to see the snail in it's shell, it's chopped as well. . . Whoever chops those pricey ingredients well in the kitchen, gets paid well and helps that restaurant to save money. Wait, not over yet. . dessert is the most ridiculous part  of that, they placed  different cheese kinds under the dessert menu, followed by a sorbet and an ice cream one and then finally there's ONLY ONE dessert item there which is a thin slice of cake, with different layers and hazelnuts. And even that one was just ok. . nothing to talk about. Walking back from the Mission to Lower Pac Heights around pm, we came across Monsieur Benjamin. It was. . . . OPEN. I was hungry. We went in. Fine, upscale yet casual French bistro. Ordered: two glasses of white Bordeaux, olives, grilled lettuces, and a pate de compagne with a little sliced baguette. Every bite was perfect. The olives were glorious. The pate was rich and firm. The lettuces were soft and dripping with flavor. And the butter, omg. It was a delightful surprise to come across this restaurant I hadn't even known was there. I would most likely come here for small late night bites. The entrees are priced in the   range. I would have dinner here on a special occasion. Chefs are top notch and an open kitchen is always a treat. Service was accommodating, friendly, and un intrusive. Highly recommend. Meh.  I was really excited about this restaurant.  Went in and tried a bunch of small plates.  Nothing was  star amazing, except the oyster.  But if I wanted just oysters, I would go somewhere else. Two dishes that were particularly sad were the Mussels and Escargot.  The Mussels were served with very little sauce, so that when they brought out all the food at once (seriously, why did they do that?) the mussels at the top and middle quickly dried out, and were gross and stinky.  The escargot was not classic snails.  It had some strange gelatinous taste to it, and was a huge disappointment, since I LOVE escargot!I was hoping this would be the cafe Beaujolais of SF for me, but it inst.  Too bad, I was really hopeful, and now still craving good escargot : ( Perfect modern French bistro with some American flare. Easy enough to get a seat (a lot of seats for walk in and others on opentable) but busy enough it feels happening. It's lively but not loud. Service is fantastic with abundant staff impeccably dressed in clean whites. They're friendly too!Food wise, I recommend the veal which was in a cream sauce that wasn't too heavy but quite tasty. The sweet bread is a greater starter. The quail was also perfectly cooked with an amazing presentation unlike anywhere I've seen. The cocktails are excellent and clearly belong to the ""craft cocktail"" tier. The wine list is also great (very heavy on the French) Excellent meal, quality service by professional and good humored staff.   I would eat here again.   Must not miss the duck confit, potato and leek croquettes, and the  layer cake for dessert.   The Lobster Ragout left a bit to be desired, although the homemade pasta was excellent.    If you like cocktails, don't miss the ""Ace"" which is delicious and deceptively easy to drink. Two days into my detox diet and the hubby asks, ""Would you like to try the new restaurant downstairs? My treat. ""  Um  it's Chef Corey Lee's newest venture so. . . Yes, kind sir! I will re start my diet tomorrow!We've been waiting for this place to open  and it was definitely worth the wait! The atmosphere is trendy, yet relaxed  love the open kitchen concept and decor. The GM and his service staff were not just accommodating and knowledgeable, but they all seem genuinely happy to work there.  All smiles even with a packed room at :pm!  And of course  the food.  I couldn't get past the appetizers because it had all my classic French faves! Oysters  Beausoleil and Shigoku, served with house spicy sauce ($.  a piece)Chicken Wings Persillade  pretty hefty serving for a ""small plate""  which worked well for us because they were so good with the parsley crumbs!Steak Tartare  served with a thin crispy lavash and egg yolk bits craftily blended inSteamed Mussels  always a favorite, and even more with the garlic sausageBeef Tongue Dijonnaise  loved the flavors on this dish with the tender meat on top of rye croutonSweetbreads Grenoblaise  highlight of our meal! It was crunchy, rich and delicious!Marrow Bones ""Blue Ribbon""  did I say the sweetbreads were the highlight? Changed my mind  this one is!  It's also the one that will inspire me to hit the gym tomorrow!All in all, a very satisfying meal from Chef Corey Lee  and we haven't even tried the main courses. Oh, and did I mention that they had a good wine and cocktail menu and were open late?!  This is now solidly in my Hayes Valley dining spot faves! Nom nom! I was able to snag a spot on their communal table on opening night. And aside from their service (which was pretty messy even for an opening night. hence the  star) everything was lovely. Atmosphere: Trendy, clean, french brassiere look. It is lively and noisy in a good way. Not too loud. The bar are is small but you have a nice view of the fully open kitchen. the layout of the restaurant is also very open and nice. Food:A very clean and full menu. options for everyone and every type of eater. I have to say the steak tar tar was phenomenal  the way they did the egg yolk was really fun and different. Steak TarTar   starsLobster Ragu  starsCroquette   stars ( i wish it had more cheese/flavor)Drinks:Great cocktails and wine listService: like i said the service was pretty bad  i usually give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to opening day, but this wasnt a soft opening, and they forgot about taking our order for a good min, when finally the manager came and took it. I'm sure they will work out those kinks eventually so i can't judge too hard yet. Yelp thinks I'm a regular. Waitstaff greets me as if I were one. I must be one then  for a restaurant that is less a week old, that is. It's not difficult to eat here when you crave for something different and have been bored of the Mission. ""It's a cat. "" I said. ""No, it's a fox. "" He corrected me. It was, or course a fox. He's about to go and see his best friend from high school, whom I worked with once upon a time at a well known management consulting firm, who was now living in Northern Europe. We met, however, through an entirely different set of circumstance in San Francisco nearly two decades ago. The world is indeed a very small and random place. He was feeling happy and relaxed. I was about to go to my summer home in France while making a routine pit stop in Germany, his home country, and to see my friends. Just then the sweetbread arrived. It was delicious as one would expect. I had tried the bone marrow here before, while good, it was going to give me a heart attack, it was, however, a perfect food group to consume before you engage in extraneous physical activities, such as a full trail marathon the next day. Another must try is beef tartare, it was the caper they said. The capers and olive made it unique, or at least a crowd pleaser. Saw the neighbors having Burgundy snails, but having ridden my bike to the town where the very said snails were raised and cooked up right at my house, it's forever ruined my snail experience elsewhere. So I would say, try it if you must, but it is probably not as good as the escargots de Bourgogne by my French house, sorry. I never thought of myself as a Francophilia, though my girlfriends who have seen my photos on Facebook ever since I developed permanent crush with Paris circa  would beg to differ. Every summer holiday eventually led me to a stone farm house with not one but two gardens in Burgundy. Say to him, ""This reminds of me food I could get at home, if I was lucky. Come sometime. Go cave wine tasting. Smoke a ciggi on the street corner cafe. Watch me dancing or dance with me in the field of meadow for no reason at all. Then catch the train to Berlin when we are bored of the country life. "" ""And always fetch terrine with a folk being held on our left hands. "" I added as I finished the sweetbread, holding the folk on my left hand. ""You and your attraction for left handedness. "" He said while holding his folk in his left hand as I did. Just then our entrees arrived. Lamb shank fell off the bone. Chicken bathed in golden glistering. Both generous portions and superbly displayed on plates with fox imprinted on. Details. Details. Details. Staff was well trained. Food wonderfully prepared. I should have known. I have tried nearly everything on the menu. For a restaurant that was less than a week old, this is as good as it gets. But not just for a new restaurant, but for that specific genre: modern French bistro. Is this Midnight in Paris?Would I cross time and meet Josephine Baker or Salvado Dali? What about Edgar Degas or Pablo Picasso?  ""That was the movie you watched when you flew to Munich the first time. You told me so when you landed. We saw a Dali painting at SFMOMA just a week before. "" He reminded me. Has time really flied when food was this good?Another satisfied meal was had by two people departing for Europe, separately, together. Well dress staff sporting a Theory man's jacket opened the door as we were leaving. He knew that I'd be back. I always do. I don't think I can add much to the chorus of approbation from my fellow Yelpers.  I will say that I've been very much looking forward to M Benjamin's opening, as I especially love this style of French brasserie/bistro.  What a great complement to Absinthe and Chez Maman. I went in on a Saturday evening around : or so with no reservation, and was promptly seated at the communal table.  I normally don't like communal tables, but this was fine.  Because I only ordered the chicken soup and sweetbreads appetizers I can't comment on a full meal experience, but what I had was excellent.  I can be very picky about my restaurant outings, but I can't find anything to complain about here.  The food, service, ambience, decor, clientele. . . all to my liking. I'll be back soon for a full meal, diet be damned!! This is a .  star review. Went there for a dinner before Daniel Tosh's show at Nourse Theatre nearby, and it was actually a good call that we made a reservation before heading there as the whole place got crowded in a snap. Once we arrived, we were greeted eagerly by a super nice host/manager(maybe?) with a strong charming French accent. We were seated right away at a fab location table next to the window. My bf ordered a Leffe Blonde, good as usual, while I got a Pouilly Fume sauvignon blanc for drinks. For food, we started with pesto escargots, a great dish but a bit too much pesto, dipping bread in there and now you are in heaven. The next starter is sweetbreads. I always love this delicate part of entrails, even love it more when MB perfectly cooked it. We were sharin a lobster ragout for a main course, averagely good but not that outstanding. After we finished our main course, we ordered a crepe facon gateaux and a Muscat de beaumes de venise, and this is why I took out a .  star. It was a very long wait until we got our crepe. The crepe was exquisite but the gap between the two course was too big. We kinda got bored and unappetized by the long wait. All in all, I think we will be coming back here, probably for a weekday dinner when the crowd is not too big, to try other dishes on the menu. Let me put this straight  Monsieur Benjamin MB is worth the + months wait. It's Corey Lee's second act after Benu. Appetizers did worry me a bit, yet entries totally sealed the deal. Looking forward to purchasing their serving plates!Parking is always tough in that neighborhood, esp. with tons of restaurants and the Opera House in proximity. Décor is by Aidlin Darling Design (Bar Agricole), kinda reminds me of Nojo. We got there @ :pm yesterday (FRI) and it's already full house with two  seat left. Good vibe, causal yet elevated. Great service from both the GM and our server. A successful kitchen/restaurant does have their food & service under control even on its rd day of business. Price is actually on the high end as a ""bistro"".  Considering it's tricky to present successful classic French dishes, I still highly recommend MB. Brunch service is upcoming and more walk in seats will be available. Escargots were fresh, yet under seasoned. Skip the beignets. Fries were. . . . . . .  fries. Luckily, the quail and duck confit + sausage dishes confirmed my wait was worthy. Probably should have ordered the gateau marjolaine, the palmier ice cream was ok. The duck confit is *it*! We've been looking for a good rendition for quite some time. Finally found one. Extra credit for being open late (until am  we walked in after the opera at :pm). Nice open space, pretty noisy and tables are close, but we'll be back. I don't usually try places right when they open, but I had faith in Corey Lee's team.  Even on the nd night open, it was super packed, so I'm glad we had a reservation.  The space is very open, and you can see exactly what's going on in the kitchen. . I wish we had gotten one of the counter seats facing the kitchen, though. Hayes valley parking can be hit or miss, but we got lucky on one of the side streets; there are a few lots near the symphony, too. The cocktail list sounded really interesting: My morning sun: iced green tea, gin, saffron liqueur. I  was looking for something less sweet, but this one really did just taste like iced tea and gin. I couldn't taste any hints of saffron Dagger of a day: definitely the better cocktail. It had cognac, bonal, apricot liqueur, and angostura bitters.  It was a beautiful color and had so many layers of flavor that went together reall well. All of the wines are under $/bottle, and we went with Cru Beaujolais (Regnie, Colette ) for $. It was a very light red, and it went well with our food. It took a while for our server to come back around to get the food order, but then the food came out relatively quickly:  Camembert beignets: mini savory beignets, which are very light, and you can smell the porcini dust on top as they bring the dish by Potato leek croquettes: I was expecting more of a whipped potato texture, but it was like a whole fried baby potato, and I could not taste the gruyere or leek. It was not what I expected and was kind of disappointing Steak tartare: mild, with a bit of cornichons, runny egg yolk. The pissaladiere lavash was a nice light base for it, but I actually prefer stronger flavors with my tartare Bone marrow:  pieces that are big but shallow.  The grilled bread was the perfect vehicle for the standout part of the dish  the bacon jam!  I would have jarred this and taken it home if I could have.  The bacon jam was definitely the best part of the meal Lobster ragout: the spaghetti was thin and cooked nicely, but the lobster and shrimp were overdone.  The lobster is supposedly brought over from Benu.  The ragout lacked the sweet lobster flavor, and it ended up kind of chewy Duck confit: good flavor on the confit, but it was a pretty small portion.  It had confit and sausage, and the sausage tasted more like pork?Dessert: Palmier ice cream: palmier bits in ice cream with a calvados caramel sauce (didn't really taste the caramel). I never thought to put palmiers into ice cream, and it worked well, so now I know what to do with my stale palmiers!Service was a bit slow to start, but otherwise, they did pretty well considering they had just opened.  The menu is very traditionally French in its description, and the dishes were kind of hit or miss.  Again, bacon jam was the highlight.  I can see this place quickly becoming popular, and I suspect it'll soon be difficult to get a table here. Stopped by on opening night for an entree and a glass of wine with my girlfriend. Food was very well executed and they have a small but well curated selection of wines by the glass. Service was coordinated and well informed. Thomas the GM was extremely gracious in welcoming us to the new restaurant which is sleek and well appointed. We made sure to place a reservation on our way out to bring our friends back. Welcome to the neighborhood Mr. Benjamin. The Arctic char was outstanding, and I was happy to oblige when my boyfriend offered me a bite of his steak frites. I predict that Benjie's (my nickname for this place that I hope catches on) will become the nopa of Hayes Valley. Looking forward to coming back over and over again! .  STARS Now that every woman's dream of banging Ryan Gosling and birthing his first born is completely shattered thanks to the hawtest cougar I know (how is Eva ?!), I now turn you to the next best thing: French Men. Oui, oui! Seafood play!Obviously, I didn't last  weeks in my French class so I'll stop now. Walking into Monsieur Benjamin (MB), we were welcomed by a familiar face, Thomas, the most charming French man and GM. We met Thomas several months ago at Stones Throw where he was the GM. He told us about Corey Lee's new project and I told him we would see him on opening day. So, here we were. MB is Corey Lee's (Benu) casual French Bistro in the newly built Ivy building in Hayes Valley. The dinner menu is divided into  categories: oysters, small plates, appetizers, entrees, and sides. Weekend brunch service will begin in August. Portions are on the smaller side and expect to spend around $ pp for a  course meal including one cocktail/glass of wine, tax, and tip. ~ * ~ F O O D ~ * ~*Steak Tartare w/ egg yolk & pissaladiere lavash ($. ): bit. ly/qZlPE*Sweetbreads Grenobloise w/ capers & brown butter ($. ): bit. ly/TUURK*Loup de Mer w/ mussel provencale ($): bit. ly/omrWac*Duck Confit & Sausage w/ grapes & sauce au poivre ($): bit. ly/sBVRk*Palmier Ice Cream w/ calvados caramel ($): bit. ly/zrBmCEverything on the menu was enticing but since it was just the two of us, we settled on the aforementioned. I can't help but compare the food to Gaspar Brasserie in FiDi that opened in late May (my review: bit. ly/qNoQm). Both restaurants serve classical French fare with California influences making the food not overwhelmingly rich or heavy. For starters, you can't go wrong with Steak Tartare at a French bistro and MB's rendition was great. Instead of serving it with a raw yolk, a slightly cooked yolk concoction was piped throughout the dish. Sweetbreads are the epitome of French decadence for me. Deep fried then lacquered with a brown butter sauce, the sweetbreads were deliciously velvety.  However, I wished the sauce was only garnished on the plate instead so they would have maintained more of a crunch. I chose the Loup de Mer as my main. The fish was perfectly seared with a nice crispy skin and was sitting atop a tomatoey mussel ragout. I  really enjoyed the flaky texture and an exquisitely sweet and mild flavor of the seabass. Mr. NSS ordered the Duck Confit & Sausage as his main. I only had a small bit of his confit but the bite that I had was really good. The duck was rendered well leaving the skin super crisp and the meat very tender. A must order for dessert was the palmier ice cream. The vanilla ice cream base alone was excellent but interweaving it with crunchy palmier cookies and calvados caramel was olala good! Pack this into pints to sell please!~ * ~ D R I N K S ~ * ~*Way Back When: dry rye gin, yellow chartreuse, celery ($): bit. ly/oGduvc*The Ace: rye, calvados, sloe gin, honey, lemon & rosemary ($): bit. ly/qZVwYBoth cocktails were strong and well balanced. Darks usually make me gag but our waiter recommended The Ace so I thought I give it a try. Delicious. It was like drinking a spiked cider with a touch of aromatics from the rosemary. ~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~Considering it was MB's grand opening last night, the staff did an excellent job. They were well versed with the menu, made great suggestions, and was very attentive without being intrusive. Food service was very timely. We were in and out within  minutes which why I enjoy eating like old farts. Thomas, the GM is probably the most pro active one I've ever seen. From making menu suggestions to delivering food to tables, he was really engaging with all the customers. And, THAT French accent makes it even better. So while the food was  stars for me (compared to Gaspar), the exemplary service boosts MB's overall rating. ~ * ~ A M B I A N C E / D E C O R ~ * ~I have much appreciation for chefs and what they do so love open kitchens. MB's focal point is their center open kitchen and bar which divides the dining area into two sections, and where you can watch the mixologist and Lee's team in action. I took and uploaded a panoramic view of the restaurant in my Yelp app which completely failed (please fix the bugs!) so this pic will have to do: bit. ly/qnJGZ. Loved that they played Jay Z and Jackson  in the beginning (we were told it was Lee's selection) which adds a hip casualness but then the music turned to boring elevator type music. *le sigh* Maybe to better suit the crowd?~ * ~ P A R K I N G ~ * ~Easy street parking before  pm (non show nights). The closest garage is .  blocks away on Grove and Gough (Performing Arts) for a $ nightly flat rate. I can't wait to come back for brunch in August and to bask in oolaala French accents! Oui, oui! Seafood play! This review comes with some bias as Corey Lee is one of the people that have changed the way that I view food. Since my first encounter at TFl, and the multitude of times I've hit Benu, it was a no brainer that I would enjoy M. Benjamin. I peaked in the  Ivy building months ago and it seemed like an empty shell then. It's been transformed into a sleek, wood, glass and steel dark toned space. you walk into the large glass doors flanked by even larger windows. The bar sits right in front with the dining rooms on either side. The kitchen opens up in the back where there's a flurry of activity. Unlike the Benu soft opening though, they worked with a full dining room tonight. Almost all the seats were taken even those at the bar. After perusing the menu we ended up with: Beausoleil & Shigoku oysters Beef tongue Dijonnaise Sweet Breads Grenoibloise Beef Bone Marrow ""Blue Ribbon"" (ode to Blue Ribbon Brasserie in NYC) Lobster Ragout w/ Spaghetti, Mirepoix, Fine Herbs Steak Frites Crepe Facon Gateau Gateau Marjolaine w/ Creme AnglaiseThis is an ode to all the French Bistro classics that s under represented in SF and a reflection of many of the things Chefs like to eat. After coming back from Paris and Brussels/Anderlecht I forgot how much I love this food too and how it's almost a dying breed here. Take a look at Daniel Boulud's current cookbook to see the real crazy stuff that you dont find anymore. M. Benjamin doesnt quite go that far, but it's a great start. The food is delicious, and so are the cocktails and wine. If you go to benu you'll see some familiar faces here in both front and back of house and a handful of new ones that will take care of you on either side. The flood gates open later today and I can tell from all the eyes watching me eat dinner that it's going to pack it in. Hours are dinner to late night and soon open in the mornings too. Congrats on your opening Team Benjamin!Spotted in the crowd:Joshua Skenes of SaisonThe Tusks of QuinceCecilia ChangJoe & Sara of TacoliciousChad Robertson of TartineMourad Lalou of AzizaStuart & Nicole of State Bird ProvisionsMarcia aka TablehopperBelinda Leong of B. Patisserie Disclaimer: I am a huge fan of Benu and I was here for a soft launch on July , . The latest restaurant from chef owner Corey Lee, Monsieur Benjamin is spearheaded by Executive Chef Jason Berthold (previously from RN and a TFL/Per Se alum). The menu is fairly extensive, with entrees ranging from $ to $, putting it in the Rich Table bracket. My friend and I started off with the beignets and the croquettes. The former were different from the ones I had in New Orleans recently, saltier but delicate and fluffy. The potato and leek croquettes were wonderfully comforting. The steak tartare was probably my favorite. Perfectly spiced with the egg slightly cooked, each bite was balanced and delicious. The marrow was great but the marrow to bread ratio was a little off. Half (or /) portions of the bread would've been sufficient. If you have a friend who doesn't like sweetbreads, take them here. They'll change their minds. The texture had the right level of firmness, with none of the usual mushiness that sometimes occurs with sweetbread preparations. The lobster ragout was a strong contender for my favorite dish of the evening. It was absolutely delicious and I'll definitely be coming back for more. We ended the meal with one of the cheese selections (goat, and great cheese it was!) and the crepe, a satisfying finale. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the beverage selection. I started off with the Special Forces cocktail, which was sweetly pleasant though I would've liked to taste the walnut more strongly. I also had a glass of the cru beaujolais and the macon perronne. I look forward to exploring the wine menu some more the next time I'm here. I hear they'll be open for brunch in a few weeks too, which is an exciting prospect. With more casual French bistro style fare, Monsieur Benjamin (MB? M. Ben? Five syllables are a mouthful. . . ) will stay open until  am.

Verbena 0|4.0|American (New) in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|179|0|3.78571428571|" I really like this place for a few reasons one I'm not vegetarian but I rather eat mostly veggies than meat. Most restaurant has % meat the rest is veggies this one is % veggies and the rest is meat. Two I really enjoyed the plating every dish had a lot of thoughts into it and three even veggies had a lot of flavors like the mushroom bowl with a tasty broth. Dessert we had the white chocolate & strawberries cheesecake I could have eaten an other one. Not your typical restaurant but very delicious. Different is good!! Ate here a month ago and am going back to try again because the food was inventive, the cocktails were good but there were a couple of problems:Portions were small.  Just a bite or two more would be nice?Waiter was kind of clueless, and we gave him a break because he was new, but he brought us some bread when we didn't order it, and then he tood it away and gave it free to the people next to us rather than asking us if we wanted it any way. WTF?Unlike Michael Baer, I did not like the meatballs with mole.  The Mole was kind of flat tasting and the meatballs were more like vealballs as they were soft and delicate. The Quail was very good.  The carrots were very good as well and all the food was beautiflully presented.  This is a great place for vegetarians as I saw the other vegetable dishes go by and those looked great as well. The parsnip ice cream was unusual and very tasty a good match to the chocolate crunchies (not cake) that it accompanied. Completely underwhelming. I really want to like this restaurant  great decor, wine list, and service. The food was just OK and the price is rather steep. We had the meatballs mole (dry but tasty sauce), vegetable bowl in broth (what a joke  peas and greens in broth.  $ for Two spoonfuls), and swordfish.  The ""Large"" plate with swordfish and clams was tasty but left us rather hungry afterwards.  We went home and had Prosciutto di Parma and Tartin Bakery Bread.  Delish!Speaking of bread, they charge $ for Bread and Butter.  Why?I will never suggest Verbena to my friends.  OK food for steep price.  On top of that, you walk away hungry.  That just mean that the restaurant's goal was not accomplished. I really enjoy Verbena's sister restaurant, Gather, so I had high expectations for Verbena. Unfortunately, it fell short. Nothing was bad, but nothing really stood out, either. My friend and I enjoyed the sprouted seed bread and the nettles ice cream the best.  The chevre served with the bread was smooth and mild. Even my friend, who normally isn't a huge fan of goat cheese, liked it. The nettles ice cream was surprisingly reminiscent of green tea ice cream. If we hadn't known it was made of nettles, we would have never guessed it. We also had the seafood sausage, which neither of us particularly liked. (I thought it tasted like the fishballs you get in Asian soups, only worse. ) The Koji quail was perfectly cooked, but I thought the grains it was served with were almost muddy tasting. I'd like to give it another chance once the menu changes, but until that happens, I'll continue to make the trip across the bridge to Berkeley to eat at Gather. Really enjoyed the interesting deliciousness of this place. Had the mushrooms, sausages, asparagus and kale salad. Everything was great, but I can't say I enjoyed the kale that much. The bread and butter were also delicious. A great place to try  cute inside, great food, definitely a must try. Our group of four went there this last Friday at .  without a reservation,  We were told that it would be  minutes until they could seat us, which is fine, so we went across the street to get a drink.  About  minutes later we get a text message indicating that they can seat us now, we tell them that we will be ten minutes,  They contact us again (not sure why) and we get over there.  The restaurant had numerous empty table, slightly suspicious for a nice Friday night.  Pro's: nice decor, much improved set up from Rex; like that their food comes from local sources (but then again, don't most reasonably nice restaurants in SF do the same?); the swordfish was great. Con's: server stopped by our table way too much at the beginning of the dinner, seemed to be pushing us to order (not a big deal); we got the impression that he was new. . . when asked about a certain dish, he said that it's wonderful, but then had to look at notes to describe it. . . again, not a big deal; we ordered maybe  dishes to be split between  of us, he said that we need to order a lot more, that for instance, the mushroom dish comes with ""maybe  little mushroom buttons"" which shocked me because most dishes were in the $ to $ range; we took his advice, and he was right. . . the dishes were tiny. . . asparagus, came with  stalks, total.  The carrots. . .  carrots on the plate, total = not nearly enough food for the price.  Also, the food took forever to come out.  We waited at least  minutes, finally asked him what was going on and he said that the food would be out in "" seconds"". . . about  minutes later the first dish showed up.  Total time,  to .  hours. In the end, the only dish that we all liked was the swordfish, which was great, but each person had two small bites.  For $ or whatever it was, not nearly enough food.  The server also forgot two dishes, which at that point we didn't care.  The bill came to $, which did include  rounds of drinks.  The two guys at the table walked out hungry. Worst dining experience in SF that I can remember, and for that price, never going back or recommending to anyone.  There are a lot of restaurants serving local, sustainable food. . . the difference is you get more food, you pay less and you will most likely be 'wowed' by more than one dish.  Avoid Verbena. P. S.  I've been to Gather in Berkeley, much better experience and value. Finally  creative food for vegetarians. Absolutely amazing dinner. Staff / service great.  out of  dishes were out of sight which the th was merely very good. I can't wait to go back. Note: We tried only vegetarian dishes so I have no clue about the non veg dishes. My friend and I walked to this place not knowing what to expect. A beautiful decor, very romantic and friendly, a bit lounge inspired, dim lights, the concept for food is great: plates that you can share, and the food is delicious and very original. We had a lovely time, and lovely gastronomic experience, and had such a hard time restraining ourselves on picking ALL PLATES! Will definitely visit again. . . to taste everything on the menu :D Why all the hype? They are simply a cut above. That is why. Tapas tasted great and looked fantastic. Look at all the uploaded pictures. Staffs are knowledgable and friendly. Ours were anyway. One point about charging for bread, I don't mind paying $.  for bread (when all other places are complimentary). But when I have to order for the third time and were told that I need to pay for each order, that kind of ruffled me a bit. May be they can change the practice so that refills are included. Still, I will go again and again. May be bring my own bread? This is a growing trend on my beloved Polk Street that I'm not very happy about. Stylish decor though much louder than it should be and pretty, teeny tiny, overpriced portions.  Verbena is much like   while I'm happy to see something there rather than an empty storefront or subpar taqueria, I will go to again but only if I'm not hungry and if someone else is paying the bill. Underwhelming. Likes  mushrooms, beef ribs, Frisees, beetsDislikes  paying $ for bread, swordfish / clams, meatballs/mole, agree with another review that for some reason the service seemed intrusive. our server was quite nice so didnt seem to be her fault but for some reason, all of us felt like the staff was constantly lurking and would pop up at awkward times. . . this might have been just us though. My boyfriend and I had dinner at Verbena for the third time last night and I decided it was finally time to sit down and write a review. In sum: We. Love. This. Place. The food is completely inventive, and this chef works miracles with vegetables. The menu has evolved a bit over the past few months as different vegetables have come in and out of season, but I have yet to try a dish at Verbena I did not love. Current favorite is the asparagus with squid and kimchi. It was so good we almost canceled our order of our final dish to get a second helping!Don't miss: the sprouted seed bread or the button mushrooms. Also, save room for dessert. The ginger molasses cake is to die for. (And this is coming from a diehard chocolate fan. )This is not the kind of place where you go for a heaping plate full of food. This is the kind of place where you savor every bite because the food is just that good. Take a moment to appreciate the presentation of the dishes before you dig in, too. Every dish is like a little work of art. We live in the neighborhood and could not be happier about this addition to Polk Street. Verbena, we hope you will stay for a long, long time! Quite possibly the worst restaurant in all of San Francisco. They make you experience your meal family style even though we said we didn't want that.  I waited .  hours for my quail dish, however it was not cooked all the way through.  The service was intrusive. This restaurant offers a cool ambiance and unique menu, categorized by type and ordered by size. I think the plates are best when shared, because of both size and presentation. My husband and I enjoy different things, so one of us would have all of one dish, while the other waited. Then the other person would have the second dish, while the other waited. It's a lot for one person to eat all of the veggie plate, or all of the meat dish, for example. But the dishes were delicious and our server made some excellent recommendations! The only thing that soured our experience was that the kitchen missed one of the dishes that we ordered. So when our plates were cleared, we tried to cancel it, but the server said it would be ready imminently. But we ended up waiting almost  minutes for it at the end of the meal. We thought we allocated sufficient time for dinner before getting where we needed to go, even though we dined in this successive fashion, but this delay made us late. Although it was very tasty, I wish they would have just allowed us to cancel the dish. I think this might be the best meal I've had in San Francisco thus far.  It's worth the trek to get all the way over here. The plating for everything was impeccable. It made me want to be the person who takes their phone out to take a photo of everything I'm eating.  But unfortunately for you all, I refrained. The quail was superb. As were the artichokes, sprouted bread, meatballs, and dessert.  So worth the time it took to get a reservation and the price.  I'd gladly spend it again on a restaurant this good. Good was good. Not worth the price we paid.   Portions were small but that was aspected. Great place all together. Has a unique and delicious menu with wonderful cocktails. Great lighting and a wonderfully designed space. Really enjoyed the Swordfish. Finally an exceptional specialty cocktail place in the area. Probably the best between the marina, cow hollow, and Polk street, though I don't go out on Polk street much!Anthony is the guy for well crafted drinks and if you ask nicely he may whip you up something off the menu! Awesome new addition to Polk st.  A little on the pricier end, the food was outstanding and they do some amazing things to deceptively simple ingredients.   This restaurant is designed for you to order a bunch of small plates and share.  For three people, we ordered  dishes. Favorites included:Carrots (yes, I discovered carrots could be mindblowing!)Swordfish main (cooked perfectly, delightful flavors)Sardines (super fresh, super good)ArtichokesAmbiance, lighting and volume level were perfect.  Had dinner for  and were able to quietly converse. Drinks were excellent and wine list very nice. Staff was attentive, but not invasive.  Super knowledgeable and they ordered our food perfectly to go from lighter to stronger flavors.  Manager also came over to ask how we enjoyed our meal and was very receptive to feedback.  We mentioned that the only dish with we felt was just okay was the seafood sausage, his response was pleasant and he immediately removed the item from our bill.  Nice move!Will be back for sure. Lovely new(ish) restaurant on Polk.  Try the chicken meatballs in mole, it's delicious!  Three meatballs come in the plate.  The quail is also fantastic and easy to share between two or four.  I love the artichokes with pine nuts, the flavors are fantastic.  Also tried the beets with yogurt and I think pistachios. . . larger plated presentation wise, beautiful appearance and delicious. The servers here seem to take pride in knowing about the wines and are a great help in making sure you order the right amount of food for your table.  Some dishes are small, others large so it can be a bit tricky.  Ordered a martini and it came in a tiny little glass ($), can't say I got my money's worth on that one but still, this is a great addition to Polk! Food was delicious but portions super small. We ate at the bar and the Bartender was super personable. We had a good time, just wish there was more substance to the food. Unfortunately, we see no other avenue but to share our dreadful experience at this place. Last Saturday night, we were excited for what we had planned to be a romantic post Valentine's evening. We informed our server (as we always do) of my husband's severe porcini mushroom allergy. The evening was flowing and to be fair to the chef we were really happy with our food.  The last dish came and after my husband had two bites, he immediately became ill. He was a having an allergy reaction (short of breath, chest pain, sweat, dry mouth). Luckily, I had Benadryl in my bag so I gave it to him right away. I signaled our server and asked him to inquire in the kitchen if there was any porcini in the dish. The general manager came back to confirm our suspicion. She was apologetic for the incident, gave each one of us her card and asked us to contact her if there was anything she could do for us. My priority at the time was to get my husband home for treatment and observation, so we asked for the check. The GM came back and to our complete disbelief, she fully charged us! I wanted to say something right at that time, but I'm not the type of person that creates a scene. Since she had already given us her card I figured I would call her later. We paid (even left a tip) and left quietly. I took my husband  hrs. to recover. I called the manager the next day to go over the unfortunate event and share our feelings of frustration and disappointment. She admitted the restaurant to be at fault and seemed concerned. She took my information and told me that she would follow up with me shortly. It's been a day since our conversation, and we have not heard back from her. My husband's health was at risk and no one at Verbena is taking responsibility for their lack of communication and poor customer service. This is simply unacceptable! I had heard great things about Verbena, so I booked a table  weeks in advance. I rallied a group of foodie friends to come with me, and we were all looking forward to a night out in SF. Unfortunately, this restaurant fell flat on all levels. For me Verbena is a classic case of too much ""concept"" and not enough substance. We ordered pretty much everything on the menu, and while there were definitely some stand out dishes, most items left us underwhelmed. This was especially true of the desserts. Wow  I was pleasantly surprised by Verbena.  Not going to lie, I was hesitant to try this place because the menu seemed to consist of primarily very expensive vegetables (roots, beets, fancy broccoli, etc. ).  The ones we ended up trying turned out to be quite tasty (and were indeed expensive).  As a bonus, the couple of meat dishes that we ordered were amazing (meatballs and swordfish)!  They did a really nice job with the interior / decor and the limited alcohol selection was solid.  While Verbena certainly isn't the best value play, the food was delicious enough to warrant a return visit. Verbena is a small flower long associated  throughout history, literature, and mythology  with the supernatural, the sacred, and the sensual.  One evening in this gorgeous, aptly named culinary mecca evokes these lofty adjectives, delivering a start to finish feast to delight every sense.  The decor and the vibe create an ideally harmonious balance, pairing rustic charm and casual comfort with sleek, modern, elegant flourishes.  The long brick wall behind the bar was instant karma  brick is always a winning feature  and the wooden frames holding large gray slate tiles were a study of subtly and simplicity.    On an opposite wall, small shelves of orange, red, or green pickled vegetables added a bright aspect to the dining room.  Every person we encountered, from the hostess to the gentlemen filling waters, could answer our copious menu related inquiries, and was a great and engaging host.  And then there is the matter of the food.  Each dish was an innovative and interesting riot of colors and flavors vastly different from anything I'd had before. Many of the flavors are unadvertised, too subtle to deduce, and too sublime to overlook.   The most inspiring dish of the evening was a medley of roasted carrots laid in a gentle curve across the center of the plate (shape and symmetry are important in the visual presentations here).  The carrots were sauteed in goat butter and paired with a creamy, whipped puree of nettles and cashews, then sprinkled with tiny verbena flowers and nettle ""chips. ""  A masterpiece, par excellence. Other plates were equally fanciful and nearly as delicious.  Cardoons (a vegetable that somehow looks like celery and tastes like artichoke) and parsnips were joined by wilted kale leaves and small dabs of charmoula and yogurt.  Marvelously prepared artichoke hearts rested in a pool of savory black garlic sauce aside salty pine nuts.  Thin slices of sprouted seed bread came with silky goat cheese sprinkled with the most interesting concoction of the evening:  dehydrated and granulated beet sauerkraut.  Whatever it may sound like, this curious feat of culinary engineering really, really worked.  Our two larger dishes were excellent, though each packed a surprising level of spice.  The stout pork and chicken meatballs were doused with a smooth but spicy black mole and served atop one of my favorite starchy comfort foods, hominy.  The swordfish in a hearty green cioppino had a serious kick, and a seriously diverse array of seafood (mussels, clams, and octopus to augment the fish).  The feisty fish stew came with a toasted slice of sourdough and excellent ""new oil"" (whatever it is, it's fabulous) aioli. We thankfully decided not to gyp ourselves out of dessert, and limiting ourselves to two of the three offerings on the menu was an epic struggle.  For one, we swooned over the molasses ginger cake (overwhelmingly moist and light) and its unique IPA caramel sauce.  The carrot sorbet with it was a nice touch, albeit too much high octane carrot taste for the dessert course.  Last not least was our chocolate course, in this case dollops of chocolate custard along with startlingly good parsnip ice cream (when parsnips are in season, their utility goes on full display!).  The streaks of Blenheim apricot gelee made for an intriguing combo.  Overall, this is the best new restaurant I've visited in a long time, a place that pushes creative bounds without being too far out, and features a menu of commendable diversity, including great vegetarian options. Those who know me, know I'm a fan of Sean Baker.  I tend to lie about my weight and age, but never my food. When I heard about Verbena, I could hardly contain myself. . . and. . . I waited months and months until opening night.  I admit, reading the menu scared me a little and honestly, I was underwhelmed by it.  Which is entirely due to the fact that I'm ignorant when it comes to vegetables and lack an imagination/creativity. So, I put my big girl pants on (literally) and popped in for a casual dinner.  Before I make my buzzfeedesque list of things, I must say as a carnivore, all the dishes I had (with the exception of the sardines) were ""celebrated vegetables"" and holy bazinga, they were amazing. Here goes:(Please note I'm dumbing it down for those of you who are like me and lack a vegimagination). ) Mushrooms  EVERYONE: get this, don't ask questions, it's what it sounds like but with tiny cherubs and harps dancing on your taste buds. . ) Beets  A work of art, too pretty to eat, but tastes better than it looks if that's possible. . ) Cardoons and parsnips  My favorite. Ever. WOW. Don't ask, just order. . ) Chicories  Dressing is SO good, gorgeous and rich in color, on the bitter side of course, so diner be ware if it's not your thing.  A great balance combined with the other dishes. . ) Artichokes  Tied for first place with the cardoons, ugh I have wet dreams about these little green nuggets. . ) Sardines  was the first thing I actually ordered because I loved them at Gather.  Still love them here, just a different spin on them. Every bite was complex, deep with flavor yet so simple.  I don't know how they do it, but you can tell from host/hostess, server, bartender, management and kitchen that no detail is too small to be overlooked.  Not even one taste bud left that place unsatisfied. Where can a pescatarian, a person who doesn't eat seafood, a person with almond allergy and gluten allergies and an omnivore all have a great meal. Verbena!To say they went above and beyond both in terms of food and service is an understatement. Not only did our server go through the entire menu to point out what was safe for my friend to eat, the chef ended up making two other dishes we ordered gluten free. We ordered all the large plates, the quail are two lovely quail that give State Bird Provisions a run for the money. The Brassica was actually very satisfying even for the most dedicated carnivore. The sprout seed bread was so good we ordered two. The sardines just as delicious as before as was the swordfish which is really a seafood stew. We ate and ate and had a long leisurely dinner and the atmosphere is perfect for that. I had dinner over this rainy, stormy weekend at Verbena and the weather served to accentuate how dark the room is.   With semi bright lights hanging from the ceiling, it felt as though I was in a subway tunnel.  The high brick wall behind the bar seemed barren to me and in need of some bright splashes of color.  I should mention that I received a gracious welcome on entry to Verbena and service was helpful and caring. A first course of carrots came with verbena, and pepper.  This was the high point of my meal.  The pepper was a nice accent to the carrots and the whole came together nicely. Next, grilled artichoke with pickled green tomatoes.  The artichoke was nice but the acidity of the pickled tomatoes was an off note, at least to me. Finally, meatballs with black mole, hominy, some sort of cabbage, and cheese atop all. There was too much going on for me to really appreciate this plate.  The acidity of the mole and the cheese didn't sit well with the meatballs. The hominy and cabbage on the other hand were mellowing. While all of the food wasn't entirely to my taste, I left feeling that someone in the kitchen has an ego, a point of view, and didn't pull any punches.  That is very much better than the homogenized food you can find just about anywhere. Over priced under delivered. I was very excited about Verbena. . . location perfect and the ambiance is great.  Good things:excellent job with the decor moved the bar to the side that has opened up the restaurant. Bad:The food.  Portions were small.  Took forever and I believe quail was not cooked all the way.  for the food bills was way too high.  They were trying to go for refined light taste but missed the mark.  No flavor whatsoever. I may go again for drinks due to location. Wine list was limited but wine we ordered was decent. I stopped by here for a quick bite to eat on the way home and was incredibly impressed. The service was second to none and the food some of the best I've had in San Francisco. It can get busy so call to reserve a table. short review. the food was terrific. we had artichokes, sardines, meatballs and the short ribs. it was just about the right amount of food. did a byob and also had a couple of cocktails. service was meh although a couple of the food runners were charming. beautiful interior, particularly the lighting. noise was normal for the city i. e. loud. now the real reason of the review:WHY ARE YOU SERVING COLD BREAD? COLD LIKE IT CAME OUT OF THE REFRIGERATOR. PLEASE STOP DOING THIS. OK?there, now I feel better. GNO on a Monday after superbowl is always worth it, except if its at Verbena.  First thing: I am not sure if the seats are ostrich or faux, but either way it was incredibly uncomfortable and I ended up sitting on my jacket for some extra padding. The bottle of wine our server suggested sounded better than it was, perhaps it was her NZ accent?  The four of us ordered  appetizers and two entrees to share (seed bread, artichokes, mushrooms, seafood sausage and the brassicas).  I must say, the seafood sausage looked quite offensive and wasn't at all what was described by our server.  Any sausage that wiggles as you cut into it just ain't right.  The brassicas were delicious but very small.  I suggest if you have plans to go to Verbena grab a real dinner somewhere else first because you will leave here hungry. I was very excited about Verbena when I heard that they opened during the holidays, but my experience there was just ""meh. . . ""The high ceilings and the decor are pretty awesome and the vibe is cool and everything, but we were put in a table in between two other tables and they were so close together that it was difficult not to feel ""invaded"" by the people sitting next to us and, of course, difficult not to hear the conversations in the next table. As for the food, the menu was a bit complicated. We had to either Google some of the ingredients to really understand what the meals consisted of or ask and end up getting really over the top explanations from the waiter and the chef. But the worse part was actually the portions, they were SO SO small. . . I mean, more like tiny bites instead of dinner. As for the service, the waiter was VERY polite, but a little bit too much. He kept interrupting us every  minutes with some question, and he ended up messing up my order. . . It took a long time to be served and when we finally did, I had to wait for the correct order to come because he misunderstood what I wanted. I would definitely give Verbena another chance, I like the concept of the restaurant but there is a few things that they need to improve. . . at least the size of the meals. We had a wonderful dining experience at this new innovative restaurant! The executive chef is simply a food artist!  We ordered  different dishes from the menu and tried all  of their desserts!  All of them were beautiful as modern arts and "" Wow us""  as party in our mouth!  Our server Justin was very attentive to our needs.  Since we ordered many dishes, he delivered  dishes at a time so we could really taste the food and not overwhelm with all different flavors.   I think for a restaurant only  weeks old, the service and food quality were way beyond our expectations! :)  The only suggestion is perhaps make a slide TWIST  on the bread with Verbena Butter appetizer.  That was perhaps the only dish on the menu that is nothing new to us. It is simply good bread with butter and sea salt. It really should be complementary not as a charging appetizer on the menu.  If the chef would add a modern twist to the most ordinary bread then we would be satisfied to pay for it. The portion size are small so it is wise idea to go with friends and share everything from the menu.  This is going to be a very HOT spot in the city soon so get there to try it now before it gets too popular! :) Have now been twice. Creative, novel approaches to root vegetables. Seafood sausage and braised short ribs of beef very tasty. Don't misorder  for me, the mole meatballs were a little unimpressive. Alissa A. talks about a ""decomposed cheescake"", which might give you the wrong idea  I think that she means ""deconstructed. ""  Kaffir lime cream cheese cubes, pomegranate seeds, black sesame meringue, and turmeric marshmallow  I admit, this combination was too crazy for me. A person in my party wittily quipped that this might be the subject of a New Yorker cartoon. That night, I had the molasses ginger cake with IPA caramel and carrot sorbet  very good. The second time for dessert, I had the chocolate and parsnip icream, custard, and cranbeery gelee. Works! It was great. In two visits, I've had good luck with the service both times. A welcome addition to the neighborhood after all the useless incarnations of bar/restaurant called Rex. Came here on New Years Eve with a friend who had been here before. Amazing food, great service and wonderful ambiance. It is definitely a foodie experience and expect to spend a bit more but overall would definitely recommend it and try the place again! I've gone twice and really appreciate what the Chef (sean baker) brings  very fresh ingredients prepared with interesting and original flavors that pop. This definitely shows in the food but also in the drinks. Good cocktail bar. I'll definitely try his restaurant in Berkeley, Gather, now that I know about it.  Verbena's menu is very eclectic and is really for the person who wants to explore new flavors and textures more then the person looking to chow down. Portions are small but very memorable and I prefer that to quantity. Overall the menu reminds me of 's (down the street)  in that it is pretty eclectic and there isn't a clear delineation between courses. You just sort of order what you want from a list of  or  items.  The difference is that Verbena really executes well (something that seems to be currently missing from ). To give you an idea of how eclectic Verbena is, you can order the Trotter Terrine which is clearly German in a strong dejaun like mustard but with a  a compliment of mexican (I think there was a little marinated Jalapeño on it that helped the flavors jump).  You can also order the duck meatballs with mole sauce which is very Spanish,  and then there is the seafood sausage  which is sort of like uniquely California Chinese.  Or you can just order simple vegetables that aren't so simple. They do some sort of molecular technique with it that make simple broccoli stand out. And then there is the quail that is very Napa but wonderfully prepared. Service is exceptional and the two times I went the restaurant was fairly open so getting a table was easy and service was quick. Not sure how long it will remain easy to get a table. Interior design is very organic modern with excellent woodwork. Did a nice job. I wish food and service could be rated separately. Food is definitely  stars and service is between  and . We were the only table on a Sunday at : for about an hour before more people showed up. Even though the server was friendly and seemed to be knowledgeable, service was so slow and we were hungry . We started with the seeded bread which was nicely toasted and served with goat cheese. Delicious !I don't usually eat a whole slice of bread but this one was so good. We also had a bottle of wine which my friend picked,a Syrah with only . % Alcohol. It was good but very light. Unfortunately the server kept pouring too often and the food was not coming. We almost finished a / a bottle by the time the rest of the appetizers came. . They were : Turnips with sunchokes and red hummus,Artichokes and the beets. All were fantastic both in looks and tasteWe shared the beef short ribs. Absolutely yummy they came with rappini. And I am not a beef eater but this was superb. Then chocolate custard to finish the meal. Equally delicious!Was debating between  and  stars but in the end the food won. Have to return for sure. Btw, the decor is lovely too,great job. This is the first time I'm writing a negative review, as I know it's hard to please everyone in the restaurant business.  But it's the first time I've ever heard a bartender say this after  years of dining in SF.  On a busy Friday night, I was there with a friend catching up and we were there for at least  hours.  Food was very good, as were the drinks.  But this is what got me. When I asked for the check, Anthony at the bar says to us, ""thought you'd never ask"".  Really?! I mean, I realize you want to turn tables and make money, but really??  Maybe he regretted telling us his name, and I asked him for extra ice for my drink (even though I asked the same for my first drink), and also asked him for an extra plate.  Who knows. But you're in the service industry, if you're irritated or busy, suck it up.  I think he realized his mistake, as he bought us the last two drinks.  Little too late.  I live in the neighborhood and do my best to spend money locally.  Don't worry Anthony, you won't be bothered again. Though it was packed and they probably won't miss my business.  Oh well, there's plenty of other places happy to provide great food AND great service.  BTW we still left a generous tip. After the demise of Rex Cafe and Marbella, and with the bustling growth on Polk Street, it was important to get this right. I think Verbena has. Just a month into business, we were pleased to encounter excellent service, good food, a vibrant, yet intimate atmosphere and a delightful $ corkage fee. The beets and meatballs were superb. The rest  carrots, sardines and seafood sausage  were very good. The only two shortcomings were dessert, which was forgettable (we tried all three), and the wine list, a different approach (several offerings from several producers) but still decent. Overall, we were pleased and will likely return. I decided to try Verbena with some girlfriends for girls' dinner last night and let's just say this place left a LOT to be desired. We started the night with a glass of wine waiting for our friends at the bar. This is about as good as the experience gets. The bartender was great. Very friendly and entertaining and the drink menu was great. The beer and wine menu was very good and they really do have a great selection. We ordered some bread to munch on while we were waiting. The bread was good and comes with their house butter and sea salt. Nice touch. The décor is very nice. Very earthy and rustic. Lots of industrial lighting, and high ceilings which is nice. They did a nice job decorating the place. We sat down to dinner and the menu was pretty interesting. We had our phones out googling what some of this stuff was (and I'd like to think we have a pretty sophisticated palate) but we couldn't figure out some of this stuff for the life of us. We ordered our meals and when they came, it was smaller than an appetizer portion. My seafood sausage and mussels came out and it was literally a "" sausage,  tiny mussels in a little sauce, with some arugula and a slice of radish. After dinner we went across the street to La Folie lounge and ordered another round of food because we were so hungry still! I appreciate Verbena's ""different"" concept, just not my thing. Service was fine and our waiter was nice and helpful. I would not come back here. Creative food combinations, great drinks/service/decorHowever, the most important is how the food tastes. It was just mediocre. Carrots,Cardoons and parsnipsSprouted seedsArtisan breadbeef short rib in brothsword fishSprouted seeds was salty. Carrots combination was interesting, but the sauce overpowered the root vegetables. The beef short rib wasn't as tender as I would expect if it came as a soup. My friend said the sword fish was pretty good. All in all. I wouldn't dine here again. The bar was pretty good, so I would probably come back for drinks. My husband and I had an excellent dinner at Verbena last night!  What an awesome addition to the neighborhood!We love Gather and their catering company catered our wedding, so we were excited to try it out.  Although it is indeed different than Gather, the food, service, drinks, and space were all fantastic.  They are still working out a few minor kinks but overall it was a great meal.  We loved the mushrooms, beets, cardoons, carrots, etc.  My husband loved the ribs and the cheesecake we shared for dessert was really tasty. Also, the bartender was great  super knowledgeable and made us special drinks with one of their homemade syrups. We loved our dinner and look forward to going back soon! Perfect spot for late Tues dinner  cozy but not too close or noisy; lighting a tiny bit bright for late evening but music/atmosphere were pleasant.  Most important: food and wine were excellent and server was efficient and likable.  My friend and I are both discriminating veg's and enjoyed the beets, artichoke and a lovely Bourgogne blanc; parsnip ice cream and tea for dessert.  So nice to have this addition to the hood  I will definitely return! . . Tuesday night GNO.  Why not?The bartenders and servers are extremely knowledgeable about their respective menus, which I appreciate.  I ended up arriving  minutes early (still can't figure out the MUNI system after growing up in SF) and had an off the menu beer on tap.  Yes, it is caramelly and finishes with an orange peel taste.  Listen to the bartender  you can't go wrong!We split three appetizers  mushrooms, artichoke, and carrots.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but the carrots were absolutely fantastic.  And it contains verbena (and yes, I had to look it up  en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Ve…). I thoroughly enjoyed my quail, which was two pieces over Sonoma grains, topped with mushrooms and finished off with pumpkin juice.  Highly recommend, to wolf down by yourself or share among your dinner companions. yelp. com/biz_photos/verb…A bottle of cab franc from Santa Barbara to complement the meal, and it was a recipe for a great evening. Total damage for four: $ We had an amazing meal there.  Everything was incredibly delicious  I have never seen vegetables prepared in such a unique and exotic way.  But beyond the delicious food, the service was OUTSTANDING.  The staff was INCREDIBLY knowledgeable about Gluten allergies and helped me navigate my way through the menu and even taught me a few things along the way! The restaurant has great ambience, food, and service.  I give it three stars due to the portion sizes. I had the sardines and the meatballs.  The sardines had a great flavor profile.  I loved them. The meatballs were very tasty too.  My main critique is for  bucks before tax and tip I should not leave the restaurant starving.  That doesn't include the two glasses of wine which were very good recommendations by the bartender.   Home eating peanut butter on crackers. Creative, sophisticated, welcoming, earthy, beautiful ambiance.  Out of this world flavor combinations stunningly presented.  Superb service. Was delighted by every one of Chef Sean Baker's sustainable, close your eyes in gratitude offerings.  Verbena really exceeded expectations in every category. . . can't wait to go back. Total class especially in an area where a dusty potted palm, a big screen TV, and a neon Budweiser sign often pass for ambiance. Step inside and enter a sexy, clubby world. The  foot ceilings are the first thing you see, then the huge panels of pressed earth paintings (okay, they're actually dried mud) and the rows of pickles and relishes in Bell jars backlit in tidy niches from floor to ceiling. No missing what this place is about earth, gardens, fresh. In a city obsessed with farm to table, Chef Sean Baker stands out, with nonstop creative with combos and arresting flavors. A few oddities (not sure about the parsnip ice cream. . . ) but the winners are true knockouts. Our faves: silky mole and rich duck meatballs, super tender quail, wacky shaped winter carrots, and a broccoli and cauliflower combo that I could eat nonstop for days. Sauces and swipes of dips across the custom plates are truly incredible, especially that tangy sweet perfect apricot mustard. Can't wait to see what this chef does when produce really swings into gear in spring in summer. Service was amazing our waitperson Becky was also a sommelier, and poured perfect pairings on request. We just let her pick from French sparkling to Tempranillo and a Sicilian white. So many staffers I wouldn't have been surprised if I looked down to see someone was buffing my shoes under the table. Thought there might be collision at some point with all the bodies flying around, but front of house order was controlled beautifully by Sabrina (her ballet training clearly helped keep this crowd of servers moving in style). Great evening. Highly recommended. A few hits and misses, but service pushed my rating to  stars.  I had dinner here last night with some friends and we ordered almost everything from the small menu.  The standout dishes were: the carrots, lamb meatballs, and quail.  Everything else were relatively subpar or average.   Our waiter was spectacular!  He made sure that every dish came out with the corresponding dishes that paired well with it.  He was able to ask the bartender to make me a drink that they didn't have.  Very attentive and easy going, and he just added to the overall jovial mood of the dinner.    I also loved the space high ceilings, exposed bricks, and wood accents makes it a very attractive dinning spot.   So. . . food was . , service and space was , so overall solid  stars. High ceilings. High hopes. Creativity? I give them that. Horchata with Rye. Duck Meatballs. Seafood Sausage. Deconstructed cheesecake with kaffir lime, marshmallow and pomegranate. It all sounds amazing. But nothing blew me away. (only) Two meatballs in mole  in a plate that was whisked away before we'd finished. A sausage that was delicious  but really, just a sliced up fancy sausage with a couple mussels on top. Dessert? Pretty to look at, but in the end, the flavors of the components didn't mesh. Beautiful, modern loft ambiance. Definitely leaning towards a 'date' spot. Sure, I'll be back, but I'll recalibrate my expectations. This place is good but there's potential for it to be better. It's new, so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and come back in  months or so. Overall, great service from the host and staff, tasteful & open decor, strong bar presence, and the food was promising. Great spot for a first date or dinner with friends. .  stars. The menu  creative dishes that encourage family style dining. Love when restaurants emphasize local, seasonal, sustainable ingredients in their dishes. Vegetarians and vegans that have gourmet palates will delight! There's a whole section of entrees dedicated to vegetarians even (we looked at them as ""extension"" of our appetizers menu). Presentation was good, and everything was carefully prepared, with clear use of interesting spices. We had the artichoke to start, then duck meatballs, and finished with brassicas and koji quail. For dessert, we had the kaffir lime cheesecake. The koji quail was outstanding  just the right amount of flavor, moistness, and ingredients. Definitely coming back for that. Drinks  Wine list was lengthy, yet the wines by the glass offerings was disappointing (how do you exclude a sauv blanc from the list?). The cocktail list was minimal, but the bartender can make a mean old fashioned. It was tasty, but small. Ambiance  they've really done a great job with the space. I've been here when it was previously Rex Cafe, then Marbella, and now Verbena. They've done the best job and really opened it up; it certainly has a warm, inviting feel with the soft earthy tones, and it has a sense of intimacy, yet retains the liveliness of a locals favorite neighborhood joint. Haven't explored the upstairs area yet, but looks much better than before. Great music selection as well. Service  very attentive, from when the initial reservation was made over the phone (Joe the host  very accommodating; we arrived  mins early and he showed us to our seats since there was an availability) throughout the course of the meal. We could tell it was a new restaurant and/or new server. When asked for menu recommendations, rather than asking for diners' preferences, or recommending   items in each category, he ran through the entire menu, without much detail than what was already laid out on the menu. (Thank god for other Yelp reviews & pictures of this place  it really helped us decide). All that said, they were very nice, food came out within reasonable timing, plates were cleared for subsequent courses, and they checked in enough, without being overbearing. It's nearby, and different than most offerings in the neighborhood  will definitely come back! Sexiest new spot in SF without question. Outstanding service and creative atmosphere, the mud ""paintings"" made from the soil of different farm  suppliers took a mid century modern sensibility and blended it with  the restaurant's commitment to sustainability. Very cool. Helped seal the deal between rating a  vs  review. As for the food, it was a .  with lots of promise. While the veggie apps were tasty, the sardines were a revelation  one of the best dishes I've had in a long time  while the swordfish was worthy of  any pescatore's attention. Enjoyed my cocktail ( something with citrus and a name I don't remember) and a shared dessert with a light ice cream  made from root veggies. Very pretty too. However, What I do remember specifically is the coffee. The best damn cup I've had anywhere. Went within days of opening.  Must say that the food, service, wine, bar & overall aesthetics of Verbena were impeccable.  Its obvious that everyone loves what they do.  Plates looked and tasted vibrantly fresh and incredibly interesting flavors.  All food arrived at the table in a timely manner.  Bravo to the entire team for making a great restaurant and for finally putting a good place in that wonderful location. We had a nice little dinner last weekend at Verbena.  They've done a lovely job with the space, open and airy but still intimate. Drinks at the bar to start while we looked around and tried to guess if the female next to me was a daughter or date of the man next to her. Dinner was upstairs, seeded bread starter with chèvre and dehydrated beet sauerkraut. Really tasty and possibly the best thing I ate all night. Carrots, short rib and duck meatballs were all fine. I didn't like the mole on the meatballs and the broth the ribs were served in was bland for my taste. I actually don't think there was anything bad about these dishes they just weren't for me. I'd totally come back again and try some of the more interesting starters. What a makeover since Rex cafe. Love what they've done with the decor. Has a natural warm look and feel. For dinner I had the beet salad and duck meatballs, both excellent. My friend had the swordfish which came with a delicious garlic toast and that had some sort of creme sauce that was killer. For drinks, I had the fog cutter cocktail, which I would definitely get again. Another standout part of the meal was the service. We had planned to come early and get drinks before our reservation, but the hostess Jackie was able to get us a table earlier.  She was really friendly. Our server Tahra was great as well! She was very knowledgable about the menu and explaining each dish. She checked in on us just the right amount, and was very nice. If your looking for a spot that has delicious food, quality cocktails and great service, Verbana's an excellent choice. I took my mother to Verbena right before Christmas. We were both so impressed by the ambiance, service and food. It's a great spot for an intimate dinner with close friends. The food was magnifique. Everything tasted amazing. I would definitely recommend Verbena to anyone who wants a wonderful dining experience. Verbena is a nice new addition to the neighborhood. The mainly vegetarian choices were a little surprising at first, but all the dishes we had turned out to be great. We started with the mushrooms, beets, turnips and sunchokes. The mushrooms were the best followed by the beets. There might have been some confusion as our final two dishes arrived what seemed to be  mins later, but they were worth the wait. The sardines were perfect and the cioppino with swordfish mussels and octopus was awesome (loved dipping the bread into the verde sauce). I'll definitely be back to try a few more of the dishes. . . Very off putting champagne toast at midnight on New Years' Eve.  The Chef came out within earshot of several tables and asked the waitress where the ""good stuff"" was.  Offensive, unprofessional, and unacceptable. I am an adventurous eater. I am a light eater. When I am eating a meal and thinking ""There is too much going on here,"" there is a problem. When I am hungry at the end of the meal, there is an even bigger problem. Many other ""minor"" problems also contributed to a sub par experience. Only about half of the   ingredients in each dish are listed on the menu, so every order was sort of like Russian roulette (which we unfortunately only learned when the food was delivered, despite asking the waiter detailed questions about each dish). We appreciated the creativity, and some of the flavors were outstanding, but there was no restraint. Most of the dishes would have been greatly improved by being simplified, and all would be improved with a detailed menu description. Another issue was portion size and value. For example, the shared plate of carrots for $ was basically  baby carrots. For a vegetarian trying to make a meal, the result was a lot of money spent for very little food, as there wasn't much else on the menu than small plates of vegetables and meat dishes. Truthfully, this is probably a  star restaurant, but when I leave a $ meal feeling hungry and wanting to head for the nearest baguette to fill me up, there is a certain amount of downgrading that is going to occur. I so wish I had read the  star review from Jaime in LA before we came here, because that review was spot on to how we felt last night. We are huge fans of Gather in the east bay and were very excited to try this place. The first thing our server said was well things are different here and boy was he right but in the worst way possible. First  dishes that came out: The carrot dish so many have waxed on about was so overpowered with liquid smoke honest to god it smelled like a hot dog. Not good at all. The beet dish was mediocre, too beety as my kid said. The cardoons and parsnips was a very good dish I thought. Next up we had the sardines which I thought were super fresh and clean tasting, I loved the addition of the ikura. My group did not like the sardines at all. Next was the Brassicas which was a big bowl of broccoli  that should have been cut down a bit to make it easier to share, on a nice broccoli sauce and some cheese sauce. The huge let down for us was the Quail dish, barely seasoned and came with a persimmon and grain side that was undercooked and unpleasant. The duck meatballs were ok but not fabulous. Desert was also just not great, the cheesecake had an unpleasant texture and was not anything to write home about. Also one thing that super annoyed me was at midnight they were offering a complimentary champagne toast which was nice but the chef then came out of the kitchen and asked one of the staff ""where is the good stuff?"" she laughed and said he could get it over there behind the bar with the rest of the staff. Seriously? Yes it was complimentary, but a total douche move for the chef to say that within ear shot of customers. The bottom line for me was the food looked beautiful but did not live up to the great tasting food at Gather we were hoping for. We will not be back here. I was in town visiting some friends, and we wanted to have a special dinner out.  We'd all heard great things about Gather and my local pals were anxious to try this spot out.  While we ultimately had an enjoyable evening, I'm sorry to say it was no thanks to the food at Verbena. I'm going to lead with the positives: service was great, especially for being so new.  The server we had was knowledgeable about the menu, was extremely attentive and service of the food was well paced.  Also, the cocktail menu was a highlight.  We tried a few different drinks (Victory and Brightness, Fog Cutter) and enjoyed them all. The food itself was a huge disappointment for our group.  The starters we selected were nothing exciting, in addition to being a paltry, unsatisfying serving for a party of .  The mushrooms, which were heavily flavored with some kind of liquid smoke and not very appetizing.  The cardoons and parsnips were good, except they also had a sauce involving liquid smoke that was overpowering the rest of the dish.  There was also a yummy yogurt sauce on top (although there was only a tiny bit of it, we were scraping the plate for it). The turnips and sunchokes were the best of the starters we tried.  Although we were less than impressed with the meal at this point (and still plenty hungry), we figured that the main dishes would be filling and appetizing. This was where Verbena really fell flat for us.  The best main we had was the duck meatballs.  They were almost light and airy, and the mole sauce was very tasty.  They were definitely too salty, but still the best thing we had all night (we ended up ordering  servings because our group was so hungry and that was the one thing we liked).  The Cioppino Verde was not good.  It was also very salty, and had an overpowering, fishy taste.  We did not taste any of the miso or green pea flavors the description on the menu boasted.  The fish was well cooked and had a great sear on top, but unfortunately was drowning in broth that nobody at the table wanted to touch.  There was also sand in the shellfish which made the dish even more of a flop.  The worst dish we had by far was the beef rib.  There were only a few small, tough pieces of beef in dish.  When stewed in garum, the rapini, which I normally love, was too sulfuric and made for a horribly pungent and unappetizing broth. I was really sad to waste my one dinner out in San Francisco on this restaurant.  There are so many great restaurants, and this definitely isn't one of them.  I had a  day old leftover piece of Escape from NY pizza later that night (I was starving) that was better than my $ meal at Verbena.  As lackluster as Rex's and Marbella were, I would have preferred a meal at either dining establishment. We loved the incredible creative and delicious food. I'm very claustrophobic and the decor is very cozy indeed.  Jackie made sure that I was seated in a comfortable, roomy table of which there are many.   The mushroom dish was divine! as was my entree, squab. . The duck dish ,also amazing!    The gingerbread dessert was festive and yummy. . . The staff is attentive and knowledgeable. What a fabulous addition to our Russian Hill neighborhood. A group of friends and I gave Verbena a try on opening week, and I think our expectations may have been too high.  The highlights were the ambiance, bar drinks, service, and overall vibe this place has. It's cool in the way you could meet someone for a cocktail, but warm and inviting enough to spend a +hour dinner with close friends chatting and laughing. The cons were unfortunately all on the execution of the menu items. However, there is time for the chefs/staff to improve on the taste of the dishes. Low lights for me were ) Mushrooms  tasted like smoke, ) Cioppino  I know it's a seafood dish but the broth was so fishy, like  Fisherman's Wharf,  ) Beef Rib  we could barely taste the beef flavors as it was soaked in broth that was also incredibly smelly and fishy. This was probably the first time I've refused the waitress's offer for extra bread to soak up the broths. I'd come back to meet a friend for a cocktail as the drinks were great and reasonably priced compared to La Folie and Tonic, but with a better ambiance. If I hear good things about this place down the line, I wouldn't be opposed to coming back for dinner. .  STARSWas it big? Naw. *sigh*Was it satisfying? Yup. Was it toe curling good? Phuck yea!Ah, the three things women discuss when we gossip about. . . the newest restaurants of course! I know you sexual deviants were thinking of something else. Tsk tsk. Grand opening last Tuesday, Verbena (Gather's sister) serves intricately prepared NorCal cuisine with unique and innovative ingredient combos that is sure to tantalize those taste buds. The menu is more veggie centric but there were a handful of options for carniwhores out there. As with most new restaurants in SF, the portions are small and the prices are high. However, the food is very satisfying and is Michelin star quality so it's worth every penny. Expect to spend about $ pp (pre tip) for  dishes pp, a shared dessert and a glass of wine. ~ * ~ F O O D ~ * ~*Firebrand Artisan Bread w/ verbena butter ($)   STARSbit. ly/KaMwaConsidering how costly bread service can be for a restaurant (about $k a month), I don't mind paying a small fee for bread but I wish Verbena would warm up theirs. *Trotter Terrine ($)   STARSbit. ly/llugYRichly tender meat with a gelatinous bite from the trotter skin and tendons along with the sweet tangy heat of the apricot mustard?

Food service was timely but service got off to a rocky start.

I love all the rich woods, rustic brick wall and the high ceiling. Although I wasn't on a romantic date, my childhood bff and I agreed that Verbana would be the perfect date place.

Love all the details down to the verbena incense in the women's restroom. ~ * ~ P A R K I N G ~ * ~Forget about finding street parking because it sucks after  pm so we ubered it from happy hour. After dinner at Verbena, I can say it's one of the best new SF restaurants of the year next to my favs of Mason Pacific and . Pricey but worth it for the innovative menu that was well thought out and executed. The best thing about it was you leave fully satisfied but not disgustingly full because nothing is overwhelmingly heavy, salty, or fried. Why is that important? You can't sexercise on a fully stuffed tummy which is WHY Verbena is such a great date place! *wink wink* I am ecstatic about my findings at Verbena. The decor and aura of Verbena is very much like many of the new age rustic, yet chic and edgy San Francisco restaurants, however it has many subtle, earthy accents reminiscent of the farm to table philosophy.  Exposed brick, black metal, some type of hide esk bench along the long wall seating tables of two comfortably side by side. Anyway, it felt warm, cozy and visually stimulating. Our waiter was an incredibly charming man from Australia. Very knowable about the food and wine, he checked in regularly to make sure we were enjoying our experience Also handling the pressures of night three of the Verbena's presence exceptionally well. Now for the food:To start. . . Mushrooms with celeriac puree and lovage. Yum. As my mother said, ""A carnivore could be satisfied with this dish. "" These mushrooms take on the life of some of the best cuts of meat out there. Cooked perfectly and a perfect amuse bouche for the two of us. Chicories with pumpkin seed milk. This is a herbivore's dream dish. It combines all the elements of fall and a delicious peppery lick of radicchio next to the cooling persimmons. Mid. . . Beets with hazelnut and citrus. Next to the first two dishes, this dish did not have a loud enough voice. Pretty, earthy and beets cooked two ways. It was generally bland. Climax. . . Cioppino Verde with fennel, potato and new oil. This is one of the most delicious complex memorable dishes I have ever had. Every bite sang. Every element complimented one another. For the first time in my foodie mother's  years of having a deep distain for octopus she was transformed. It was fantastic. They must have sprinkled the orgasmic seasoning blend on the fish. End note. . . Molasses ginger cake with carrot sobet and IPA carmel. Perfect portion for two and perfect semi sweet ending to a delicious balanced meal. Only open for a few days. . . I look forward to seeing what Verbena has to offer in the next few weeks. . . months. . . years. . . I've been highly curious to try verbana as a big fan of gather. First of all, they did a great job with the decoration of the place and removed that bar from the middle of the resto, now it looks way more spacious, woody and trendy. We tried a good amount of different dishes from veggie and the protein sides, all were super nicely decorated, spiced and flavorful plus creative. Duck meatballs is one of the items that I will have it again. Seafood sausage was the least interesting. And for the dessert, kaffir lime cheesecake with marshmallows was amazing. I've been eagerly anticipating the opening of this restaurant along with everyone else who ever wondered how cafe rex survived off just the brunch crowd for so many years or why they thought marbella was a good idea in the shadow of zarzuela. I normally avoid a restaurant the first week it's open but they had a private party last week, a day long staff training session,  and the backers are all seasoned veterans so I took the plunge. . . It was great! Not quite yet perfect,  but very good. The service was excellent and attentive but a little scattered (halfway through my entree I wanted to order a vegetable dish but couldn't flag down my waitress until after my plate was cleared). But she was great at explaining the menu and offering suggestions and checking in right after a dish arrived. I think she just has to find her rhythm. The cocktail was delicious. The duck meatballs were was almost perfect but a tad too salty. The beets with hazlenut curd were divine in their uniqueness (who knew you could make cottage cheese with hazelnuts, serve them with a cousin to the radicchio and some really red beets and they would actually work?!). This place is well on it's way to being my new favorite place in Russian Hill! Beautiful set up and very inviting . warm ambience. A little pricey for small portion. I would definitely go back it's a fun place The tall tilings above the bench seating are squares of dirt from al the different farms where they source ingredients. All I need is a cobweb by it saying ""some pig"" 'cause that's the vibe here. The way high up #wecanpicklethat wall reminds me of Madrone. . . and th grade Biology class. Good thing I aced animal dissection. Because you know I had to get the Trotter Harrypotterrine app and Darkwingduckballs entree. But you know what? ASK about the menu items, even if you think you know what they are. Many have surprise unwritten ingredients, like my Meatballs which also contained chocolate(!) and squid ink(!) and the Beef Rib which additionally features tongue & heart = I'm so getting it next time."|1|87|3|Routine Inspection| Inadequately cleaned or sanitized food contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 4/17/2014 ] Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils  [ date violation corrected: 4/17/2014 ] Improper cooling methods  [ date violation corrected: 4/7/2014 ]
Pabu 0|4.0|Japanese in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|188|0|3.79259259259|" The food is four stars, but service and price knock one off.  Came here for lunch, ordered a few small plates and an entree per person.  They forgot my entree and didn't check in for fifteen minutes to see if I had received it.  To their credit, there was no charge. Sushi is solid, but extremely small portions at an extremely high price.  Best value is in the small plates which are more reasonably priced and excellently prepared. I'll be back, but only on the expense account. Just wanted to say I went back again and it was still AMAZING, the grilled octopus was BOMB, and the drinks are on par (if not better) than those at Rickhouse/Bourbon & Branch/Local Edition. I've been to PABU twice  once for normal food and again to try the tasting menu (never had a sushi tasting menu before!). I probably won't be going back again because while the food is delicious, the service is a little slow for sushi, and the sushi is expensive. Atmosphere is pretty cool  they have lots of comfy booths, high ceilings, sushi chefs for viewing, and a bar. Sushi is fresh and delicious. I recommend the happy spoon  it's a happy combination of yummy things like oyster and uni. Also recommend Michaels Negitoro  has fatty tuna, uni, and roe for extreme yumminess. For non sushi, I haven't tried very much, but PABU does really great things with burdock. Overall, I've had two fresh, delicious sushi experiences here, so I recommend trying it! The tasting menu is a fun way to sample all the different fishes they have! We ordered  signature drinks off the menu. We got one that looked like toilet water. It was brown and putrid and tasted like a cross between leather and medicated vaseline. The other drink was served in a ton of crushed ice. It looked like a glass of milk and had the alcohol content of a wine cooler. It tasted like weak rosewater. The third drink was yellow and was served with an ice cube with flowers frozen in it. It tasted like bandaids with antiseptic. What a horrible experience for $ a drink. ! First I have to confess that I have the tastes of a peasant when it comes to food. Generally I am happiest in the divest of dive bars. Hence my experince with sushi is limited. Here is my take given my limited experience:. The atmosphere is fun and lively with comfortable seating the good accoustics. A. Service started out a little spotty but pick up quickly.  A. These folks have an excellent selection of beers, wines and liquors. I had an excellent Japanese scotch. A+. Food: Here is my weak point. The sushi was fresh and delicious although I would have left starving if I only had sushi. Their hot chicken dish with spicy mayo was terrific as an addition. . Holy smokes is this stuff expensive. When I got the bill I decided to put it on my personal card. Accounting would have fainted if I submitted the cost of the meal. Good stuff but not that good and I am not very price sensitive. BOverall nice experience. Here's my take in Pabu  I give them .  stars  I want to be fair to them so I'll just say I've just had their lunch menu versus the dinner Omakeze. Came here for lunch on a Wed, res is recommended as it gets very crowded. My friend and I tasted about  dishes and I was highly impressed by one  the happy spoon oyster. The miso soup was definitely not instant, great big chucks of tofu and lots of fresh green onions (love that)! But it was a tiny bit fishy for some reason and I thought it could be what they use for broth base or the seaweed. Plastic piece came out of my miso soup, manager did come over apologize, it was fine. The spinach was some parts too sweet and some part too salty and over marinated I think it could be perfected but not the one we had. Happy spoon oysters, great blend of uni, oyster, ikura and some yogurt mix didn't mind the texture, tasted warm and fresh. The Kanpachi was great. Yuzu didn't overwhelm fish and the fish was amazingly fresh and well done, not to mention the beautiful presentation. The miso cod, nigiri plate, okonomiyaki, spicy ahi tuna they were okay, not too exciting. Visuals are beautiful but I wasn't impressed. *I was mostly disappointed with nigiri  especially for the Saba  too much ginger on top and any good Saba should not be this fishy. I think (until I try their dinner Omakaze). . This will be a good happy hour place for me in downtown with good warm/cold dishes but not for nigiri or sashimi. Not fully convinced yet! Cool decor, hipster type of place after work but I went for lunch.  I doubt I would go for drinks even though their cocktail menu did look inventive.  I'm glad I was treated because the prices are very high.   Our host ordered two of the rolls and after that a ""Happy Spoon"" for each of us.  The sushi was amazing but small for the price.  The Happy Spoon was not for me but I ate it. . . done and never again.  There were three of us and we ordered the tonkatsu, salmon and beef short ribs as our entrees.  They were lacking at best. The tonkatsu was dry, the short ribs looked like hawaiian bbq but a lot smaller, the salmon did look good.  The service was good but extremely slow.  I would only go back if I was being treated. Too pricey for what you get.  Oh, almost forgot, cute bartenders! After checking out Ramen Bar also by Michael Mina, and next door to Pabu, I was a little unsure about keeping my Pabu reservation for my mom's bday. But I gave Pabu the benefit of the doubt and we ended up going. I was pleasantly surprised at how well executed it turned out to be. We ordered the tasting menu which is ~$/pop. (They raised it a little from $ to $ recently. )I looked around and wanted to give Pabu a try because they offer  pieces of nigiri compared to many other tasting menus around SF which often offer ~ or so. Pabu's tasting menu is an eight course menu. It starts off with their trademark Happy Spoon which offers a great explosion of different flavors, albeit the uni portion is a bit small. Following that is a small salad appetizer with two pieces of kampachi. Starting from there is a series of four nigiri dishes each with four pieces. It goes through four different themes. My favorite was the shellfish theme. The baby shrimp sashimi was new to me and one of my favorite. To end the tasting menu you're treated to a mini shabu shabu which is nice after a series of cold dishes. It also comes with some carbs, handmade udon, for those of you who are not full from the nigiri dishes. The dessert was also quite a surprise: sparkling sake with ice cream and asian pear. The combination was new to me and very good. Nice place. Cool vibe. Great service. Neat decor. Expensive food. Overall some good dishes. Some meh dishes. But at this price I would hope there aren't so many meh dishes. At this price the fish should be so fresh it walks out to the table on water. Kanpyo maki  well made simple maki sushi. A Japanese wagyu beef nigiri  a little tough at first but the slightly seared meat melts in your mouth. $ for  buttery pieces of high quality cow. I'd do it again and again!Burdock  lacks flavor. And it's a huge bowl of root. I would skip it. American shabu  little bowl, not very hot (meat takes forever to cook) and broth gets full of meat junk since it sits there forever. Meat rolled in little rolls  kinda cool but inconsistent if it was one or two pieces. Noodles w it congeal into a big starchy ball. Kind of gross how the noodles ended up. Grilled squid  tasty and that Japanese spicy mayo wow!Assorted nigiri  spot prawn, uni, hamachi, scallop. All fresh but none were out of this world. Hamachi was cut pretty small. Happy spoon was ok. The creme fraiche made it creamy and sweet. Interesting concept. And yikes they charged $ for a bowl of plain white rice. Sit at the sushi bar so you can watch and talk with the sushi chefs. Reservations on opentable. Valet parking on California St. For $ Came here with high expectations, and am sad to say i was a little disappointed. Not that the food wasn't good, but there just wasnt a dish that completely wow ed me. Appetizers:Happy Spoon oysters  This was a good, but the oysters were unfortunately not fresh enough. Would have been much better if the oysters were fresh to bring out the sweetness. Homemade Tofu  This was Okay. The tofu was a little tasteless and they tried to make the sauce more salty so it blended well. Unfortunately, not the best homemade tofu I've tried. Definitely check out kappo nami nami in Mountain View for the best home made tofu I've had so far. They were out of ankimo, which is very disappointing since it is one of my favorites. The okonomiyaki was delightful, it was served with a sunny side egg on top. One of the better okonomiyakis for sure. Definitely order this. We had the skewers tasting platter. Unfortunately, the food was barely warm when it was served, which is rather disappointing. We initially ordered  plate, which was good, so we ordered another one and the second one was cold. The platter is served with a raw egg and some chilli powder which is a great sauce for the skewers. I liked the beef tongue best out of all those we tried. The chicken meatball was cold inside while the steak was overly done and it was tough. We had two orders of the american wagyu beef shabu shabu and it was completely disappointing. The beef was cut in different sizes and rolled up together, sometimes  slice in a roll, sometimes  slices in a roll. Japanese food is supposed to be about the art of precision and execution. This was a complete lack of attention to detail. They gave a small pot and the fire was not strong enough to boil the soup, so the soup jsut stayed warm the whole time, which meant that the beef took forever to cook. I'd say give this a miss. Most disappointing dish of the night!Miso black cod  This was extremely well cooked, definitely worth ordering and giving it a try. It was soft, juicy and tender inside. I didn't quite like the spinach bottom but my friends liked it. Spot prawn sushi  This was yummy. But really, definitely not the freshest of spot prawns. The waiter forgot/ messed up our orders a couple of times. Forgot about my wine order, forgot about the tea refill. Messed up our order by serving only  pot of shabu even though we ordered  portions. I also found it weird that they served the sushi last (after the shabu) instead of before. Wait between the appetizers and the rest (black cod, shabu, skewer platter) was about min. We ate from  to , which was ridiculous since it really wasnt a tasting menu/ fine dining where you expect to be eating for more than  hours. Probably wouldnt return again. Came here once for an impromptu dinner, and was pleasantly surprised by the food here.  The pork belly was awesome, and I also had a  piece nigiri (chef's choice) as well as the Ken's and negitoro rolls.  Absolutely no complaints here, and I would gladly return to try the omakase another time. Not a hater, not a lover. And for the price, I should be either one or the other. We were given a table at : after making our reservation that afternoon. . . which was rare for a restaurant with a reputation, but once the meal started, Pabu's front door continued to let in a draft which made our entire meal cold and unpleasant (and if you know how much ambient temperature changes your food experience you're with me on this one). Calamari appetizer was unbelievable. Insane. Better than the entrees. Sashimi was tasty but overpriced and warm. . . not ""holy crap you have to try this"" good. Dropped $ on two of us including drinks and didn't think it was worth it. We came here with a group of five celebrating two birthdays and as a team lunch. Opentable reservations were easy to reserve a table the day before. As we arrived, we were quickly seated and the decor was beautiful! We ordered a couple of small and large plates to share. We started with the ahi tuna poke, dungeness crab cake and monterey squid okonomiyaki. The dungeness crab cake was the best and freshest crab cake I've ever had with spectacular presentation. The okonomiyaki was scrumptious and down right delicious. For the large plates, we ordered two sushi rolls (rainbow roll and Ken's roll). Ken's roll was simply divine with the spicy tuna on top that just melted inside your mouth. It is definitely a must order! The last large plate we ordered was the miso black cod. It was nothing special but it was tasty. Since there were two birthdays, the restaurant hand written a card for the birthday ladies which I thought was nice. They also surprised them with two chocolate whoopie pies with a scoop of ice cream. I'd come back for omakase and cocktails next time. I'm guessing I'm an outlier on such a named restaurant. The location is ideal and the service was everything you would expect of such a high end place. I wasn't blown away by the food, given the prices. Trendy. Interesting menu, wide variety, some unusual Japanese food items. Service was ok. Noise level very high as combination restaurant, sushi bar, and regular full bar. Full bar area was party area including music and loud conversations, so difficult to hear people at your own table in restaurant area. Food overpriced. Valet park or walk there. Great food, wonderful service, class act. Had the tasting menu, mostly sushi. After two rounds I remembered that sometimes I have an allergic reaction to raw fish. Did not want to take a chance on two more rounds, so i ordered the chicken meatballs (excellent) and mushroom tempura also perfectly done. We were not charged for those two extra courses. It's a hopping place with lots of energy and great food and service to match. Highly recommended. A vast and open dining area looked a little quiet since most tables were empty when we went in for lunch.  Perfect place for a business lunch, perhaps, judging from the professional service and pleasant ambiance.  It's a restaurant in FiDi after all, so I wasn't expecting it to burst with personalities. It's like hiring someone to decorate your house.  It looks impeccable, but at the same time, it's hard to find any distinct personality to it. Food: chirashi bowl is simple and to the point.  Rice was superb.  But the fish was only okay.  It reminds me of a date lunch I had with my husband at Saru not too long ago, where we sat in a fairly cramped little place, enjoying a really nice chirashi bowl.  The fish there was better. Pabu, is perhaps better suited for a Happy Hour drink with friends or coworkers. I, maybe should have tried some cooked dishes. I am not sure how they received  stars.  I was very disappointed with the food and service!  All our meals came staggered so we had to wait for the other dishes before we could all eat.  The food is overpriced and quality was okay.  I have had way better sushi and did not have to pay $ for a roll.  I feel that Michael Minna is forgetting about why people come back; good food and service. I really hope Michael Minna still reads his reviews.  I am beginning to believe his sole purpose in life is to just open up restaurants and not care about the experience we have.  I am not sure he is striving for repeat customers. Food was delicious. The sushi was fresh and melted in our mouths. The service from Emily was excellent. Very lively and has a great vibe at every corner. We went there specifically to try the sushi and threw in few small plates from the main menu out of curiosity. While I think the sushi was boarderline good, the main menu was truly amazing. Not purly Japanese but a true fusion. We tried the Karagge chicken (small bites but full of flavour served with Japanese mayo) the squid was grilled to prefection and beyond (still dreaming about it!). Size wise their small plates are easily shared between two people. Spinach salad was quite sweet for my liking and the dessert was a coffee creamy custard goodness. . . I liked it for about  spoonfulls then I was done, too rich for an already heavy dinner. The service was also faultless. They had a cocktail area for what seemed to be a private event. . . very New York. Pabu has a lively and casual atmosphere. Both the large space and the menu offer plenty of variety for a range of moods and occasions. Take your pick of beer, wine, sake, cocktails, liquor, izakaya dishes, nigiri, sashimi, rolls, yakitori, shabu shabu, large plates (similar to those served at Michael Mina), and dessert. Stand near the bar or sit at a lounge couch, dining room table, semi private booth, private room, or sushi counter spot. All of the small plates that my friends and I shared were very good. Listed from most to least favorite:* Grilled squid with kewpie, togarashi, lemon  $: Perfectly cooked squid, paired nicely with spicy mayo* Kinpira burdock with umami soy, togarashi chili  $: Nice spicy kick * House made tofu  $?: Surprisingly creamy * Monterey squid okonomiyaki with pork belly, sunny side up egg, bonito  $* Pork gyoza  $The rolls were just average. The nigiri was good, with fresh fish and nicely cooked rice that was a bit sweet, a bit vinegary, and not mushy at all. However, I'd rather go to Maruya or Ichi for better sushi at comparable prices. There were a few hiccups in the meal. A couple of drinks and dishes were slow to come out. The server apologized nicely and comped one of the drinks that was somehow forgotten. The bathroom was surprisingly dirty for a restaurant of Pabu's caliber. Very nice atmosphere & attentive service, but the cuisine does not live up to the expectations: had the tasting menu  much of the sushi / sashimi was fresh but lacked flavor/character, with a few pieces being downright disturbing in their loose texture (the crab in particular); the rice with the sushi was not complimentary  poor flavor & consistency.  The desert was refreshing, but more so for cleaning the palate from a disappointing meal. . . Definitely not the quality one expects for the price  hunger was the best seasoning with this meal. Delish! Modern, sleep, upscale and a great addition to the restaurant scene in SF. I loved the tapas and the sushi. The service was great. Attentive staff and super helpful when we asked for suggestions. Highly recommend. Yummy food and excellent service. We went for the happy hour today and sat at the bar. The drinks were awesome and the apps (fried chicken, mushroom tempura, oysters, and hand rolls) were all amazing. The shabu wagyu was okay not my fav but the server on her own got a  so we averaged to a solid  (I would even give it a .  if I could). Def a go back location! We came here on a Sunday night for my mom's birthday.  It was funny because when we told the waitress who took our dessert order it was our mom's birthday, I think she didn't know who it was and put the birthday dessert in the middle of the table.  We were promptly seated for our reservation.  There were two booths next to each other and ours was not set and closer to the kitchen so we asked if we could take the one closer to the door that was set for five.  The hostess refused.  Not sure how difficult it is to remove a place setting and reset the empty table for five but oh well. Servers are dressed down in crisp white shirts and jeans. Our server was friendly and very thorough. One of us opted for the tasting menu. We also shared a chawan mushi and grilled squid to start.  both really good. chawan mushi came with ikura which was a highlight for me.  the squid was grilled perfectly and not too dry. For mains we shared the lobster and wagyu, seafood shabu shabu, and also a robatayaki sampler.  Some pieces of the wagyu were blue while we asked for medium rare.  The shabu shabu was a cool concept but the sterno never made the soup boil.  The seafood cooked, I think. The sampler came with tsukune with raw egg (so good and juicy!), negima, kokoro, bonjiri, harami, gyutan, eringi, and butabara.  I didn't know bonjiri was chicken butt only way after I ate it. We also shared a Miso black cod which was good.  the turnip greens underneath were bitter.  It is not as buttery as other miso gindaras I have had.  definitely very flaky. For desserts, we shared a birthday dessert, soy caramel custard, green tea, pabu chocolate and sorbet. All were delicious.  The green tea was way too sweet for me.  The green tea white chocolate was too sweet then the accompanying huckleberry jam was too sweet. I much preferred the custard with coffee jelly and sesame candy.  So delicious. I love coffee jelly. The sorbet had a sake sauce and pears.  super refreshing. I didn't get a chance to taste any of the sushi but it looked good.  I am sure their quality justifies the price but all in all felt the meal was a bit expensive. Pabu's outdoor seating is my new favorite Sunday hangout. For our early dinner, we ordered my usual sure win dishes and also discovered some new ones! Futo maki* don't let this all veggies maki put you off. It is packed with flavor and goes well with skewers! House made tofu: MUST get this if you like tofu!! It's so well executed and you can really taste the soy bean.  Yakitori: chicken wings & chicken meatballs are both a must! Tried their skirt steak yakitori this time and I liked very much. It was lean yet flavorful.  Pork gyozas: I appreciate gyozas with a very thin skin. These precious pieces go so well with a bottle of Dassai  sake.  Tempura main course (great for sharing as an appetizer for two): This was divided into two courses, a seasonal veggies course and a protein course. I recommended getting a bowl of PABU Gohan rice that has hijiki, carrots and peas inside to go with the lightly battered tempura. I liked how the tempura came with its own dipping sauce and green tea salt in case you wanted more seasoning. Very satisfying if you're having tempura cravings. These dishes, along with the Michael Mina roll, always super fresh sashimi platters and PABU desserts will keep me coming back again and again. Thank you PABU team and Nicole for always looking after us! :) This is solidly a .  star restaurant. I had lunch here with a few of my colleagues. Though I wasn't feeling sushi for lunch, they had some other amazing entrées. I had the Crispy Cod which was very good. It was soft and buttery, excellently done, and quite flavorful.  All the dishes were beautiful made and everyone had nothing but positive things to say their food. The desserts are pretty legit too. The service was very good as well. Would love to check this place out on a Friday evening, pretty sure it's great. Highly recommend this spot if you desire an upscale Japanese experience. Atmosphere was elegant, staff was top notch, and presentation was chic. The staff were very attentive which suits the whole ambiance of a restaurant in this neighborhood. The food, although we enjoyed the presentation, was nothing to write home about. Nothing really special here, but we did just order sushi. We didn't try any of the main dishes, so maybe we'll have to try one of those sometime. I'm not sure if I would come here again unless if it was to impress someone from out of town. First of all Japanese cuisine is my all time favorite, so when I heard that Michael Minna was opening a new restaurant that would serve dishes from Japan, I of course was super excited. I have gone here several times and have not yet been disappointed.  The location is ideal in the midst of FiDi. I absolutely love the modern loungy bar area especially great for HH because the spectacular floor to ceiling windows allows one to still enjoy the sunlight despite being indoors.  But they also have a patio area too; good to know if you want to bring a canine friend:)I have yet to experience the dining area or sushi bar, but I will.  Lately I prefer restaurants that have a bar area; the ambiance is always much more lively. I'm ususally at the bar in front of Carlo (fabulous mixologist) and with my girlfriends for HH. So ""summer"" is my favorite drink on their menu.  But I'm sure that's about to change, now that summer is over.  The only negative was that I wish they had a more extensive wine by the glass list. As far as food: I've had most of their skewers, gyoza, and tuna tartar which were all delicious.  But my latest favorite is hands down, the grilled squid.  OMG this was off the charts super yummy!  The service was equally amazing; not pretentious but very friendly, attentive and accommodating. Most memorable experience was when I double booked and had my young date meet me amongst all my girlfriends at the bar.  Not a new date, I would never do that to someone new. Well 'never' is a strong word.  We dated a long time ago, so I knew he could handle being around my friends.  My most recent experience was dodging the bullet, when my friend said my Ex BF was there.  Please, if this was any other shabby restaurant, I may have walked out with the sight of him, but Pabu is now one of my favorites in the city, so ignoring him was painless when the food, drinks and service far exceeds the pain of bumping into a recent Ex. . . Leaving and not getting to eat the grilled squid, now that would be more painful! Lunch:: Awesome sushi (highest quality, fresh, delicious and generous portions) and the liberty farms duck breast I had this week was superb truly amazing flavors!Happy Hour: HH wines are quality wines and a terrific bargain for $.  (and I know my wines) and bites are reasonably priced and excellent quality YUM!Music: INCREDIBLE sound system and great music playing every time I have been in. Only problem is that I want to dance lol.  Can you say JAMES BROWN  Get on Up! Thanks for opening up right below my office! I LOVE PABU.  One of my awesome gfs treated me here last night and it was wonderful.  It's ""Hot and New"" on Yelp and I can see why.  It's right next to the Ramen Shop and the interior has clean lines and high ceilings.  The wait staff is excellent and attentive.  All of the dishes were fantastic.  Someone different served each dish but they all were knowledgeable and really pleasant.  The timing of the dishes were impeccable.  Every detail was taken care of including hot hand towels to start and the wait staff always keeping the table clean, which I appreciate very much!We had the seaweed salad (more taste and moisture than most seaweed salad), burdock (like the Korean side dish but lighter), house made tofu (OMG to die for), grilled squid (perfectly cooked and cut  beautiful presentation), pork belly (delicious), Ken's roll (delicate and not overwhelming) and green tea mousse with huckleberry jam.  We were so full and satisfied.  They have quite an extensive sake menu as well. I want to come back and try the rest of the dishes.  Between two people that do not eat a lot,  small veggie appetizers, one roll and either one other entree or side dish will do.  And you can't forget dessert!  The green tea mousse was not too sweet and the huckleberry jam gave it some texture and a tart kick at the end.  I love this dessert  one of my favorite now in the city!  I want to come back and try the rest of the dishes.  And not to mention, there are plenty of beautiful people here to scope out. Pabu is a new and swanky Japanese restaurant located in the heart of San Francisco's Financial district. The decor is sleek and modern, complete with high glass ceilings and a spacious bar. This Michael Mina collaboration serves izakaya style Japanese small plate dining and serves a large selection of Japanese whiskies and sakes. Much to my surprise, Pabu has an amazing happy hour. Even better than their happy hour is their customer service. There were no seats available in the lounge upon our arrival however the service staff graciously made a table available for my group and I. I assure you, we were very happy!For happy hour, I recommend:+ Japanese Chuhai (A bourbon type of drink was being served on the day I visited)+ Happy Hour Spicy Salmon & Spicy Scallop hand rollsThank you Pabu for making my first happy hour experience absolutely amazing! First off, I am a huge Mina fan, I have dined in  of his restaurants. Michael Mina's name is being thrown around all over the place lately. I celebrated a nd going away dinner with friends here and since this restaurant was the talk of the town (being that it's  months old) it only seemed idea that we had a dinner here. High quality sushi but I can't say the price is worth it since high quality sashimi is high quality sashimi. At a $ per person average, I would say there needs to be more stuff going on the plate. I want to see more than just a piece of fish lined up with rice on a white dish. Their pot stickers were way to salty for my taste and their ""fresh fruit"" dessert sucked since it was just a  few pieces of fruit with sauce on top. Where is the creativity and thought? This place is an over priced Japanese restaurant located in dtown. The hosts were dressed very sexy but they were not friendly. The waitress who served us was very nice and professional (I gave her all  stars). Nothing special about the food. Sashimi was fresh but I can get it elsewhere with half of the price. The menu is a bit overwhelming, fortunately we went in knowing we were getting sushi.  We started with edamame, Tokyo Fried Chicken and Grilled Squid.  The highlight was the Squid.  The presentation was fantastic, and it tasted great too.  The other dishes were good but the squid was the highlight for me. We then moved on to a the skewers.  We had the chicken meatballs, Mushroom and pork belly, for me the chicken meatballs were great. The egg really added some great flavor, not sure if I would order the other  again. We then had a few maki rolls.  The Ken's roll was great, definitely recommend that.  Such great flavor.  The crispy spicy was just ok.  It was lightly fried, but for me the fried tempura was really all I got out of that roll.  The rainbow was really great as well as the spicy roll.  All the fish was incredibly fresh and delicious. I would definitely go back. Just finished my lunch at pabu. We shared a few plates ahi poke (pretty standard), crab cake (delicious) came with tasty heirloom tomatoes, squid okonomiyaki ( blew me out of this world if you order one thing, you Must order this dish) not only is it gorgeous but flavors play so well together. We also had black cod which was ok, I felt like it lacked flavor. service was outstanding, make sure to make reservations this place fills up I'm giving Pabu a solid four stars. Came in on a Monday night and the place had a pretty good crowd aka must be doing something right, right? Bar Area: Very chic and modern. They have high top tables and round sofa ones as well. You can order food at the bar area if you don't want to wait Bartender was sweet and knew her way around the drink menu American mammoth jack is my new favorite drink! Delishh! I even got it twice! Unfortunately,  man friend and I were seated in the very last booth in the restaurant area which somewhat concerned me (being ignored, hard to find wait staff, crappy service, etc. . . )Well, our lovely waitress Jaime (can't remember too well) was very pleasant to talk too and helped us out. We decided to go for the omakase tasting menu. Now, I'm not usually a huge fan of tasting menu's so this was a very big leap for me. Tasting menu:Happy spoon: What looks like a pile up of poop, egg balls, some extra cream with oysters, this actually tasted quite good. You can definitely taste the flavors of each component. The goods: Kanpachi plate and the tuna plate. Absolutely delicious! The toro was my favorite of the night. I'm a sucker for fatty tuna, and this place sealed the deal. The bad: The mackerel plate (Dari) and the shellfish plate (Ronji). I spit the fresh scallop out, and only ate the snow crab. The mackerel plate I gave to man friend. Way too exotic for me. Palate cleanser: Water infused sake with melon. Very refreshing and tasty. Shabu: They were nice enough to sub the waygu for me. I instead got the seafood shabu. The broth needed more seasoning as it did lack flavor. I've had some better shabu closer to home, so I expected to be blown away. Dessert: Tasty sake cake infused sorbet. I tend to skip desserts at Japanese restaurants but nonetheless, this was pretty good. We ordered the ahi poke as well, which I became a fan of. Wish it had a larger portion though,  but easily enough for two people. Man friend did the sake pairing with the tasting menu, and I was lucky enough to taste some as well. Now, I am not a huge sake fan. Usually i just drink it with beer, but that night, I realized their is more to sake than just a good buzz. Some were light, some were crisp and airy, and some were fruity. But Pabu definitely made me open a new door to sake and I have found a respect for it. All in all, Mina has outdone himself again. I will come back and try their a la carte menu, sake, and cocktails for sure. Would I try the tasting menu again? Probably not. But their is a first for everything. Will come back again! P. S.  Was lucky enough to meet Mina himself that night! Popped my cherry here!I mean my omakase cherry here!Celebrating my b'day, my friend invited me to take my maiden voyage here on a recent Friday evening.  After a quick glance at the regular menu and a quick study of their tasting menu, she immediately asked, ""Are you game?""  Those who know my competitiveness know that I don't like to step down to challenges so, yes, GAME ON!  Here's the tasting menu that we enjoyed:.  Happy Spoon (yelp. com/user_local_phot…)  Kusshi oyster, uni, ikura, tobiko, ponzu craime fraiche.  Rich first bite. .  Kanpachi and Kinpira burdock (yelp. com/user_local_phot…)  Good start with the smooth sashimi and crunchy burdock. .  Nigiri st plate  Sea bream, Butterfish, Alfonsino, and Grouper (yelp. com/user_local_phot…)  Starting with the lighter textured fish. .  Nigiri nd plate  Horse mackerel, Japanese mackerel, Striped jack, Flying fish (yelp. com/user_local_phot…)  Heavier flavors which non mackerel (fishy) fans still enjoyed. .  Nigiri rd plate  Bluefin tuna, Big eye tuna, Fatty Bluefin tuna, Wild bonito (yelp. com/user_local_phot…)  Hearty tuna progression with toro being favorite. . Nigiri th plate  Fresh scallop, Snow crab, Baby white shrimp, Sea urchin (yelp. com/user_local_phot…)  Interesting change of pace with scallop being fave and crab being least.  Had double uni portion from friend. . Wagyu shabu shabu (yelp. com/user_local_phot…)  Garnished with mushrooms, watermelon radish, and Goma Dare in a Kombu broth, this hot course was perfectly apportioned.  Broth was not overly salted. . Cherry Sorbet (yelp. com/user_local_phot…)  Enjoyed the summery sweetness of various stone fruits (plums and pluots) which are in season. Besides the above, there was a refresher spoon mid meal and two bonus sweet endings.  Loved those azuki bean cookies.  All I can say is that we both were grinning after our meals. . . she perhaps a bit more because she enjoyed the sake pairings.  Full props to our server Emily C. who explained the intricacies of the journey as we went along; she taught us newbies about eating our sushi from  left to right.  The only hiccup was some confusion on our shabu shabu. They made up by giving me a double order of the noodles and, well, you know me and noodles!Yes, will be back and it'll be awfully hard NOT to have this meal again!  Big thanks to my dinner host too! Take the tasting menu next to the barThe freshest fish you can getTraditional creativity and great service Eh, I think I got my hopes a little too high because I drank the Michael Mina koolaid. The place is very pretty, contemporary Japanese. But the food didn't live up to it's ambience. They didn't even offer white tuna. The cod and the veggies were bland and oily I had to ask for salt which took  minutes. The ahi poke was not ahi poke. It was just ahi. The Moscow mules were sour. The beef strips were too large and the whipped egg dipping sauce was interesting but a little desperate and unnecessary. There are better hole in the wall sushi places in SF. . . that even offer white tuna. Mina needs to stick with what he does best, which isn't Japanese food. Excellent dining experience.  The menu is full of delicious creative dishes with ingredients that compliment each other perfectly.  The service was attentive and the staff was very knowledgeable which really enhanced the entire experience for us.  We would have overlooked the happy spoons and they are not to be missed and the Sake Master was spot on. This place is good.  I love good sushi and bad sushi, but this restaurant shines as a place I'll go and eat even after having already eaten in the last hour (as I did last night after eating at barbacco). I went here for the first time on July , shortly after the restaurant opened.  Neither my boyfriend nor I were particularly hungry, so we initially decided to order nigiri off the menu.  After the first few pieces arrived, however, I realized that I would definitely be wanting the  appetizer +  pc nigiri + shabu shabu omakase the sushi chef had originally recommended.  A few highlights are hard to pick from the amazing omakase, but here goes:) The Happy Spoon: kusshi oyster, uni, ikura,tobiko, ponzu crème fraîche.  I like all of these things, and it turns out I like them all even better when they come on a cute soup spoon on a leaf in a bowl of ice.  Order it off the izakaya menu if you don't go all in for the omakase. ) The tuna course: bluefin tuna, bigeye tuna, fatty bluefin tuna, fattier bluefin tuna.  This was eye opening for me to be able to compare different types of tuna side by side.  I've always loved maguro and toro, but understanding subtle differences between the different fish and cuts was interesting and delicious. ) I am a sucker for shellfish, AND the bottle of sake (Yamahai Nama ) we'd ordered was intended to pair with this course, so this was a clear winner.  hotate, ama ebi, snow crab, and clam were expertly prepared and seasoned. The service also happened to be amazing.  Near the end of the omakase, we ordered some uni nigiri.  The chef opened a new box, gave us ""samples"" before the actual sushi, and then proceeded to put double the amount of uni any other restaurant puts into our nigiri.  We were in heaven. Suffice it to say, I'm a huge fan and will happily eat here any day, any time. Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the omakase. Had some nigiri I'd never tried before that blew me away (horse mackerel is amazing). Love the wine list as well get the gruner veltliner Michael Mina had developed specifically for his restaurant group pairs amazingly with the sushi! PABU on SF FIDI #FAIL We were excited to try this new restaurant in the SF FIDI.  We arrived at noon. There were about  parties in line.  When we arrived at the Host/Hostess station directly inside the door we explained that we did not want to sit on a high stool.  My friend is not as tall as me and stools simply do not work.  We were then told ""Oh, there is room at the Sushi Bar, but oh that has stools!"" Really? Yes, we said we don't want to sit on stools.  We scanned the entire restaurant and there was plenty of table and booth space, yet the two hostesses seemed overwhelmed with the influx of the crowd. We were NOT offered anything but sitting on a stool.  Really?  Both my colleague and I have worked in the FIDI for over two decades and we have NEVER been turned away from a restaurant. YES, I said ""turned away"".  We were simply told ""we cannot seat you"" and NOT given a wait time which is the norm at lunch hour in the FIDI.  Anyone who owns a restaurant in the FIDI hopefully should know that there is going to be a lunch time rush and make accommodations for such and offer a time wait or some type of courtesy for the future other than ""we cannot seat you"".  We were publicly embarrassed due to a lack of planning, ill equipped staff and savoir faire on the part of PABU and we left feeling that there was more at play.  I am a Gay man, my friend is a Latina.  I'm just sayin'.  #PABUFAILS High end JapaneseExpensive ( already expected )Services was wonderful Ordered miso black cod ( had to send it back and get a new one) okA nirgri  stars Shabu Shabu:   stars Ahi tuna:   starsOverall is pretty good !! The entire time I was at Pabu, I had the distinct feeling that I was at Hooters (except ample breasts are poured into black low cut tank tops instead of orange). My male colleague definitely took notice and was quite cheerful about it. Depending on what you're looking for  this could be a plus or a minus! But for a business lunch in downtown SF at a high end Japanese restaurant it feels out of place and awkward. The service was good, everyone was nice and the food was mixed (sashimi platter was ok and the spicy sushi roll was lacking, while the miso cod and okonomiyaki were yummy). Lunch for  was $ (tip included) without alcohol. It wasn't so special that I would necessarily go back. This is based on lunch. Very good food and service. Nice Ambience. The Okonomiyaki and Cod were my favorites. My companions enjoyed the sashimi especially the Uni. Would return We are huge fans of Michael Mina's after eating at his Seattle RN restaurant. I was excited to try this new restaurant because it was a break from the cuisine at his other restaurants. It did not disappoint. The decor was very trendy with a Japanese influence. We ordered from the main menu. It changes often so some of the dishes may not always be available. We decided to drink Sake for the night. The restaurant has a sake sommelier that can help you decide which one to order. That was super helpful because we are not very knowledgable in the sake world. The waiter was very helpful too. We saw a few dishes we wanted to try and the waiter helped us create a harmonious meal. We started with the Ahi Poke. Delicious! You can taste each individual ingredient. It was so well balanced and delicate! Our other small plate was the Sake steamed clams. Again, another well balanced dish. The flavors were great!We had to try the Shabu Shabu because it's not often that we see it on a menu. We ordered the seafood one with snow crab, scallops, and hamachi. My favorite protein of this lot was the hamachi. It just soaked up all of the flavor of the broth. Don't forget to use the dipping sauce! It has some great flavor!Another main dish we ordered was the Black Cod. It was nice and delicate. The beans added a great contrast of texture to the cod. We still had a little room left to try a sushi roll, but we wanted something really simple. We got the hamachi and scallion roll. It was just the right size to cap off the night. A wonderful experience from the ambience, to the staff, to the food. We'll be back and I've already recommended the place to friends. Bravo! Big, beautiful and boisterous!  Even when half empty this restaurant is so loud and by pm when in full swing it was almost unbearable.  That being said, there is an undercurrent of fun here.  We sat at the sushi bar and enjoyed their tasting menu.  For $ it is a great deal for all the fish you get.  We also loved the sake pairing for $.  We sat with the very affable Ron.  We enjoyed talking to him and his neighbor Chef Chris. Compared to other high end sushi restaurants, nothing was really stand out.  The fish was very fresh but the preps were not very innovative or complex.   Though no wasabi or soy was offered with the tasting menu, the fish dressings were not that flavorful and a few times I missed a quick wasabi soy dip.  However, the fish was so fresh, the fish would have been enjoyable totally on its own.  Watching the sushi chefs, it seemed that rolls were the big pull here.  So popular, they had what looked like a couple pounds of spicy tuna in a huge pastry bag to squeeze onto the rolls.  The Happy Spoon started the tasting menu and it was great.  The sparking Michael Mina curvee was served with it, and this made an elegant start!  The kusshi oyster was so fresh.  The uni was too scant though.  Ikura and tobiko were added.  I noticed a huge difference in the size of the uni piece and amounts of tobiko on each spoon.  My husband was too quick for me and got the big piece of uni, SHOOT!  A pretty presentation of kanpachi sashimi with a side of kinpira burdock was next. Then the sushi chefs took over from the kitchen with serving  pieces of nigiri.   All good fish, simply presented,  nothing real fancy here.  My only real complaint was a mushed mess of uni I was served.  I only like picture perfect tongues of uni and will not eat ugly messes.  Thank God for husbands who will switch with you even if it is only so they do not have to hear about it for the next hour.  LOL!  After a whole lot of nigiri, the last savory course was such fun.  Along came a fairly big production of a small shabu shabu pot of broth with a few vegetables and tofu.  A small bowl with  pieces of American waygu, that was highly marbled.  Also  small bowls of dipping sauce for the wagyu after you cook them, not needed.  Another bowl had noodles that must have had sesame in it for it had that great peanut butter flavor.  This was a fun way to end the meal and also if by chance you were still hungry, this filled you up.  BTW, we were not still hungry at all!  Dessert was also served, a delicious sorbet covered in fresh nectarine.  Would we return?  Perhaps though I think this restaurant is more aimed at the younger crowd.  The fish was very good and the price was right!  I think we were served more food than we have gotten with the omakase at Akiko or the tasting menu at Kusakabe though the fish preparation was not nearly as interesting. ,  And we spent about $ less which could in part be due to ordering the sake pairing instead of more expensive bottles we usually order and in some ways we preferred the sake pairing.  Pabu was so much better in every way than our visit to Maruya, another of the no soy/wasabi new wave of high end sushi restaurants!By the way, the sake pairings were really fun!  And so good.  We enjoyed all of them and they did not skimp.   Service was timely and friendly.  All in all, the entire dinner was really an excellent value. I am a little torn as I write this review. . . . I LOVE Michael Mina. I've loved him since I first tasted his lobster pot pie. . . his beef tartare. . . his root beer float. . . . just thinking about those dishes makes my heart melt a little. So when Pabu opened, I was sure I'd fall in love all over again. . . but I didn't. First let's start off with the positive. The restaurant is beautiful. High ceilings. Cherry blossoms painted on the walls. Cute little booths. It wasn't too busy when the man friend and I went (over Labor Day Weekend) but I can see how it can get very lively and loud when it's packed. The drinks are cute! I love the square shaped ice cubes. They are also innovative and tasty. The staff is friendly and attentive. They were quick to serve the food and clean up the plates when we were finished. We sat at the sushi bar and got the Omakase ($). We added the okonomiyaki, tamago and ikura to our Omakase. The okonomiyaki with an egg on top was a nice twist. The tamago was meh. Not sure if the man friend liked the ikura (I didn't try it). Maybe the man friend has just spoiled me with some mind blowing sushi (Shiro's in Seattle is a m a zing or semi locally there's Akane in Los Altos and Yume in Alameda) But there's just something amiss with the food here. . . Everything was good. . . . just not great. And for the reputation and price point, I expected great. I expected umami. I really don't understand why people keep knocking this place.  Came here with my husband on Saturday for our anniversary and we were very well looked after.  I had come in previously with coworkers and we really liked our server, Chris, so I requested him again.  We had the tasting menu with sake pairings.  Everything was just perfect.  People kept stopping by our table to wish us  a happy annviersary. OK, so the food.  Happy Spoon wins for best single bite!  The  course tasting menu was  (?) courses of nigiri and it all featured very fresh, firm, delicious fish.  Comes with their nectarine and sparkling sake dessert but we also had the coffe jelly  love!!  They were so great at explaining the sakes!  I am really a novice in that area so it great to try a bunch of different kinds, know what I was drinking, and not get sloppy drunk in the process. Service was impeccable, and the ambiance was so warm and inviting.  Next time we'll sit at the sushi bar (our favorite spot) to get the full effect. Out of all the ratings I've given on Yelp this is easily the one that gave me the most consternation because I'm really conflicted about this place.  Ultimately I've chosen four stars but really it's a  / in my book because while the space and drinks are two of my favorite things in SF, the food itself is often pretty underwhelming. Pabu is almost guaranteed to make a good first impression.  It's on the corner of some prime real estate in the Financial District so you can already see something lively happening inside before you even get that close.  Once you can see inside, the interior design is really quite striking with a beautiful modern bar occupying one half of the space and the other dedicated to seating and the sushi bar.  It has a very tastefully considered classic Japanese motif blended with typical understated aesthetics of Michael Mina's other places.  The end result is a interior that is simultaneously lively and calm  it makes me feel good just sitting around in here. The star of the show is the bar.  They have a wide selection of lots of libations here but really you should head straight for the cocktails and Japanese whiskey.  If you're a fan of Suntory they've definitely got you covered here, with my personal favorite of all whiskeys, the  year Yamazaki, available and ""reasonably"" priced.  The cocktails are all very well prepared and delicious, with special care given to presentation.  I've seen many cocktails some complete with a crafted piece of ice with some of the spice and herb components of the mix embedded in the piece, which is not only beautiful but melts over time to keep mixing the contents inside.  My favorite, the Yakuza . , is a mix of whiskey, spirits and, of all things, chamomile tea that comes served in a wine class with a very large ball of ice  the name might suggest something edgy but it's actually the most subtle, refined whiskey based cocktail I've ever enjoyed and highly recommended!  If you're not coming in for a full meal your impression of Pabu may shoot way up because the bar is quite special. Unfortunately, food is a really mixed bag here.  I've tried pretty much everything here, including going omakase, and you're definitely best off talking to folks who have been here before for recommendations than going in cold because some of the selections are underwhelming.  I can't say that I've had anything here that would indicative of a world class chef. Good: * Ken's roll: pretty standard shrimp tempura + tuna roll but with a little pine nut on top that is paramount in making the bite stand out  it is really striking what a difference that little thing makes to the texture and enjoyment of the roll!* Strawberry Scallop: clean, fresh, just a touch of sweetness and a % crowd pleaser.  If this is the first thing you order your dining party will probably be thinking ""this meal is going to be great!""* Toro: you will not be disappointed with the taste and melty ness of the Toro here  bite the bullet and spend extra for it. * Kinpira Burdock: It doesn't look like much but Burdock root, properly prepared, is always tasty and this is no exception.  Bad:* Gyoza  this is one the more fascinating failures in SF.  On the way in the delicate nature of the dumpling will have you thinking you're in for the most spectacular preparation of this classic bite ever and then. . . wow, that's bland.  I'm comfortable in saying that this is my least favorite Gyoza ever. * Happy Spoon  this is probably the most gauche thing I've ever consumed.  When it arrives all of the components (uni, ikura, tobiko, oyster and ponzu crème fraîche) are sitting on the spoon like some alien entrails.  When you consume it all in one spoon, none of the flavors combine in any way and it's as if each occupy a different region of your taste buds, and each of them was equally unpleasant for me.  On top of that, something in the mix made my mouth very dry for some reason, a sensation that continued on for some time.  Maybe you'll like it but for me the adjective ""Happy"" was the opposite of how I felt. That's just a small selection.  Also good is the Black Cod, chicken skewers and all of the deserts.  The sushi is mostly underwhelming. I know it doesn't sound like it but overall I'm a fan.  It's taken some navigating around the menu to come to selections that I feel really make the meal.  Maybe the best thing to do is come in with a large party and try to order as many things as you can to get a sampling of what Pabu has to offer because as I've described, you can go pretty good or really wrong very easily. I made reservations fully expecting to love Pabu completely. The tasting menu was well portioned and paced with a variety of flavors and textures. The kampachi with burdock root was my favorite. The red bean cookies that come at the end are so good! I wanted to buy a box and take them home. The plates, bowls, and cups are all so pretty and a joy to use. The coffee carafe is so cool  it's the French press of the future! We almost bought one on amazon during dessert lol. The service is mostly friendly, helpful, and informative. But there was a  weird moment. When we were served our shabu shabu, the waiter asked if we knew how to do shabu shabu. When we confirmed that we knew what to do, the waiter said, ""oh good. Then I don't have to go into the five minute speech to explain it. "" Huh, ok. Why not just say, ""oh good. Thank you. "" And stop there? The presentation of the omakase dishes were all beautiful and clean with the exception of one of my tuna nigiris. I picked it up and hanging from the end of the fish by a thin thread of muscular protein was a piece of tuna  like a hanging chad, this piece was not cleanly cut. The happy spoon was a bit too creamy and savory. I would have been able to taste and enjoy the oyster more if it wasn't masked by uni, two kinds of eggs, AND creme fraiche. Sometimes simple is super, ya know? We sat at the bar. The staff was very attentive and detailed from the get go. We ordered a the five chef choice Sashimi and a Ken's Roll. The roll was well prepared and the sashimi was fresh. It's a decent Sushi joint. But for the price and quality, it's an overpriced joint. The service is great and the place is very nice and clean. But the value is not that great. Maybe it's because they in downtown San Francisco and paying high rent! It's a new place and the place was pretty empty at lunch time. They might last! My wife and I went to Pabu last night to celebrate our th Anniversary. Overall, we walked away thinking it was a disappointing experience and would not go back. The food was just ok. The best dish of the night was the Happy Oyster Spoon. The most disappointing dish was the Miso Black Cod. Ours was severely overcooked and was trimmed properly. The other dishes in between were forgettable. Quite honestly after  dishes we left hungry. I would recommend skipping this. Generally, we are big fans of Michael Mina but this place needs lots of work. We've had ramen throughout Hokkaido. Pabu's is just as sublime. A true downtown SF gem My friends and I were excited to try this place and I really wanted to love the experience. But truly, ""Meh, I've experienced better. "" For the pice point, I expect pretty exceptional service and exceptional cuisine. The service was uncoordinated. . . possibly because the place is still new. But a server poured still water into sparkling water in our glasses. And the waitress had a hard time communicating with us. The food presentation was excellent, but the actual taste was ok. I had the Monterey Squid Okonomiyaki and Chirashi. The okonomiyaki included pork belly that was dry and overcooked. The chirashi was good, but not necesarily much better than others I've had. Overall, with so many exceptional places to eat in this area, I would not come back here again. Oddly enough for an international, Pacific oriented city, it can be hard to find Izakaya style Japanese food in San Francisco, which is why I'm glad Pabu exists. The food isn't spectacular by any means, but it's good.  I enjoyed the Okonomiyaki and the grilled squid, in particular. I'm so excited! A new cool place that I can add to my rotation :). This swank new sushi place in the financial district is a .  star experience. It's pricey sushi but it's worth it. The staff are all basically models which is a unique experience in SF, this place feels like a place you'd find in LA. We had some sushi rolls and a cooked fish, all were high quality. Definitely a great spot for a date if you're in the area and you can sit outside if you can deal with the chill. Sat at the sushi bar on Friday night and ordered the omakase tasting menu ($). The omakase begins with the happy spoon oyster, sea urchin, ikura, tobiko and creme fraiche. I thought this was really delicious and the creme fraiche made it slightly different to similar dishes I've had at other Japanese restaurants. I enjoyed the flavours of the kanpachi/kinpura burdock that followed, although it wasn't a particularly memorable dish. Next up was the extensive nigiri courses ( pieces). Generally speaking I prefer sashimi over nigiri and so was a little hesitant about ordering the omakase. Having said that, the fish selection was pretty extensive with a good variety of flavours and textures. In particular, the partially seared masaba Japanese mackerel was exceptional. I'm a big uni fan and the sea urchin from Mendocino did not disappoint. It was super fresh and really delicious. The wagyu shabu shabu was just like a mini shabu hot pot! A pretty fun dish and added the do it yourself element to a fancy dinner. For me it was a little too heavy by this point in the meal and too similar to regular shabu. I'd rather just stick to sushi with an omakase menu. The final dish, a cherry sorbet with sparkling sake, was somewhat disappointing. The sake comes separately and is poured on as they serve it. The sorbet and accompanying fresh fruit were delicious, however with the sparkling sake it strangely reminded me of that fizzy tang when orange juice goes bad(!)Overall I really enjoyed the friendly and attentive service at Pabu. Although the space is large and busy for a fine dining restaurant, our server made sure to provide a personable experience. I look forward to coming back, most likely to order off of the a la carte menu to sample dishes not offered on the tasting menu. Pabu is a nice option for Japanese dining in the financial district.  I enjoyed Pabu much more than I enjoyed Roka Akor. My family started with several Izakaya style dishes that were all quite good.  The pork gyoza and kaarage chicken were tasty and enjoyed by all.  The grilled squid was delicious and delicate, yet huge.  The squid could easily be a meal all on its own. We also tried several Robata including the chicken thighs and chicken meatballs.  Both were very tasty. As a finale, we split the seafood shabu shabu and the whole flounder.  The flounder was very delicious and a favorite at my family's table.  The shabu shabu was good with snow crab, hamachi tuna and scallops.  I probably would not order the shabu shabu again. Overall, my family decided that Pabu is a place where we will return. A bit disappointing for a Michael Mina restaurant ! At least  other upscale places in the city that are better. And it is so noisy and tables close together in, as one customer called it, the pit area. We had a booth  in the bar area. Service was ok but the waitress was not too knowledgeable and could have spoken a bit louder. Wines by the glass are high and are going up to $  a glass and it is not an always freshly opened bottle(as in this day). Best thing we had was the Kanpachi but a bit skimpy. Spider roll was ok also , only  of them though. Chawanmushi was a bit watery and bland whereas the Farm Greens were quite good and plenty. The Cod was also a bit disappointing. It totally fell apart on the plate Actually I am checking my bill over again and noticed they charged me $  for this dish and on the on line menu it says $ .  Terrible. . I had  pieces of potato and the rest was vegetable , a dish not with very good flavor. Skirt steak skewers were very good. Unfortunately the white chocolate/green tea dessert was so very bland and really nothing special. So based on everything together it should probably  / stars but not  for sure. And also I can;t believe Bauer's review with its  stars. Somebody probably recognized him. . . . . Well designed place. The ambience didn't feel uncomfortable at all. We sat for drinks at the bar before we had dinner and their bar program did not disappoint. I had an old fashioned and let the bar tender use his choice of bourbon. He led me to a Japanese  year Hakushu and it was excellent as a cocktail. For dinner we had a few starters which included the happy spoons. They will recommend that so I say just go with it. It's pretty good. The chawanmushi was also a favorite. For the main we went with nigiri. The fish was fresh and flavorful. You're definitely going to be dropping a pretty penny after dining here but I think it's worth it once you figure out what you really want from their extensive menu. Delicious. Squid appetizer was delicious. Sashimi was best ever. Spicy crunchy roll and ken's roll were the best. There were  deserts. All were amazing but the strawberry cream cake was the best. The ambience was great. The bar was a great scene. The drinks were incredible. Lovely restaurant with Asian esque, Japanese decor.   Drinks were delicious, especially the American Jack!  Since they're new, they need to work out a few kinks, and I'd be back to try the food again.  Fish is high grade, and I enjoy ordering the small plates rather than the entrees.  That way, there's more to try! Props for conveying a great NYC like ambiance, right in the heart of financial district.  I think the area definitely needed a place like this. The fact that it was packed Friday well after work was a great sign. the space is HUGE with a large bar area. We grabbed a drink in the bar area, practically stepping over people.  Everyone was squeezed along the wall so it was more reminiscent of an amtrak terminal.  We were then seated shortly  the waitress led us into ""the pit""  basically an area in the middle surrounded by booths and the sushi bar on the sides. There were about   tables packed in an area smaller than my living room. We obviously chose to sit at the bar than the pit . The tables are so close, I can't imagine having any private conversations. The whole restaurant was buzzing. It was so loud that our waitress had to invade our personal space in order to take our order and make her presence known. The prices are sky high. The quality is great. The selection is wide (with shabu shabu and great entrees).  I wouldn't mind coming back here but would not be my ""default  trendy japanese restaurant"".  That title still goes to roka akor =] My friend and I both love sushi, and were excited to try this restaurant after reading the rave reviews and seeing it on the cover of a local magazine. We have both been to Nobu (is it any coincidence the name sounds similar? I don't think so) and we love good sushi in SF, places like Sushi Zone, Warakabune, Sushi Sam's in San Mateo, and many others. I'll start with the ""positive""  the food. It tasted very mediocre, run of the mill. Like no better than a random sushi place you might go to in San Jose or San Bruno. With double the price. We ordered rolls, nigiri, and appetizers. None of it was impressive. The best were probably the meat skewers. The service was terrible. It took them  minutes to seat us, and we had reservations. They brought by  wrong orders that were for another table! We ordered simple drinks (Coke and Diet Coke) and it took  minutes to bring those out. The waitress kept rolling her eyes. Just bad all around. Bad service and very average food. Left there truly disappointed, perplexed at the high ratings, and vowing never to return, as well as to warn others to stay away. Save your money for a better place. There are so many to choose from. We had the omakase. Fresh sushi and great value for the quality of fish we are getting. But I do agree that the sushi rice is unseasoned and hard. The ""southern"" outpost of Hana Sushi is a spectacular space with amazing food, incredible depth of menu and a phenomenal sake selection (along with an impressive and charming) sake sommelier. Sat at the bar and tried the tasting menu and was blown away. We went for lunch and everything from appetizers to dessert were delicious.  Service was superb too.  I can't wait to go back for dinner. Excellent service. . . great food. . . also a very good wine list. . . . great addition to the city. I give it  stars because I had the best wagyu beef here. It is buttery and tender. The fat melts in your mouth as soon as your tongue touches it. . . A grade, $ per oz,  oz minimal. Totally worth it! It even comes with a certificate of authenticity ""certify that the following beef is % traceability genuine Miyazaki Wagyu and graded according to the highest standard required by Japan Meat Grading Association"".  Other than Wagyu beef, we tried:'Happy Spoon' OysterBluefin Medium Fatty Tuna (Chu Toro)Yuzu KanpachiSweet Miso OctopusAll good but pricy. Ryoko's offers better value for the money! We met chef and owner Ken Tominaga during our meal, a very nice and humble man. Went here to celebrate my husbands birthday.  I made early reservations for pm on a Friday night.  We got there a little early and the bar area was packed!  We just headed right to our table.  The drinks here are fantastic and the presentation of the drinks are even better.  The cocktail list is well rounded and there are a ton of choices.  I had the fuzzy and the American mammoth jack.  My favorite of the  was the American mammoth jack.  My husband had the ""I have to go"" and it was also delicious.  The drinks are served with flowers incased in ice.  Pretty cool!  We ordered quite a few dishes and had done our homework on yelp to see what was recommended.  Our server was very nice and explained the menu to us in detail making several suggestions as she went. We ordered:   happy spoons great way to start our meal off probably my favorite dish of the night, all the flavors go together so nicely!Yuzu Kanpachi this was just okay to us, Im not sure what I didn't like about it but it tasted a bit flavorless. Okonomiyaki Yum yum yum!  This is a beautiful dish and taste very good as well.  The egg with the pork belly is magical. Chawanmushi This was okay they egg was a bit watered down and it was kind of disappointing after the first bite.  The ikura was beyond delicious though!Chicken meatballs I liked this dish a lot the egg yolk dipping sauce is genius and so good!  I would definitely order that again. Beef Tounge Ehh again this didn't have much flavor to me. A Beef (off sushi menu) This was $ but the meat was very good unlike any steak I have ever tasted. Michael's negitoro roll with uni, ikura, and fatty tuna.  Sounded delicious but I thought it was just okay, I was a little surprised when they brought this dish out it was only  pieces and it cost $ that's a bit pricey even for those ingredients!Overall the service here was great, and there were some stand out dishes.  However I did find some of the dishes a little bland.  I may return, but with so many delicious restaurants like this in the city I will be more likely to try out something new! I was very excited to have dinner with my gf here. Since this is A Michael Mina resto , I was expecting it to be impeccable service, food and ambiance. So why did I give a  star?Service  excellent, very prompt, super friendly and very attentiveDrinks so delish!  They have really good mixologists. Decor  very chic, modern, stylish. Very spacious and even if it is crowded, it doesn't feel like it. Food  brings it down to one star. . Everything was just so so. Flavors of the food were just OKAY. Kokko in the peninsula served more delectable and flavorful dishes than this place. But this is not because I' m giving it a one star. The reason is for the long curly hair I found in my OKONOMIYAKI. Super disgusting, very disappointing. The manager came over  and apologized and just took off the pancake from our bill. But still this experience, leads me to just come back here again for the drinks and not the food. The hair in my food leads me to give this place sadly a one star. Tiny tiny sashimi and nigiri portions, and way more pricey than other comparable sushi place. Never been to Ken's place in Rohnert Park but been to Mina's many many establishments so really wanted to try this place but something always came up.  Luckily a friend was staying at the Hyatt and called me and said he got a table at  in the bar and I was downtown so off I went.  Well, the decor is not very exciting and predictable with the bar dominating the triangular space.  The music was loud and frankly some kind of house which was awful and disruptive to the senses.  The bathroom was overflowing with paper towels on the floor and the bin was full (presumably from a busy lunch service) but they should have cleaned up.  These are never good first signs but hey they get * on Yelp and Chronicle wants to put them in the next Top .  The servers didn't clean up the table when my friend sat so I thought he had eaten already.  The female servers were all dressed in some kind of pink fuchsia getup but not a uniform.  It looks like a Reno lounge act and this is  California address, We ordered some of their many concoctions but not a one stood out.  I had a Hibiki and Soda drink and it turns out it was strawberry soda and it overpowered any whiskey taste and I felt silly drinking a sweet strawberry colored drink.  My friend ordered a Japanese whiskey and soda to start but he got Marigolds in there. . . who puts flowers in a whiskey soda?  Some of the other named cocktails had black stuff floating around and the server said it was a lost sesame seeds but upon examination. . . nori flakes.  Did somebody not wash their hands?  Now for the food. . . . it was awful.  The pork belly buns are $.  each and this is happy hour pricing.  The one bite wonders would have been worth it if one could swallow the bun.  It was dry and powdery and the pickled shards of carrots and daikon didn't help with the tiny cube of decent belly meat.  The hand rolls were not eatable as the seaweed cone was wet and not toasted.  This is sushi  here as it must be toasted crisp as is always at the best places.  It was so chewy I could hardly bite through the nori skin.  The fried chicken tenders (Karragi) were dry and tasteless and McD's chicken tenders would have been better.  The spicy aioli is the same taste as the mix in the hand rolls.  The robata daily special was chicken oysters but this meat is near the butt and hard to pull out of the bone crevice and costs for two tiny bites at $. .  By the way. . . what's with the  pricing. . . ?  This is Japanese place and not Chinese right and all the descriptions in the bar menu was too much and felt bit like trade school approach to teach their customers.  The oysters smelled off as perhaps too long out of the water and tad too creamy (this is the bad season for that but. . . ) one should never smell the oysters before one eats them.  We tried all five bar app's as we could not order off the main menu.  We asked for the check and then they asked us if we wanted to eat off the regular menu. . . WHAT?  They told us earlier it was not available in the bar!  I thought long and hard but decided that the experience so far was so bad. . . why chance it and how much better could if be from the main menu as somebody definitely not watching the ship even as I saw Chef Ken behind the main sushi counter.   People might be impressed because of the address and Mina name but it was amateur hour in the bar area at least!  The bar should be called Pupu. . . not Pabu. Can I have a round of applause for Chef Yoji Harada! The benefit of sitting at the sushi bar is you get served by the chef working in front of you and it was an honor to have Chef Yoji Harada take care of us for the evening. He put on a smile and chit chatted with me throughout my meal, while he kept filling orders. It was a pleasant experience and much appreciated through a usual busy night. Honored to see Ken Tominaga in action there as will. For my first experience here, I had to go with the tasting menu. The menu consisted the happy spoon, sashimi and nigiris followed by wagyu shabu shabu and dessert. I really have to thank Chef Yoji Harada for serving us each piece of nigiri one by one. He hopped onto a stepping stool and reached over the counter and planted all  pieces of Nigiri onto our plate, one by one with a smile and an introduction of each piece. I really appreciated that. Sorry, I only have pictures of some items from the tasting menu because once the nigiri came out. . . taking pictures was out of the question. Get in my belly already! Overall, the tasting menu really focused on the freshness of the fish and presentation. The entire restaurant has nice decor and noise level is loud. They have a separate bar area and they get packed! If you don't work in the area where you can go snag a table, I highly recommend making a reservation. Im looking forward to coming back to try their hot plates, yakitori, sake and cocktails! As for now, they earn  stars from me for such a great experience. Thanks again CHEF YOJI HARADA!

Dinner started out with drinks with one of their signature cocktails ""Fuzzy"" and a whiskey cocktail ""The Hidden Fortess""  The ""Fuzzy"" was refreshing, fizzy and just so tasty.  The whiskey drink had just too much whiskey. . .  Not my favorite. The menu had many choices and we opted to have some small plates, sushi and dessert.  Overall the food was excellent.  Here are my favorites and highly recommend: A Beef (Japanese Waygu)  Nigiri  expensive, but worth the bite.  Negitoro Roll (Bluefin Fatty Tuna)  Skirt Steak Robatayaki  small skewers which were so tender Monterey Squid Okonomiyaki  (pork belly, sunny side egg, bonito)   flavorful Pabu Chocolate (green tea white chocolate, plum & sake jam) dessert  to die for!The service was top notch. The servers were attentive and the food was brought out at the right pace.  Plates were cleared and water was re filled promptly. Will definitely be back to try other plates and sushi. Well, this is my second Michael Mina excursion, and, as with the first one, I wasn't paying. This place is *really* pricey. For that, you get great decor, excellent service, and a nice view (if you sit in the atrium). The food was great. It wasn't the BEST Japanese food I've had, but then I've been to Japan. It wasn't the best small plate Japanese food I've had in SF, and it wasn't the best sushi I've had in SF, but it was definitely up there. Still, though I sound like an ingrate, I was glad I went, and, like I said, the food was very good, but I doubt I'd be back unless it's on someone else's Amex. It was a special occasion and a night to celebrate. Colin M. took me out to celebrate and introduced me to a new girl, Pabu. Pabu is beautiful even by the most conservative standards. Her words of welcome are warm and personal, yet her eyes possess a dark lighting that suggests a more mysterious vibe. I know Pabu comes from the distinguished Michael Mina family so her expensive taste came as no surprise. What did come as a surprise was her sense of adventure. Despite being hailed as an upscale girl, Pabu enjoyed company with a more urban and chic company. Ramen Bar, her down to earth friend, seems to be always by her side. Throughout the night, Pabu impressed me time and again with her outlook on Japanese cuisine. She believed that fish should be fresh, and flown straight from Tokyo's very own Tsujiki Fish Market. Pabu's  actions spoke louder than words, and she presented plates of sushi that awed us all. The most memorable of all was the Snow Crab Sushi, with the top seared by a flame to bait out the enticing aroma. The smell pulled me in closer and closer, and I admired Pabu more and more. And our conversation had disagreements. Pabu had a vision for fusion cuisine that I couldn't follow. I believe too many additions complicates the dish and interferes with the fish. For instance, the cherry tomatoes on the Scallop were sweet and juicy, but it completely stole the spotlight from the scallop itself. Pabu insisted on it. Pabu also had ideas that never crossed my mind. A raw egg on top of an Okonomiyaki made the popular street food into an elegant dish. A plate of Japanese Wagyu served by the ounce alongside a personal mini hotpot. By the end of our night with Pabu, I felt enlightened as a food enthusiast. My experience with Pabu was nothing short of amazing. She was understanding, friendly, classy, and most of all, exciting. But alas, she was also expensive. Our meeting with Pabu reached beyond $, and that's after her manager Jason (thank you so much!) treated us to a few dishes of sushi and shots of a limited Sake. Thankfully, Colin M. picked up the tab. He is as generous as his taste is refined (check out his reviews). It was an amazing experience with Pabu. But as just a foodkid trying to make it in f. A. A. t city, I can't afford many of these extravagant outings. But when I finally do make it, you can bet I'll give Pabu a call. Thanks again, Colin M. , Jason, and Pabu! Opted for the omakase and added in couple extra courses. I would definitely say the strong point of the meal were the nigiris as the fish tends to go from lean to fatty. The shabu wasn't too memorable but was different as you get to cook up your own lil tasting. The dessert was a surprising winner. Carbonated sake, peaches, and shiso is a happy marriage. The cocktails and sake were a pleasant touch to the meal. Place was packed all evening but waiters and staff were attentive. terrible phone person. we had  reservations for an event a month away. first, she cant' find the reservation. then she cancels the wrong reservation. guess they have ""Hard Water"" and ""Pabu"" on the same system. big difference in names and Pabu is apt name for the the staff we've been dealing with.  such a pain, we'll just go to Ozumo. We read an article in our hotel about how this was ""traditional"" and the chef would demand no soy sauce, etc.  BS!!  The sushi came out without any brush of sauce, rice was undercooked and soy sauce had to be used.  SO Overated!!  Pluses were nice server, and great sake menu.  Otherwise the sushi was way weak.  IF IF IF we ever went back it would only be for the sake. Pabu is the latest restaurant in the Michael Mina Menagerie, focusing on Japanese food in a more Izakaya (small plates) style. It has a little bit of everything in current Japanese food trends in America. The place is very large and in  main sections. The front room is a spacious bar with high glass ceilings, large triangular bar, with modern style tall chairs, surrounded on  sides with red cushioned booths. The middle section has the main dining room with natural wood decor. Their are booths on the left, tables in the center, and a long sushi bar on the right. The ceiling is not as high, but still more than most, accentuating the airy feel and noise, sacrificing any intimate coziness. There are a couple of private rooms in the rear for groups of about  to  each. The rear section is almost completely separate, with a more casual feel and features a Ramen bar. At Pabu you can sample on some small plates Izakaya style, with both hot and cold selections, on plates or yakitori type skewers. The selection isn't as diverse as a true Izakaya, but has many favorites like chicken hearts, chopped cold octopus, and full grilled squid, and a few twists on some of these Izakaya staples a la Mina. Or you can choose sushi, mostly in classic Nigiri style at the sushi bar or on a plate at your table. They do have a few rolls for those who think that yada yada rolls are sushi ( I won't tell Jiro you think so) or haven't acquired a taste for raw fish. The Nigiri can be served with rice with the standard  pieces per order, or sashimi with  pieces per order. Or you can go order ramen or even shabu shabu, although I didn't notice how the Shabu Shabu was cooked at the table or the bar, where you have the full menu. We sat at the bar with no wait on a busy Saturday night at :pm, and could have had another  people join us there. The tables were full, but not the sushi bar that night.  They do have some great creative drinks at the bar crafted by Carlo, who has crafted many a cocktail menu for Michael. They have a pretty extensive sake list and some Shochu selections, too. They have an impressive array of Japanese Whiskey and Single Malt Scotches, and specially crafted signature cocktails. I tried the Citrus, which is a refreshing Gin based drink, with grapefruit juice, specially flowered ice cubes (only enough for /night) and a fragrant lavender wasabi salt rim. We weren't super hungry, so we tried the Okonomiyaki ($, perhaps the best value), which was not traditional, but very delicious, with pork belly, sunnyside up egg, and Japanese tsukemono toppings. We also tried  kushiyaki (skewered) tastes: Tsukune (Chicken meatballs with a raw egg yolk dip, $) Butabara (fatty pork belly (there was little meat, almost all fat, $), and thin slices of Gyutan (beef tongue. , $). Actually, the tongue wasn't on a stick. we leave that to you tongue piercers. We also had an Ahi Poke appertizer ($), and for Nigiri sushi, Umimasu (Ocean Trout, $) and Aji (Spanish Mackerel, $). Drinks we had were a great Peat Single Malt, Caol Ila ($), Hendricks and Tonic ($), the Citrus ($), and a special concoction made by Carlo ($) which was sort of an aged Japanese Whiskey based Old Fashion. The food is good and drinks are good, too.  However, the prices are about double what you would pay at a sushi bar ($ $ for  Nigiri, $+ for more exotic), and maybe % more than an Izakaya in the suburbs. I didn't try the ramen nor Shabu Shabu and think I would choose specialty shops for those anyway. This place is huge, it has a celebrity chef and it is in the FiDi of DTSF, so you are paying for all that in addition to the actual food and service. They do have a very popular happy hour, perfect for being seen thru their large floor to ceiling front windows. But if you just want to walk in without a rezzie, the large bar has plenty of room on the weekends, with full menu. I would say this is a great afterwork FiDi crowd place for those on an expense account or making good bread at their start up, and a place to be seen in a chi chi sort of way. But what it has in airy atmosphere and modern sophistication and eclectic offerings, it trades away intimacy and a true Japanese crafted food feel. It strategically capitalizes on the Izakaya, Sushi and Ramen uptrends growing in popularity today, and serves them all in one place with the MM moniker, and has a great location. I would suggest it is better for a corporate meal or afterwork indulgence rather than an intimate date occasion, unless you just want to be seen from the outside looking in through the all glass facade. Pabu was very, very good.  We did the omakase tasting menu, which showcased a nice variety of dishes.  The ""happy spoon"" first course was a delicious and nice treat to start off the meal.  It was a nice mixture of textures and flavors.  The star of the evening, of course, was the nigiri sushi, of which there was plenty.  The sushi is served in what I called ""flights,"" a dish of four pieces that were in the same taste ""family. ""  It was a fun way to experience different pieces of fish and compare the differences of the ones in each flight.  I didn't love the shabu shabu.  I feel restaurant Michael Mina does a better job with that dish, and the broth wasn't that hot.  It was also weird sharing one pot amongst multiple people  you can't really keep track of what you put into the pot, or you wait your turn and it takes a while for everyone to enjoy.  Maybe give everyone their own pot?  I also didn't love the udon noodles brought at the end.  A nice idea, but they tasted almost like instant ramen noodles.  I love instant ramen, but it's not udon. Service was very good.  Our water was refilled often and we were checked on throughout the night, but not so much it was oppressive.  If you can sit in the booth that overlooks most of the restaurant near the private rooms, it's probably the best seat in the house.  The decor of the restaurant is also tasteful, modern and elegant. Food was okay. Service was spotty. Health Care surcharge for Michael Minna's empire. . . Really? Are you kidding? Michael Minna is so cheap he can't buy his hard workers health care? He has to gouge his customers. After spending a whopping $.  at Pabu, a nearly $.  Healthcare fee was tacked on. TACKY Michael!  For all of you others who don't want to give business to these cheap chefs click this link to see who else makes their customers pay for health care for their employees and themselves. sf. eater. com/archives/… The omakase was omg yummy! My friend and I came here on a Thursday night and sat by the sushi bar. The sushi chef was very nice and informative. I wanted to take pictures of my sushi and kept reminding myself after every bite but my mind and mouth were too busy savoring the delicious meal. Anywho, I only remembered to take a photo of my dessert. The dessert was also a really nice surprise. Loved it. Truly delightful experience. The shabu shabu was incredibly flavorful. The sushi was super fresh and the tempura mushrooms were out of this world. The service was impeccable. The atmosphere was contemporary and energetic and extremely comfortable. Well done! Wow! Just finished a fricken Awesome dinner!! Party of , we had our own little room and Nicole took very good care of us!! It was my brothers birthday and he likes his favorites so we knew the tasting menu wouldn't work so we just ordered lots of bites. The chicken thigh skewers were awesome. The black hawk fish melted in my mouth. The side spinach a delight. The summer saki beautiful and delish had . The decor and space is elegant , even the bathrooms have this great smelling cake batter smell inside and the hand soap was nice. Excellent customer service and excellent food! Thank you for a great night // What a scrumptious Michael Mina find this was that just opened in the Financial District. We visited with reservations when it was not even open for a full week, and we ate our hearts out! Food items we shared (that I can still remember) included their Happy Spoons, Monterey Squid Okonomiyaki, Cucumber and Octopus Salad, Braised Burdock Root, Pork Gyoza, Ahi Tuna Poke, Monk Fish Liver, Chicken Wings/Meatballs Skewers, and several of their Nigiri. Oh Lordy Lord, flavors tickled something divine that night, particularly the Octopus Salad. Loved the tuna poke and the skewers, too. Interesting variation on their okonomiyaki, but was completely worth being an adventurous foodie about. I certainly cannot forget to mention the Sake! We had two delicious recommendations on a cost conscious basis made for us by an expert working there, and they were passionately consumed as our night rolled out. The bottle I snapped a pic of was the second we tried: the Asahiyama Junmaishu. Fantastic. We even got to take a picture with Chef Ken Tominaga upon this occasion. Was very impressed. A wee bit CO$$TLY, but worth splurging on for extra special occasions  you'll simply know when the time is right! Everything was delicious! My friend has been telling me that this is her new cafeteria in the city ever since it opened, so I just had to see why. Having dined at quite a few of the Michael Mina restaurants before, I had high expectations coming here, only to find that they were met and exceeded! This is definitely my fav MM restaurant to date!To give a brief run down of what we ordered:+Happy Spoon: AMAZING! MUST GET!Had to get it modified as I'm allergic to oyster, but was still delicious none the less!+Ahi tuna poke: have eaten this pretty much everywhere but this was definitely one of the best ones! seasoned to perfection. +Monterey Squid Okonomiyaki: omg I don't know how they even invented this but I would eat this everyday if I could!!+Mushroom tempura: just as good as the one at RN!+Grilled squid+Skewers: MUST GET THE CHICKEN MEATBALLS! enough said :D+Salted Caramel Coffee jelly custard: I've never been a huge fan of custard but OM THIS IS SO GOOD YOU CAN'T COME HERE WITHOUT ORDERING IT!+Sake roll cake: yum =PDefinitely coming back to check out the happy hour and eventually the omakase menu. Love the ambiance, attentive service (may be a little slow for my liking), and delicious food! Good job Pabu! Hit and Miss. We enjoyed a bit of everything on the menu. The nigiri was ehh except for the uni which was spectacular. All in all I would return but it wouldn't be for the amazing food, more for the experience.  The experience was good, but not fantastic.  Hopefully that makes sense. . . If you are debating on going to Pabu you should go, just do not expect to be blown away. I have previously eaten at Michael Mina and RN and enjoyed them both immensely. So when I heard of Pabu's opening I was more than excited to try Michael Mina and Ken Tominaga's take on modern authentic Japanese cuisine. My reservations were made through OpenTable and we were seated almost immediately even though we were late (dat traffic doe). The first thing I notice when I walked through the door was the noise level, it was off the charts! Wouldn't recommend if you were planning to come here for a intimate romantic dinner, but luckily I was with family. We we're sat at one of the booths by the bar, it was super roomy and comfortable. I decided on the tasting menu with the Japanese A Waygu supplement for the shabu shabu, along with an order of Otoro sashimi and Okonomiyaki to share. The tasting meanu consisted of two courses appetizer like dishes (Happy Spoon & Kanpachi Kinpira Burdock) and four courses of nigiri. That's right, FOUR courses with four pieces each so I ate a total of SIXTEEN pieces of nigiri. Pretty awesome. One ""main course"" (Wagyu Shabu Shabu) and a dessert (Cherry Sorbet). My biggest complaint was the time between each course. The wait between each dish was far too long, especially for a tasting menu, and disrupted the momentum of our entire meal. It also didn't help that I was starving even before we started eating so I was understandably ""hangry"". The main course of the Shabu Shabu wasn't anything special although the presentation was cute. The Okonomiyaki was very nice, so I would recommend that. Each cut of fish for the nigiri courses was extremely fresh and absolutely exquisite (the Uni was the best I'd ever had). But overall, the prolonged wait between courses ruined the entire night for me and my stomach. It's obvious that Pabu is still working out some kinks with it's timing and service since they only opened a month ago, but so far, my experience at Pabu did not live up to my expectation. / would recommend to friend to wait a few months before trying in hopes of Pabu finding its appropriate rhythm. Happy spoon, squid okonomiyaki, sake steamed clams were the best. the sake and whiskey cocktails were very good. Ordered a bunch of stuff with  other lovely girls, everything tasted very good, with an elegant presentation. Sure it is pricey, very pricey, but you're paying for the ambience and the location. Nothing you can't get at a good local japanese place, but they all tasted very good and authentic. It reminds me of Hakkasan, if you ordered the right stuff, it could be an amazing experience, on the pricey side. If anyone can rate Pabu more than a  star, then he/she probably has never had better. In a place like San Francisco, where great food is on almost every corner, Pabu just has no place here. There are so many other better places for good sushi. The only thing Pabu has going for them is their swanky decor, location and the Michael Minna brand swindling tourists through the doors. If I could sum up the food, it would simply be ""dog shit"" and you're better off having sushi from the local supermarket sushi aisle. I spent $ for  people and so I tasted a wide enough spectrum of what they had to offer. What I remember from my experience:* Spoon of happiness tasted gritty, sauces were too salty & overwhelming and mine came with a shard of shell. * Pork belly was like chewing rubber and was too dry and again too salty* The sauces to the scallops were way too sweet, which was followed by an extremely acidic and sour aftertaste* Chawanmushi was cold and too salty* All of the nigiri we ordered arrived with rice that was too cold, hard and most of the fish, esp the otoro tasted fishy* Broth to cook the wagyu was tasteless, thankfully they didn't botch the wagyu meat itself which was acceptable quality* They took over an hour to bring our sushi out. That, however, allowed us to meet the interesting whiskey specialist from the bar who impressed with his knowledge of Japanese whiskey and his service. That was probably the only positive from my experience at PabuTo give more context around my personal sushi preferences, I rank these other sf places very highly:* Akiko's* Wako* Kusakabi* SaruSo, if you think these places were delightful, then there's no way you would bother with Pabu. .  stars. Got here an hour before our reservation and they didn't mind seating us early. Decor was upscale modern Japanese, very nice. Got the piece omakase tasting menu. The timing was on point, pcs of nigiri was a bit much, would have preferred some cooked meats. Ended with a shabu style w/ waygu. The final dessert course was peaches with carbonated sake.  Service was great, nigiri and shabu was good but nothing special. Didn't care for the dessert at all. For all the sushi options in SF, probably won't be back cause of the price. great atmosphere, decor, and service. But most importantly amazing food. Highlights:Bloomsdale SpinachYuzu KanpachiMonterey Squid OkonomiyakiIt is on the pricey side but you get what you pay for. This is a very solid addition to the SF Japanese cuisine scene. I had a great omakase experience here and their sake list is nothing short of spectacular. It is a great place for a large group or a private party as well as it has a very lively izakaya like atmosphere. My only knock on the place is that they are trying to do so many different Japanese cuisine specialties (sushi, robata, okonomiyaki, shabu shabu, etc) that it is difficult to excel at all of them. That said, I love the place and will be back. I could eat the Monterey Squid Okonomiyaki every single day for the rest of my life. Everything we tried was delicious. Can't wait to go back!! Favorite new sushi spot in SF!! Word on Yelp is that it's quite difficult to get a reservation here so I consider myself quite lucky to score a reservation in their lovely private dining room. Our lovely waiter, Nicole, made sure we were aware of all the most popular cocktails and menu items. While the cocktails looked incredible we were in the mood for a little bubbly so ordered a bottle of that instead. As for our apps and entrees we ordered a variety of sushi and regular menu items. While the sushi was so fresh and tasty I think my absolute favorite eats were the octopus and mushroom tempura. So good!  We were stuffed and said no to dessert, but Nicole didn't take no for an answer and brought one of everything to our table. Omgoodness! And of course somehow we found room for all the deliciousness. I'm back in SF next month so I better book my reservation for Pabu now. Full disclosure: My friend and I tried Kusakabe before we tried Pabu and are definitely a bit biased by how overwhelmingly great our Kusakabe experience was. However, if you're charging the same price as Kusakabe ($ for the omakase and $ for the sake pairing) and serving raw fish as well, it's a well warranted comparison. Unfortunately we were left quite unimpressed after our dabble at Pabu. Aside from the modern, upscale ambiance and the friendly, personalized service, the food was simply not up to par. We ordered the omakase with the sake pairings. First and foremost, I'm not a sake drinker (love my grapes too much!) so I'm sure that biased my view on the pairings a bit. However, I didn't really feel a direct match between any of the items and the accompanied sake. Also, all of the sushi pieces that we received, both sashimi and nigiri, were good but not great. They were decent if priced at $ for the entire omakase. But at $, there is a certain standard of excellence that these items completely lacked. There was no attention to detail when it came to freshness and flavor  quite disappointing. Same with the shabu  good but not great. Very mediocre and parallels some of the significantly more reasonably priced ones I've had at shabu spots in the valley. And last but not least, don't expect to be full from the omakase. My friend and I were still bit hungry afterwards  hungry and tipsy to be specific. If you're going to spend a sizable amount to have a one of a kind sushi dining experience, you would expect each item to be refined and perfectly curated. Pabu, however, loses major points there. So if you're looking for an upscale omakase dining experience, check out the significantly better Kusakabe (also in Fidi). Happy Eating, Yelpers! We had heard that this new place was going to be great considering the roots of the chef. We were very impressed with the space, the bar and the selections of saki and shoji and whiskey were outstanding! The staff was very attentive and well educated about all the dishes. We decided to try the tasting menu thinking that would be the best way to sample the cross selection of the creativity of the chef. Unfortunately we were badly disappointed. The menu items were uninspiring and very repetitive. It basically  was a long drawn out menu of a bunch of sushi pieces prepared similarly. Nothing to inventive with each piece of sushi and the the worst part was the quality of the sushi was very poor including the uni which was old and tasteless. Fresh uni should be bright in color and almost sweet to the taste. It would have been nice to throw in some grilled dish  or a hamachi cheek for variety in the tasting menu. Overall very average and considering the steep price, not a good value. When someone asks ""Where's good sushi in San Francisco?"", the answer is quite simple: PabuSure they're new, but this Michael Mina dining establishment sure knows how to roll out the red carpet for a group of  hungry ladies at the last minute. THANK YOU to Anthony, Nicole and the entire team for accommodating at the last minute. We came hungry and ordered several app/entrees and were treated to quite a few extras. Here's a quick rundown:+ Ahi Tuna Poke+ Bloomsdale Spinach+ Seaweed Salad+ Edamame+ Grilled Squid+ Maitake Mushroom Tempura+ Chicken Meatballs+ Miso Black CodPlus a variety of sushi rolls that I didn't even sample because I fell in love with a new dish on the menu: Udon with fresh crab. Rarely do I finish an entire plate of food when dining out (hey, it's all about portion control) but this dish was perfectly balanced and I sucked it down within minutes. If you love uni, this is *the* dinner plate for you. I would eat it again for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Just when we thought it couldn't get much better, desserts came out. . . A little gift from the kitchen since we were celebrating a special occasion. Soy Caramel Custard, Sake Roll Cake, and PABU Chocolate were all yummy, but my heart belongs to the Cherry Sorbet. The sparkling sake really makes the dish shine. Thank you again to the Michael Mina team for serving our group on a Sunday night. The private dining room was exceptional, perfect for a special night in San Francisco. Can't wait to go back! After having a fantastic experience at RN , I was very excited to try Mina's latest endeavor, and it definitely exceeded expectations.  I went to Pabu with several friends for cocktails and dessert.  Overall, everything we had was very creative and played on your taste buds, waking them up from the dull day to day. Our cocktail waitress was also very knowledgeable and attentive.  My cocktail, the ""citrus"" was not only well balanced (acidity vs sweetness) but was also presented with artistic flare. The long rectangular ice cube was infused with some sort of flower and one side of the rim was dipped in lavender wasabi salt. I loved that only half of the rim was covered, as that way, I could choose how much, if any, salt i wanted with each sip. My husband ordered the ""tree"" cocktail, which I cannot describe well enough to give it justice. . . you just have to try it. Spicy, creamy, tangy, so many flavors all at once, and it works! We got two desserts for the table to share. Both were literally a party in our mouths! Mina has elevated the physical experience of eating with these treats. The Soy Caramel Custard with coffee jelly and sesame candy was the perfect blend of textures, and the Cherry Sorbet with peaches came to life as the generous serving of sparkling sake was poured over top. I left Pabu so excited to return; I want to enjoy the full dinner experience and lunch as well! According to our waitress the restaurant will be open for lunch at the end of the month. Nice Japanese spot, with small and large plates, grilled items, and sushi.  Cocktails are really excellent, think Beretta or the like.  Weekday dinner felt populated with corp types, and the conversation at the table next to us was soul sucking.  But the food and service was great, highly recommended.  The ramen bar next door is connected and looks excellent. To be fair, this place should be .  stars. Pabu seemed great on paper, but was mediocre with its execution. Felt contrived, almost. Service was good. We came on a busy Friday night and we were seated shortly after arriving. The waitress would disappear for long periods of time, but again, busy Friday night. They explained each dish as presented, so there was that. Water cup was also refilled pretty frequently. The food was tasty but nothing great. I wasn't blown away by anything in particular and nothing really stood out. The Happy Spoon was probably the best of what we ordered with the dessert coming a close second. The grilled squid was good, but Ippuku in Berkeley makes it much, much better. The pork belly shouldn't even be on the menu. I love me some pork belly but I've had better coming out of food trucks. Ordered:Happy SpoonMonterey Squid OkonomiyakiGrilled SquidBeef Tongue skewerTender Kurobata Pork BellyMiso Black CodSoy caramel CustardAmbiance was typical Friday night Financial District. 'Nuff said. I probably wouldn't return unless for Happy Hour. The drinks were good and the bar area lively. Go here to be seen, but NOT for the food. Unfortunately it was mediocre at best. My husband and I had high hopes since we read several articles on Pabu prior to going. It didn't meet our expectations. Dishes we ordered: Oysters  had a fishy taste. should I not have ordered it since it was on a Sunday? Kinpira burdock  tasty but nothing special Summer chawanmushi  lesson learned. seafood chawanmushi is best when hot Grilled squid   stars for this dish  Beef tongue  decent Ordered every Nigiri you can imagine  Trout sushi was excellent! however, sad to say all else was super disappointing. O toro, uni, tamago especially were sad. I'm surprised that both hot food and sushi were mediocre. From my experience, restaurants like these can execute at least one aspect of their food very well. Pros: Service was good  professional, attentive and pleasant Interior decor was very niceSadly, I will not be going back. PABU is definitely a breath of fresh air in SF.  This place is what I've been waiting for and it DID NOT disappoint.  I had the pleasure of dining at PABU  times since it was opened in July.  Each time was a different  and wonderful experience, and every time, I discovered something new and amazing.  FoodIt's the freshest, most exquisite, and innovative.  It's hard to describe, but easier to say that everything I'd tried was wonderfully indescribable.    Cocktails Elegant, creative and refreshing with the best Sake list in the city.  PABU's sake sommelier was extremely knowledgable  and help us find the best sakes to pair with our foods.  ServiceJust one word. . . . Impeccable!Will I be back?  Again, again and again. . . . This is a solid  star establishment. I came here on a Wednesday night with a girlfriend from out of town and we were seated immediately (with a reservation). Our server was spectacular, offering tastings off of the sake menu before we ordered a carafe and giving us plenty of time and recommendations on the menu items.  The variety of items that we ordered were brought out in  different ""courses"", which allowed for a very relaxed and smoothly flowing meal.  I do think that the tables are a bit crowded if you plan to order drinks/multiple food items but I know that space is a premium.  Food: Seaweed salad and the edamame  to start (just to get some greens) and the seaweed salad had a pleasantly sweet note to it.  Pork belly robatayaki, which was as indulgent as you would expect.  I wish there was a bit more of a char on my piece as it was a bit gummy, but my GF had a perfectly grilled skewer. At a place like this thought I was expecting that to be executed perfectly.  Pork Gyoza were delicious and presented beautifully.   Grilled Squid was not what i was expecting at all (large squid grilled and then sliced as is) but was fantastic! Our waiter tipped us off that the spice in the containers to the side of the table went fabulously with the squid when dipped in sauce (I opted for soy because I don't care where you are, mayo is nasty).  Nigiri sampler the fish was cut way too thin for the price and the establishment.  The taste was fresh, but it was almost overwhelmed by the rice/fish ratio.  Next time I would opt for the sashimi and hope it was more generously plated. As a side note, when we were seated we were very confused because we were given two set menu options (one that looked much better than the other) and is reserved for large groups.  So if you come in a larger group definitely check that out.  I dont think the smaller party option was worth it, which is why we opted out. Overall, the experience was wonderful and the food was very solid.  This place will thrive with all the businesses located nearby and that was definitely the vibe that you got. I would love to come back for happy hour and check that out! Good location for FiDi peeps.  Nice happy hour menu (food/drinks  pm ). Reasonable pricing on the HH menu as well. Place is big with bar at the center, with tables around the perimeter. Outdoor/patio seating as well.  I had the pork bun and the tokyo fried chicken (aka Karaage). Both were delicious though the bun was less like a bun and more like a mini taco (with the doughy breading).  Would definitely come back for a dinner! Pabu is a standout among upscale Japanese restaurants in SF. Food is excellent, service is superb, design is traditional yet chic, and ambiance is lively. It feels like a top notch Vegas restaurant. Food wise, they do sushi, yakkitori, and hot foods like Shabu (pretty much the full breadth of Japanese cuisine). You'd think it means they couldn't do any one thing well but everything we had was excellent. The sushi bar head chef, Yoji, prepared the fluke, ocean trout, tuna, prawn, and tomago for us. All fresh and well prepared. No wasabi on the side here as they clearly think they know how to prepare your nigiri. The grilled squid was mind blowing. I never had squid that well done. The okonomiyaki is out of this world excellent. It's a squid pancake appetizer. The happy spoon was good though maybe a tad too creamy. The chicken thigh yakkitori was juiced and tasty, better than I've ever had in NYC or SF. The seafood Shabu Shabu for two is excellent. You'll savor every bite. The sake soaked cake dessert is also great. Cocktails are excellent here. They also have the largest Japanese whisky menu I've ever seen. I definitely will be coming back here. It's certainly pricey but I couldn't find anything I was disappointed by. Food  So we were in the SF downtown area on a Friday night looking for a place to eat. Was going to go to our default Barbacco, but decided to try something new in the area. My wife said this is a new restaurant opened by Michael Mina, so we decided to look at the menu. The prices weren't terrible for something downtown, but we wondered what the quality was like. So rating what we ate:Gyoza  Thick skin, filling was ok, nothing special.  Taste was there execution was meh. Grilled Ika  Default Standard. Was good definitely on Par. Hyakshou Greens  Very fresh very good. Top notch vegetable quality well done. Tempura Set Dinner  Terrible, / of the corn tempura was uncooked. Raw batterChicken Karaage  Very good, good taste good fry on it, excellent sauce. Spider Roll  Service forgot it. Roll Cake  Sub par. Sponge was dry and the filling not great. Comp'ed Coffee Jelly Caramel  AMAZING!Service  So as you read the above, they forgot our Spider Roll and Collected our plates. When we told them they were very apologetic and gave us a free desert for the error. Both the maitre d' and the server apologized, admitted the mistake, and took care of things quickly. They took off the Tempura set dinner as well. So service although not polished, I give A+ to accountability, which is rare in a lot of places these days. Ambiance Definitely business casual and a great looking crowd. Closer to people in their late 's or 's. It can get crowded so a bit loud at times, but definitely very nice. Bonus My wife tried the Lunch Ramen which is lined up around the block during lunch time. Don't bother, very sub par. Great food, ambience, service and pricing. ) The happy spoon appetizer, ken's roll, pork belly skewers, sake dessert,  and Japanese paired whiskey/sake cocktails (Summer) were delicious. Simple to eat, and not too heavy) Good location and open ambience inside. Not overdone either) Service is quick, great suggestions) Went in expecting over the top pricing considering its Michael Mina + sushi, but didn't feel the pinch too much. Pricing felt right for quality and service. Definitely go again, especially for the happy hour. I visited Pabu a few days ago, and found the place a little below my expectation.  Service was great, our server was attentive, great smile, and really know the dishes, and drinks.  I had one cocktail, and it was well made.  The interior was nicely done as well (the only problem was with the booth, which made it very difficult for the server to take care of the customer who sits at the end, but it's the same problem with any booth in any restuarant. )The food is where I feel a little disappointed.  Everything tasted great, just not extraordinary enough to be memorable.  We had a few appetizers.  Scallops with strawberry sauce, kampachi, tofu with matcha, clams in sake, and a couple others.  The best part was the clam in sake, which is really not something I never have before.  The grilled items were good, a bit salty for me, and good in general. The biggest let down was the sushi.  I had a few rolls, and they were just the same as what you get anywhere else.  I found the rice was pressed together a bit too hard, making the rice sticked together too much.  I'm sure the nigrini would have been much better, unfortunately, the friends ordered the rolls.  Shabu was ok.  The noodle offered afterwards was nice, but the use of sesame sauce overpowered the flavor of the brooth a bit. I like this place, but I expect it to be much much more given the predigree of the chefs. New, modern, quality grade sushi.  The wait staff were knowledgeable with every drink on the menu.  My friend loved the whisky sitting on a ball of ice.  I fully endorse. Came here for my birthday dinner with my brother and sister in lawWe decided to give the Omakase a shot and see where that takes us. ProsA good solid variety of nigiri Snowcrab leg was amazing (melt in your mouth goodness)Skewers were solid, well seasoned and tender ConsRice was inconsistent across each course (from undercooked to mushy) Cut of fish was too thinFlavors of fish were rather lackluster Too nigiri focused (would have enjoyed a more robust wide range of options such as sashimi, hot items from kitchen and grilled skewers)Shabu broth lacked depth and felt one noteDrinks were great and the bar area is quite amazing Waitress was fine, the busers were on top of their game, maybe a little too eager to clear the table but since we were doing omakase timing was key so I understand why they were that wayOverall ThoughtsIMO, skip omakase/nigiri and stick with the hot items/skewers. Definitely a great ambiance to have HH while sipping on truly well made craft cocktails Best experience ever! Food was delicious and the service was excellent! Good job guys! Can't complain about the free sake and sashimi Four of us came here for dinner on  Monday night The atmosphere was lively. We opted for the omakase menu with the waygu addition. The omakase was beautiful and delicious, but it left us feeling unsatisfied.  The Waygu addition was not worth it two small pieces of beef to be cooked in a small shabu pot. We ended up getting a couple more cooked appetizers to supplement the menu. For the price tag, I wouldn't do the Omakase again. Instead, I'd opt for trying a combination of sushi and cooked items off their regular menu. Took a foodie friend here for his th birthday. AMBIENCEJapanese pub milieu  wood beams, shoji screens, two bars (one for drinking and one for sushi) prominent, beautiful cherry blossom tree painted on the wall  but better because of the open space/high ceilings. Comparable restaurants in Japan are tighter/lower to the ground and encourage bowing. This restaurant instead draws you upwards, to stand tall and enjoy the height/views of the room and, more importantly, the aromas of the food. Sat in a comfy booth with good looking, very light green cushions. Bar area is more hip dark gray with booths that allow you to see the full actions. On a Tuesday night, restaurant was packed and energy was palpable. FOODWe had the omakase menu with Wagyu shabu shabu finale and sake pairing. Started with the Happy Spoon. Nice complement of flavors with a ponzu creme fraiche in particular adding a richer taste to the mouthful without overpowering the oyster. Next I think was a trio of Kanpachi which featured a small piece of deep fried shallot on top and some delish sauce with a bit of spicy oil in it.  Loved the texture the fried shallot added.  My British friend who is a utensil nazi was appalled that I used my finger to wipe up a bit of leftover sauce into my mouth, but chopsticks weren't going to cut it and licking it was below even my vulgar standards. Upon further reflection however, he broke down and did the same. We then had three plates with four pieces of sushi each. Every piece of fish/seafood was excellent, fresh, melt in your mouth. The chef dressed each one with a range of treatments (ponzu to negi to sesame to lemon/salt, etc). One of my new food habits is to focus on the food I am eating. I mean really focus  even closing my eyes sometimes. In my hectic life, I have recently noticed that, at times, I have finished a meal without even tasting it. So odd. This sushi is definitely something to savor. In fact, the most startling observation I shared with my friend was that I had actually checked my swallowing instinct several times because I wanted to chew the food longer in my mouth to enjoy it more fully. I'm pretty sure that's a first for me. Can't quite detail all the fish and treatment combinations, but I did flashbulb the awesome King Salmon because the Maillard reaction from super slight searing just killed me as well as the hotate (so sweet and creamy) and crab (melted). FYI, I'm not a huge fan of mirugai or amaebi, but both were as good as I have had. We then had the Wagyu shabu shabu with two sauces, ponzu and a sesame based one. Three delectable pieces. Also helped that sesame happens to be one of my favorite flavors. Nevertheless, tender and tasty. Finished off with a cherry sorbet and peaches dessert with a sparkling sake pour over. It really delivered an effervescent fruit hit that you tasted olfactorily. It came with some delicately ground almonds, but I think I actually enjoyed the bites without the almonds a bit more. SAKEWanted to put a special call out to Stuart Morris, the sake sommelier.  Sake is not usually my thing  I tend to be more ghetto, drinking beer with my sushi  but I am really glad we did the sake pairing.  For the first time, I really connected with the sake varietals  from fruity to yeasty to soft to warm  and how they complemented each dish. Heard a nice vignette from Stuart about how he became just the sixth foreigner to pass the Sake Master test. Real boon to Pabu. At the end of the meal we agreed that we will have to bring our wives sometime soon to moderate their Pabu envy. I am looking forward to exploring the other parts of the menu next time. Made a reservation for  on a Saturday night, got sat in the lounge in their beautiful new bar. We basically ordered everything shared starting with the Happy Spoon, which is pretty much a Pabu tradition now. We ordered anything that was out of the ordinary. The karagi, okonomiyaki, chawanmushi, as well as their signature ""Ken's roll"" and ""chef Michael"" dishes. Enjoyed their desserts, though a little simple compared to RN's & Bourbon Steak's. (It's the same as at The Ramen Bar next door)My friend noticed how the staff's vibe was very hospitable, and that was just on his way to the bathroom. He felt appreciated being there as a guest. Our Server, Syd, was no exception. Perfect presence. The lowlights were the under seasoned tempura maitake and a Food Runner who did not know his spiel, as well as some others rushing through their speils dropping off the plates. We were very interested to hear about the food, but I was always able to ask Syd, who always knew what was what. Empty glasses could've been noticed a little faster and less of a lull from order to table. Great energy in the place and I can't wait to take my parents to try it! Incredible food, solid cocktails, and amazing service! Had a phenomenal time here with a bunch of girlfriends but not going to bore you with the details. Undoubtedly the freshest & best selection of sushi & robata I've had in a long time, lots of sake to choose from, and our server was very sweet and genuine. At the end of the night, we were full bellied happy clams. Had dinner here on Saturday night in the lounge area. Overall, really enjoyed the meal. We had the Happy Spoon appetizer, which was pretty good. For sushi, we had Ken's roll. The spicy tuna on top was amazing!For dinner, we had the meatball skewers that had an egg yolk with seasoning to dip it in. It was really interesting and yummy. The best part of the meal was the A steak! A bit overpriced at $/ounce, but super tender and flavorful!Dessert was delicious as well. We had the soy caramel custard with coffee jello. It was so different and the custard was so rich and creamy!I definitely want to come back for happy hour! Eh So So nothing special. Last Saturday went to the restaurant for dinner. I ordered the Omakase. It was $ for  pieces. Here is the problem. . . the fish was from good cuts BUT it was so thinly cut that I could not taste and appreciate those cuts. The fish should be king in sushi. Very disappointed. I would have been happy with  instead of  but give me some thick cuts of fish where I can appreciate what I'm eating. Don't think I will be coming back. This is San Francisco, I can list a good number of great sushi places that are traditional Japanese and delicious.  Skip this one for now. If I were the Hulk I would have ran down Market street crushing cars after spending $ plus eating here. Came here / early (:) so we decided to grab their Happy Hour special, but after  minutes of waiting, there were no servers in sight, and Happy Hour ends at pm. Finally after flagging down a server at the bar, they took our order and said they would deliver it to our table. After being seated our main server only gave us one menu, and we had to ask her about the sushi menu before she finally brought it out. We ordered the following:Happy Spoon Oyster: Tasted very plain with the uni drenched in what tasted like a plain milk rather than a crème fraîche, very lacklusterOysters: Good, but very tiny for the $.  each price. Better bang for your buck at Woodhouse's $ Tuesday oyster specialMonterey Squid Okonomiyaki, Pork Belly, Sunny side Egg, Bonito: Tasted like hash browns with unagi sauce, though the egg was cooked well, I could barely taste the pork bellySpicy Tuna, Spicy Scallop, and Negi Hamachi Handrolls: All good but not greatOcean Fois Gras: Which was just plain anikimo, very little flavor and a boring sunomonoAnd a roll that had uni, toro, and fish eggs: I forgot the name of this roll but it was $ and the best dish out of everything we hadAnd for dessert the coffee caramel jello pudding and green tea white chocolate: Both lackluster at $ eachSo why would I turn into the Hulk you ask since the food was just mediocre? It was our waitress who, though we were told they would bring the Happy Hour items to us since we ordered them in advance, gave us grief over one of the rolls. She only brought out  hand rolls ( I had  hand rolls and my friend had  hand rolls) and so when we inquired about the spicy scallop handroll, she pulled up the tag that the bar waitress wrote and said we didn't place an order for it. Here's the thing:IF we're lying (which we're not), why don't you just add the roll on anyway, isn't that what good service is all about? Why argue over a $ hand roll?IF we were telling the truth (which we were), then that means someone dropped the ball, so just add the handroll on and don't make a big deal about it. She continued to argue with us about this one handroll, since Happy Hour had past, so we just told her to forget about it. Thankfully, another waitress overheard and just brought it to us. Another thing that made me want to turn into the Hulk is that I paid $ for their Sencha tea, and wanted a refill. The waitress said that would be another $. So I told her to just give me hot water instead, to which she replied that she would have to charge me $ for a pot of hot water!?! Seriously?!? So after flagging down another waitress, I got my hot water. Everything with our waitress had to be a battle, and I didn't like her condescending tone such as ""well I like the desserts here,"" when I told her that we didn't like our desserts since the soy caramel tasted like a cheap pudding, and the macha white chocolate tasted like flavorless crouton squares mixed with a weird tasting white chocolate pudding. I didn't finish my dessert, and she knew this, and didn't offer to replace it or take it off of the bill. Then, AFTER we had finished our meal she brought out the Omakase tasting menu and told us that we could have ordered the $ Omakase that basically had what we ordered, but more stuff, and would be cheaper. Really?!? Just to rub it in. Why didn't she bring out the menu in the beginning? As a waitress, she did an extremely poor job in informing us, as well as serving us. Hence, I'm thankful that I don't turn into a large green Hulk monster when I'm angry, because goodness knows, this experience would have triggered it. A friend and I decided to check out Pabu's happy hour. Since they just opened and this was the first time we had been there, we had lots of questions. The staff was friendly and informative. Carlo the bartenda, Morgan our waitress, Giana and Marco the runners who brought the food all were very helpful. We decided to try some of the signature cocktails  the American Mammoth Jack and the Summer were really good, the Fuzzy was too bitter for my taste, but the presentation was fun. The food was all good, we had some handrolls, pork buns, fried chicken, and skewers and while we did enjoy them nothing really stood out, until we ordered the Bloomsdale spinach. We were both in love with the spinach, the sesame seeds and sweet dressing on it were amazing  we ordered a second serving it was so good. Since they are so new they are still working out some kinks, but overall we enjoyed our experience. Came here a couple days ago and had such a great time, the bar atmosphere was incredible and the dining room was buzzing with energy. Ordered Amberjack and Giant Clam sashimi which was plated beautifully and tasted so fresh. The grilled squid, okonomiyaki, beef tongue, spinach goma ae and Robata that followed the sashimi were equally delicious. Stuart the Master Sake Somm found the perfect carafe for me to go along with my dinner. I will definitely be back for more! Hello happy hour!Popped in to check out HH & weren't disappointed! The food is hands down delicious, the service is top notch & the Earth cocktail is total wow. The happy hour menu can be viewed on the website & the standouts were definitely the spicy tuna & scallop hand rolls(both were very mild & could have had some extra spice) which were incredibly fresh. The fried chicken was moist & delicious too. The pork bun & chicken skewers were good but not standout amazing. The happy spoon was wow. . & that's coming from someone who doesn't like oysters!The Earth cocktail was great too. Not a cheap HH @ $ later. . . granted we had  cocktails @ $ea. . . . but it was delicious all the same. The staff were all very polite & well versed with their eye contact which I must admit made us feel very welcomed. What an AMAZING experience. I've eaten dinner at Pabu  times ( social and  business) and I was so impressed with the consistency of excellent food, presentation, and service. The bar is a really fun atmosphere and great to go early so you can try their specialty drinks. The diversity of the menu is another key advantage of this restaurant. From the tasting menu to sushi to ridiculously good small and large plates. I highly recommend the: Madai sashimi Fried Chicken (didn't expect to see it on the menu and the two nights we had it, both groups thought it may be the best they've ever had) Miso Glazed Black Cod Wagyu beef and Lobster Negitoro roll (best roll I've ever had!)I can't wait to go again! Pabu far exceeded our expectations. Service was top notch. The cocktails were out of this world  I had the ""Summer"", sake with pickled strawberry juice and fresh squeezed lemon. . . omg! The MONTEREY SQUID OKONOMIYAKI with pork belly and sunny side egg was out of this world. And I could have had two extra orders of the PORK GYOZA. The desserts topped off an incredible meal. Pabu offers a dining experience you will not forget. Treat yourself! Crowd pleaser menu, outstanding ingredients, fully priced, served in a hellhole of a Financial District social venue. Nice to have a dinner capable restaurant open up on this block. Recommend very strongly for Happy Hour. Also recommend strongly for the private rooms, particularly for large corporate groups. Recommend against for regular dinner. Here's my dinner impression:+ Excellent ingredients (although, you know, ""from Tsukiji"" for sushi is a bit like saying ""from the New York Stock Exchange"" for equities)+ Preparation is fine. Nothing that really stood out. Expect many menu items built around crowd pleaser ingredients like miso & sweet soy glaze. + Big open space+ Generally attentive staff, they're working out the opening kinks nicely. + Hitachino Ale on tap. Have I seen that anywhere else? Big loud space, music and all Uncomfortable, close table positions with poor server flow Considering the above, rather preposterous pricing Sequencing is off. For our meal, a pan fried okonomiyaki dish showed up prior to completion of the raw items.  Also: Okonomiyaki? RLY? MJD? Yelp 生息の中国系アメリカ人もビックリ！I do think it's a great Happy Hour venue though:+ Surprisingly reasonable pricing for snacks and drinks, considering ingredient quality+ Big, open, loud, fun space. And the private room out back is a nice touch. Not too many options for group dinner venues like that. Treat for your eyes, not so much your mouth. Great place if you: ) want to impress your date or ) don't know what to do with your disposable income. Restaurant is spacious and designed beautifully. Service was on par with any other Michael Mina restaurant  superb and attentive. Most memorable of the evening were the Happy Spoon starter and cocktails. The octopus salad and rest of the tasting menu were anticlimactic. I would come again for the bar experience. Well what to say when so expected. We reserved for .  pm to be seated at  pm but at the bar. We have asked to be at a table. We got it but close to a so noisy group of  noisy people. Ouch. Not delectable experience. Let's talk about the only great experience: our waitress Nowell she was amazing . Now tasting menu: boring boring Michael Mina. Same same you expect a surprise at every dish ( for $ + $ for the wagyu) yet nothing. Just a boring repetition of fish rather than a sample of the menu. Thanks god we got the wagyu which at least was cooked or not but different. Dessert was great. Not an amazing experience, not a culinary trip for Michael Mina. Everyone, just keep your other Asian places, much better and much cheaper. Nothing to blow your mind away but the  dollars bill for three of us. Even the restrooms have to be shared with other and through a smelling kitchen. NEXT nothing original nor tasty enough here to be branded Michael Mina. Certainly disappointing when you have experienced the rest of him. Well. I wanted to write a review while i still have my thoughts fresh in my mind from the awful culinary experience i had yesterday night. Boy oh boy was this place a disappointment. .  stars? Why don't we knock that down to  stars, maybe . . This is only because of the drinks/serviceOk. So let's start off by saying this PABU means pub in Japanese. And that is all this place is really good for. Their drinks. If this was strictly a bar? I would give this place  stars. Drinks were fantastic, huge selection of Japanese Whiskey (although a bit pricey), the selection was there. I had the Yakuza .  and my fiance had one of their signature drinks and then another whiskey drink which she loved. This place is also one of the only places i have ever seen Hitachino White Ale on tap. Service was good, drinks were fantastic, and then we come to the food.  STAR! if i could give it no stars i would. This sushi was an absolute joke. We saw the menu and was like $ dollar Omakase sushi,  pieces, Michael Mina Restaurant. How bad could it be? Well It was freaking AWFUL! They should be ashamed to be serving sushi of that quality for a Michael Mina Restaurant. Their sell was we have our fish sourced from tsukiji fish market in Tokyo. the slices of fish were small, not creative, under seasoned. So let's just talk about their rd course with all the Tuna. So on the menu it reads Otoro, which is supposedly the fattiest of the Tuna's, maybe the chef thinks we are amateur sushi eaters but my god, at least cut the darn thing right. How could you serve us that junk? Our fish and you will be able to tell by the photo, had a HUGE TENDON IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FISH. What kind of sushi chef would serve that piece and call it Otoro? Sushi chefs i know would've been like this is not a good piece, i can't serve it. For any sushi lover, DO NOT COME HERE FOR SUSHI IT WILL BE A HOLE IN YOUR POCKET AND YOU WILL LEAVE unsatisfied. Just don't come here for sushi, there are so many other good sushi joints in SF that this one shouldn't even make your top . So, how can you improve on your sushi quality?? Well to start, once can source better fish. Don't serve fish, call it Otoro and not have it be quality. People don't mind paying up for good food. The Shabu? Instead of bringing out one small pot, maybe each person should get a pot, or just two pots per couple. I could go on, but i digress. Just come here for the drinks and only drinks, from what i hear about their Ramen and everything else? Just Mediocre and not quality especially for the price your paying. So what's the appeal of this place? Well it sure was a place to be seen, it reminds me of a LA restaurant where the who's who is in the restaurant. For example Barry Bonds was sitting in a both right next to us with Michael Mina and Chef Ken Tominaga walking around and greeting him constantly, i mean i guess it's Barry Bonds. Industry insiders walking around and trying out the food. This is now officially the new Slanted Door, for me great drinks, awful food (for the price), great service, and the new place to be seen in town and probably take clients too. p. s.

Pabu 1|4.0|Japanese in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|188|1|4.42307692308|" I have been wanting to try Pabu since reading about their recent opening.  I finally went last night for dinner.  It was a great experience! Starting with the ambiance and their interior décor, very open, bright and soothing on the bar/lounge side.  That's where I dine yesterday evening.  It's modern with a bit of vintage touch if you pay attention.  The vintage part is subtle.  Here are what I indulged with last night:.   glasses of Jokigen Junmai Ginjo  refreshing, crisp, perfect for a sunny, breezy afternoon.  Happy Spoon  read good reviews about it and saw the photos on yelp, it fulfilled my expectation.  It's an interesting combination of the ingredients and they compliment each others well. .  Monterey Squid Okonomiyaki  another delicious and interesting combination of the ingredients, I didn't taste the squid much, perhaps the pork belly overpowered the squid's flavor, very flavorful.   Hamachi Sashimi  very fresh, great even without soy sauce, but I still paired them with wasabi.  Will definitely go back for their Omakase sashimi tasting. .  Crispy Flounder  I love the crispy fish head, bones, and the tail more than the fried fish fillets.  The fillets were not crispy.  The crispy fish head, bones and the tail were very flavorful.  It came with a bowl of rice that looked like Hijiki brown rice, delicious!.  Soy Caramel Custard  dessert of the night, both the soy caramel custard and the sesame candy (more like sesame shortbread crumbs) are very tasty and the refreshing coffee jelly complimented the custard and the sesame candy by lightening the sweet/richness a bit.  .  Love the artisan ceramic cups and the Eva Solo coffee carafeOverall it was pleasant experience.  I'm planning to go back soon to try the other items on their menu. Wow  what an amazing dining experience!  I dined at Pabu last night and it was an incredibly journey of exciting flavors and evocative presentations.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable of the menus and took the time to walk us through the wide range of options and presentation styles as well as the unique whiskey tasting.  The cocktails were sublime  I started with a refreshing exotic combination of gin, lavender and citrus.  The wasabi salt rim and beautiful ice cube containing a fresh lavender sprig were representative of the thoughtful and intriguing touches that we experienced as we continued to explore the cocktail menu throughout our meal.  My husband enjoys whiskey but was not familiar with Japanese whiskies and our server suggested one that has opened his eyes to a whole new world of whiskey!The combination of flavors and textures in all our dishes was fantastic.  We started with the yuzu kanpachi and the sweet miso octopus which were both delicious.  From there we dabbled in a few of the robatayaki and tempura dishes.  Tempura can often be disappointing if overly battered, but the dueling tempura was perfection  lightly coated with a thin crispy batter, the tender inner fish and veggies were bursting with flavor.  A few standout entrees included the crispy flounder and the miso black cod.  The presentation of the flounder is incredibly creative  the entire fish was deep fried and served as the ""bowl"" which the delectable chunks of flounder sat in.  Again the innovative twists like an accompanying dipping sauce with fresh ground daikon really elevated the food.  The miso cod melted in your mouth and was served over a bed of crisp green and yellow beans with a velvety mustard sauce.  The space is gorgeous and attention to detail is evident at every turn.  Pabu is a truly unique Japanese dining experience here in the Bay Area and well worth checking out. This review is for the bar servers. It was :pm on a Friday afternoon. It was a girls happy hour. I ordered a martini, and my other girl friends decided to order a bottle of Rosé. Ordering a bottle was our biggest mistake. It took literally  minutes to get the bottle, I see our lady server just talking away with another server with our bottle in her hands. Our server showed us the bottle and went across the bar. She handed it to the other lady to open it which took another  minutes. The lady who opened the bottle poured a small amount on a glass for the other server to taste it and it is all down hill from here. Hm. . . I thought the server should pour a little wine to the customer's glass? That made me shake my head. Our server poured the wine in our glasses, one of the glasses were dirty and I told the server the glass is dirty.  It took another  minutes for them to figure out what to do with the dirty glass with wine. . . at this time. . . I am irritated. Bottom line is. . . servers at this kind of up scale establishment should be well versed to how to serve a bottle of wine to their customers. Clearly these  ladies have no idea how to do it. Shame to Michael Minna and Ken Tominaga to hire staff that are not well trained. Oy, I don't even know where to start. . . Mr. J and I had friends visiting from overseas.  We thought it would be awesome to take our guests to the newly open Pabu.  (Try to think of it now, it was quite a bold move)  So, a reservation for four at the sushi bar was made. I was happy to see Chef Michael Mina and Chef Ken Tominaga there when we arrived at the restaurant.  Our seats were great since they were literally next to them.  Both chefs were so friendly and nice.  I even got a picture of them together!  Because it was opening week, many chefs from the Michael Mina Group were spotted.  We had the pleasure of meeting Adam Sobel, Executive Chef of RN. To make things easier, we decided to go with the tasting menu.  The first two courses were perfect.  But, the following nigiri sets were beyond disappointment.  When I sit at a sushi bar, I expect my nigiri to be served individually in front of me.  Otherwise, I could just sit at a table.  The first set of  nigiri were served  and  together, fine.  Then, I don't know if our chef got lazy or what.  The following  sets were served  nigiri at a time, on a plate, as if he would to a table.  The sushi rice was not good, some were even undercooked.  Some of the nigiri doesn't even look appealing enough for you to want to eat them.  I cannot feel the chef's appreciation of these high quality ingredients through his work.  What a waste!  I was baffled when they gave us only one pot for our shabu shabu course.  I mean, shouldn't you get your own individual pot for the ""tasting menu""?!  Not to mention, the four of us were sitting at the bar, next not across from each others.  We had to ask them for a second pot so each couple can share one.  The biggest surprise (in a good way) was probably the dessert.  When I first saw the menu I was like. . .  Hmm, ok, sorbet, huh!?  But, the combination of cherry sorbet, peach, sparkling sake, almond and shiso was brilliant.  I love me a good cup of green tea after a Japanese meal.  And, I have never seen green tea being served with sugar!I really, really want to like Pabu.  But, with our recent experience, it is unlikely we'll return for another meal.  Maybe we'll come back for a cocktail or two though at this hip, trendy place! So. . . to follow up with my previous review from the fantastic pre opening dinner that I was fortunate enough to attend at Pabu, tonight we ventured back to the city for the full course!And, just as I had anticipated, it did not disappoint on any level. In fact, it exceeded all my expectations. The meal was absolutely fantastic and I know that Pabu will be a place I become very, very, VERY familiar with as time goes on. This place has limitless potential, and judging by how busy it was on a Wednesday night, it will be a VERY successful place for years to come. Some of the wonderful items I had tonight were the Happy Spoon, Grilled Squid, Miso Octopus and Okonomiyaki as starters. Then some of the yakitori items, chicken thigh, heart, tail (who knew tail was so ridiculously amazing?!), and beef tongue. Each item was absolutely wonderful, cooked to perfection with amazing flavor and melted in your mouth. Also had the crispy flounder which was excellent. Nothing better than eating some really crunchy fish bones!!Wanted to mostly try new things, so didn't venture into the sushi. However, I am an  year veteran of Hana. . . so I know Ken's sushi front to back. I know how unbelievably wonderful it is, and I could tell just by looking at people's plates that Ken's sushi would continue to be just as amazing at Pabu. Dessert was also fantastic. . . had the Sake roll cake which was splendid. So light, but with so many wonderful flavors. Also had the Pabu chocolate which was a wonderful cross between a Green Tea ice cream and a pudding with awesome little sweet green tea crouton cookies of sorts. Everything was just sublime. . . the food, the atmosphere, the service. I could not have left any happier. Can absolutely see myself becoming a veteran of Pabu as well. Said it once and I'll say it again, ANYTHING Ken touches is absolute gold! The man is an absolute master at his craft. I have to say, being here for the first time already was a wonderful experience.  I entered here as a group of three and the seating was pretty quick.  I really like the atmosphere of this place being both classy but comfortable.  This would he a great place to enjoy a night with friends and have a couple of drinks. I have to say this place just be the best customer service I've seen.  Since this is our first time at this restaurant, the server took the time to explain to us the menu and dishes they would recommend.  It definitely made the choice a lot easier.  Also, throughout the night, they always came back to check on whether we needed anything.  Even though they had a pitcher of water at the table, they would poor water for us when they see that our cup may be just half full.  As the food, I think it was pretty fresh and taste pretty good.  The portions are small though and it can be pretty pricey.  I think the food is worth the try but may not he a place I would come if I was super hungry.  But, probably good food to accommodate you have while you sit back, relax, and have a few drinks with friends. Back for a second try.  Stars are just not enough. Everything is a work of art. They must have an aquarium in the kitchen the sushi is so fresh. The flying fish sashimi was so beautifully presented I did not want to eat it but I did. Delicate and wonderful taste. Losing weight and having the best food  I can imagine. The Ken and Michael decadent diet. I literally work RIGHT across the street from Pabu, so I've known for a very long time that I needed to try here.  What's more is that I've really made an attempt to re engage in finding a really solid Japanese food restaurant that I love.  When I heard that Pabu would be offering sushi, I was excited! But then I saw the menu, and then got seriously confused. What kind of restaurant is Pabu exactly? Is it an izakaya? A traditional place that serves large entrees? A sushi bar? A shabu shabu house? Well to answer all of it, it's Yes. I made a reservation here the second day they were opened, and I walked in feeling like I was in a super trendy (and bougie) restaurant in LA.  It was definitely a place where ""being seen"" would have been totally accurate. Our server was definitely nervous, and we made his life easier by ordering two of the whiskey cocktails off their celebrated menu. Greg was largely unimpressed with the Pabu Sour, which focuses around the Nikka coffee grain whiskey, and my I Have To Go cocktail was basically me pouring in my housemade yuzu soda into a glass with whiskey at my own discretion.  No instruction on how to do this, just ""here you go! pour away!"" um wut? help. SOS. In between all of this, deciding on what to order was the biggest challenge.  With so much going on, it's easy to just give up and say, ""sure! i'll try all the things by getting the tasting menu"". I almost fell for it and had to get reeled back in and reminded that it was only Wednesday night.  Did I want sushi? Yes. Did I want the robatayaki? Yes. Did I want to feel full? Yes. So after all that, we decided that ordering a few small hot dishes, some robatayaki, and some nigiri sushi was the best way to go. Things got kicked off with the Tokyo Fried Chicken Karaage.  The taste of this was very similar to that of Izakaya Yuzuki, where the batter is light, and not overly greasy.  Still though, Izakaya Yuzuki's version tasted just slightly better, but this was definitely delicious.  Moving on, we Maitake Mushroom Tempura, and I also enjoyed this (catching my theme here? I love fried stuff!).  The mushrooms were meaty, and battered just enough so that when you dipped it in the sauce, it was delicious.  This was followed by Pork Gyoza, and while the plating was beautiful, at the end of the day, it was really just gyoza.  Next came the Tsukune and Negima skewers.  The tsukune was good, but the negima was average.  The raw egg that came with the tsukune was a nice touch, and really helped elevate the chicken.  Finally came the sushi; a  piece sampling that sets you back $.  Going into this, I was thinking that this really needs to have a ""such wow, so delish"" factor, where I'd put in the category of my recent experience at Ichi.  The result was that I was a little let down.  Sure the fish was good, and there's no arguing that it was definitely fresh.  The shari, however, was a) small and b) tasted like it had been sitting at the bottom of the rice bucket all day so it was a little hard.  I was disappointed to say the least. Things ended with the Pabu Chocolate, and to be honest, this was outstanding.  Between the chicken karaage and this dessert, it was definitely worth the calories. It was like eating one of those Match Kit Kat bars you find in Tokyo, and then when you discovered the bottom of the bowl is lined with Plum and Sake Jam, you feel like you've found a pot of gold.  Dessert didn't make up for the sushi's shortcomings, but at least I walked away feeling happy. The overall consensus for this is that I think Pabu is trying to do too much.  In my opinion, I think it tries to do too much and cater to too many types of people (which is likely intentional given the location and the clientele they're after).  I suppose the fact that it's Michael Mina says that you should expect to pay a serious price for what you're about to eat, but I just couldn't wrap my mind around why spending $/person that night was well worth the money.  I will be back to visit here for The Ramen Bar, and for the Happy Hour drinks. For dinner at Pabu, I'll throw it out there as an option in the event work's paying for dinner that night, otherwise, I'll pass. This place has a really nice atmosphere and very good food, but everything we tried was too small or too expensive for what you got, depending on how you look at it  the Michael Mina factor. The omakase required full table participation and didn't seem to include many of the things that we wanted to try, and not everyone wanted to be stuck with that much fish, so we opted to order a la carte instead. You're definitely paying for the ambiance; it's a very nice, comfortable, hip space and the service was very good. ""Happy Spoon"" oyster  very nice combination of flavors, with the main attractions being the oyster and uni, though the salmon roe and creme fraiche rounded it out nicely. Yuzu kanpachi  just okay. Could have used more flavor and the fish itself was sort of strangely sticky; not sure exactly what it was but the texture was off. The sashimi/carpaccio style dishes I've tried at other izakaya type restaurants were all better. Strawberry scallop  also pretty bland. Probably one scallop total, sliced up and with some tomatoes and a strawberry flavored sauce. Ocean ""foie gras""  just some cubes of monkfish liver with ponzu and green onionSquid okonomiyaki  this was probably my favorite item of the night, but again, I've had better elsewhere. Still, the pancake was nicely grilled and seasoned, and the egg on top mixed nicely with the squid and bits of pork belly. Sake steamed clams  the broth was very buttery! I enjoyed it, though some of the other people in our group commented that it was definitely heavier on the butter than you usually find at Japanese style restaurants. We decided to pass on the skewers, based on the prices and knowing that we could get better skewers at yakitori places like Kokko. Sushi  we did order some sushi items, which were all fine, but really nothing out of the ordinary. No big deal, but again, they should have been at lower prices, or done something more amazing to our taste buds!Shabu shabu  we finished up the meal with the American wagyu shabu shabu. For $ you got  oz. of meat in a *really* individual sized pot. They used a chafing fuel thing which meant that the broth wasn't very hot at all. Pretty much by the time we finished eating the dish it was getting there, but too little too late. They give you some noodles at the end to eat with the remaining broth, which is nice. None of the larger plates looked very appetizing, so we went straight to desserts, sharing the first two on the list. It's only the next day and I can't really remember what either one way, though, so I guess they weren't too memorable! Omakase included  pieces of sushi, the happy spoon, kanpachi sashimi and wagyu shabu shabu.   pieces of sushi were divided into  plates of  nigiri introduced in order from light white fishes to red to the vinegar marinated and to the fatty.  My personal preference would of been a more flavorful shari and also neta just a bit bigger.  Shari size only slightly smaller than usual omakase of sushi but that's fine if you're going to have about  different fishes.  The happy spoon had an umami balance and I can probably eat  spoons.  Sushi omakase also included a wagyu shabu shabu at the end that was very cute and small.  The wagyu was two pieces of kiriotoshi style which is small bandage sharp/scrap pieces rolled up.  It would be a tease to the customer and simply not enough to understand the deliciousness of wagyu.  I often buy at Mitsuwa in San Jose when there's a food fair and actually had steaks and shabu at home the day before, so I wasn't craving any wagyu.  I wasn't planning to have wagyu in the first place but was included in omakase.  The udon that came with the shabu was my favorite, smooth, silky and al dente.  My  year old son had the same omakase, we ordered extra pieces of uni, akami, unagi and tamago.  He's an average size  year old and ate everything.  I was surprised and thanks for the smaller shari. I also had the wine pairing which included a Chef Michael Mina Cuvee, a white and  sakes.  The sake were premium including honjozo and junmai ginjo.  I enjoyed all the wine pairing.  Wife also had omakase but  year daughter decided to go a different route.  She had the chawanmushi, okonomiyaki,  pieces of uni and  pieces of chutoro.  She was very happy.  We shared a plate of karaage, which I order at every Japanese restaurant and is my go to dish.  I found it to be too crunchy for me, I like the kind with light batter, well brined and dripping hot oil down my chin when bitten.  But it was seasoned well. Didn't have a chance to try any yakitori or large cooked dishes.  Also wanted to try a bowl of ramen next door but its not open on the weekends. Both Chef Ken Tominaga and Chef Michael Mina checked in with us several times which was nice. Staff was friendly and very attentive.  We must of had a team of at least  people serving food, serving drinks, refilling water, checking in (Chefs and managers).  Great service. Will be back to do it Izakaya style with the homies. Have to say, that I have been passing this location while they have been under construction. So when I had a chance to pick a restaurant for Saturday night, I thought of Pabu. Let me begin by mentioning I get that new restaurants have issues.  However, in this case, with Michael Mina and Ken Tominaga at the wheel one would expect better.  Mr. Mina would have been better served to walk the floor of his restaurant than to stand watching plates at the sushi bar all night.  Since we did not have reservations, we were seated in the bar/lounge area.  Believe it or not, I like that area better as it is very open to the entire restaurant and not crammed in like some other tables. Our Vegas like server came to greet us.  While very pretty, she is underwhelmingly undertrained as is most of their staff who wander around aimlessly (including their managers).  For an example. . . at a restaurant of this caliber, why must I ask for water  times AFTER our beverages arrived.  Appetizer plates remained on the table throughout the whole meal even after the manager brought over food (he did see them)  AND the server was standing doing nothing at a server station?  Why is a busboy removing plates before everyone is done?  (This is not Denny's) And why did our pretty server ask us if we wanted anything else (not offering dessert) with empty entree dishes on our table.  (I believe she might be scared to clear a table. . . poor thing).  Other questions. . . is the furniture used?  Look closely at the tables in the Bar/Lounge. . . they look as if they have been there for  years and need a paint job.  Banquettes also look dingy and stained. As for the food, we did like the meatballs with the egg. . . very interesting.  Pork Gyoza was standard.  For entrees my friend had the A Shabu Shabu and I had the Miso Black Cod.  While it was delicious, all was standard.  The cod came with approximately  beans/vegetables with it.  I love sushi, but it comes at a high cost here, even if it is brought in from Japan. As for music, it might behoove them to put on an upbeat lounge station instead of the loud music they were playing on Saturday.  I actually wanted to show my friend the other Michael Mina restaurant up the street.  When looking at the menu and the ambience it was pretty much the same.  I must admit, I miss the elegant high end glamour of Michael Mina of yesteryear.  Unfortunately, this seemed like a Vegas restaurant in San Francisco.  Finally. . . this is a new restaurant.  I hope they clean it up a great deal before Mr. Bauer and other reviewers come to visit. Came back for dinner with  of my friends after Happy Hour on Thursday.  Pabu proved to be consistent with food, drinks and service.  We had the Nigri and sushi tasting.  A M A Z I N G! .  stars rounded up to . I AM SO GLAD I FOUND YOU PABUWent as a group of four on day two of openingAmbience  terrific  beautiful placeCocktails  Really enjoyed the Meiko Onee and Pabu SourMeal  Between the four of us we ordered: Happy Spoon Oysters (must order), Yuzu Kanpachi, Ocean Foie Gras (aka ankimo. was a little smaller than ankimo i've had before), maitake mushroom tempura, gyoza, okonomiyaki, kappa maki, tokyo roll, michael's negitoro, robata tasting, crispy flounder, surf and turf, and duck. we ordered all  desserts. I'm Japanese and it was solid Japanese food with a very unique contemporary twist/flair (I would have never imagined that ikura and oysters would taste good together. . . but well. . . IT DID. ) Presentation was excellent also.  For dessert, it was delicious. It's really hard to come by delicate, not overly sweet asian style desserts in SF, but Pabu really hit it out of the park. Price  It came out to be slightly more expensive than I thought it would be, but then again it is a Michael Mina restaurant, and they were using quality ingredients. Hard to choose favorites (All were so delicious) but for sure, next time I'm back I'm going to order the happy spoon oysters, crispy flounder, michael's negitoro and the desserts.  Chef Ken Tominaga came out to greet us and made sure we were enjoying our meal. Of course everything was delicious! Thank you Tominaga san. Half star off for a few hiccups around service (hot appetizers coming before cold appetizers, drinks not coming for a good half hour), but I assume this is because they just opened. I'm hoping this will get better as they get up to speed. Things to Note: M F,   Happy Hour. Do not miss out on the Happy Spoon. That is all. Pabu in SF is a Fantastic Place to dine! Perfect located in the financial district with a beautiful decor, excellent service, great ambience, outstanding cocktails combine with the most delicious Japanese cuisine. I can't wait to be back!! I am so happy to have Pabu in the city. After spending a month in Japan earlier this year, I could only satisfy my cravings for real Japanese flavor at Hana in Santa Rosa with Chef Ken san. We are so lucky to get his food in San Francisco and with Mina Group's resources, standards, and excellent reputation this restaurant is sure to be a success. As far as food, I've been three times in the first week and already have some favorites: chicken thigh skewers, omakase nigiri (get to know Yoji san behind the sushi bar), Waygu shabu shabu (that broth! And the noodle service when you're done with the swishing is a great touch), and every single one of the desserts (seriously, just get all of them when you order). With experience at RN and Michael Mina, these guys knew to design a big happy hour and walk in area for their FiDi guests. The bar is huge and has plenty of space to handle a busy after work crowd. However the beautiful dining room and enclosed patio room also accommodate those important family, business, or otherwise more formal occasions. Staff has excellent knowledge of the product and cultural relevance, and are excellent at guiding anyone through the menu which is authentic yet approachable. Can't wait to go back! This is the best Japanese restaurant in US! Starting from the people working there to the food is unbelievable! All the food is so fresh and perfectly executed. All the employees are well trained and knowledgeable. The interior is absolutely fabulous and the bar is so sexy. Can't wait to go back. When you go to a Michael Mina restaurant, you should already know what you're getting yourself into. One. Expensive. Meal. So you better call your sugar daddy or sugar mama. Or, if you're like me, you go on a top ramen diet for a week and splurge on a meal. Ok, it's more like having Mr. Amex giving me the finger at the end of the month but whatever, YOLO! Just don't tell my Chinesey mom that. Opening earlier this week, Pabu (from Michael Mina and Ken Tominaga of Hana) serves high end sushi, izakaya, robatayaki, and shabu shabu. They also offer an omakase menu and A miyazaki wagyu at $/ounce. I've had mixed experiences having visited  Michael Mina several times, RN, and Bourbon Steak so we took an conservative approach by sticking with the robatayaki (best value on the menu) and sampling some of the sushi then heading over to Ramen Bar next door for a ramen finisher. I recommend this approach if you want to avoid racking up a huge bill and to also kill two Mina birds with one stone. Pabu's standouts are their Japanese inspired cocktails and robatayaki. They have an extensive booze menu and if you're a whiskey drinker, you will be pleased with their Japanese whiskey and whiskey based cocktail selection. I had the Tree ($) and the American Mammoth Jack ($). My iphone deleted my picture, but the Tree cocktail was crafted with espolón blanco tequila, green chartreuse, avocado wasabi cordial & shiso sugar while the American Mammoth (bit. ly/tvruK) was crafted with bulleit bourbon, peach shrub, honey, lemon juice & ginger beer. Both were fantastic, balanced, and damn tasty. ~ * ~ R O B A T A Y A K I ~ *~*Butabara: pork belly ($)*Tsukune: chicken meatballs ($)*Gyutan: beef tongue ($)*Bonjiri: chicken butt ($)*Kokoro: chicken heart ($)Platter #: bit. ly/roxoR and Platter #: bit. ly/mbGDjdLightly seasoned then grilled over hot coals, the robatayaki skewers we sampled were solid and comparable to Izakaya Sozai and Izakaya Yuzuki. The tsukune is a must order! The mouthful of balls were succulent and the jidori yolk added a luscious creaminess to it. The butabara and bonjiri were deliciously rich. My least favorite was the gyutan which was chewy. From the hot plate section, we only sampled the Maitake mushroom tempura ($) which I would skip: bit. ly/mnZGsn. Solid tempura should be light and crunchy, this mushroom tempura was on the soggy side. ~ * ~ S U S H I ~ * ~*Hamachi ($): bit. ly/zajgw*Umimasu ($): bit. ly/VHOZWJ*Ankimo ($): bit. ly/ouREn*A Wagyu ($): bit. ly/VhNOfU*Otoro (MP): bit. ly/ovro*Tamago ($): bit. ly/jng*Ken's Roll w/ shrimp tempura, avocado & spicy tuna ($): bit. ly/VHSBYHThere's no denying that the quality of the fish is pristinely fresh but to compare them with other high end sushi places in SF like Akiko's, Maruya, Kusakabe, and Wako, I thought the nigiri at Pabu was mediocre and the prep was standard. The shari (sushi rice) was a tad underseasoned (just a personal preference). I'm used to seeing high end sushi bars top their nigiri with special housemade sauces and accoutrements (since no soy or wasabi are usually provided). For example, Kusakabe soy cures their toro and cold smokes some of their fishes while Maruya tops their nigiri with smoked green tea salt or brushes it with housemade ponzu to give it a special twist. Nonetheless, do order their Otoro as it was buttery goodness from the sea. I rarely order jive ass rolls (coined by the infamous Nobu K. ) but I saw that Ken's Roll was highlighted on Yelp at Chef Tominaga's restaurant, Hana in Rohnert Park so we had to order that and it was one of the best rolls I've had. The tempura shrimp was freshly fried so it was still warm and crunchy. The roll was neatly and tightly wrapped and the spicy tuna had a nice fiery heat to it. Considering it is grand opening week, the entire Pabu staff was wonderful. The hostesses had a smile on their face, our waitress was knowledgeable of the menu and attentive, as were the sushi chefs, and the busboys kept our water glasses filled and quickly cleared empty plates. During dinner, Michael Mina and Chef Tominaga were overseeing food orders. There were some timing issues with the kitchen but that was to be expected since they just opened. Pabu's large, contemporary space is filled with wooden furnishings. There's a separate bar area perfect for happy hour, a fairly sizable dining area with booths, and more private enclosed corner tables for large groups. We sat at the sushi bar so we can watch the sushi chefs in action. Too bad Chef Tominaga was not behind the sushi bar as I've heard good things about him. Valet parking is available but metered street parking can be found before  pm. I no longer work in the area but I would come back to try more of those buzztastic cocktails like the Mr. Miyagi. Wax on. Wax off. Carry on. Home run!  Ambience, food, service all perfect. Pabu is in my office building so I invited my boyfriend to try it out tonight. We were not disappointed. Summer cocktail (with one giant ice cube!) was delicious. We loved the cod and the sushi was clearly very fresh. Impeccable service. My favorite thing was the soy caramel custard with coffee jelly  so unique! There are no words to explain the flavors of PABU and The Ramen House. We went there around .  and the atmosphere was perfect. Pabu sits in the center of several high rises in San Francisco, so the ambiance of glass and concrete and steel , and the sounds of the City and valet was perfect beginning to what was to become. There was so much going on  that made the experience. But lets get right to business here, the food. Ken recommended Pabu's Surf and Turf.  This consisted of Wagu A Beef and lobster tail, glazed with Uni . Like I said above, There are no words to explain the flavors of this dish. This is hands down my favorite out of the other dishes we had here, but they all we so damn good!Oysters! and Japanese white ale beer!  Michael's spicy tuna, salmon eggs, and Unit ! Wagu A Shabu shabu! melts in your mouth!Wagu beef and Lobster! OMG / LOL from the flavors!Sushi was so fresh and good like as if I was in Tokyo at the Tsukiji Fish Market. Last words. I'll be back. . . . I think about Pabu and the food at least x daily. This place ruined me. absolutely amazing! i have been a big fan of chef ken for a long time and am so happy to have him closer to home even through the drive to rohernet park was ALWAYS well worth it!  everything is spot on, the happy spoon is a MUST.   the outdoor space reminds me a little of NYC  which is a great addition to downtown SF! cannot wait to become a regular. I was so fortunate to have been invited to attend the Grand Opening preview of the new PABU in San Francisco and it's spectacular! Not only is the space incredibly beautiful and well designed, but the food. . . wow! Being from the Bay Area, I am a huge fan of both Chef Mina & Chef Tominaga. This will be the spot to go to when it opens  fresh fish that is expertly prepared, cocktails that really emphasize quality ingredients and a staff that is there to ensure you have only the best time (and are extremely knowledegable, by the way, and help you navigate the large menu)! If this is them ""practicing"", they have a bright future and I can't wait to get back up there to visit them again when it's open! Went to pre opening and we where not disappointed at all. Mina group never ceases to amaze me, great service, great food. The food is great full of flavor and great presentation, the drinks are original and unique to the season. The staff is very knowledgable and friendly . I will be back again and again. The food is amazing! I love food so I know food. If I say it is amazing, it is amazing. Cocktails are awesome. I love the summer cocktail. We have variety of appetizers and shabu shabu. The staff are friendly and very helpful. Incredible ambiance, service, and of course food. I went with three friends and it was one of the better dining experiences I've had in recent memory. Went to a pre opening dinner and this is definitely a place to check out if you love great Japanese food. It has everything from sushi to Shabu. We didn't try the shabu but everything was amazing and they are just getting started. There's a great dish with a fried egg on top with pork and squid, I think. Definitely worth getting. When I first got there the staff were getting ready for the evening. I went to the restroom and a chef was checking himself out and prepping his outfit. I didn't think much of it until I realized it was Michael Mina getting ready to crush it. We'll definitely be back and this place will be hot."|2|93|1|Routine| Improper reheating of food  [ date violation corrected: 11/3/2014 ]
Pesce Seafood Bar 0|3.5|Seafood in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|171|0|3.5652173913|" Moving right along. Original and now a classic: youtube. com/watch?v=MMR…Original and now closed: yelp. com/biz/pesce san f…Returning to check out their new space has been high on my list. Initially disappointed when our friendly waiter broke the news they were out of homemade chicken sausage. Time to move on again. Smoked salmon tartine with cheese, onion, capers and arugula and indulgent buttery biscuit with homemade berry jam was a delicious destination. Both were more food than expected and made the $ price seem worthwhile. Light paint, dark wood accents and minimalist lighting represented a nice revamp from the previous incarnation. Plan to visit again for the sausage and dinner. Should be a good move. I came to Pesce when they were relatively new. I had a heavenly meal. I had Short Ribs and my friend had the lamb and we loved it. And I mean that we really thought this was a great restaurant. I went back today. Their menu seemed to be dumbed down a little but i could still find good things. Both my starter and entree choice were not available. OK. I get it. So i ordered the steak. The steak was chewy and tasteless, and the fries were disgusting. I would have enjoyed McDonalds more. I understand how difficult it is to run a successful restaurant, but when you compromise the quality of your food so badly then you become just another Castro shit hole with a pretty face. That sounds harsh but I was really disappointed. It was a place I really welcomed and hoped would be my go to place. Now I feel ripped off! $ for a glass of wine and a meal that MacDonalds could have done better!I never post here, because i get how pleas need to survive and thrive. But this is such a drop in quality and I paid $ for it so I feel compelled to warn people. If you want poor for in a mediocre atmosphere go here. A month ago my review would have been that the for and service were amazing.  Wht happened? this place looked really impressive at first glance.  we walked past the restaurant on our way to Anchor on Castro.  After looking inside and looking at the menu, we decided we would come back and try this place sometime.  When we got to Anchor, the wait was insane, so we figured, hey, let's go try that new place we walked past.  I have to say, the space was really, really nice, and the service was great.  unfortunately, the food was not up to snuff.  ordered three things: grilled octopus, seafood and shellfish risotto, and cioppino.  all of them seemed a bit one dimensional in terms of flavor.  the pulpo was overwhelmingly lemony.  also i think the octopus was cut a bit too thin so you didn't really get the full flavor of the octopus.  the risotto tasted mainly of cream, instead of being infused with seafood flavor, so i'm guessing they cooked the rice in some sort of cream base rather than a seafood stock.  dont' get me wrong, i like creamy risotto but not with seafood.  also, the cioppino really fell flat.  the broth was lackluster and didn't seem to have any fennel, which I think really makes cioppino cioppio rather than shellfish thrown in tomato soup.  like other reviewers have said, not sure how long this place will last in this prime spot on market.  oh well. I love this restaurant. I've been here with one other person and with a party of eight. Everything I've tasted has been delicious. All the fish is wonderful, but so is the pasta, risotto, steak and braised lamb shank. There is something here for everyone. The biggest problem with this place is the noise. I'm surprised so many people complained about the service, because it was actually one of the highlights for our last visit. I went with a group of four, and it was so busy that we had to be seated in the back not a problem since it was very loud in the main area and the back room seating offered some solace. My husband and I split the arugula salad and our friends split a Caesar with kale. The salads were way too salty. Definitely going to pass on them next time. The quality of the vegetables were exceptional, so it is a shame they had to kill off that flavor with a mountain of salt. I had the angus steak and my husband had calamari and swordfish. He seemed very happy with his dishes and the steak was cooked with precision to medium rare. It was absolutely delicious. The tiramisu was fabulous. ""Remember that restaurant in the Castro called Pesce?""  That is what we're going to be saying in about a year and a half.  At first glance, the new restaurant remodel has brightened up the place.  The cheap, brown, bent wood stools at the bar seem out of place for the white interior.  Perhaps they are temporary; but, they are the first thing you see.  I ordered a drink for my partner and we were ""coaxed"" to our table. As soon as I opened the menu, I remarked, ""We're not getting out of here without spending $. ""  The food, for what it is, is expensive and not all that creative.  Small dishes, and nothing outstanding.  Servings, pictured in the other reviews are not representative of the presentation which looks cluttered and piled, or slopped, onto the plate. Unless we get a ""really"" cheap Groupon, we're probably not going there again. A group of us decided to check out Pesce during Dine About Town week(rated top  out of the DAT participants). I ultimately decided to order off the regular menu as I didn't find the DAT menu appealing. I also immediately noticed they had a large selection of smaller dishes allowing me to construct a diverse meal. The Pappardelle(wide noodles, braised duck in a porcini tomato sauce) was lip smacking good and the Bistecca(grilled black angus steak, garlic fries) was solid but our other dishes were just pedestrian. My cocktail(Winter Smash) had a generous rye pour and was tasty as were the desserts we had shared(Budino Warm bread pudding with vanilla gelato, Tiramisu, Milk & Cookies, and the Biscotti e Vin Santo. The ambiance was sophisticated and the service was on par with this level of establishment. I noticed their happy hour menu which runs  days a week(with shorter weekday hours) looked very solid. True rating: .  stars Been here for dinner before but this was first time at brunch today. Between us we had the poached eggs on polenta cakes and the fried eggs on braised pork hash.  Both were wonderfully prepared. I was surprised that the restaurant wasn't more crowded as it really was delicious. .  stars After 's departure, the Castro has never been the same. Pesce tries to fill in that void. It has classy decor, but still approachable. A restaurant with superb cocktails and great service. I say, forget the dining room altogether, you'll find me at the gorgeous white marble bar next time, because if there's one thing the Beretta team is known for, it's their cocktails! Being the only cocktail on the happy hour menu, the $ Georgia Porch Swing (vodka, peach, bubbly) is a nice way to ease into the night. Starving? Can't go wrong with French fries spiced with Calabrese chilies and the fried calamari. Moving onto dinner, the only memorable thing is the hamachi crudo. Between the overcooked herb crusted tonno and the bland Agnello, I was ready to call it a night. But the bf insisted on tiramisu and thank God, it's good. I opted for more cocktails because  I still had space in my tummy ; )Try the lemony Ducati with gin and flamed absinthe or their version of a Manhattan in the Focolare (mixed with Mezcal for that smokiness!) And just to prove my hunch, a great bar can make the perfect Negroni and Pesce nails it. There's much room for improvement but keep this on your radar when you're in the Castro. Hey, this neighborhood isn't just for partying anymore. Wow, I'm surprised this place hasn't gotten better reviews. I guess I forgot to post mine. I'm reviewing it now just so yelp will do a better job of showing it as an option when I search for things near the Castro (!). I've been here at least twice, maybe three times so far. The food is always fantastic. Highly recommend the hamachi crudo, I have gotten it every time and I was never disappointed. I also seem to remember liking the kale salad and the Gamberoni. So far I've only had vegetables and seafood on my visits, since those seem to be the strengths of this place. The service is always good, too, and I've been very happy with the wine choices. Drink was a bit slow to get to me. ( Minutes) The food was pretty amazing though!  Loved the tiny pizza. Food and cocktails are excellent.  The service is terrible.  Inept, unprofessional and management has no idea how to mitigate the situation with guests.  I have hopes they will fix the service so this can become a goto. A great date place. Quite noisy and the service was a little slow but the waitperson was quite pleasant (which is not always the case with restaurants in San Francisco). The cicchetti's are a great way to experience different flavors. Just the right size  all of us (party of four) sampled everything. arancini was great (delicate saffron flavor). Octopus was lovely, though some thought  it was a little over boiled. Salmon crostine was all right  not bad but but not terribly differentiated. Scalloped potatoes was delish. Bay scallops was nice  and the sauce was even better. The tuna was not bad  but I probably wouldn't order it again. I so wanted to like this place. . . Overpriced, way to loud, and have you ever been served by someone who never smiles? Came early to avoid the crush, even on a (thankfully) rainy evening, and since they say they're Venetian in influence we decided to eat at the bar. The woman on duty was quick to acknowledge us and water appeared without asking. Blackboard at bar noted oysters, beau soleil. Bien!Asked server about wine to match with oysters, gave me a taste of something she thought would go well, great wine, and poured me a glass. Then our server was replaced by a guy who couldn't have cared less. What a dullard. Took him a bit to look and see me and say 'Yes?' oh, am I bothering you, I wanted to say, but instead gave him our order. He then chatted up the barback water guy in Spanish, dishing the crowd and a co worker. Then he placed our order. At no point in our meal did he check in with us, no chatting with us, no chatting with anyone but his co workers. Overheard that he was leaving, I think, or someone was. Should be him. You represent the business, you ass, and if your face never has even a hint of smile there is no welcome in your heart. What are you doing serving people, go get a job coding. The bar filled up, our food came. Calamari good, as was Chicory salad. Note that the website menu does not match the one currently offered to you. About $.  per bite, at least for the small plates. Quasi Venetian, a bit of Cali twirl and seasoning. The hamachi has the nastiest pink peppercorns, so big the flavor overwhelms and makes your palate numb. Nice peas in the suppli, probably the best thing I ate besides the oysters, which were $.  each, a bit pricey. Deafening room, one of the worst in the city. Cheap, Crate and Barrel ish but tackier furniture. Not that many changes since  and then Jakes to the room, same layout. The staff seemed overwhelmed, judging by the crowd that crowded the doorway. Our nice woman server was there when we left our unsmiling dude server and made our way out into some lovely rain. One and done. $ bucks each,  drinks, ringing ears and crap service. Done, indeed. This place looks beautiful if you like the trend with wood and metal. To me it feels cold. The food is not memorable. Lack of personality on the floor staff. Overall a good cafeteria. Solid Dine About Town experience that gives you an appetizer and  entrees for a robust, hearty meal. I went with the raw Hamachi starter, duck papardelle, and seared tuna a spicy tomato sauce. All were well done and delicious. Nice fresh pieces of Hamachi served with a few greens made for a simple yet tasty dish. The duck pasta was cooked nicely with just the right amount of sauce. The tuna steak was seared medium rare like a good piece of steak and the sauce had a great kick. Ended the night with tiramisu and canoli to conclude a great meal. Ragazzi, questo posto e' BUONISSIMO! Pesce is my favorite restaurant in SF right now. I really liked their food when they were on Polk street and I was worried they might have changed negatively when they moved to Market Street in the Castro. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised: the location and the interior are better and the food is as great if not even more delicious. I love their food. I love that they have a generous happy hour for apps and drinks. I love the wine options. I love the mini apps (Chiccheti) options as an amuse bouche almost. Th quality is fantastic and the recipes are very real of the region of Venice (region of Veneto). I am from that area and am proud to see that Pesce was able to bring the original regional flavor to SF adding a modern twist to each plate. Noteworthy:Polpo app: awesome flavor, original taste from Veneto. Especially the flavor of the potatoes in the recipe, brought me back to Venice for a moment. Their vanilla and chocolate GELATO: the best in town. Heaven!And I am so glad there's not TV in here! Great bar and bartender, food is ok, dining room is a little boisterous, bistro like. Tuna medium plate was very good, and liked the aracino, pulpo was ok. Hard to find other plates that were standouts. Love this place.   We were introduced to Pesce by a friend who owns a restaurant down south who came to SF with his chef to ""do some market research"" (translation eat), and can't thank him enough!   Five visits over the course of six months and it is consistently great.  The oyster shooters are like a fresh hit of oyster followed by a shot of chunky gazpacho.  Yum.   The octopus is terrific, properly dressed and seasoned.   The tuna bolognese was delicious.   Nice wine list at a reasonable price.   The only flaw is the parking, but if you go early it's not a huge deal. Had a fantastic meal on Sunday night. Server was so nice and accommodating. The Pappardelle was perfect. The Puttanesca Pizzette was almost perfect. Surprised not to see olives, but then again, we shouldnt have been surprised as olives are not mentioned as a topping. But, the pizzette was so yummy, how could I possibly complain :) Plus, when we asked about the olives, the server offered numerous times to add the olives. But, truthfully, it was perfect without them. And the gnocchi dish was rich and luscious! Definitely making Pesce one of out standard Italian places to frequent in the Castro! I came to Pesce for restaurant week last Thursday and dined with a friend.  We had reservations and were seated without any problems.  My friend and I were seated in the side room, which was nice because it wasn't as loud (we were looking to catch up).  Interesting enough, the side room was predominantly Asian but the main dining area was more mixed  coincidence?  Anyway, my friend and I both opted for the Dine About Town menu.  I chose the hamachi crudo, braise duck pappardelle, and the lamb shank.  My friend ordered the same but switched crudo for kale salad. Love crudo in all of its forms, and hamachi was no exception.  The peppercorns and the oils were an excellent compliment, too, and it came out with three pretty decent sized pieces.  Pappardelle definitely tasted like it was made in house, the noodles were soft and wide.  The braised duck was present, but not extremely loud, so it was more subtle than anything else.  My favorite dish, though, had to have been the lamb shank.  The portion size was huge (it probably also felt this way because we'd already polished off two courses prior).  And it was deliciously tender.  The veggies seemed like they'd been braised along with the lamb shank, and the meat basically fell off the bone with such ease that I really didn't need silverware.  If these are regulars on the menu, I'm mighty impressed!  We got some bread pudding for dessert too (not on the Dine About Town menu).  Warm bread pudding (with raisins, which added a kick) and cold vanilla ice cream.  What an amazing way to end the meal. Service:  There was a bit of a wait in between the pappardelle and the lamb shank, so the waitress ended up comping our bread pudding!  We didn't even say anything.  They just felt bad for the wait so dessert was on the house.  It was lovely.  Also, the staff did a great job filling up our water. Bottom line:  Fantastic meal! (+. ) this place is such a great find! didn't except to be this awesome but all the seafood dishes are amazing. Definitely should get the bronzino! My friend and I tried this place for dine about town. We had Hamachi + mint lime shrimp for the First course, they were both pretty good especially the Hamachi was great for first course, fresh and tangy, great to start your meal. shrimp was little too big for course (nice dish with tasty grains tho but felt too much as first thing to eat, makes you full. ) . Second course, we had Tuna bolognese, and Braised duck noodle. I would not recommend Tuna bolognese  any tuna used  for this dish was wasted got too mixed up with other things in the source. but the duck pasta was super tasty I think it was nice soft home made pasta (?). The third course, we had Herb crusted tuna and lamb shank. they were both super tasty. no mistakes ordering them to make your night. I will come back this place for dinner and try more dishes. Think seafood tapas. Potions size is on the small side. You will need about   dishes to feel full. Unless you order the larger/grandi dishes which is about twice the size of the rest. I had the best scallop ($) dish to date here. The cream sauce that came with it was amazing. Make sure you mop it up with some bread. The herb crusted tuna ($) was mediocre. It was way too spicy for us. The hamachi crudo ($) was nice. Lobster spaghetti ($) was really good. Duck papardelle ($) was less impressive. Milk and cookies ($) at the end made a good finish to the meal. It comes with a small vanilla milkshake and five cookies (each in different flavor). Service was friendly and on point. Parking sucks. If that wasn't the case, I would be back soon. This was officially the worst dinner we have experienced since moving to San Francisco  years ago.  I'm not a person who usually eats a lot of salt but everything was completely under seasoned.  This is a huge mistake in my opinion. Everything tasted super bland and was drenched in tomato sauce.  The octopus was good, but I have had better. The crudo was ok. My husband said the pappardelle with duck was super bland. The tuna bolognese was ok but it tasted sweet. Normally when you add sugar to tomato sauce it's because it aren't able to cook it long enough. The lamb was tender but again no taste no flavor. The tuna was in edible. It was doused in tomato sauce and weird sauce on top. Absolutely horrible. We spent over $ with tip. What a waste! Precious, sparcely portioned food at outrageous prices. $ for  thin slices of hamachi with a ruffle of organic mâché picked by hippie orphans.  Small plates equal big check at the end.  Location is fantastic, service is fabulous and if you love precious food, this is your spot.   Precious, but unlike the film's star, tiny portioned.  If you are going to be precious, give me a serving that will fill me up.  Indicative of San Francisco's changing landscape. Had dinner here last night with some friends at the bar. We tasted a bunch of different dishes. . . The pappardelle (fantastic), the jalapeño vodka oyster shooter (the vodka was so spicy it was unbearable), the crudo plate (pink peppercorns were a neat contrast in texture), the crab Louis salad (delicious!) and several of the specialty cocktails (the Mama Mia is like drinking fire water)The layout is sparse and I would venture to say boring, but the staff was nice. Great addition to the hood. Contemporary dishes, quality ingredients, solid service, creative ingredients, always buzzing, updated decor (though a bit stark for my taste). very good Italian seafood & very good service.  Star food,  star service,  star atmosphere,  star drinks.  Before being deterred by some of the low ratings  PLEASE read the reviews (Being asked to quiet down apparently is hostile).  My favs:  Scallops are impeccable, brussels are insane (excellent), and the gnocchi is well, YUM!I miss the Enzo drink though; wish that Pear juice/vodka drink was available all the time. . . Good food but shockingly bad customer service. I went there with some friends, the atmosphere was nice and the food was good, but two things happened that really peeved me. And the restaurant's response was even worse. . For my main dish I ordered mahi mahi which was about $. They told me they were out of that fish and could substitute it with another prepared the same way, which I was fine with. Then after about  minutes someone, presumably the manager, came out and told me they were out of the replacement fish. Now all they could prepare for me was the sea bass they had on special on the menu. I really didn't want this, because it was on the bone and is generally less fish, but I accepted. However when we got the check, I was pretty shocked that they had charged us the $ for the sea bass, given that I intentionally did not want to order it because of the high price and lower amount with meat. Not cool. . The friends I was with ordered x the amount of food as me and my partner. They also ordered  rounds more drinks. We both put our credit cards on the table and I was expecting the waitress to come and ask ""should I split this down the middle?"" at which point I would see if I could gracefully put just our dishes on my card and leave the remainder for the other couple. However, the waitress came by and just swept up both cards and split it / without asking. So, after being charged a lot more for a dish I was forced to have because the one I ordered was out, and then having to front the cost of three more rounds of drinks and two courses I didn't partake in, I left feeling pretty annoyed and upset. Between the above I ended up paying about $ for the $ of food me and my partner actually consumed. It's a relatively new restaurant and since I live only a couple blocks down I felt compelled to at least try to help them out, so I thought it was important that they get this feedback to reduce frustration from future customers. However, here's the worst part. The next day I called them and spoke to the manager (Myron) to give him this feedback directly. He remembered me and remembered the incident. He asked for my name and I gladly responded thinking he would offer some kind of resolution or compensation, but he never did. He just thanked me for the feedback and hung up the phone. Seriously? Any restaurant, especially at this level, should have better customer service than that. The menu is weird. It consists of various alcoholic drinks, small servings, medium servings, large servings and pizzas, rather than the usual first course soup salad and main course. And I'm very suspicious of  the freshness of food in restaurants that offer a very long menu along the contours of Italian food. The waiter was a bit pushy with his agenda of what he wanted to steer us to order. Realizing we got the subtext he changed his demeanor for the better. For first course we ordered grilled sardines. To our shock these were not fresh but  slices of canned sardines that were fried. Canned sardines are cheap. The item was quite expensive  $ for a very small serving. And canned. . . For main course we shared a grilled fish. It was divine! Very fresh and done exactly right  not undercooked or overcooked. Its meat of high quality. . It came with potatoes and artichokes. A large serving for two cost $. The chocolate pie dessert (bearing some fancy haute cuisine name) was mundane. Not good for groupsThe atmosphere of the restaurant is better suited for groups of  or less.  Went with a large group and we were reprimanded for being too loud.  The waiter was super nice, but the service was very slowAs for the food, the brunch was not that good.  The food was in desperate need of seasonings.  It was very bland and uninspiring.  Will not go back nor recommend it. Manager did not immediately remove a clearly drunk and aggressive guest who was shouting and repeatedly threatening other guests. No respect for managers who do not care enough about the safety of their staff and guests. Will never return. Good happy hour. Wine is $ a glass of house red or white. My friend and I had the fried calamari and a oyster shooter.  The oyster shooter w/o the vodka was good. The acid from the lemon worked well with the oyster. The calamari was fried perfectly.  I will have to come back here for a meal to experience the full potential of the restaurant.   And a quick return it will be. So glad Jake's is gone!This place is a better one to inherit the  space. The brunch was very well prepared, excellent, fresh and compelling menus, good, simple, Italian (Northern) style, good service and attractive ambiance. Cocktails were really excellent, I had their ""Vespa"" (read: Vesper) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . nice. We will be back! I have been a longtime fan and love the new locations but I have to say our last trip the food was great and the service was so poor.   On our way out the three folks standing at the reception table asked we enjoyed it, and I told them the service was not up to par.  They respond really?  I said yes it was, please look over to your left and see the poor guy waving both his arms to get some service. . . . and three of you just standing there. . . .  They need to pick it up a few notches or it will ruin a great place. Update:Lenny the manager emailed me asking for details on the poor service so that he could use it to help train the staff.   I will need to go back and see if things have improved on the service side now! I'm still having dreams about the squid ink risotto. I mean wow! WOW! I couldn't quite make any decisions on what to eat. I knew that I was HUNGRY! The bartender recommended a pork pasta with some sort of flat noodle. It was good, but man, that squid ink pasta. . . I just drooled on myself. We had also purchased dessert from Hot Cookie which is around the corner. The cookie is a bit of a conversation piece. The bartender decided to bring out a candle so now my cookie was ""flaming"". Oh Castro. . . how much I love thee! You should definitely make a reservation. I walked in with my friend and the wait was about  minutes but we sat at the bar. That is my preferred seating by the way because bartenders seem to have a tad bit more fun than the wait staff. I'm excited to come back and have more wine, cocktails, flaming cookies, and most importantly, the squid ink risotto!! Great addition to the neighborhood!  Loved Pesce when it was in Russian Hill and it's even better now.  Great food, service and the new digs are vast improvement on the old space which was a bit cramped.  Current big hits for us are the bigoli tuna pasta dish and the kale Caesar, yummy! My Bf and I recently moved to SF and have been all over the place trying new restaurants and we are pretty convinced this is our favorite spot so far! Why you ask? Well it's in the Castro and it's a fun place to walk around! (We happened to stumble into this place and had no idea what we were in for)They serve small tasty tapas, Italian/Seafood style. My fave was the eggplant dish. We sat at the bar and had amazing service. We had some delicious drinks  mine was a vanilla bean cocktail and I can't remember what the BF had but he loved his too. We also enjoyed our second round but can't remember exactly what it was!We ordered the mini pizzas and we were very pleased. By far the best part was the dessert. I don't remember what is was called but it was a flaky phyllodough type of dessert with great chocolate and whipped cream. I was in San Francisco for work and this place was recommended to me by a friend.  Went in there and loved every minute of it. Its tapas style.  Which is cool but i like to eat a lot. . . . so i really had to get a lot of food which ended up being kinda pricey considering how much my buddy and i eat. The food was excellent and the server, whose name i do not know was the most attentive and likable person ever!The scallops were amazing. . . although they were a bit small and i think the plate only had  of them on there. . . . so we had to order  plates!Place is great and the food is excellent i just wish they would put more of it on your plate! If you go with the understanding that the dishes are meant to be shared, you might  have a better experience and not be surprised at how small the servings are. . . My partner and I had a :pm reservation and we were able to be seated right away even though the restaurant was packed. The host needs to work on his greeting.  He stared at me blankly while waiting for me to give him my name.  I waited for him to say ""good evening"" first and then waited again for him to ask me my name.  I don't play the ""attitude game"" too well. After we finished dealing with the drama, we were seated and met by a fun and down to earth server.  She eventually lost a star in this review because along with her playful demeanor, she proved to be incredibly absent.  Hence, the % tip. However. . . . . the food was very good. We shared everything and yes, the plates are small.  We had the following:. oyster shooters (Miyagi oysters very nice  We had one shooter each. ). arancini ( There were  small rice balls I asked for a bit of red sauce and they told me ""no, they don't need them"".  I  still think that they needed some sauce for dipping. ). scallops ( There were  of them and they were probably the best seared scallops that I've ever had!). pizza ( We shared an arugula, heirloom tomato, and  mozzarella cheese pizza.  It was VERY small.  Picture a personal pizza and you'll get the idea.  There were  tiny slices.  It was good but a tad bland, so we asked for grated cheese and that perked it up a bit. ). gnocchi with milk fed pork  ( Again, this was a very small portion but perfect for the two of us considering all of the other dishes that we just shared.  This was good.  The chunks of pork served with the gnocchi were very tender and tasty. . tiramisu and chocolate gelato  ( The tiramisu was good and not too saturated with liquids.  It held up nicely.  The gelato was ok. There is a full bar and many specialty cocktails to choose from.  We stayed with Jameson on the rocks and a Hangar One vodka martini. Dinner before taxes and the Health Tax addition came to $. . Side note the reviews are correct when they write that the restaurant is very loud. Wow this was one of the loudest places that I can think of in a long time. Granted, Pesce was completely full but the noise level is out of control.  They need sound proofing panels on the walls.  Right now, they are completely bare.  Maybe some hanging artwork would help reduce the noise too. The drunk girls next to us were literally screaming.  Thank god they left halfway through our dinner.  It looked like they were only drinking wine too  cheap dates! We only had two complaints: it's rather loud and hard to carry a conversation when busy and the benches need foot rests (we were told they were still working on this and it will be fixed).  Aside from that, a top notch date spot with pretty amazing food.  Go! I have been in many restaurants over the years.  Never have I felt so unwelcome in a restaurant.  The host and bar server were so cold and unfriendly, I left before finishing my drink and ordering my meal.  No matter how good the reputation of the chef, the front of the house staff has ruined my experience.  I will never return, and will tell everyone I know how bad the experience was. BTW, I am not a competitor trying to dish this restaurant. What a great place for brunch!Excellent service, food and ambiance. Pesce = fishA simple name for a simply delicious meal.  It was a windy Sunday eve that we arrived to a bustling restaurant, left side, bar and right side, dining. The food =  stars.  The prices, high. We shared a couple of dishes, family style:  capesante, pan seared scallops in a thick buttery and creamy saucebroccoletti, grilled broccollini with warm garlic and anchony saucerisotto de seppia, squid ink risotto, andcioppino. Cioppino was the best dish of the evening and for the price (), a health big bowl two can easily share.  Seafood was fresh ( tasted of the sea) and tender. Capesante was fantastic but for the price,  small scallops didn't warrant the cost. (). My mate swilled some Vida Rosa (which had a smoky mezcal) and Gargenga Soave, a red from Italy. Both were tasty. And for dessert:  budino, a warm apricot bread pudding with vanilla gelato, one of the best I've had. Minus one star for the uneven service. Sometimes overly attentive (getting to close to the customer is awkward) and sometimes the timing is off  getting your drink order after your food arrives. Dishes like these are best shared with loved ones.  Bundle up this winter with a visit to this fine eatery in its new home. You Have Got To Be Kidding Me.  I have paid a high price for many different dining experiences in SF, but this was the worst value. Poor service blended with small portions masked by uber rich cream sauces made for a underwhelming experience. The menu is full of dishes priced as entrees that are mere snacks with boring and expected over rich flavors. Boo. $ paid for two people to leave bored and hungry is not worth it. Find somewhere else to spend your money on better planned menus. Sterile. Flat. Expensive. Restaurant opened with little fanfare. . . . . coming into the Castro swimmingly. Once in the door. . . the ambiance and restaurant lacked character. Drinks were not as refreshing as thought. Now the kicker. . . . food. . . It didn't. Appetizers was a huge miss. . try it and you won't be able to picked up with one hand. . . bread did not hold ingredients. Should I give them time to perfect? No. . . they had no business opening if they were not ready for people paying their hard earned money into their business and the immediate neighborhood. Think twice before sauntering into Pesce. We got caught in their net. . . not a good catch. Had a Saturday brunch here with my hubby. Food was a delight. Server Gary was friendly and professional and kept our coffee full. A pleasant find. We will return here the next time in SF. PS have the Kale Ceaser. Had brunch and got the same vibe as dinner a few weeks ago. Pleasant staff and service. Food is creative and pretty good. Nice variety. Was a fan of  many years ago, and this is a nice replacement. Prices are bit high for small portions, but still acceptable I went to Pesce a little while ago when it was on Polk Street when my parents were visiting the city.  The food was delicious. . risotto . . yum, and the fresh seafood was amazing.  Our waiter was so nice, friendly and timely.  My parents and I were celebrating, but it also felt special while we were dining there.  I don't know if they could tell we were celebrating or not (we were there for a couple hours lingering with drinks) but they brought us a complimentary dessert, which was awesome! I haven't tried Pesce in their new Market Street location, but I hope they are as good as they were on Polk Street! Delicious quality brunch, just the reasonable sized amount that doesn't leave me feeling bloated.  Nice environment and good service!  That's equality as important!  Quality food and good service. So far I've only been here for brunch.  I am a brunch lover. Overrated.  Our party of four went to town at Pesce having heard good things about it and I was underwhelmed. We ate the granchio, polpo, fritto misto, cavoletti, bigoli, torta cioccolato, and budino.  Of all those, I only truly recommend the polpo because it had to be the best octopus I've ever had. . . and I am not a big fan of octopus.  Everything else was honestly mediocre.  Not sure if we'll be back. I had previous checked out Pesce in its former location in Russian Hill many years ago.  I had remembered it was quite good back then . . . I think that still holds true today. As is recommended, we ordered a bunch of small share plates and for the most part, they were stellar.  Some of the highlights: Granchio (dungeness crab tower with avocado)  beautiful arrangement and even better tasting.  One of the best dishes Risotto di seppia (squid ink risotto)  creamy and rich; another hit.  Pumpkin ravioli with brown butter sage and saba  just a touch of sweetness that added a nice balance to this savory pasta dish Capocollo Pizzette (spicy tomato, capocollo, calabrese chile)  this pizza, on the other hand, was amazing.  Simple but with surprising heat.  So good we ordered an extra one. Others dishes were just ok: Pere e gorgonzola Pizzette (d'anjou pear, onion preserve, pomegranate seeds)  interesting toppings but unlike the capocollo, this one was just ok.  Tonno (herb crusted tuna, tomato puttanesca, soffritto)  the fish was just ok but the sauce made up for it. For cocktails, the Focolare (bourbon, Benedictine, walnut liqueur, mezcal rinse) was a great drink although the Estasi (chamomile infused grappa, elderflower, cocchi, lemon, grapefruit) was surprisingly even better. Desserts were somewhat disappointing. The Budino (warm cinnamon apricot bread pudding with vanilla gelato) was better than the Limoncello cake with marscapone but neither really shined. Nice spacious location with a semi private room in back for small parties.  Friendly, prompt service and reasonable prices. Gosh, I really liked this space when it was  probably because years ago, some close friends threw a birthday party for me in their private back room. That kind of thing happens to me like once every twenty years, so I don't expect the next one until I'm eating the Early Bird Special at some suburban shopping mall chain restaurant. Anyway, I still dream about that herb roasted Fulton Valley chicken sitting on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes and piled high with Blue Lake green beans and a stack of fried onion rings (photo: bit. ly/epZiO). Delicious. I read some good things about Pesce, so Jamie W. and I sauntered over to the Castro for a birthday eve dinner here. The first thing that struck me was how loud it was. REALLY LOUD! I know it's the Castro, and they kept the bar scene hopping. But still. . . Even though we made a reservation, we were squeezed into the crowded banquette seating area where the couple next to us felt a need to hog the seating for themselves. In fact, the one who was sitting halfway into my space wouldn't even acknowledge that I was trying to get in. EXCUSE ME. MAYBE YOU CAN DO THAT AT HOME WHERE YOU ACTUALLY OWN THE SOFA. I tried to push him to his space with my jacket but to little avail. The server was no help even as other tables started to open up. Oh well, I suppose I can eat with just my left arm. Service was on the slow side as the bread finally arrived. Room temperature and rather chewy (photo: bit. ly/dEcw). The menu had a pretty standard cross section of Italian food with of course, a focus on seafood. Thus the name, Einstein (photo: bit. ly/awmUq). By this time, another nearby couple was doing the two on the couch thing. WTF. YOU WANNA TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF AND PICK YOUR TOES NOW, TOO? We decided to start with the mini pizzas or Pizzettes as they are apt to call them in Castroland. The first was the $ Puttanesca with spicy tomatoes, capers, olives and white anchovy on a puffy, browned crust (photo: bit. ly/akBCdM). It was decent enough though a bit saltier than it had to be. Better was the $ Scarola e Salsiccia which had clumps of caggiano sausage along with escarole, lemon zest and panna (photo: bit. ly/p). This had actually substance, and the lemon gave it a more refreshing taste than you would expect. Entrees were next, and Jamie got all predictable and ordered the $ Pappardelle with Braised Duck in a Porcini Tomato Sauce (photo: bit. ly/cBuSO). It was pretty good but strictly by the numbers in execution. Once again, overseasoning hindered the intended rustic flavor. It was my birthday. . . OK, birthday eve (did I mention that already?). . . so I decided I deserved the $ Aragosta, which was just a plain bowl of spaghetti mixed in saffron, brandy and tomato and topped with a roasted half lobster (photo: bit. ly/iEQWF). I didn't have any complaints about the succulent lobster, but it overshadowed the pasta which was in a pool of watery sauce with only a hint of the brandy mentioned in the description. By now, the couple next to us had left unable to disengage their mutual embrace. DON'T LET THE DOOR HIT YOU ON THE WAY OUT, BOYS! And the other couple was canoodling causing a look of sheepish indigestion on the neighboring diner. HEY, YOU CAN GET AN HOURLY RATE AT BECK'S REAL CHEAP, SWEETHEART. Why am I yelling? The place has emptied out. Please bring back . FOOD  .  stars. . . some of it is good, much of it is meh and often on the same plateAMBIANCE   stars. . . WHAT?!!SERVICE   stars. . . fairly indifferent given the canoodling that was going onTOTAL   stars. . . that chicken with the onion ring tower sounds pretty good now Pretty solid for the Castro. I do prefer the quieter vibe of the old location but really, this place is vibrant and what really impressed me is that every person you come in contact with was super polite and friendly. The waiter, each busser, food runner, etc. Crab tower: /Octopus: . /Sardines: /Whole Branzino: /Service: /What I remember about the old Pesce is that there were tons of hits but a few missed here and there. Last night was along the same lines. Only one miss that was the sardines. The accompaniments on the plate was wilted and underwhelming. But, everything else was really nice and the whole Branzino was cooked perfectly!Energetic  and a bit noisy but we can hang with that  people were having fun and enjoying their dinner and we really enjoyed it as well. Good job, please keep it up! Disclaimer: I don't have the most sophisticated palette, so maybe the quality of food at this place was beyond my appreciation. Went here for a mini celebration and figured the prices weren't ridiculous ($  ish a plate for a nice place with a beautiful, fancy atmosphere) so we tried it out. SERVICE was nice. It was crowded for a Sunday night, and we walked in without a reservation. The host was also the waiter and bartender so we were waiting up front for a few minutes, but then seated immediately at the bar because the dining room was full. The waiter seemed rushed but was still polite. I wouldn't exactly call it attentive service, though. DRINKS: We started with $ cocktails. A Farewell to Arms, I can't remember what was in it but it was fairly sweet and delicious. He had the Americano, which sounded sweet on the menu but ended up being crazy bitter. We didn't finish the drink, it was just made badly. Thought about sending it back but he didn't want to. After ordering, the waiter brought some bread on a plate with a pat of butter. The food came relatively quickly after that. SCALLOPS: I had the $ scallops, which came with three seared scallops, some mushrooms and a delicious sauce. It was a yummy dish, and it didn't seem expensive, but the fact that the dish was so SMALL threw me off. It looked like an appetizer. I was hungry when I finished and continued eating bread. PAPPARDELLE: He had the duck pappardelle, which was also a tiny dish. Delicious as well, but perhaps my palette couldn't distinguish how that tiny bowl was worth  bucks. The food was not bad, and the prices (for the quality) was not bad, but I really couldn't get over the QUANTITY (or lack thereof). We spent nearly $ on dinner and left hungry. It wasn't a good experience; maybe we will come again when we are feeling more frivolous or loose with our wallets, but the value didn't hit it home that night. Atmosphere was nice. I'm lucky I sat in the back room! I could still hear a lot ofNoise coming from the front!Service was good but a little too good at times. I felt rushed!Also, food that comes out to the table under  minutes ofOrdering, makes me believe it was sitting in the fridge. Ordered the kale salad that had some kale in it mixed withIceberg. If it says kale salad on the menu, shouldn't it be kale?Steak was good, but each bite had a lot of olive oil in it. Tiramisu was not good. Cocktails were very good!I would return for cocktails & maybe an appetizer (happy hour)I don't mind paying higher prices for dinner but I don'tBelieve the food at Pesce justifies the price. Too many other restaurants that are great without the highPrice. Overall excellent. Food, service and decor was such a huge improvement over anything that has been in this space. Only criticism is the chubby host. There were two of us, it was early and not yet busy and he sat us at a table just outside the kitchen. We requested a booth and he said that the booths were reserved for  even though the table we were being seated at was a four top. The booths went empty until just as we were leaving when he sat two separate parties of TWO. Pesce needs a new host or they'll be doomed as others in this space have been. First impressions! very rare I give a  star to places but my two experiences were so wonderful there. . I love the remodel and the upscaling they have done to the place. The staff it actually amazing in every way. they had dimmed the lights and to my friends it was too low and they turned them back up . I have not been to too many places that will do that for u . This place is maily SEAFood so do not go if u do not like, they have some dishes not that way like lamb and beef but majority is seafood and amazing seafood at that . Jessica was our server noth nights and she rememeber everything about me and one of my other freidns that came both nights, to me that is impressive. The food is mainly smaller portions ment to be shared but they also have about  dishes that r just a big plate style . which one night i did that way and had the lamb ( excellant) in every way shape and form. . . and then last night the small plates and shared with friend from Turkey. The only thing i would say is that with the high ceilings and wood floors it gets very loud in there to where u may not be able to hear people at the other end of table if u have a big group . sorta like HOME used to be before the carpeting and still how Chow is. I do hope that if u r in the area you give it a try for its great to have another new addition to the hood that is upscale and great food. . . . . . Fantastic!  Lovely, warm interior with a friendly and attentive staff.  I came early and was waiting for my friend, but they sat me anyway.  Other places would have made me wait or told me they were booked (even if half full).  They won me over with their friendliness.  Now the food. . . awesome!  They had fresh clams that were incredible.  Fresh, with just a lovely hint of the ocean.  Their slightly baked squash salad with fresh mozzarella and a sprinkling of cinnamon was incredible.  Wide noodles with braised duck in a tomato and mushroom sauce, amazing.  The noodles were like butter!  The menu changes depending on what is fresh and in season.  Nice wine and cocktail list.  Very relaxed and friendly atmosphere, with a great staff.  A bit pricey, but worth it.  We will make this a regular place. The introduction of Pesce to the neighborhood was quite refreshing as that area of Market Street leaves much to be desired in terms of dining options. Pesce (owned by the same group as Starbelly) has opened a great Seafood oriented restaurant that offers a wide variety of dishes from the Northern Italian regions.  The menu offers mostly smaller plates, but unlike most other Tapas style places, you actually feel like you're getting a good value.  The options range from exclusively Italian items (seafood pastas, mozzarella etc) to more local items like flat breads and scalloped potatoes.  They do also have a shorter list of larger entrees. The restaurant itself is freshly designed, think Restoration Hardware meets Italian Seafood!  The bar is quite nicely designed and the space feel like something you might expect in NYC. Overall having already eaten several dinners at Pesce, I highly recommend it for its consistently good food, friendly service and pleasant atmosphere.  Hopefully the neighborhood can take a few notes from these guys! Awesome brunch. Not crowded which will change very soon. Food was inventive and well priced. Good music Good bar. Coffee was so so but that didn't ruin it. Definitely check this brunch out. Good food in the hood is welcomed. Yay Superb food, drinks and service.  Well crafted menu.  Everything was just so tasty.  We sat in the cozy back dinning room.  Our waiter was professional, friendly and very knowledgeable he helped guide us thru an awesome meal. As we were leaving I did notice the noise level in the main dinning room was very, VERY loud.  I'll be sure to book the back room again. What a pleasure to have in the neighborhood.  Great food and service.  Portions are small so it can add up to order many plates, but it was quite delicious and our server Jessica was sensational. I love this place. We have been long time fans going to the location on Polk about once a week for years. We were sad to see them move from our neighborhood but happy to see the amazing new space and extended pizza menu! My faves will always be the scallops and the tuna pasta. The best best ever! Also the staff is so nice. I don't usually drive across town for a mellow week day dinner  but for the food and staff this place is worth it! Wish I had gotten in a review for the former Russian Hill Pesce ( Polk St), but I was quite relieved to know this place only moved, and did not shut down because their seafood is so delicious!At this newer location about two month ago, my date and I ate such items as sardines, baby octopus salad, diver scallop crudo, pan seared scallops and lobster pasta. Everything was tasty. I particularly liked the sardines, and the octopus  it was soft and seared, not chewy at all. Our waiter was quite knowledgeable about the menu, as well as the wine selection  his help guided us to select the Moscotto. Did have to get reservations, but it was well worth it. Delicious gourmet meal each time. Friendly service, tasty cocktails, comfortable atmosphere. Has it been perfect each time? Of course not  that would be boring, and what's more seriously unrealistic. Sometimes its great, sometimes its not. But each time, its been a fully present experience that doesn't pretend to be anything its not. And for that (and the gravity challenging deliciousness of their crab tower), I truly appreciate them. Old school Italian seafood without traditional Italian American east coast exuberance,""mezza mezza"" atmosphere and service. Great improvement from Jakes, however miss warmth of , especially @ the bar."|2|96|1|Routine Inspection| Moderate risk vermin infestation  [ date violation corrected: 4/1/2014 ]
Pesce Seafood Bar 1|3.5|Seafood in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|171|1|3.625|" We had girls' night here and all of us want to return! I read some of the reviews before coming that said you had to order a few dishes to feel full, but it depends how hefty of an eater you are. Definitely treat the Capesante (pan seared scallops) as an appetizer since it only comes with three scallops, but the pasta and risotto meals as well as my shrimp dish were plenty filing! I had the gamberoni as a main: grilled mint lime shimp with farro and vegetables. There is some kind of cheese on top (in the crumbly feta/goat ish variety) so I'd recommend clarifying if you're sensitive to that, and note that the shrimp is very very lightly grilled, but I loved it. I also tasted:Barbabietole: roasted beets, red radishes, tender greens, pecorino ricotta cheese. Delicious, fresh, nothing outlandishly special about itZucchine: slow braised summer squash, heirloom tomato  reminded me of ratatouille. I'm not a huge squash fan, but I had a couple of servings of this dish. I didn't leave feeling overly stuffed  and that's a good thing! I'd probably give this place between .  and  stars, but this one deserves the rounding since we all had so much fun. I'd give it .  stars but I'm posting it as a  star over a  star because the dishes simply weren't food forward. You know there's a problem when the description on the menu reads tastier than what is actually served. As others posted bland squid ink risotto, small servings for ""family style"" (don't call it family style dishes if you need to order  just to fill your own belly!), and the pizza dough tasted like an English muffin to me. Best thing was the grilled pulpo, but I thought that could even use a kick, like pickled onions, perhaps. If things stay status quo, I give it a lifespan of a year. . . Not going back :(Good good. Good drinks. Good service. Do noisy that my ears hurt. Really unpleasant sitting there. Too bad, otherwise we enjoyed it. I am a long time customer of Pesce on Polk street. It has always been one of my favorite restaurants with consistently great food and service over many years. I was delighted to find out that they were moving to a bigger space although I would no longer be able to walk to the restaurant. So we went with some friends for dinner and as soon as we sat down we looked at each other and you could tell that we were all thinking the same thing, we had made a big mistake in picking this restaurant. The noise level is unbelievable! We couldn't hear each other and we couldn't hear the wait staff. One of the great things about the old location was the fact that the restaurant was quiet and you could carry on a normal conversation with your friends. Too bad. We won't be going back. Very friendly service and nice space on market street. Nice selection of Italian style cocktails. However, very disappointed with their food. . Very small portions  each plate costs $ $ but made me feel like eating a kids meal in tiny plates. If it has great flavor and taste, I would get it. However, seemed to me that it's just small portions of average Italian food. . Venetian family style but never seen any Italian restaurant without bread on the table, family style should be even more generous about a couple of pieces of bread, don't you think? Maybe a stingy family style??  ( FYI I used to live in Italy for over  years and never ever seen this no bread serving ) . Serving foods with time difference for each one of us at the same table. One dish out for one and  minutes later for one another. So one of our group had to wait for his dish until everyone else finished their own. The kind waitress provided us free dessert to make it up and I appreciate her effort. Overall, it would be my first and last experience here I guess. However, im not against some people's idea of trying their cocktails for happyhour. Excellent seafood, italian, tapas style bites, well priced and located in a newly renovated restaurant. Loved it, will return. I only had two concerns, the waitstaff did not seem very familiar with the menu or italian food, nor could they pronounce the dishes, and they served us the wrong pasta. In the end it was great anyway, I'm sure they're still learning. Small portions. Expensive prices. Mediocre food. Beautiful new location in the Castro, perhaps good for a drink if you can find a seat over there.  stars for food,  stars for prices,  stars for friendly but mostly slow service. * Complimentary bread  pretty bad. * Scarola e Salsiccia   STARS ($): Escarole, lemon zest, panna, caggiano sausage. I should have guessed for the price this pizza would be tiny, it's smaller than a traditional individual pizza with  tiny slices. It was pretty good thin crust, that kind of reminded me of something home made. Great flavor. Unfortunately it was all downhill from here. * Risotto de Sepia   STARS ($): Squid ink risotto, mediterranean sepia. Not much flavor of the sea. Not much seafood. Mostly alot of bland rice. * Granchio   STARS ($): Dungeness crab meat tower, avocado, cucumber, tomato. This famous dish heralded from the beginnings when Pesce first opened up in Nob Hill. Pictures are deceiving, as I could likely eat the dish in  easy bites. It was pretty tasty but as you would expect, and most definitely not worth $. * Capesante   STARS ($): Pan seared scallops, field mushrooms, green onion, cream, tartufato. Sounds amazing doesn't it? Unfortunately the plate was mostly composed of cream, and to my disappointment the scallops were either low quality or cooked poorly, or both. There were few mushrooms, and no other flavors showed through the extremely rich cream based sauce. Perhaps good for cocktails or happy hour (M F  pm), not a good place for food. Walked in without reservations and was told to go to the bar and find a seat.  Found one in this busy restaurant! I'm sad you left Polk St. , but I can't hate on the new digs.  The service is still excellent, the bar is still top notch and the food is, of course, amazing.  The scallops are cooked to perfection and the sardines are excellent.  The tiramisu made my eyes water with pure happiness. Solid  stars. Overall, friendly service and nice place for dinner. If I wasn't on a self imposed no alcohol on weekdays ban, I would've definitely tried their cocktails. Food was good, but none of the dishes we ordered particularly stood out to me. The portions are small are meant to be shared family style, with   recommended plates per person. We ordered the squid ink risotto, pan seared scallops, escarole pizza, and dungeness crab tower. My favorite would be the crab tower, which I thought was really fresh and tasty. The squid ink risotto was lacking in flavor and did not have much squid. The vibe is nice and service was friendly. I would come back to try their happy hour and drinks. that. . . was a hella great dining experience. we arrived a little early for a : reservation on a tuesday night. we were led to a small, serene room in the back of the restaurant. the room is large enough to accommodate  diners. initially we were the only ones there but by the time we left it was full. the menu consists of tiny plates, small plates, small pizzas, medium plates and entree sized, you guessed it, plates.  we had wanted to start with a half dozen oysters on the shell but were told they only had shooters. we declined. so what we did have was:octopus with potatoes and celery this was the smallest plate. warm with tender octopus, it was a little too acidic but that might just be a quibble. really acidic dishes just don't match well with wine and that was the case here but still it was tasty. pomodoro pizza  when pesce moved from polk street, the new location already had a pizza oven installed so they added pizza to the menu and what a great addition it is. the dough is kind of bready and thick with just the right amount of toppings. it was harmonious, subtle and delicious. capesante i asked the waiter if there are any must haves and this was his recommendation. wow, was this good. three lightly seared scallops in the most delicious sauce you can imagine which consisted of cream, green onions, mushrooms and truffles. i used some bread to sop up what was left of the sauce on the serving plate. just as the waiter told me, i'm now telling you, it's a must have. squid ink risotto perfectly cooked, creamy with some small pieces of squid. perhaps a little too much garlic and not enough ""taste of the sea"" from the ink but nevertheless a good dish. flank steak we didn't want to have all seafood so we ordered some beef. the steak was cooked perfectly, medium rare and seasoned perfectly as well. tender and juicy the steak is served with a big mound of fries that are tossed with deep fried parsley and sage leaves. the fries could have used just a little more time in the fryer but again that's a quibble. this was an entree sized plate and it was spectacular. we finished off with tiramisu and a couple of cocktails, the tentazione and the vida rosa. all was good not great. for wine we did a byob, a  evening land ""memorius"". the fruit for this wine comes from el's estate vineyard in the sta. rita hills ava which is located in the southernmost part of the central coast in santa barbara county. the wine was elegant with just the right balance of fruit and acid and paired well with the food. el produces pinots and chards in burgandy, oregon and california. if you're not familiar with them, check them out, they're a real interesting producer of outstanding wines. corkage was $. i'd like to offer a little constructive criticism. the bread is not up to the standards of the rest of the food. it's totally forgettable. the stemware is inferior. when our cocktails came, the glasses were wet on the outside from spilling the contents or overfilling. there was also a long wait between the last entree and dessert. you'll notice i said ""great dining experience"" at the top and what i mean by that is that not only is the food very good but the relaxed vibe from the restaurant made eating there very enjoyable. the lack of polish of some of the staff, i'm going to guess that some are still in training, is more than made up by personality. every staff member we came in contact with had an aura of  ""glad you're here"". all in all we had a great evening. pesce: ""a presto"". I will make this brief and short.  We had a confused situation with our order as well as our server tonight and for some reason he had to leave after only just getting there??  That's not a negative comment by any means because sh*t happens, right.    Otherwise, He was really great.  All the staff were.  I was there with a friend for his birthday and we both had a good time.  The food is very good.  I recommend the pizza with goat cheese and grapes.  I have to especially thank Myron for helping us at the end.  What you did was and is excellent service.  Good job to you and your staff.  I'll definitely be coming back! Food was good, but too expensive. Wouldn't go back, too many other choices in the city for that price. Found this restaurant thru Yelp a few months ago and gave it a go. When we arrived at Pesce (old location) it was small and very crowded. Once we were seated & sampled the food, I understood why. . . . .  DELICIOUS !On our recent visit a few weeks ago visited Pesce in their new Market St. location. . same great food and so much more space. I love, love, love the Risotto di Mare Solid addition to the neighborhood. Welcome! Everything we ordered was tasty from the starters to the fish to the meat. The squid ink risotto was a highlight. Service was attentive and friendly. Nice compact wine list. We will be back. Welcome addition to the Castro. Nice space, good cocktails, and great food. . . probably one of the better places in the area This is the way seafood should always taste. Excellent quality, excellent preparation and excellent service. It would be five stars if not for it's noise issues. The service is very attentive and for being open only  weeks were on top of their game. We arrived late for our reservation but they were fine with it and said they were running late too. I had heard that there are serious noise issues and that there was a small back room and I knew I would need to be there if I wanted to hear anything. If you are hard of hearing or just can't handle lots of background noise ask for a table in the back room. The food was excellent, simply excellent. Most of the dishes are small plate, some the size of appetizers, some the size of small entrees. It's billed as a Venetian Seafood Cichéti Bar. I've never been to Venice but I've eaten all around the Med in Spain and France and it had many of the same ingredients and similar preparations. Most dishes range in price from   with a few larger dishes in the 's. This a seafood place, there are limited vegetarian options and only four dishes with land creatures. We tried:Caprese salad fresh mozzerela was devine, a simple salad that's always good when you have the right ingredients. Patata alla crema chessy rich scalloped potatoes. Would be perfect on a chilly SF night. Squid ink risotto my favorite dish beside the pulpo, they know their risotto, loved the nuttiness and the way it held the flavours of the squid ink. It came with bits of sepia that were tasty too. It was good size and the closest of the dish to an entree size. It would be a good solo dish. Polpo I am kind of obsessed with Octopus ever since a trip last year to Barcelona. I was so disppointed by the octopus at Coqueta both in terms of size and taste. Here we had a small plate brimming with octopus on top of potatoes. It was so wonderful, the taste was perfection and I know I will be eating many more plates of it. Capesante the server told us this was Pesce's signature dish but it wasn't my favorite although the French Spouse loved it and thought the creme sauce was divine. I prefer my scallops simply prepared and without sauces. Still it is a rich and decadent preperation of seared scallops. We finished with Panna Cotta that was just the right texture and sweetness something many restaurants fail at. We also started with  oysters,  of each of their three selections. They were nicely shelled and very fresh. The food came out very quickly, although too quickly but better that than too slow. The front door and the dining spaces are wheelchair accessible and there are no stairs or level changes. The bathrooms both of which are unisex were on the smaller side and while a wheelchair could get in, I'm not sure if a transfer could be made. All in all, I am so happy they moved from their previous location and they are great addition to the Castro/Dubosce Triangle area. I recently had the opportunity to give Pesce a try, and I came away feeling happy that this place has made its home in the Castro.  The Mozzarella Insalate and Pappardelle with Braised Duck were both showstoppers.  My dining companion and I also enjoyed the Fritto Misto and Spaghetti con L'astaco, and we shared the Chocolate Tart and Bread Pudding for dessert.  I'm not a huge fan of the small plate trend (which tends to be pricey), and some of the cocktails at the bar were a little too inventive for my taste.  With that said, the food was delicious and the service was excellent.  I'm excited that this space on Market Street is finally occupied again, and I'm looking forward to giving other items on the menu a try. Service is a delight. Abundant seafood and vegetable menu. Cocktails and wine! Come on!! Thank god Adriano took this space over. No more visually assaulting decor and REAL food.  The flavors are authentic Venetian but unfortunately no matter how hard you close your eyes you're not in Venice. I thought the food was uniformly tasty, although not transcendent.  We had a puttanesca pizza, the kale salad (really just a caesar salad with some kale), squid ink risotto, and the fritto misto.  The service was very good.  The biggest disappointment was the cocktails.  We had the Farewell to Arms, Tentazione, Venetian, and the Orzata Punch.  Although they all sounded interesting on the menu, they were poorly executed  too boozy or too watery and uniformly lacking in the flavor dimensions promised on the menu.  I don't know if it was poor training, carelessness, or poor recipes.  But there is no excuse for sub par $ cocktails these days, especially with Blackbird just down the street. I would give it a . , rounding up to  because it is new and in hopes they will straighten out their bartenders. I  though the food was good  but it seemed like with each dish one thing was missing from it being perfect.  For example we started off with Dugeness Crab tower.  The star of the dish should have been the crab which was lost in all the avocado they used.  Thus while I could see the crab and feel the texture I could not really taste it.  Furthermore I would have preferred more acid and salt and pepper in the dish. The second dish we had was Lobster and spaghetti.   While the lobster was cooked well the spagahetti and sauce was lacking again in acid and pepper.  Also there was no lobster flavor in the dish besides the half the lobster on top.  The could have used lobster stock ect.  just like in the above dish they could have used crab stock. Next we had the Cioppino (sorry from NYC so do not know how to spell this classic SF dish).  I thought this was one of the better dishes with a well flavored sauce and lots of fish. Finally we had the pizza which was probably the best  and cheapest dish of the night. The spicy sauce (finally flavor) was good along with meat and perfectly cooked thin crust.  I would have loved it if they elevated the dish to its classic with basil and mozzarella. Also we got a bottle of wine which was a great  selection by the host for $. In closing I really want this place to do well but flavor profiles are missing and dishes are rather pricey for not perfect food.  I really hope they work on this or even cut the menu in half so they can concentrate on fewer dishes and perfecting their food. Food  stars (hits and misses)  Service .  stars  Atmosphere  Stars  Value  Stars The portions were really small, make sure to order a salad and appetizer with your entree.   Great ambiance, food was solid but not very memorable.   I had the Cioppino, base was pretty watery and only a little bit of seafood included.  It definitely doesn't compare to the Cioppino at Hank's Oyster Bar in the Castro, which is still one of my favorite seafood dishes in San Francisco. I actually love this place but I can only give it one star, my explanation follows. I happened to be walking down Market St. and I saw that Pesce was in the last stage of a move in/remodel.  I asked what happened to the Russian Hill location and was told that it had moved here permanently.  I couldn't be more excited!  This is one of my very favorite restaurants!  We would brave the lack of parking in Russian Hill to dine there, how fabulous it moved into my neighborhood!  My partner and I can now walk there, no more parking hassle!The menu is pretty much the same and the food quality equal to before meaning. . . . EXCELLENT!  However, the dining experience is not the same at all.  I don't know who they hired as the interior designer but they need to get some further education in understanding the science of acoustics (and I say this as an interior designer who does, please give me a call).  It was so loud neither of us could have a conversation nor hear/understand what our waitress was saying.  Looking around, everyone was having the same issue and even the wait staff commented that they were ""working on this problem"".   Obviously others have complained yet there is no evidence of any changes being made. Adding to the cacophony was the blaring techno gym umcha umcha umcha music (which is not music at all and is an insult to all music by calling it music and does not belong in a restaurant.  Gym or disco maybe, not a fine dining restaurant).  When we mentioned this the ""host"" he said the ""owner wanted this music"".  To the owner, your customers are who you should be appealing to, not your personal stereotype of the Castro.  No one wants dine in the gym, they want a fine dining & romantic experience (as they used to have at the former Polk St. location). Again, I have always loved this restaurant and the food is still a superior quality but the horrible noise and awful loud non music  ruined our experience so much so that we are not likely to be repeat customers any longer nor recommend this restaurant again.  Sorry but until you think of your customer's dining experience first and foremost and make your establishment comfortable and a place people can easily converse with their loved ones, friends & family without having to scream across the tables you do not deserve our patronage. Well, that was fun.  We were / on wines (the Lagrien is great, I think it was the  Elena Walch), but the food was super.  The Penne Arrabbiata was awesome, as was the Kale salad. Pesce is hands down my favorite restaurant in the Castro/Mission. I regularly eat at Frances, Farina, Tartine, and Abbot's Cellar, and I love them all, but after eating at Pesce this week, I was blown away. Pesce mainly offers Italian small plates, but they are more like petite entree sizes. Our server, Gino, informed us of the specials and answered all of our questions, but did not try to push too much food on us, which is a pet peeve of mine when it comes to small plate establishments (ahem, Coqueta). We took several of our server's recommendations, including the risotto with squid ink, the crabmeat tower, and the day scallops. We also had the mozzerella (caprese salad) and the pizette with goat cheese and grapes. The dishes come out as they're ready, but the pace is good and every dish was amazingly flavorful and well executed. We probably could have done with one fewer plate, as we were over satiated and left a bit on the table. At $ each, the cocktails are not only well crafted, but affordable. Dinner for  for the above items, plus one cocktail each was roughly $, not including gratuity. The space is modern but warm. The front dining area, which also includes the bar, can get very loud. If you are looking for a more intimate experience, better for conversation, request the back dining area, with only a handful of tables. The mini pizzas were incredible. The crab tower tasted like it had been made earlier in the day  and then stuck in the fridge, so it had that wedding food rigidity. The risotto di mare was just OK, with some of the fish tasting. . . bland. I have a special fondness for the location (dating back to the old """" days), and the meal experience was overall a happy one, so I will probably go back. Nice atmosphere. Service was very slow. Two of us were seated at : and didn't get our first course until  minutes later (oysters). Salads were tasty but the ciopinno and especially the squid ink risotto had very little flavor. The risotto was so bland I couldn't eat it. I was a bit disappointed given what i had read about their previous location. I'll try this place again because the owner and staff seem to be passionate about what they are doing. I hope they can work out the kinks. .  STARSOne of my prerequisites for a good date place is the restaurant must have a bar. . . a FULL bar. Nothing sets off a bunch of fireworks like a couple of stiff cocktails can. As my good friend says, ""DRINK TILL HE'S CUTE!"" and I can't agree with her anymore. So what if he looks like Rob Jeremy the next morning. . . at least he looked like Channing Tatum for the night right? Hey, Ron Jeremy lookalikes need some love too. Pesce is a great place to set off some boozy fireworks of your own because they have some awesome cocktails! But more on that later. . . Formally in Russian Hill, Pesce moved into the old Jake's about two weeks ago. Brought to you by the Delrosa, Starbelly, and Beretta team, Pesce serves seafood centric small dishes. After some comparison, their menu seems to have stayed the same; offering oysters, salads, risottos, pastas, seafood, and several meat items. They did, however add pizzas to their menu. It's suggested that you order   small plates ($ $ each) per a person but they have four dishes that are entrée portions: spaghetti aragosta, branzino, cioppino, and pesce al forno (whole fish). Expect to spend about $  a person before tip (including  cocktails a person). Reservations highly recommended. We started off dinner with several cocktails which were fantastically stiff. I had the Tentazione ($) which tasted like a boozy spiced cider: bit. ly/mR. Patti Stanger would have been proud because I stuck to her  drink max rule (thankfully two was all I needed to make me WHO HO!). Sadly, the food was not as good as the cocktails. I've never been to Pesce's original location so I have no basis for comparison but I found the food here to be mediocre and universally bland (this is coming from someone who dislikes heavily salted items). Not sure who was the previous chef, but I read that former Top Chef, Jen Biesty (Scala's Bistro) is the current chef at Pesce. ~ * ~F O O D~ * ~*Granchio: Dungeness Crab Tower w/ Avocado, Cucumbers & Tomato ($)   STARSbit. ly/akhgjThe best dish of the night, the uber fresh crab and buttery avocado went together like bread and buttah but of course even better. My only gripe is I which there was more because ""someone"" hogged up the entire dish. *Fritto Misto: Calamari, Shrimp & Green Beans ($)   STARSbit. ly/dTsRxForking into the pieces, the batter immediately flaked off so I just ended up using my hands like a savage. We play anal acoustics in front of each other so I had no qualms about looking uncivilized. It was very bland and the ""spicy"" marinara sauce was very bland as well. I ended up just squeezing some lemon on everything just to give it some flavor. *Granoturco: Summer Corn, Bacon & Red Onions ($)   STARSbit. ly/almEDDoesn't corn and bacon sound like a yummy combo? Too bad it tasted like boiled corn with ham. Not sure why it was prepared this way but bacon should always be crisp IMO. *Spaghetti Aragosta: Half Roasted Lobster w/ Spaghetti in a Saffron & Brandy Tomato Sauce ($)   STARSbit. ly/tfTNThe most highly raved about dish at their original location was a letdown. While the lobster was perfectly cooked and nicely tender, the spaghetti was flavorless. I'm not a fan of eating pasta drench in sauce a la Olive Garden style but I could barely taste any tomato sauce. It needed salt, tang, spice; something. *Pollo: Braised Chicken Thighs & Crispy Polenta ($)  .  STARSbit. ly/oKjoSurprisingly better than the lobster spaghetti, the chicken was succulently juicy but again bland. Mr. NSS kept sprinkling salt over the chicken which was the first time I've ever seen him do this. ~ * ~S E R V I C E~ * ~Just like the cocktails, the staff was spectacular. From the host to our waiter, Matthew, you know you're in the Castro when you're welcomed by an energetic and sociable staff. No hipster attitude or sNob Hill pretentiousness here. Matthew gave great suggestions and was attentive without being intrusive. Food timing was on point and we were in and outta there in about an hour. Just how I like it fast. The restaurant was packed when we left at :ish so expect slower service when they're busy. ~ * ~A M B I A N C E / D É C O R~ * ~Minimalist décor with dark tables, wooden floors, and neutral furnishings: bit. ly/UTOk. It reminded me a bit of Locanda in the Mission. With a bar area and a main dining area, their new location is spacious and can accommodate about + people. ~ * ~P A R K I N G~ * ~Good luck finding parking so allot yourself an extra   minutes for finding street parking because there's no nearby garaged or lots. Despite the lackluster food, I have to round up because of the awesome cocktails and service. My only regret is not stopping by Hot Cookie afterwards for some BBC (yelp. com/biz/hot cookie …). All girls (and guys) need some BBC in their life. . . =P Great dinner at the new location !Nice wine selection by the glass. Delicions mozarella/tomato salad and sardines as appetizers. Then we went on to have the Whole Fish(Dorade). It took a bit longer but was well worth the wait. Capesante was very good also. The waitress was knowledgeable and friendly, we felt very comfortable . Good dessert selections,we had the Panna Cotta which was great. I am happy they moved to this new location which is so much more spacy and also has a big bar area. Only slight minus , it was a bit on the noisy side and echoing all around. I am sure eventually it could be fixed. Tried out the new location this weekend after having dined at the Polk street original a few times before. Definitely a different feel  Polk street was more intimate, whereas the Castro location is more trendy/racy paired with clubby music. It takes a little getting used to if you were accustomed to the Russian Hill ambience, but once you do  the place does not disappoint. Same great food, excellent wine list and cocktails. The chocolate tart is absolutely to die for, even better than the ones I've had  at Tartine (which is saying a lot). Definitely looking forward to going again ! Such a nice addition to the stro. Good food, tasteful space, and hot staff. I highly recommend this place. I was really excited to try out this new restaurant, and it did not disappoint. I went on the first official night it was open. I was honestly shocked how good the food was for an opening. Usually kitchens are still working out the kinks, but the dishes I had were great. Highlights were the Crudo di Pesce, Squid Ink Risotto and Tiramisu. I have been thinking about the Tiramisu ever since. . . definitely will be back with reinforcements so I can try more of the menu. I think we may have a winner in this location finally! Wednesday at : PM, party of . We were promptly greeted and and seated. Our waitress was just the right combo of friendly, sassy and helpful.  The food came at a reasonable pace, our waitress checked in several times, water refills were prompt and the table was cleaned between each serving. Below is what we ordered and I'd recommend all of it. Everything is on the smaller side and meant to be shared so a party of  is perfect. Everything was cooked properly, was fresh and had good flavor profiles. I tried one cocktail that was quite tasty and we had a reasonably priced bottle of red. Oysters Puttanesca Pizzette Mozzarella Salad Pappardelle  duck Bigoli  tunaGranchio  dungeness crabCapasante  scallopsPolpo  octopusSpaghetti Aragosta  lobsterMaiale  pork Budino (yum yum yum) and  a fig based dessert that was good, but more savory. I'll be back! How I wanted to like it. . . howhowhowhowhwohow. . . let me count the ways. It was clear jakes was not to become a fixture in the Castro and many of us agreed that following  was just maybe too hard and that one resto may die trying. . . two thought, let it not be true. . . and yet, I think the warning signs are there. We went, three of us. We had a booth and we were ready to see how they had fixed the other issues and had turned it all around and that we could breathe a deep sigh of relief and know we had a new place to call home. . . At first when you walk it you feel the new space wrestled out of the new space and you think that that is nifty however at the same time you see the terrible chalk board on the wall that looks half baked no love and then from there you see how no money was put into the space and then from there you see how the servers seem almost bothered to be there and then. . . and then. . . you order the bottled water and see the size and hear the price and then you and then you. . . it sorta goes down hill fast. The menu is thin and repetitive of most restos in this bracket. I went to the bathroom and the kitchen seems untouched and then I walked back by the bar and saw that they have the hot guys to get the drinks ordered . . . . but come on, even the hot guys need more than that. The hot guy with us was taken with the tall handsome mr cheekbones at the bar slinging drinks but he even mentioned that that a resto does not make. Saving grace? The arugula salad was tasty. I wish they had been more inspired, taken more risks and done more in their ""effort"" to build a menu. If they do not make it I at least hope we in the Castro are not again forced to read a sob story as we are not to blame. So excited to have a new restaurant in this space!My wife and I split the Mozzarella  salad and a the Capesante: pan seared scallops, field mushrooms, green onion, cream, olio tartufatoThe salad was a generous portion, and the tomatoes were perfectly ripe.  The scallops were absolutely perfect, and were beautifully presented.  I do think that the scallop dish was meant to be a first course, as there were only three smallish scallops.  However, that's on me for not asking. The wine list felt well thought out.  I do have to say that the acoustics overall need some improvement.  The music was a bit harsh and seemed to be bouncing off the walls, making it difficult to have a conversation.  Perhaps they'll figure that out in time. The service was just a bit slow, but I expect they're still working out some kinks.  We'll be back for sure. We went for dinner last night and really enjoyed the food, atmosphere, drinks, and service.  The mozzarella is amazing, the best we've ever had.  The grilled shrimp with farro was wonderful, as was the delicious seared scallops.  Service was top notch. Just okay.  I guess I'm more a fan of La Ciccia / Uva Enoteca / Beretta.  The grilled fish and crudo is better at Bar Crudo.  Service was good though.  people,  Saturday, Aug th at pm. Just what the Castro needed!Let's always remember  and all of the good meals we've had there, but it's time move on. We must wipe Jake's from our memory, and never speak of it again. Pesce has made a new, fresh, and welcome mark on this space and can stand on its own. The interior has been completely redone from ceiling to floors  grays and hunter greens mixed with warm woods, a great painted tin ceiling, and modern rubbed brass light fixtures. Apparently a mosaic wall has yet to come. The old (too) high bar is gone and has been replaced with a beautiful marble bar, with tall tables near the windows as before. The bar has its own small snack menu so I could easily see coming in here for a glass of wine and light bite before going out. They have a full bar, a fairly short but innovative cocktail menu, a good number of beers, reasonably priced wines by the glass, and a varied wine list. As far as the food, the Venetian menu is pretty extensive with everything but a few dishes made to share. The standout plates were: Crudo di Pesce   yellowtail tuna with white balsamic and pink peppercorns. Very fresh.  Capesante  scallops with an outstanding mushroom and truffle cream sauce. It sounds heavy but it actually was very light. The scallops were spoon tender and the server offered us bread to sop up the sauce.  Maiale al latte  a milk braised pork with gnocchi. Tons of flavor and perfectly seasoned. We also had a tomato, basil, and mozzarella salad that was delicious, and a Pomodoro pizza that was okay. I understand pizzas are new for them as this space already had a pizza oven. If I were them, I'd spend some more time perfecting the pizzas if they plan on making them a regular thing. We skipped dessert because we were full, however as a small criticism,  out of the  items on the dessert menu had alcohol as an ingredient, which seems a bit overkill. The service is casual, friendly, and efficient. It was obvious they spent a lot of time training as our server was new to the restaurant but able to confidently recommend and talk about the various dishes on the menu. Total bill for two people with  cocktails, a bottle of sparkling water, and  plates: $. . It's not an inexpensive meal comparative to the majority of places in the neighborhood, but it is very good value for the quality of the food, the environment, and service. We will definitely be back again and again. Delicious! And, better than the original in regards to the clientele."|2|100|0|Routine|This inspection has no violations.
TBD Restaurant 0|3.5|American (New) in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|153|0|3.79166666667|" My wife and I ate here for a pre show dinner.  The food was fantastic!  The dishes are very simple but delicious.  It's clear that cooking over the open flame makes a big difference, particularly for things like the semolina cake and the roasted leek.  The service was also excellent  our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and polite.  The food came very quickly, but we were never rushed. The drinks are a little funny.  The sort of cocktail I had was tasty (stout, sherry, and bitters), as was the glass of wine, but the individual drinks are not a good price for what you get (e. g. wine by the glass costs a quarter of the bottle price, but it's definitely not a quarter of a bottle pour, and the cocktail was maybe half a beer for $).  However the wine bottles are moderately priced (some good selections ~$), so that's a better way to go. I love the open fire, it reminded us of eating at parillas in Buenos Aires on our honeymoon.  The downside though is they don't seem to have the smoke under control.  It smelled a little smokey when we got there, but not bad and we didn't notice it by the time we left, but afterwards, we realized that our hair and clothes all had that campfire kind of smell.  I kept getting whiffs of it all night long.  Normally that wouldn't even bother me!  But we were dressed very nicely for the show, so now my suit is airing out and hopefully won't require dry cleaning. By comparison, Camino in Oakland also has an open flame grill and I have never noticed any smokey smell there.  Maybe it's just because we were at TBD early in the evening (pm on a Friday) and they hadn't gotten the fire hot enough yet?  I don't know. Anyway, I wouldn't recommend going very dressed up.  But I would definitely recommend going! If you like elevated campfire grub, this is the place for you. The beef has the most incredible delicious carcinogenic crust, I took a sensual video of my boyfriend eating the heavenly cheesy grits, and the deconstructed s'mores just brought it over the top. Great and intimate view from upstairs and helpful friendly staff. I'll be going back very soon! The service was good and the food was excellent. The flavors in our entrees were exceptional and the ingredients really complimented each other. There was not one single complaint. If only we had room for dessert. . . The wood burning stove is the most aspirational object of TBD Restaurant. The ambiance is upscale yet casual, and the always changing menu is exquisite. I would definitely recommend a reservation. I can't recommend this place enough, and I certainly can't wait to go back! . . : reservations for a party of .  Then .  Then .  We first sat down at two separate tables of  downstairs, since it looks like the tables are stationary and quite intricate.  Everything you need, from silverware to napkin to menu is in a drawer on the table. Since we were down to , we were able to move to the communal table upstairs (no drawers, though) and got to ordering.  The suggestion is   plates per person, to share.  I think we did a sufficient job in ordering most of the menu!yelp. com/biz_photos/tbd …Everyone had different hits and misses from the dishes.  My highlights were the leek, octopus, and the beef.  I also enjoyed the seaweed bread, uni, and trout.  I wouldn't order the corn cake again (it was. . . quite dense).  No opinion on the dessert since I opted out. Total damage for : $P. S.  excellent service! I walked into this restaurant this evening after being a long time lover of AQ and was very excited. Having no reservation, we were greeted by the matre d' and were asked if we were keen on waiting for a table or rather sit at the bar. We gladly let him know that we'd like to just have an app and a glass of wine at the bar whilst we waited for a table for our meal. At that juncture, he informed us it would be  minutes or so. Perfect. We were addressed, ordered, and served our glasses of wine by the bartender a bit after being seated, and started to mull over the menu. The verdict? Pickles and ham to accompany the cauliflower dish. The food was delicious. The wines by the glass were a bit to be desired. Mine was a bit jammy, and for a $ zin, I felt that they could have either priced it better or picked a more appropriate winery for the varietal.  minutes pass and the maitre d' is nowhere to be found. We keep drinking.  minutes now, and we're asked by the maitre d' who found is way back to his post on whether we'd still like a table. We say very pleasantly, yes please. He shouldn't have assumed anything else though.  minutes now, still no apology or hint from him as to when this table will happen.  minutes and he's curiously absent again for quite awhile and we figure to close the tab and slip out for another restaurant. The entire way through, the bartender was paying more attention to his servers and this person on the far left sitting at the bar. It was a bit of a fight to get wine or plates ordered, though we persisted clearly, to our dismay.  Shame, TBD. I had high hopes. a friend and i had a really great experience at AQ, the sister restaurant, earlier in the year so our hopes were set high for TBD. this restaurant is much more rustic and their focus is food made by varying sources from fire. think hearth, grill and smoke. it unfortunately didn't live up to all of the hype i'd built up in my head but i think i can say that i appreciate what they are going for. the service was great overall. there were smiling faces everywhere and they spaced our meal out nicely, though i do have one complaint. i'd made the reservation weeks in advance for three people and we were placed in the loft section with seats in a row sort of like bar seating. this is not conducive to conversation among three people or food sharing (their plates are meant to be shared). i had to pull my seat back away from my friends and the counter so that i could look at both of them while talking to them (totally not ideal for parties of more than two people). the food was unremarkable. there wasn't any one thing that stuck out to me as being REALLY good. This restaurant was just OK. We had the arepa which was starchy in the heavy sits like a brick in your stomach way.  The chicken and dumplings was good but nothing to write home about. The sides were very good. The cauliflower and carrots are both dishes I'd have again. We sat in the back close to the kitchen. They have a lot of wood for cooking which adds to the ambiance. I liked having the little drawers with the place settings in them. You will leave the restaurant smelling smoky though. We ordered many items here (approximately /  / of the menu), and I didn't really enjoy the food.  It wasn't bad, but I wasn't impressed. There wasn't a single item i had where i was like ""wow, that's good"".  The service here is solid, and the resturant is decorated pretty well, but did not deliver on taste. The ambiance at TBD is a comfortable warmth that makes you feel at home with a touch of refinement. I thoroughly liked the wooden theme throughout the restaurant and felt it created the space. The open wood fire kitchen area is a thing of beauty to watch and impressed at how minimal the smoke out put is but we warned you will leave smelling a weft of smoke on your clothes. Here are what we ordered and my thoughtsArepa good sear on both sides but doughy on the inside, lacked seasoning and didn't have anything specialLardo piggy flavorful goodness, copious amount, definitely need more breadScallops beautifully presented, light hint of smoke, refreshing pop from the fennel ice and good portion but was lacking savorinessLamb Carpaccio tender slices of lamb with just the right amount of gaminess, paired nicely with the sweetness of the beets + a hint of zip from the wasabiRoasted Lamb belly of the lamb was scrumptious, the loin was dry but flavorful, a good balance of texture and flavorsUni & Potatoes the potatoes were delicious, they had a delightful hint of heat from the jalapenos and a wonderful silky coating on the exterior. Uni was refreshing but for the price the amount was limitedCrab and Grits the polenta was dried out and under seasoned, a great amount of fresh crab that was sweet and succulent Beef Bavette beautifully cooked beef, well seasoned, and paired nicely with the side dishesSeaweed Bread a clever use of seaweed in place of salt, it added a special briny quality to the bread that complimented well with the slight smoky char of the bread. The bread had great texture and interesting intricacies Weisswurst the cabbage was overly sweetened and completely overwhelmed the dish. The sausage had great flavors but felt the texture lacked a meaty qualityService was fair, towards the end she sort of spaced out and seemed a tad overwhelmed. She apologized for the wait to get our bill and gave us a free sample of the soft serve that night (peanut butter topped with cocoa nibs). It had a good smooth quality and just the right amount of subtle peanut butter flavor. Overall ThoughtsFor a restaurant of this caliber, I am always looking to find something that makes me want to go back for more. TBD was not able to elicit such feelings but perhaps down the round maybe this will change TBD is warm and inviting, and also warm as in I should of worn short sleeves. It has sort of a lodge feel to it with a nice open kitchen and if you sit in one of the upper or lower bar seats you can watch them prepare everything.   The menu is seasonal so I am not sure what items are mainstays but almost everything we had was fantastic. The Kale salad was good but a little boring. The Seaweed toasts were fantastic and the Leaks my lord the leaks were so good, I hope they are on the menu all the time because I would hate for you to get there and not be able to eat them.  We  shared  smaller plates and  medium plates and it was more than enough food. I think we could of done  and  and been fine.  Our bartender/ server was fantastic as a guide throughout the menu and would not let us leave until we had dessert.  We were stuffed but I was very glad we took his advice it was fantastic.   I would for sure go here again. TBD is SO San Francisco, and SO my kind of place. I can eat here any and every night of the week.  And btw, I'd have no problem walking in solo and um. . . pigging out  I mean dining!  at the bar. First off, a reservation is not required, but recommended. I had a party of two and waited for ~ min.  No big deal. We just sat back, relaxed, admired all of the unique touches inside of this uber hip (dare I say hipster vibed) restaurant. Onto the dining experience. We sat downstairs and first noticed how cool the tables / quasi desks are. Just slide open your seat side drawer to find everything you need  your menu, silverware and napkin  all neatly placed inside. OMG, TA DA!  The food.  Makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  It's all about small plates. You MUST have the bread + butter + seaweed.  It was a little weird at first, but once you start muching, I gotta say, seriously rivals Tartine bread (maybe they get the bread from Tartine, I don't know). Other stellar standouts were the heirloom carrots, cauliflower and the uni dish (sans Uni for me, but the potatoes and garnish on that dish are amaze).  And surprise surprise. . . Dessert didn't disappoint either!  Soft serve was bomb. And mind you, I'm not a fan of soft serve. And Smores  you GOTTA do it. It's more like deconstructed smores.  But who cares. All together was all good. The only (sort of) surprise at the end of the night was the bill.  I think we had ~ dishes all together, which came up to $ plus tax.  A little steep so watch those little triangles on the menu if you're counting coins!! You nailed it! We had a nice view overlooking the kitchen which made us want to order everything. I have to say it is a little weird to sit upstairs at the table against the railing with a party of three. All of us in a row trying to lean over one another to talk and fight for the last bite. Aside from that one hiccup, everything was excellent. Our waitress was brand new and she wowed me with how much she knew about the menu, the ingredients and the wine. She made some recommendations that I wouldn't have ordered  I love that! We ordered the cured ham and pickled carrots to start which were packed with flavor and a great way to kick off the evening. Then we had a salad with kale, shaved celery and a soft cheese. That dish was really simple and fresh. Then we moved into some heavier items like the weisswurst, lamb, scallops and steak. The scallops were a little underwhelming but the rest were very good. We also had the arepas with mushrooms on top. Yummy but could have been warmer in temperature. Believe it or not we were still wanting more so we asked for bread. They gave us this fancy bread smothered in butter and mache. It was ridiculous! We all stopped talking and devoured these slices and we couldn't stop talking about it. We're still talking about that bread. Thanks for serving us sparkling water for free! : D We appreciated that. We had the Unti red wine from Dry Creek Valley which paired well with everything. The bathroom in the restaurant is really calming and spelled fantastic. The walls are covered with pine scented car air fresheners. I'm thinking about stealing the idea and doing it my toilette. Looking forward to me next meal here. Really excellent. An example of ""California"" cuisine at its best. Very fresh ingredients combined creatively yet simply. So much flavor from the vegetable dishes  the cauliflower and heirloom carrots were to die for  and really nice balance in the meat dishes one might expect to be too rich like the chicken liver toasts or the beef carpaccio. This is a place to visit with a few friends so you can order many plates, big and small, and share them all. Service was attentive but not overbearing and the pacing between dishes was impeccable. We loved TBD. Can't wait to go back. How can the meat be so perfect and everything around it be so bland? stars for meat, drink and ambience People's other reviews are pretty spot on. You have to know what to order here. It is the definition of hit and miss. I didn't have a problem with smoke or the interior (I actually thought it was pretty nice) but the food. . most of it was very salty. I love salt, so I was stoked, but if you don't you might be disappointed. Celery stick cocktail: boring. That's it. Scallops: bland. Would've been much better perhaps seared, or with something sharp/bitter to bring out the flavors. Pickles: pretty good. Lamb: good. not amazing, but good. beets and lamb are an interesting combo. Arepa: YUM! I can't really say more. It's a simple, tasty dish. Carrots with lentils: good, but proportions were off. Cauliflower: Good. The Beef Bavette was amazing. The chef needs to take the inspiration for this and spread it all over the menu. Perfectly cooked, deliciously turnips, meaty and hearty. Semolina Cake and  Smores were both delicious. Smores were all melty and not too sugary. Semolina cake had kumquats not too sweet, cake was not dry at all. So good!!Again, as others have said, good service, some great dishes, but they need to work out the kinks (soon! a restaurant in SF won't survive with that level of inconsistency). Actually, .  stars. I came in with high expectation after seeing all the delicious pictures on Yelp. Upon walking in, I was surprised to learn that it has the same owner and executive chef as AQ just a few doors down. Didn't have the best impression of AQ's food, so maybe this will be better right? Just marginally. Pictures of the uni potatoes was the main reason I chose this restaurant. I love uni. It's my first time having uni outside of a Japanese restaurant and I can't say that I'm a fan. It tastes just like how it looks  uni. & potatoes. If the potatoes were softer maybe it would have gone better together. Beef bavette was highlight of the meal. It was indeed buttery & delicious, and the collared greens adds a nice touch of flavor. Turnips went well with the dish too. Kale & leek salad  good standard starter dish. The hazelnut ""cheese"" complimented the raw kale. Unfortunately, can't give too many koodos to this since its hard to mess up a kale salad. Cauliflower & raisin starter  tasty but way too salty, especially for an appetizerKumquat cake  delicious! and I don't even like kumquat (is that how you spell it?!)rice pudding  couldn't get past the second bite. This was way too earthy tasting, didn't feel like dessert. Our waitress noticed it was barely touched and didn't charge us which was nice. Overall, TBD has its uniqueness with the drawers that stores all your silverware/menu/napkins. Service was great. Decor is nice and welcoming. Menu is creative, but taste, a few good ones and a few misses. `Meh. I had high expectations based on the other reviews, but left the restaurant thinking I would probably not be back.  The evening started off on a promising note with the seaweed topped bread.  It was perfectly grilled and topped with unique yumminess.  The kale & celery salad that followed was overdressed for me, but I know I like my salads more underdressed than the average diner.  The lamb was tender and flavorful, but the rest of the dishes were misses for me.  The pork wurst was decently flavored, but the texture was a bit too mealy for me.  The beef bavette was prepared just the way I like it  medium rare tending on the rare side, but was way too salty. And in the chicken & dumplings dish we ordered, the dumpling was slightly undercooked and part of the chicken was way undercooked  raw to the point that I had to reassure my friend who bit into it that I'm sure she wasn't going to contract salmonella. That said, the service was attentive and they apologized profusely when we showed them the raw chicken bits.  They comped that dish and threw in a complimentary s'mores dessert which was definitely a highlight.  I also liked that each table has built in drawers that house your flatware, napkins and menus.  A fun whimsical touch. The restaurant has promise, but seems like they have a few culinary tweaks to work out. I have been a long time fan and customer of AQ so I was really psyched to try TBD.  In the past month I've tried THREE TIMES including going once in person and couldn't get a table.  It would be one one thing if the place was packed, but it looks half empty much of the time when I walk by.  When I stopped by to book a party of  they left me standing there.  I really want this place to be successful, but work with me a little! Help me help you! My wife and I had dinner at TBD for the first time a few days ago. We are familiar with AQ having been there a few times and were delighted to find another restaurant of similar quality in the neighborhood. We both enjoyed TBD. The food is creative we enjoyed the Lamb, lamb carpaccio and the cauliflower.  The food was very good worthy of another visit and a recommendation to our friends. The service is very good. The wait staff does not hover however they kept an eye in us and were at our seating always at the right time. The surroundings are right in line with the SOMA loft look very clean and open. The room is a little warm because of the open fire pits used to prepare all the food. Keep away from wearing wool sweaters think of layering your clothing.  We will return for the food and the service. All good This place is really cute and affordable (dishes are , , or  dollars.  It is cool to sit upstairs or at the bar so you can watch the embers burn. As others wrote, layer your clothing as it can be a little warm. Not to be missed  DEFINITELY eat the lamb. I don't even like lamb, and it was awesome. The carrots/lentils and smoked cauliflower were also delicious. We also ordered the scallops, crab, chicken & dumplings, and smores. My friend was obsessed with the smores. Service was great. FYI aware of your surroundings when coming and going to the restaurant. Side Story:  Text from my friend  ""We made a reservation at this restaurant in SOMA TBD""   Me: That's great, but can you text me the name so I can tell Bob so he can meet us? Friend: It's really called TBD. . . hipsters. This place is a super fun little hangout around a big cozy campfire oven. Perfect for groups of friends to share plates of delicious  and well put together food! The atmosphere is pleasantly casual and the service is warms and friendly! I recommend the ham, carrots, leeks and the arepa.  Oh and you have to get desert! Lots of variety and the presentation of the food is immaculate!  Try it out for yourself and be adventurous with the menu.  The top chefs will do you no wrong! They are amazing! Cheers Chef Alex and Mark! Sarah and Chris Nelly's It's Hot in Herre, should be the theme song for TBD.  We literally could have been buck naked and still been sweating.  We were seated at the mezzanine level, above the cooking area, heat definitely rises and ladies, you will smell like you came from a BBQ after you leave.  Perfect hipster ski chalet atmosphere.  Think lots of knotted wood, antlers and an open hearth.  Super friendly staff and interesting method of pricing on the menu. The pickled beets were unique and wonderfully paired with the Serrano.  Absolutely loved the lamb and the uni with potatoes.  Grits and crab, a little bland, but grew on me, tasted light.  The veal and pork sausage was a fabulous way to finish off the savory courses.  Least favorite was the scallops, just not a huge fan of citrus.  Similar to a ceviche, but not quite there.  Desserts were good, especially the semolina cake with kumquats, I hate kumquats, it worked and there was a nice caramelized crust to the cake.  Rice pudding was more like a soup, flavors good with the unexpected candied squash, but texture a bit runny.  Gripe: due to the method of cooking, the kitchen pumps out dishes not in the order it should arrive, from light to heavy.  At times we felt overwhelmed by the number of dishes on the table, the timing of the kitchen created a backlog of courses, I like no more than two dishes in front of me.  Overall a good meal, fun atmosphere and worthy of a return visit.  Make sure to secure a rezi, they are busy along with their big sister a couple doors down. Try as much as you can! Each dish is paradoxically simple and complex. . . Delicious! And silverware, menus, and napkins are conveniently located in a drawer for easy access. My boyfriend and I had a wonderful meal to celebrate my birthday, and the service was fantastic.  I just love the group service style. . . it is fast and everyone is attentive.  Here is what we had:Winter citrus, scallop & fennelrainbow trout, buckwheat waffle & dillDungeness crab, grits, & mustarduni, dry farmed potato, jalapeño & scallionheirloom carrots, sprouted legumes, sesame & mintleg of lamb, charmoula, puntarele & sunflower seed milk blood orange creamsicle soft serveMay favorite dishes were definitely the uni potato dish and the scallops.  The scallops had a mild smokiness to them that was set off by the citrus and the fennel (which was featured in the dish a few different ways, including a fennel juice granita of sorts).  And Uni and potatoes?? Who would have thought?!? It was a creamy, rich dish that had just the perfect amount of spice to it.  Everything else we had was great, the only ""miss"" was the Crab & Grits.  It lacked some sort of acid or kick to it.  There was a whole heck of a lot of crab, which was very refreshing to see, but it was a bit one note in comparison to the rest of the meal.  That said, we still ate all of it! Definitely a place I'd go back to again!  Probably not the best if you are sensitive to noise, but for a date night where you only have to focus on one person, it was great.  Good wine and beer list too! Everything is better cooked on an open fire.  That seems to be the theme here and there is a whole balcony of firewood waiting to go into the fireplace where they cook your dinner in front of you.  Don't go for the ""chefs counter seats near the fire"" unless you don't like having eyebrows or have gone to dinner in full fireman gear. The uni dish is delicious but my favorite was the seaweed bread.  I don't know why we don't eat more seaweed in general it tastes like a new kind of seafood. Anything with veggies on the fire is good, especially the sprouted lentil dish. Don't bother with the s'mores.  The crumbled graham cracker is salty and the chocolate is cold (not what you think of when you imagine a real bonfire s'more) Great atmosphere for date night. First they sat us at the ""chefs table"" but it was a little hot as its right over the open stove fire flames! We moved upstairs and sat at a loft type bar where I could get nice and cozy with my man which is always a plus. We ordered almost everything on the menu. The bread and seaweed was interesting, a bit odd. The best was the carrots and sprouts and the lamb. We tried the uni and potatoes and the beef tar tar which I thought was just okay (hence the  star). The dessert was the s'more  which I thought would have been more authentic because of the open flame cooking theme. It was a fancy deconstructed version. Yes, I cleaned the bowl so I can't say it was bad, but I wouldn't order it again. Wait staff super nice and the crowd is pretty trendy. Good spot to take a date, not so good for dinner with friends as most of the seating is bar style. Fantastic steaks.  Skip their cocktails but try the uni dish! Had been looking forward to coming here for a while and really wanted to like the place. It had seemed like an interesting concept, but for the most part it just results in a more difficult menu to parse. You are left guessing if what you order is appetizer size, entree size or something in between. However, the menu did help expand my vocabulary with its use of esoteric foods that show up towards the end of the description. Alliums? Have to pull out the phone to check Google again. . . Also the menus, along with the napkins and utensils, are stored in a drawer in the table, so you get to do all that yourself. Annoying and pointless. The beef tartare was served with a plate of iced lettuce to make wraps with, instead of toast like almost every other steak tartare is.  These really didn't taste great together and left just a bowl of raw beef and raw egg yolk to eat with a folk. The cauliflower was better but still pretty bland. The shrimp in the entree were served in the shells and whole, which left the task of de shelling them to the diner to complete with a fork and knife. The sweet potato that was served with it was burned to a midnight black color. The pork shoulder was alright. It was served wrapped in tea leaves, which you weren't supposed to eat, and towards the end it became difficult to pull the pork off the leaves without getting leaves in the pork. The killer on this one was it was served in a rimmed bowl with four inch high walls that curved inwards. . . which seemed like a joke. It made it difficult to cut and stab food and just generally diminished the dining experience. Plates are standard for a reason: they work. Overall the food was very earthy and not extremely flavorful. The best dish by far, and the only one I will remember, was the roasted banana ice cream. It had an amazing flavor that actually tasted like roasted and not plain bananas. Unfortunately, the ice cream is changed every week so I wouldn't be getting that again if I went back. The glassware was Riedel, so points for that. Had dinner her last night for a friend's birthday.  We share everything.  Place is very inviting, with it's kitschy camper decor.  People were all quite nice and interested in making sure we were having a great meal.  Our waitress was excellent, just the right level of taking care of us and letting us enjoy our meal.  Speaking of our meal, the four of us split the following: Seaweed bread: the bread and butter were perfect.  My mouth is watering thinking about it.  The seaweed was very good (way better than I expected) and added an ocean y flavor (yea, just like seaweed).  A couple of bit had the little seaweed balls that were full of salty water.  I think this dish could be better if it were topped with wild greens or something, but that's just me.  Scallops in rosemary ice.  Very cool presentation, as the little scallops come buried in the ice.  The rosemary flavor was quite mild and the scallops were cooked perfectly.  Loved this dish.  Beef tartar: our of this world.  I want to recreate this dish.  It's a generous portion and seasoned beautifully, served with some little multigrain, dark crisps and a quail egg.  A hint of citrus.  This was a home run! Arepas: excellent, tasty arepas.  They were thicker and more substantial than I'm used to, but we chowed them down quite quickly.  Broccoli Humus with sardines: my least favorite dish because of the sardines (very fishy).  The sardine lovers at the table loved the dish.  The broccoli humus was crazy good and the dish was served with some small flowerettes of broccoli.  Andouille sausage: was enticingly served in a beautiful dish. ;)  It's house made by someone who knows exactly what makes a great sausage.  The sauce it came with looked kind of like a mole but tasted more savory.  Super good.  Beef ribeye for two: a substantial serving of great beef perfectly cooked.  Served with some capolini (spelling?) onions and (I think) leeks.  This was another home run. We started with an assortment of their loopholes cocktails (i. e. no hard alcohol).  I'm usually not a fan of these as they taste like rice wine most of the time.  These were excellent.  The Nogroni could've passed for an actual Negroni.  The winner for sure.  The Vive Vive Vive was a lemon based cocktail that had some sweetness (not overpowering) and a nice, fresh flavor.  A good second choice.  The Old Fashioned was based on a stout beer and was tasty but our least favorite. We'll definitely be back! They just opened, but doing a fantastic job. Loved the bean nettle soup, cabbage and clams, wild mushroom arepa with whipped tofu. Loved watching the chefs at the flame! Really enjoyed this new find! My friend and I didn't win lottery tickets at the Orpheum so we decided to try a new restaurant instead. I'm so glad we did! Although the menu is a little confusing or off putting, don't let it distract you. Although I go to a ton of restaurants, I'm definitely not a foodie. I like things explained to me straight and simple without a lot of fluff so I didn't like the menu at first. However, the food was well worth getting through the confusion. It's more of a share plates with your friend type of place so we shared the broccoli hummus, the carrots with lentils, the rib eye with brussel sprouts, and the gourmet s'mores dessert. There is not one thing I can complain about!! It was all excellent, and I will definitely be going back for the dessert. Wowza! The vibe is also very warm and comforting. It so reminded me of my days back in the midwest with the firewood and hearth, but a much cooler version of the midwest. The service was definitely better than average, and there were multiple people very attentive to our table. I highly recommend this place, and I'll be going back! Had dinner there last night  have to say the decor is the coolest ever. . . who knew that camping lanterns could make such a unique chandelier.  The food was as interesting and unusual as their decor  delicious and complex.  Absolutely have the ""bread and butter""  it was topped with seaweed and truly amazing.  There are no simple dishes here  each one had multiple flavors and ingredients.  I would recommend going with several people (there were four of us), so that you can share and try everything.  The only challenge we had was that two of our party was allergic to shellfish and fish  and their menu was pretty heavily focused in that area. We were still a bit hungry, so we made up for it by sharing two desserts  and I'm glad that we did!Service was good and the server was helpful.  Food came out almost too fast. . . When I heard AQ was opening up a new restaurant, I knew I had to try it. The concept for this restaurant is quite different though  it breaks the menu into how the dish is prepared  raw, smoked, hearth + embers, grill, plancha, and sweet (dessert). Then each dish is organized by price range and size; the more triangles, the more expensive it is. The higher up on the menu, the smaller the portion; and the lower on the menu, the larger the portion. The ambiance is a lot of fun, playing on the cabin theme of wood and a fire pit. The feeling is eclectic, with furniture coming from all over but welcoming. Not sure how many of you have been to Failla Wine tasting room, but it had that cabin feel. There is an upstairs, which although has less energy, it does have a fun view of the kitchen from above. Disclaimer: you will stink wherever you sit. So just wear your dirty clothes. Favorites:) Bread & Butter  Basically bread with seaweed (not the kind in sushi, the raw ones) on top. The crunchy texture and salty taste were so fun and delicious. This is a different dish that you definitely cannot get anywhere else! A must order) Uni, dry farmed potato and jalapeno/scallion. This was a fun dish, can't go wrong with Uni. I enjoyed the combo with the potatoes. . . something you don't get everyday. They also gave a lot of uni, which I thought was worth it for the price ($, but you get larger portions and we shared too). ) Beef Ribeye for Two  cannot pass on this one! The beef was perfectly cooked  burnt and crispy on the outside, but soft and tender on the inside. Also, they gave a lot of meat, which I guess they should for $. But it was worth it. . . I was so full that my bf ended up eating more than half of mine. I hope they change up the Brussell sprouts though. . . I wish they were a little more tender and not raw. Can pass on: ) Broccoli hummus. Although good, it tasted like something we could make at home. Nothing unique enough that stood out to us. ) Bone Marrow. This was really good, don't get me wrong. But they didn't give much. . . maybe our bones just weren't that great. Or maybe my bf took the bone with more marrow. But it didn't seem worth it. You can also get this at other restaurants, so I'd pass. At the end of our meal, they gave us our bill on a cute mini clipboard that had a metal chicken foot claw holding our receipt. It was so cute!  I'd return. I will wait a while for the menu to change up a bit though. Service also felt very new. They didn't completely know their dishes yet (this was on //, and their restaurant opened //) and sometimes had to read from their little notebook (aww, how cute!). But hopefully they are more well rehearsed by now. Went to celebrate my wife's promotion. I called day of, and the host said that while they didn't have any reservations available, he would put my name on the list and if anyone cancelled I'd get their spot. Otherwise I'd be a walk in. Got there at pm on a Friday night and was immediately seated on the mezzanine as a walk in, although I'm glad we were seated there because we got a great view of the hearth and could watch everything being prepared. The dishes were good, but not all great. Surprisingly, all of the vegetarian dishes we got ((like the heirloom carrots) were the best. The sausage dish was also good. With some wine and beer, the total including tip was $  exactly what we spent at State Bird Provisions a couple weeks earlier. The food and atmosphere was good, but not worth the price tag. I love AQ so stopped in to TBD on a whim by myself on a Monday night.  Some other reviewer nailed it when they described it like 'modern rustic but posh campfire vibe. '  Or something like that :)Totally laid back staff running everything.  Great music playing (like TV on the Radio).  Piles and piles of wood for their grills and oven.  Fun menu with the different categories of dishes, and then the little icons to represent price.   You could easily spend a lot there having a feast with friends, or be full after one dish by yourself (like I was!). Wonderful interesting combinations. . . . My favorite: the scallops with persimmon, pumpkin seeds and shaved raw sunchokes.  Awesomeness.   And the apple soft serve ice cream with caramel ribbons across the top.  Savory sweet. Love it.  Need to get back there! We had an amazing server, he was kind and knowledgable but the food was a big dussapintment. Salty and underwelhimng dishes. The smoked trout was way too salty and served with a cold waffle. They just opened up so may be they are still ironing out the details. Have we become too self reliant on the use of acronyms since we prefer texting over talking in our increasingly digitalized world? IMHO yes. I like IM my BFF and ROTFL and like she tells me to KMA and then I like tell her to STFU and so I keep it on the QT ASAP. OMG TMI. Totes McGotes indeed. In this spirit, the prodigious AQ has just sired TBD, a slightly more casual spot just DD, I mean, two doors down on the dour block of Mission between th and th. That's my 'hood, so UNTCO, man. Jamie W. (that's a real initial!) was the one to suggest we try it since he was hearing good buzz about it. We managed to land a table on the main floor just a half hour in advance, so we felt good culinary karma coming our way, especially when we walked by the huge, custom built wood fired grill that true testosterone must have built (photo: bit. ly/fRcM). Fire good. Me hungry. Got it. The faux vintage, industrial chic decor fits nicely with the eclectic menu neatly folded in drawers under the tabletop (photo: bit. ly/cQVPK). Don't close it yet because that's where you'll find your silverware and napkins, too (photo: bit. ly/gWzE). I didn't know I was going to set my own table, but the informality works in here. We started with a couple of libations  Jamie with a smooth $ half pint glass of Devil's Canyon Silicon Blonde (photo: bit. ly/cQVoPX) and me with a refreshing $ glass of Vive Vive Vive, a sherry infused with star anise and juniper berries with a slice of lemon (photo: bit. ly/cnKLYt). Perusal of the food menu was like reading an issue of Consumer Reports with prices marked by one to four pyramids with each representing a multiple of $ (photo: bit. ly/fTwC). First up was the $ Persimmons, Sunchokes and Bay Scallop Ceviche, a surprising blend of fresh flavors and textures that provided an audacious introduction (photo: bit. ly/LrZtt). Another unpredictable mix came in the form of the $ Goat Feta, Pomegranate and Farro wrapped in Swiss Chard (photo: bit. ly/eir). Rustically simple but vegan friendly tasty. A slightly oddball dish came next with the $ Rainbow Trout on Buckwheat Waffle with Dill (photo: bit. ly/dBKTl). While the waffle had a nice texture, the trout didn't work for me as the weird combo of flavors doesn't work unless I have plenty of maple syrup on hand in a cabin shaped tin container. Pass. We rebounded with our shared main course, the Beef Ribeye for Two with Brussel Kraut and Alliums (photo: bit. ly/canog). Finally here was a slab of beef that took full advantage of the intense heat of the grill with an unbeatable char on the outside but perfectly pink and juicy on the inside (photo: bit. ly/cxksAK). It's quite possibly the best prepared steak south of Market (did I really state that, Alexander?), and it better be at $ per person. Dessert came in two parts. First up was the $ S'mores, a thick bar of rich chocolate ganache served in a huge bowl with browned dollops of creamed marshmallow and ground chicory (photo: bit. ly/leMUqx). A campfire favorite is given the typically SF foodie treatment. However, the scene stealer turned out to be the $ Parsnip Cake with Toffee and Spiced Pear, which turned out to be the perfect after dinner treat for the holiday season (photo: bit. ly/fRcM). Service was near impeccable and well timed, so why not five stars? Even with a miss on the trout and waffle combo, owner Matt Semmelhack and chef Mark Liberman could refine the creations in the kitchen a bit more to match the flavors that come directly from the grill. I think it's on its way after just a few weeks. I'd love to see the menu change seasonally like AQ so it can KMSO* TYVM. *KMSO = Knock My Socks Off. . . get with it, dudeFOOD   stars. . . eclectic combos need refinement but the ribeye for two is killerAMBIANCE   stars. . . so SoMa with the big grill center stage, not too noisySERVICE   stars. . . staff is excellent hereTOTAL   stars. . . NJoy TBD. . . it's quite good NK I had a wonderful dinner at TBD on /. The ambiance is nice inside (quite warm, however). We sat upstairs overlooking the woodfire grill. We ordered lots of things off the menu, which changes ALL THE TIME so don't get used to the idea. Our favorites were the clams and toast, charred leeks, and smores dessert. I didn't really like the uni, but I'm glad we tried all the things we did. Service was attentive but it looked like they were still trying to get in their groove (we didn't have utensils, for example). I really liked watching the cooking downstairs. The saison beer we ordered was great. Very fun experience and I would definitely come back. Note, you might smell like a campfire when you leave, so best not to go before your show at the Orpheum. I entered TBD as a single diner with a reservation and was consigned to the second floor.  I was alone at the counter there and remained so throughout my meal.  True, when I left it seemed that the tables on the first floor were full but there were spaces at the bar.  Was I too old?  Did I not pass the looks test of the martinet who sent me off to siberia?  Who knows.   The only slight show of regret on the part of the restaurant was when a staff member told me that the lighting on my level was not working properly but they hoped to fix that!  Why treat a patron so poorly?The absence of common sense and hospitality aside the food here ranges from very good to stunning.  I started with smoked trout with waffles and dill.  The trout was lightly smoked and firm.  The dill perfectly fresh.  And the waffles were the perfect carriers for the fish.  Heirloom carrots had been touched by flame and their natural sweetness was thereby accentuated.  The carrots came with raw lentils and sesame.  The juxtaposition of the earthy lentils and the sweeter carrots was brilliant.  A wonderful plate of food. A main of pork cooked in tea leaves came with caramelized olives and turnips.  The pork was tender to the fork but was shown up by the perfectly sourced vegetables. Instead of a dessert I got an arepa that came with hedgehog mushrooms and cave aged jack cheese.  Everything here was very nice, but the cheese was stunning.  I left thinking highly of the cuisine and poorly of the front of the house management. Went here on a Saturday evening with my husband and two friends. At first I was really impressed with the atmosphere  i really love the decor and the open kitchen. But sadly I just wasn't that impressed by either the food or the service. Our waitress was nice enough, but just didn't seem that enthusiastic or happy to be there. She wasn't that helpful when we asked for recommendations. And when we wanted to order stuff in waves, she basically refused our request saying that we'd then have an awkward   minutes between some dishes. We would've been okay with that, but they seemed to really prefer not to do that, so we waited until we knew everything we wanted to order (I later heard her give the same spiel to the table next to us, so I guess that's a restaurant policy). My cocktail was good  stout bourbon  very heavy on the stout taste (i like bourbon so kind of missed that flavor, but the waitress did warn me that i really had to like stout to enjoy that drink) but overall really good. The food was fine, but just nothing really wow ed me, and for the price and portion size of most items, I just can't in good conscience recommend people go here. First, most of the menu items were cold, even the ones I'd expect to be warm. I was in the mood for some warming food, but that didn't happen. I can't really point to anything ""bad"" per se about the food, i just feel like I've had better small plates at a more reasonable price at other restaurants. Overall was definitely left with a ""meh"" feeling. I probably won't go back, and I don't plan to recommend this place to friends. Update: I visited TBD recently and they had switched to a tasting menu. Not a huge fan, as it took away the casual vibe. I'd rather just go to AQ!Old review: Love this new restaurant! The ambiance is casual and cool. The food is simple and delicious. Perfect for a date or drinks after work. The setup allows you to watch the open fire cooking which is fun. The cocktails were also delicious. The perfect alternative to AQ, for a more laid back night. We ate at TBD last night.  We loved AQ, so we had high expectations.  In general, we had a great experience.  The food is creative and mostly delicious, the service was great, and we were impressed by the fact that it is all prepared on a wood fire.  The atmosphere is very bare  I see what they're going for, but it looked like it could at least use some colored paint on the wall.  Also, a lot (most?) of the seating is at a bar  there is a downstairs bar and upstairs seating along a bar facing the downstairs.  Had we known, we would have requested a table when we made our reservation. The dishes were all really interesting combinations that I hadn't seen elsewhere.  The ones we thought worked the best were the leeks with smoked oysters and buttermilk, the uni with potatoes and jalapenos, and the pork shoulder braised in tea leaves.  The pork was prepared perfectly and was full of flavor.  We also enjoyed the heirloom carrots and the arepa with mushrooms, cheese and tofu.  We were less impressed with the scallops, persimmons and sunchokes.  We had the s'more dessert and that was pretty awesome too. Somewhere this creative is unlikely to nail every dish, and the space could use a little help to fit the level of the food (doesn't have to be fancy just something a little. . . more), but overall we thought the food was delicious and different and we had a really nice meal.  We'll go back. Sometimes you go to a new restaurnant wanting the place to win. Sometimes you know the minute you walk in that's your hopes were misplaced. Not the case here. We'd visited the web site and reviewed the menu and knew what we wanted before we walked in the door. Having a short five minute wait we looked at the paper menu and every single dish we'd mapped out was no longer on the menu. . . including the wine we were hoping for (Chateau Musar). OK, we're flexible and were sure we'd find something good,We were seated. The tables are small desks with a drawer. In the drawer was the silverware, napkin and menu. Why? Gimmick. This is State Bird Provision gimmickiness in a different form. I mean, no big deal really. You can pull your chair back to get a fork from the drawer but I never could figure out why they did this. Once seated, we realized there is a single achilles heel that will prevent me from returning. The impressive wood burning grills made everything in the room reek of smoke. . . including us. They really ought to have a discount coupon for a dry cleaners with the check. We got home and had to shower to remove the smoke. Our clothes go straight to the dry cleaners. There would seem to be no way around this. You will leave this place smelling like you just left a campfire. No joke. The food? Well. . . OK. We started with the winter pickles. Brined radishes, small green tomatoes and fennel. They were ok but there was a sameness in the preparation that rendered a bland experience. The lack of seasoning and spice was a theme that recurred in most of the dishes. Next up was cauliflower with gribiche and raisins. The dish was ok again. It too suffered a blandness although the cauliflower was cooked properly. The soup came up next. The vegetables in the bowl were so big that we were required to use a knife to eat soup. I mean, really? Cut the freaking vegetables. The soup itself ok I suppose. My girlfriend thought it subtle, I thought it nearly flavorless. Next up was the heirloom carrots, lentils and white sesame. First let me just say that this was served in a bowl that was humongous. It took a quarter of the table to bring a portion that seemed tiny in such a huge bowl. Use a smaller serving vessel. Also, don't overcook the carrots. Apparently you want them blackened on the skin but they were limp and black. Really? The first of the two ""entrees"" was the pork andouille, escarole and fenugreek. This was quite good. The texture of the sausage was perfect. The escarole was delicious. Very good dish. Next up was pork cooked in teal leaves, caramelized olives and celeriac. So so. The pork was ok. Everything else in the dish was cold. Another dish served in a giant bowl. Dessert was parsnip cake, toffee and spiced pear. Good concept poorly executed. A bit of a burn to the cake. The pear didn't taste spiced. The kitchen needs a chef de cuisine with experience and perspective. There is no thought whatsoever given to the diner experience. It seems to be that dinner is whatever the chef thinks is ""cool"" which translates to gimmicky. The serving ware needs a total rethink. There needs to be a surer hand in the kitchen. Most of all the place needs an architect and a prayer. No more hipster camp outs for me. It's all about the food. The ambiance is rustic and vintage. The wood burning kitchen is the star of the show from our mezzanine seats to the main dining  room and on this Thursday winter's eve the place was full of energy and warmth. As the sister restaurant of AQ I was expecting dainty and romantic and instead got hearty with the comforts of a modern log cabin culinary experience. We started with the smoked trout and roe dish. Good portion and bursting with flavors balanced by the whole wheat waffle. Next was the uni freshly nestled against the fingerling potatoes (a sea of velvet in your mouth). The rd course was the pork andouille spicy sausage surrounded by bean sprouts and leeks which complemented the hearty meat. We found this to be the most flavorful dish of the evening. Our final course was the gulf shrimp with avocado and black garlic. On my, I have a new love affair with black garlic; I call it culinary crack! We were pleasantly surprised with the flavorful cuisine and would recommend TBD for a warm winter dinner with a group of friends or a relaxing evening with a loved one. Bravo! Solid date spot, still working out some of the kinks. Most of the dishes are meant to be shared and on the smallish side, though not shockingly so, and you'll need to get a few per person to make a meal of it. There were some misses, which isn't entirely unexpected from a restaurant that has opened so recently, but plenty of hits to go with them. What we had:) Swiss chard with goat feta, farro, and pomegranate  good flavors, but farro was under cooked. ($)) Cured salmon with rye waffles and dill  really good, but didn't need to be that large of a serving. ($)) Bread and bean soup  broth was awesome, bread was good, beans were unnecessary. ($)) Bone marrow roast with turnips and winter herb crust  so boring we didn't even finish it (though they kindly removed this from our bill without us even asking!). A total disappoint of a dish. ($)) Tea leaf roasted pork with celeriac, pickled onions, and candied olives  AMAZING. If you see this on the menu, get it. Everything about this one was wonderful. ($)The service was great, if a little over attentive, and the place had a very warm ambiance. Being in the Mid Market area, this isn't a place you'll just pop into. It's not going to become one of my go to restaurants, but I would certainly visit again. Highly creative food sourced and crafted with care. The house cured salmon with rye waffle is light and bursting with flavor. The beef perfectly cooked and seasoned. And the bread and butter with seaweed is so simple and addicting, you'll try to recreate it at home (good luck!). Unlike AQ, the chefs experiment nightly and create limited run specials based on what's in season. These guys are taking risks and it's a breath of fresh air! I do have a bit of a love affair with AQ, so to say that my expectations were high would not be an understatement. I really wanted to like it the ambiance is cute/casual/cozy hipster kind of like a restaurant version of the Ace hotel with a nice big open kitchen. The service was attentive and good from start to finish. And the menu was promising, as I always enjoy a large selection of small/share plates, and there were plenty of items that sounded interesting and possibly delicious. . . In theory. It was funny actually looking back, our server mentioned that ""chef has a really interesting palette, and likes to mix flavors you would never expect. "" And that's just what we got but with really poor execution. There literally wasn't a single entree or dessert on the menu that I would order again and between the three of us who were dining together we ordered a good portion of the menu. In my opinion the food was over salted, and over flavored all together. The smoky options were completely overpowering, and everything else was either too rich/lacking flavor altogether, or just a bad combo. And it's not cheap I mean we're not quite talking AQ prices but I had a $ meal, which I didn't enjoy any part of,  AND I didn't even drink! Overall I would say its one of the more disappointing dining experiences I've had in recent memory (and I eat out A LOT!). Honestly, I will likely steer clear of this place unless I hear they get a new chef. The latest gem in the forlorn but upstart mid Market area, TBD is a unique and aesthetically exquisite dining experience.  A robust campfire smell from the open hearth oven intoxicates you as soon as you open the door, and fills every corner of the restaurant.  The oven's flames are a dramatic backdrop to the meal, whether you are in the ground level dining area as we were or behind the counter on the upper level looking down into the fire.  You can almost feel the intense heat as you watch sweat glistened sous chefs turn out the beautiful, smoke charred dishes at breakneck speed.  The interior boasts plenty of wood and funky, retro decor, including a fun chandelier made of old fashioned red lanterns that hangs over the stairway, and there's a formidable row of local draught beers behind the bar to stave off thirst.  The extremely creative menu features mostly small plates, and the restaurant suggests   plates per person to satisfy an average appetite.  We started with the highly touted bread with homemade butter topped with several kinds of seaweed.  The crisp, slightly burnt bread, the creamy butter, and the fresh, faintly oceanic taste of the seaweed makes for a fun ride.  The Swiss chard, goat feta, and grape dish was lovely, with small portions of farro delicately rolled into the chard for a pleasant surprise.  We then migrated to even more complex and whimsical dishes, including lovingly burnt heirloom carrots with earthy sprouted lentils, nutty white sesame and a slightly sweet syrup  fairly close to perfection.  Then we dug into a plate of fire bronzed winter leeks with oysters topped with an incredible reduction made from buttermilk, cilantro, chopped oysters, and the pureed outer leaves of the leek.  The larger plates included a magnificent Berkshire pork chop, with ribbons of celery root and boudin noir, that was impeccably cooked, tender and very flavorful.  We also loved the head on shrimp atop charred sweet potato, with a heavenly black garlic paste and mounds of mashed avocado blended with toasted pepitas.  To top off the experience, we were guided through our meal by an extremely pleasant, engaging server with a comprehensive knowledge of the menu and all aspects of the restaurant, including the beautiful colored pottery made by a friend of the assistant chef's. This new spot is a more casual AQ with a fire theme  just about everything is made over the fire in the center of the restaurant. There is a great variety, including veggie options. We had the chard/feta/grape/farro from the raw menu, which was great and a very nice start. I love farro. . . Then we had the bread/butter/seaweed which was super interesting  does seaweed have umami? Really rich and satisfying. And pretty! like a little garden on the charred bread. The uni/potato/jalapeno/scallion was wonderful too, and whodathunk to pair uni and potato? The jalapeno and scallion sauce, oh man. The pumpkin soup with onion and hay (?!) was really unique but I felt like I would have really just preferred a traditional pumpkin soup without the balsamic or whatever was in there. The shrimp/avocado/sweet potato/black garlic entree was huge and the shrimp was almost creamy. The menu was pretty simple but when the waitstaff actually explains the dish beyond the   ingredients listed, everything sounds like oh man I gotta get that. And for the most part, it's really damn good. It's still new so we were able to walk in and get seated right away, but I can see the place getting crazy, as hard as they try to be accessible. The decor is very glamping esque (glam camping fyi). Smells of firewood, cozy and warm, good food and wine. JUST the way camping should be. After you've had fun the umpteenth time joking how your dinner plan is TBD, get ready to settle down, but not too long (more on that later), for a thought provoking and delicious meal.  The SOMA location might get some people, but let's hope it deters any uncool people from discovering this wonderful addition to the hood.  The interior is muted and somewhat bare, but the warmth of the wood burning fire from the kitchen will welcome you once you step through the doors.  Cords of wood are stacked on the second level and emphasize the wood burning stove/grill that's used in many of the dishes.  At every seat is a drawer where you will find a menu, napkin, and silverware.  If there were a few crayons and a piece of paper, I would have been in heaven. The menu isn't extensive, but there is still a good variety of items that will tempt your palate.  Little triangles designate the pricing tier for the dish  there's a legend at the bottom of your menu.  It took me a few seconds to figure that part out.  At first I thought it designated spice levels.  Our server was really friendly and encouraged us to place the bulk of our order at one time for the kitchen.  We obliged by starting with an order of  dishes.  And they all came out within minutes  one after another.  From the time we sat down to the time we ate to the time we paid and left  it took us all of  minutes and change.  Never have I had a better meal in less time.  My wish is that they would have paced our meal just a bit versus bringing everything out at once.  Fortunately, the food was delicious. The scallop ceviche with persimmon was probably one of the table favorites.  An unexpected combination of persimmon with scallops, but what an amazing pairing. The autumn salad is also a wonderful way to start your meal.  You start seeing the influence of the wood burning grill beginning with this dish.  We opted to order some grilled bread (recommend) and the flavors of the wood smoke were infused into the bread.  My least favorite dish was probably the steak.  While good, there wasn't anything particularly special about this particular dish. Though we left the restaurant in record time, TBD was actually one of our favorite meals.  It's clear that there's talent in the kitchen and a vision for what is good food.  Complemented by friendly waitstaff and team, my vote for TBD is far from TBD  they've earned my vote. I really liked AQ, so I was excited when TBD opened.  As always, parking out front is really easy.  The space was small, so definitely make your reservation on Urban Spoon. They don't have a full liquor license, so we tried a few of their ""loopholes"" (wine and beer cocktails).  Churhill's bane: good to start, lighter, like a sweet wine with a lemon twist Stout old fashioned: I don't like stout, but it was a good base for this Nogroni: sadly, a bit like cough syrup There was also another celery bitter cocktail, which was a bit too strong and bitter for my tastes, too. . . in the end, we each ended up just getting glasses of wine after those. It's too bad they don't have a full liquor license!Onto food. . I like the 'to be determined' concept, depending on what's local and fresh.  Prices come in  tiers depending on the dish.  The server was a bit shocked we were going to order so much food for  of us, but it ended up working out fine. . . Scallop ceviche: with persimmons, thinly sliced turnip, a black tea vinaigrette, and toasted sunflower seeds. It was a great fall dish, and it was generous on the scallops.  The black tea was subtle, and the seeds added a nice crunch. Clams: amazing broth, so it's good that it comes with warm toasted bread to soak it up. Clams themselves have good flavor, and the cabbage in the dish is interesting. Definitely drink up all the soup!. Trout on rye waffle: we didn't order this at first but then saw it on the adjacent table. Rye waffles were pretty awesome in texture, thin, great as a base for smoked trout and roe. I love the feeling of roe popping in your mouth, and the dill adds a nice freshness. Berkshire pork chop: this was HUGE. The ""boudin noir"" was a bit unexpected as the ""sauce,"" and the accompanying vegetables (especiallhy the beets) were nice. The pork was tender and quite large. Pasture raised beef: New York strip served medium, with brussels sprouts and roasted fennel. It was pretty good but also not that unique. Dutch oven cake: loved the sweet pear balanced with parsnip, as well as the caramel sauce underneath  great dessert. The servers were all super nice, and everyone was helping out, so there was none of the ""let me get your server"" attitude.  Overall, I like the space a lot  it's very open and casual.  There's an open kitchen, and the *highlight* of the night (yes, we're nerds) was the table.  The tables have drawers built in and have all the utensils you'll need for dinner, as well as the menu, napkin, sugar packets.  The table was so awesome my friend and I kept looking for excuses to open the drawers again. It's slightly different from AQ next door, and it's a great new addition to the neighborhood. I dined for the first time at TBD tonight and absolutely loved everything I ate. I cannot wait to return. Bonus: My hair smelled like a nice wood fire after leaving. : )  What I shared with a friend:Grilled Rabbit with gribichesmoked scallop ceviche (stellar!)roasted cauliflower with raisins and some delicious creamy saucegrilled young lettuces with duck prociuttoarepa with mushrooms and jack cheesemeyer lemon yogurt with pink grapefruit (unsweetened delish that I would eat for breakfast!)Go now! Really? I was super excited when i stumbled across this super hip restaurant with my friend. Ambiance was great and host and bartenders were friendly, and it was only their th day of business!Walked to the back to wash my hands (cool hand washing station) and came back to the bar. Friend looked at me and said, you sure you wanna eat here? And i said, yeah totally! (what a silly question!)Then i looked at the menu. Okay seriously, there's a balance between being cool and hipster and being so offbeat and ""different"" you confuse people. Can't we just categorize food into appetizers, entrees, and desserts? Or veggies and meat/poultry? My friend and I exchanged glances, and walked out as politely as possible, saying thank you of course.  the bartenders looked SO confused.  Definitely a place to shmooze. If you're hungry, look elsewhere (probably my mistake). This is a tiny plates kinda place, where nobody talks or raves about the food, but are instead deep in philosophical conversation.  This place is too cool for me, basically.  I walked further down the street and saw AQ. Same ish menu?!  i guess that means they both use fresh/local/seasonal foods to dictate their menu. . . but it also means their menus look/sound the same.  persimmon everywhere! Visit two:TBD has a great thing going for them.  With a great concept this place benefits from the trickle down effect.  (Solid unique drink menu and warm ambiance)  My one warning to would be diners is that the meat grilling is not very consistent.  I know from the few times I've used real branch charcoal how tricky it can be to evenly spread the heat from the embers.  But it can be done and must be in order to guarantee an evenly cooked product (aka medium rare beef)  I've had both bone in pork chop and beef filet.  On each visit one or the other was a solid medium.  Which in my opinion is just hard to really enjoy.  If they solve this issue, touchdown! My hubby and I were blown away by how good the food was.  I knew going in that the concept was fire  I was a little worried that the food wouldn't be that flavorful, but I was so wrong!  We ordered mostly vegetarian items (of which there are quite a few!) and  non veggie items where they were able to put the meat on the side  this totally made my hubby happy. My faves:potatoes w/jalapenos and uniroasted cauliflower (sauce was delicious)smoked trout on breadarepaother things we got that were yummy:bread and butter seaweedgoat cheese and swiss chardheirloom carrots w/brown sugar sauce and sesamedessert:smores (the chocolate is not melted  I think it's frozen, so it's almost like a smore ice cream)We were pretty stuffed after that meal.  I'd def go back! After reading all the great reviews (and knowing the AQ background) I had pretty high expectations.  So fair or not that had already impacted my view on TBD. Overall I would say this place is good with the potential to be a whole lot better  actually, it should be a whole lot better.  I love restaurants that do small plates of excellent food in a casual atmosphere and TBD certainly aims for that.  Granted the place is still new and making adjustments, but the food did not make me want to book the next reservation ASAP.  Service, however, was excellent. High Points:Scallop ceviche w/persimmon  Our favorite dish.  Nicely balanced  sweet, salty, heat, umami  very fresh.  Not much more to be said. Chard stuffed w/rice  This was complimentary and our second favorite!  The plating was very elegant and appealing, a nod to the fine dining heritage.  The crumbles of understated feta (queso fresco y) were a nice touch. Low Points:Uni w/potato & scallions  The wife LOVES potatoes and even she thought this was a big disappointment.  The dish was basically a pile of potato in a bowl with a couple pieces of uni and maybe  slice of jalapeno and  pieces of scallion.  The ratios were way off and the whole dish was dry and incongruous.  This was screaming for a sauce element and I'm not sure the potato/uni pairing even worked. Arepa w/maitakes  Great idea but the execution and balance needed tweaking.  I barely tasted the mushroom or the cheese and/or tofu on the arepa.  I'd even say the arepa itself was a tad beyond charred and borderline burnt on the bottom.  The dish could have used a sauce or wet ingredient to bind everything together and perhaps also a bright and/or salty element to stand out on the arepa base. We went for an early dinner and oh my goodness, it was amazing!  Everything we had was amazing.  The flavors melted together so beautifully. Absolutely outstanding food! Great wine list, nice ambience, friendly staff. Was a great find! Exciting! I wanted to love this spot but it just didn't happen for me. Recently, I've been checking out new spots that have expensive, smaller portions but that advertise a thoughtful, foodie experience ( and Stonesthrow are both great, new spots for this). While I could see the attempt behind the food, the delivery fell short for me. . . I just didn't react to the dishes with excited tastebuds. What we had:. ($) autumn lettuce with duck prosciutto  meh. ($) cured rainbow trout with waffles  this was interesting, I saw this dish advertised on other nights with salmon and would have preferred that option. ($) rabbit ""stew""  the rabbit was hard to get off the bone, felt like a chore to eat this dish. ($) arepa, aged jack with maitake mushrooms  this was the best dish of them allAgain, I usually suggest most people try places for themselves but my two cents is it may not be worth the stop in and $. Truthfully we were still hungry when we left but weren't excited enough by the experience to add on more of their dishes. We had such an amazing meal here!  As others have said, everything that you need (menu, utensils) can be found in a drawer at your table.  This, and the fact that you can watch the chefs grill food on the plancha from your seat, makes the restaurant pretty awesome!We got there pretty early on a Friday night and had no trouble getting a table.  Everyone there is super friendly and helpful. We ordered the following: autumn lettuce, duck prosciutto  persimmon, scallops clams, hot peppers, dashi arepa, aged jack, mushroom quail beef strip steakEverything was so delicious, but my favorites were definitely the scallops and quail. Persimmon isn't my favorite fruit because it has a funny texture, but it was really good with the scallops (also comes with pine nuts and cilantro).  The quail came with a green purée that tasted mint and/or cilantro based  so good!For dessert, we had the s'mores and cheese plate. The s'mores were soo good!  I guess it's kind of a deconstructed dessert with a piece of melted chocolate, creamy/airy charred marshmallow dollops, graham cracker crumble, and a sweet chicory purée. I'd go back for the s'mores alone!Overall, delicious meal, great ambiance, and great service! Great new spot with inventive food, welcoming decor and great service. My husband and I had dinner here last night after a quick drink next door at AQ. The interior is nicely appointed with minimal clean design that makes you feel like you're in a modern camping lodge. Our waitress and the rest of the staff were extremely nice and went out of their way to make us feel welcome. When I asked which viognier they recommended (three to choose from by the glass) our waitress offered to bring me tastings of all of them and was very knowledgable. One of the kitchen staff attending the fire brought us a special treat of their smoked ham which was to die for! All of the other dishes we had, all great for sharing, were wonderful. A stand out is the uni served with fingerling potatoes and some kind of tasty green garlic jalapeno sauce. . . does it make sense? YES. Looking forward to going back soon!  stars  innovative, warm & friendly, and delicious!  Despite being open for only two weeks, their service (like AQ, professionally efficient and non intrusive) and food were down.  This reminded me of why I loved AQ when it first opened  playful dishes with unusual combinations that comes together in delightful, composed bites. We (party of ) walked in on a Sat night / at pm and waited for just  minutes to be seated at the bar.  The place was packed and friendly host Matt suggested we get a drink at AQ and they'd call us when seats opened.  We surely did.  Sitting at the bar, we were welcomed by Timothy who introduced us to TBD's concept.  Later we came to learn that he is the Einstein behind the bar program for both AQ and TBD.  Head honcho Lieberman was hard at work, expediting and serving key guests.  Even prodigy pastry chef Maya was in the house, albeit not working that night.  We got a bottle of Unti (pinot noir of course) and had the following:* market pickles  trio of green tomatoes (some kick was added), beans (sweet kind of sour), beets (neutral & balanced out other two)* Andouille sausage  love the burst of flavor and juice when one bites through the skin * potatoes with uni  uni, uni uni! close tie to first but see below * cured salmon with rye waffle, ikura, and a dill sauce  this was our favorite.  I usually don't eat rye but the combination of it all  genius!* soft serve dessert  lovely orange citrus with a peanut brittle; perfect way to cap off the evening with a little sweetness The restaurant itself was open and bright, compared to AQ's open but dark.  I agree from other reviews that the music was on the loud side.  I couldn't hear the person seated just two seats away, which is too bad, since this is a neighborhood place concept.  Still, we were able to strike up a conversation with the person who sat alone next to us, who turned out to be a food writer from NYC.  What are the chances of that, especially since we almost never eat out after pm and almost always eat by reservation only?  Another advantage is that the kitchen slows down, so we were able to talk with Timothy, aforementioned bar Einstein, about his drink research and the other AQ sister restaurant projects. That's the magic of TBD and look forward to future trips with current friends and meeting new ones.  We're unlikely to start eating at pm but we'll certainly come back on a neighborhood night, Sun Wed, when the staff may not be so busy and able to chat.  One last note is that I was horrified to see some Yelp references to this as the next hipster place to gather.  Sigh.  Please just come as a decent human being and enjoy a night out without loudly showing off and trying to be seen.  Really, nobody cares. Salty, overpriced, undersized portions.  $ wines listed for $. Order the carrots w/ lentils and sesame  yum! Fabulous vibe and a unique concept. Wish I had a chance to give  stars for this sister restaurant of AQ, but all I can say is that was the best discovery of . They have tapas style and the flavors, the sauces that they make to flavor the meat and veggies are beyond this world. Excellent idea and very innovative to have that drawer type of thing for the cutlery at every table. I really adored TBD! Live fire cooking has always been my favorite style of the culinary arts. It's unpredictable, requires a certain level of attention, and when done right, it can be one of the most amazing things ever. Take Asador Etxebarri in Axpe (bit. ly/JqxsI) or Ekstedt (ekstedt. nu) where there sole focus is the live fire. TBD represents that primal style in SF now. We came in before a show down at the Warfield on the nd day of opening. Having been fans of AQ and getting to know some of the staff there, it was amazing to find more familiar faces in the new space. Some of the chefs here cooked at Atelier Crenn formerly so it was good to see them in the new venture. We sat at the bar and had almost direct adjacency to the hearth and it's custom built modular grills, plancha, and other implements. After looking through the menu we went with: Rabiit Hunter's Stew Andouille sausage Young potato, uni, jalapeno Grilled sirloin of beef Root beer float Dutch oven cakeEverything was excellent. I think the sirloin might have had a section of slight over wellness but it still was darn tasty. The stew and the sausage were particularly tasty. Good thing the opening menu is so ambitious, there's still tons of things I'd like to try. We didnt even do any alcohol imbibing so there's still the wine, beer and cocktails that need tasting also. Staff are awesome, and the patronage is already crowded considering the area. The space has a lot of wooden elements, as you'd think from a hearth focused restaurant. The tableside service has the elements of Relæ (bit. ly/lWdS) in Copenhagen where they have the serving utensils in drawers below. definitely looking for a return as there so much to try and the staff are simply awesome. Great debut! .  stars Have you ever wanted to taste a hipster hunting lodge? Go to TBD, The great news is that it tastes great!I am a total AQ fan. It's my favorite restaurant in SF and more importantly it's the far more hipster & picky French Spouse's favorite fine dining place so you'd think I would be a fan of this place but if anything as a kid who actually was raised hanging out in deer blinds with my dad during hunting season I find the whole antler art/going to faux basic things makes me want to groin punch hipsters. However TBD like AQ is Substance over Style. The place was hopping and we didn't have a res. so we got a spot at the bar. The bar person/server was friendly and knowledgable about the dishes and able to answer all our questions. We got a ton of food, more than we needed as two people but damn we wanted everything on the menu. The menu is plates ranging from  to  dollars and the price depends more on the ingredients than the size so ask your server what ones work best as  entrees. For example the potatoes and sea urchin was  dollars but was a small plate which the clams at the same price were more entree size. The dishes we had were:. Bread, butter & seaweed , a high price for bread but holy crap do they make the perfect yeasty bread then grill to just the right char and then top it with seaweed that gives it the salt it needs. It was awesome. . cured wild salmon, rye waffle with dill  again this was simple dish but so damn good, the dish reminded me of eating gravad lax on rye bread in Sweden on a cold winter morning. The rye waffle were so rich in flavour and the salmon was cured beautiful, the dill and the cream sauce were just perfect. If they do brunch they had better put that on the menu.  young potato, sea urchin, kalapeno, scallon,  this dish was a total miss for us. It felt incomplete and there just wasn't enough sea urchin to potato ratio and I would have liked the potatoes to have more of a roasted or char flavour. . pumpkin soup, onions and hay , this is some fancy dancy soup and yet it taste just like pumpkin soup should taste on a fall evening. Texture was added with pumpkin seeds, the pickled onions and the hay. . turnips, calf's liver and blackberries , This to me was such a homey fall/winter dish. The liver wasn't over cooked and it was cleaned pretty well ad the turnips and berries were the perfect counter point to the deep flavour of the liver. I like that they cooked all of the turnips not just the bulbs. Really satisfying dish if you like liver. . cabbage, local clams, hot peepers, dashi , the French Spouse had this as their entree and they loved the clams, the bread and the broth. The cabbage could have used some braising before being put on the fire to grill. . S'mores,  If you like to burn your marshmallows and then eat them, this is the dessert for you. Homemade marshmallows are a thing of beauty and then toasting them til they char is so damn good. They only have license for beer and wine but they have a ton of beer on tap and the prettiest beer tap despencer. They also have some non alcoholic drinks that aren't afterthoughts like ice creams and grilled lemonade both very tasty. So the decor is more causal than AQ but we ended up spending more than at AQ. I think you could get by spending only  a person for a full dinner but    per person is more realistic for the average dinner and you could easily spend far more as we did especially if you are a glutton like me. This so going to become a regular place for us to eat. It's wheelchair accessible for the first floor and bathrooms. There is a mezzanine that will have more tables in the future.  The biggest issue is noise. There is no sound baffling at all and lots of hard surfaces. How hard is it to add some sound panels, heck cover them in plaid to keep with the camp theme. If you are hard of hearing this place would be an issue. The music was so freaking loud and really needed to be half as loud.  I missed about half of what our server said and they were quite close to me. The lighting is good. It's actually more like a  / stars than  and certainly some place I plan I going back and trying everything on the menu. Also for the folks saying it's a dangerous neighborhood, they are just wrong. It's a neighborhood with not a lot of night life but it is totally safe. Also there is free parking after six right in front of the place. Your freaking car will be safe so long as you aren't an idiot that leaves things out in the open. You know what drives me wild?Guys who can write well. Just give me a guy that can arouse my mind and goodbye inhibitions! Showing me ""Debbie Does Dallas"" doesn't count, ok?You know what drives me absolutely wild? Guys who have the balls to push the limits in the creativity department. Justin Baldoni didn't become an overnight sensation with all the ladies for nothing: youtube. com/watch?v=hVTr…. I'm sure every guy in America hates him now because who can top that kind of proposal? Too bad Mr. NSS fell asleep halfway through the video. Shucks. When it comes to the culinary world, Chef Mark Liberman pushes the limits in the creativity department and it definitely shows at AQ's new casual sister restaurant, TBD Restaurant which opened its doors on Tuesday.  TBD's edgy menu of small plates focuses on modern Californian cuisine prepared on an open fire grill and hearth. The menu is divided into  sections: Raw, Smoked, Hearth, Grill, Plancha, and Sweet and are priced in tiers: $, $, $, $. Portions are small which seems to be a trend with all the new hot spots in SF. About  dishes per a person is recommended so the bill can quickly rack up. Except to spend about $ pp including one cocktail. ~ * ~ D R I N K S / F O O D ~ * ~Having come from nearby Mr. Smiths, I was tipsy and forgot about my  drink max so I ordered one of their loophole cocktails. Except I think they forgot about the other half of my Churchill Bane ($): bit. ly/dQGGC. While I give them props for finding a loophole around not having a full liquor license, I prefer having a real drink at that price. *Bread, Butter, Seaweed ($): bit. ly/HCvkM*Raw Beef, Cheddar & Beer Bitter Herbs ($): bit. ly/fYYy*Cured Wild Salmon, Rye Waffle, Dill ($): bit. ly/fmiWjl*Pumpkin Soup, Onions, Hay ($): bit. ly/bdApWJ*Young Potato, Uni, Jalapeño, Scallions ($): bit. ly/bQQH*Lamb Shoulder, Preserved Peaches, Urfa ($): bit. ly/bdAIY(Sorry for the poor quality pics, there was bad lighting in the restaurant. )The above is listed in order of our favorite to least favorite dishes. While I appreciated the innovative ingredients pairings, there were some hits and misses. The bread, butter and seaweed are a genius combo as the seaweed acted as a salt component to the crusty bread lathered with deliciously creamy butter. Beef tartare and cheddar? I know what you're thinking but Liberman makes it work and it was damn good. You can never go wrong with smoked salmon but with a fluffy waffle and a herbaceous dill aioli? Even better. Nothing says fall like a bowl of pumpkin soup but I just wish there was a crunchy texture component to it. I love uni but there was a disconnect for me with the carby potatoes and jalapenos. The most disappointing dish was the lamb shoulder which was more of strip of jerky as the edges were hard and stringy. Don't leave without trying one of their desserts. I fell head over heels with their spiced pumpkin soft serve w/ roasted pumpkin seeds & persimmons ($): bit. ly/Jyew that I told our waitress about    times how much I loved it as if she didn't hear me the first time. Sorry, that was the alkie talking. It was so good that I know Lolia S. would approve (I miss her on Yelp). ~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~For their second day of opening, the entire staff was on their A game. Everyone was so genuinely nice and attentive. Food service was well paced and timely. I've been to a lot of soft openings and grand openings where some of the staff didn't seem to know their head from their arse so kudos to whoever hired and trained the staff here because they were wonderful!~ * ~ A M B I A N C E / D E C O R ~ * ~Walking into TBD, you will forget that you're a block away from crackheadsville on th street. The countryside campfire themed ambiance with the open fire grill, antlers, red camping lanterns, and wooden tables that doubles as shelves (pullout drawer has the menu, napkin, and utensils) were adorable. This would make a great casual date place but I can imagine it getting very loud when it's busy so I would wait until after the rd date to come here. ~ * ~ P A R K I N G ~ * ~Being in a more sketchy (but upcoming) part of SF, I suggest Ubering it here or carpooling. If you do drive, try to find parking on th and upwards. The nearest garage is on th/Mission but you'll have to walk through th which is very sketchy so I advise against this. We were lucky enough to find non metered parking in an alleyway in back of TBD and I had my stun gun ready. I always carry protection. *Wink* Was recommended this place last night after a drink at AQ, and am in total awe they JUST opened. Usually I give a restaurant a few months to get in their groove, but TBD has hit the ground running, which makes sense bc AQ is such a hit. Had such a fun dinner with lots of surprises in each dish  the bread with butter and seaweed is just so great. I loved the design and real rustic feel to the whole place. TBD invokes a real camp themed ambiance. Server told me that they'll be opening more seating a large communal/large group table upstairs, which will serve a full menu and be available for parties. Hello boozy Christmas party!!It's pretty amazing how far this block has come in the past couple years. TBD makes it that much more special. Looking forward to my next TBD trip for my campfire cravings without the dirt, dust, and spiders. from first walk in, it's warm and cozy and the smokey grill smells great without being overwhelming. you get the campfire ambiance without leaving and smelling like a campfire! it would be a great first date spot, and a great bad date spot, too. . . lots to talk about and appreciate everywhere. it's an innovative and completely original concept, another stunner from the AQ kids. last night's dinner at tbd was incredible. the space looks amazing and it's officially my new favorite restaurant! coming back next week, and i already know what i'm ordering! life changing carrots and lentils, andouille, and the sea urban and potatoes!! get a loophole cocktail, order a few bites, sit back and enjoy a camping atmosphere but still go home to a mattress! The first thing that attracts your attention is the colossal wood fire oven in the open kitchen. You then sit down at a table with nothing on it, only to quickly realize that there's a drawer for every seat with everything you'll need and some extra space to put your phone away so that you don't start writing your yelp review while you're still at the restaurant. Next you're faced with a large sherry collection. I'm new to sherry but I would recommend you order a glass of dry, somewhat savory sherry; it surely pairs well with the food. Ah, the food. We shared everything family style and I'd recommend that so that you get to try as many dishes as possible. My favorite by far was the ""bread, butter, and seaweed"" dish. It sounded interesting and tasted magnificent. Please don't leave before trying it. My other favorites were the swiss chard and the sole. Almost forgot about the crispy sprouted lentils with sesame paste. And last but definitely not least were the roasted marshmallows (didn't know marshmallows could taste so good!) served on top of a layer of delicious chocolate. The warm, soft marshmallows and the cold, hard chocolate. Genius! Overpriced and underwhelming. We sat at the window waiting area  they were nice enough to serve us food and drink there even if it was a bit awkward space wise. We got a couple of glasses of wine and cocktails (a bit pricey but as expected for this kind of a restaurant). Food  good but nothing that we sat back and said wow; small portions; free house sparkling water was nice; no free bread, but we ordered the bread on the menu ($) which had lots of butter and seaweed (probably the most interesting thing among the things we ordered), but wanted more bread  especially for the iberico ham and the potato sea urchin dishes, but for even plain bread without anything on it, we were charged $ (for two pieces of bread from the Mill).  We also got the sirloin/steak thing  ho hum, the tartare  nice but I can get that flavor at any decent middle eastern restaurant too.  We paid ~$pp and I was still hungry and went home to eat some more. Now for something really innovative  get the brussel sprouts with bacon and pears at zero zero, that was sit back and say wow good. Service was good; our waitress was really nice; and the owner was around and seemed really pleasant and friendly.  Communal sinks are a nice touch too. It's unfortunate when you are left with wanting a lot more, especially when you adore the their brother next door  AQ . We ordered the following:heirloom carrots  they came out blackened with not enough flavor except for the passionfruit and lentilsaged beef sirloin  the brussel kraut was a bit salty when paired with the sirloin and rye beer cream, also the beef was unusually tough for a medium rare sirloin these  dishes were the stars of the night:clams & bread, butter and seaweed  The bread soaked up most of the amazing broth from the clams. The loopholes were good, but they are no substitute for liquor drinks. . This place would be a , but I think the biggest problem with this place was the music was way too loud. Perhaps it was because we were seated at the front of the bar, next to the speakers, but it made it difficult to focus on the food, talk to the person next to me, or order from the waitstaff/bartenders."|1|89|2|Routine Inspection| Unclean hands or improper use of gloves  [ date violation corrected: 3/6/2014 ] Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities
ICHI Sushi + NI Bar 0|3.5|Japanese in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|109|0|3.31578947368|" We went there on vacation because all the positive reviews. For all the hype and people inside saying it was the best ever eating next to us from the area, it was the biggest let down ever and apparently they have never eaten quality sushi. The sushi was mid grade above gas stations and Safeway but would struggle against a good Sushi restaurant if that. we were given warm tap watter in used wine bottles, the music was so loud we couldn't talk,  and overall it was a hipster atmosphere more than a sushi restaurant,  and the bathrooms were so filthy it made us cringe. expensive for the portions. But good service and the decor and ambience are nice. it's best to make reservations as it gets busy pretty quickly. Was dying to try the new Ichi. . . I just loved the old place so much. . . Was seriously disappointed. . . A whole different experience. The restaurant is a dark grey room, bar stools where cheap and uncomfortable and crammed together. The service was just ok. Sake and beer selection was no existent (not even any Nigori). . Very loud, so could barely hear what the chef was handing me.  I must have asked him to repeat himself  times. . . . Oysters were overpriced and way to salty. . . Bring back the Kumamoto oysters. . Overall, i would never go back to Ichi, its kinda lost its charm. . . Its just another SF sushi bar now. . . . . . I'm sure this place is still good, but got a little too pretentious!! .  hour wait, seriously?!! Great sushi but not worth the wait!  Think the staff is in over their heads.  It's one of many good sushi spots in the city, know your roots and keep it real!  Going to some place more real!! SUSHI:   stars.  flavorful and fresh.  but incredibly pretentious sushi chefs who are quick to judge you for not eating it exactly as they would prefer you to. SEATING:   stars.  hostess says the wait is  minutes for walk in and they will text when the table is ready.  we comply and walk out to grab a beverage and prepare to wait.  a phone call comes in  minutes later informing us the table is ready. BAR:   stars.  awkward bartender.  limited selection. SUSHI CHEFS:   stars.  quick to judge and roll their eyes at you if you don't follow the unwritten rules of sushi eating.  not welcoming, uncomfortable, forced conversation. SERVER:   stars.  only approached us three times; )  mid meal to ask if i needed another beer,  ) refilling the water and nearly spilled the whole bottle on me, ) when handing us the check. MUSIC:   star.  insanely loud, inappropriate.  the sushi chef couldn't hear our orders and missed several items.  i think they even played ""hot in herre"" by nelly?AMBIANCE:   stars.  i really don't want to hear all the employees shouting ""irasshaimase"" every time someone walks in.  the decor is clean, modern but very sterile and uncomfortable. TOTAL AVG:  .  stars SUMMARY: Sushi  meh. . . not the freshest.  Drinks  beer ( types), sake (  options?), and one cocktail on the menu  meh.  Customer service  harmless, but meh too. I wouldn't go back.  If I lived closer to the place and if there were other things to do in the area, then I might eat there again out of convenience and proximity.  I would not go out and actively seek dinner at Ichi Sushi + Ni Bar.  I also don't understand why it's called Ni Bar  they only had one cocktail on the menu and about   beers on the menu as well.  I was expecting a more selection of cocktails and Japanese beers.  Echigo beer needs to be added to the menu!We were very excited and eager to eat here and put in a reservation on a weekend that we felt like celebrating something  it was our menniversary.  So. . . being super excited to eat out and have good sushi, this may have raised our expectations. . . maybe  trying to be fair here.  If you wanna read more details see below. . . SAKE: The waitress we had was friendly, but she wasn't very knowledgeable on the sake. We were hoping to have a flight of sake  but this place did not have such a thing.  (*note there is no unfiltered sake here). We ended up getting the Cat's Meow ($) which is an ume, shiso adult beverage.  It's not like umeshu  so don't get it if you are thinking it's similar and sweet because it is not.  APPETIZER: Shishito peppers DELICIOUS!  So good!  Could have been slightly salted more, but it was tasty.  Love those little things.  Albacore tataki  the fish wasn't that fresh  and i felt it wasn't that flavorful.  I have had tataki at many places, and this one was just alright. . . dry almost.  It wasn't bad, but it is probably something that I wouldn't order again. SUSHI: We ordered nigiri (magurgo, amaebi, and seared shiro maguro).  Waitress suggested that we NOT use wasabi or shoyu on the nigiri as it had other sauces/flavors added on it.  We were excited by this  nothing beats a good piece of raw fish that doesn't need soy sauce or wasabi to mask the flavor.  Maguro was definitely fishy. . . needed soy sauce on that one.  Amaebi was sweet  but it was a weird texture  mushy, creamy, and slimy. . . did not taste fresh.  I have had really good amaebi where the texture was light, crisp, and refreshing.  Seared shiro maguro was okay  nothing to write home about.   Inari was inari  good old simple sushi  you can't screw that up. MAKI ROLLS: Vegetable futomakiwas good  again, nothing to write home about. It had gobo inside and I love the crunch of gobo.  Spicy albacore was the best maki roll that we had  and probably the best sushi we had that night.  I recommend. AMBIANCE: Trendy.  Was definitely nice, hip & cool.  I like the mural on the wall that explains how to eat sushi.  Wasn't too bright or dark in there.  The old school hip hop music was awesome  had a ""name that tune"" competition with my boyfriend during dinner.  What is it with hip hop and sushi?  Why are they paired together like that?  And why do I enjoy the combination so much?! The sushi here is fantastic. It's the same quality as it was before when they were located across the street. It's the service that seems to be absent minded at this new location. We got to the restaurant at :pm for our :pm reservation. Instead of walking straight in, we opened the door and there was a huge line waiting. We thought it was people who were waiting in line without reservations, until the party in front of us said they also had reservations. I don't know why it took so long to check everyone in. We asked for a seat at the bar. Nope, only  seat available. It took forever for them to take our order. It took forever for us to get our order. We ordered  pieces of nigiri  it's fine that they gave it to us a few at a time. But when the first plate came to our table, only half of the nigiri came. As in, they gave us one piece of  different fish we ordered first. So we got this awkward plate, and it was embarassing because it looked like we were being cheap, by sharing nigiri or something. We told the waitress, she said the rest of the order would be out shortly. I checked the menu to see if each order includes  or  pieces, thinking it we forgot to order  pieces. Nope, the menu says  pieces per order. Huh. It ended up taking about  mins to get the rest of our  pieces of nigiri. . . . It was taking a while and we decided to order some Cold Somen with Shiso. We summoned one of the workers, who said ""I'll get you your waitress so she can order it for you. "" Being that it took  mins already to get someone's attention, we were getting irritated. How hard is it to put in an order for us? What made me upset was that they were checking in on all the tables. The table before us, they asked if they wanted another beer. But they couldn't ask us if we'd like to order anything else? Another annoying thing is the worker that spoke with us was making rounds to all the table with another employee. So two people together couldn't put in an order for us. Very irritating!Granted, the fish was amazing. This is the place to go when you are craving fish from Japan. It's very fresh, exotic, and definitely for sushi lovers only! I believe the special menu changes every night, and I can't remember what I ordered. . . only can recall the Anago, and ocean Trout. One downer was the Uni from Hokkadio. It didn't taste like Hokkaido Uni. . . for all you uni lovers out there who have tried both Santa Barbara and also the sea urchin from Japan, it was disappointing. I don't know if they had both in the house. . . but if they did, perhaps they switched it by accident. Just judging from the service, I could see this easily happening. I also enjoyed the broiled fish selection. Most restaurants only have Hamachi Kama, but this place had about  different variations of this. I loved trying another type of fish! (can't remember which one we got). Somen with Shiso was really delicious. It was refreshing and modern. I give this restaurant some slack since it's only a few weeks old. But their service needs to get with it! Apparently my friend was yakuza at the old Ichi and wanted to check out the new space, so we trotted on over on mid weeknight. It apparently is much larger than the old haunt. There's a large ramp that comes up from the left where te entrance is. A traditional sushi bar sits on the right side with some bar tables in the middle. As you go to the back there's another bar on the far right and some high tops which I guess is the ""Ni"" part of the space. Large murals are painted all over with quirky art, yet the tones are very subtle. We got one of the middle bar tables and as one does with a yakuza, get the omakase. Tons of things started coming out. Lots of well cut and put together nigiri, Eggplant, ebi, tofu, pickled veggies, oysters, clams. . . I wish I could remember everything and all that went in it. I do remember however that everything was tasty and you'll have to go by my bad pictures as a guideline. We met the owner and his brother who is a chef there. Very cool folks. My friend ran into folks from Hi Lo BBQ, Namu Gaji, and a few other joints. I did mention the yakuza status yeah? A bit off the edge for where I usually hang in the Mission but it seems like this, Pizza Hacker and the ever popular Blue Plate is bringing the Mission/Bernal corridor to life. Certainly worth checking out if you like the sushi arts. .  stars Good food! Over priced and  horrible service! With as many people working there you think you would get your food at a reasonable time.  Waited way too long! ! .  rounding up since this is the best I've had so far. One of the better sushi bars in SF. Sure they don't pay attention to detail. And the cuts of fish and garnishes can be sloppy. But it is one of the better ones that I've been to. They have a large enough selection of fish and the quality is somewhat decent.  And for the price it's not bad. The bill came out to about to a little less than $ per person for a  pc omakase. Not including tip. There's a bar area in the back where you can have drinks and appetizers while you wait. Ichi Sushi + Ni Bar + San Friends = Awesome Friday NightWalked in with no reservations on a Friday night with two good buddies and got told that there will be a  min wait but no worries because they have a Ni Bar for people to hang out and grab a drink till your table is ready. We ordered Kusshi oysters, the rare yuzu beer, along with the famous fried chicken. Oysters were a bit expensive but fresh and sweet. Fried Chicken was good but in a subtle way. It was not dry and light in flavor, which I'm not quite used to, I'm used to the salty flavorful fried chicken. It's not bad, but different. As we move to a table at Ichi Sushi, we ordered some nigiri and sashimi. The dinner menu is a bit sheer, but simplicity at its best. We ordered spicy scallop and spicy yellowtail, along with Uni, Amaebi, Tobiko and the best one of the night was the Tai, Japanese Sea Bream. Everything was fresh and mouth watering. Now I know next time to save my stomach for the dinner menu or omakase rather than the bar bites. A star for the awesome decals on the wall and great hip, urban feel. Overall great experience, friendly host and waiters/waitresses. Ichi sushi, you have become one of my fav spots when I have an itch for sushi. I think this could be my favorite sushi place in the Bay Area. During my last visit, the fish was fresh, our server was friendly and she answered all of our questions. Finally, they played s hip hop all night!Where is the th star for the s hip hop?!I can't wait to go back. Love the larger, slick, new space.  There's not much more to be said about ICHI other than the upgrade has taken something already great and made it even better.  There's really only one way to eat here and that is ordering omakase at the sushi bar.  The benefit of eating at the bar is that you have access to ordering from the izakaya menu as well, but vice versa is not true. My sushi partner and I were lucky to snag bar seats without reservation, but only because we were the first to arrive.  We didn't know they took reservations now, so we were lucky with our gamble. Don't take that risk and make one. . . and again always opting for seating at the sushi bar. Head Chef Erik again masterfully creates course after course of awesome nigiri. Really, there was not one bad thing we ate, and we packed away over + pieces.  From the izakaya menu, we went for the steak and chicken thigh skewers, both were juicy and tasty.  Also picked up an order of miso clams in some sort of spicy sausage broth, which we enjoyed too, but probably will skip next time. . . need more room for sushi.  I recommend the ICHIbeer too, which went very well with the meal.  Overall, we left full, satisfied, and still wanting more. With both the service and food being spot on, ICHI lives up to its deserved reputation. We'll definitely be back. . . but just need the wallet reserves to recover. Modern new set up here. . . . I like. Food. . . . great as always but it seems to me that the portions might have shrunk just a bit (but that just might be me :). The chefs are great. . . socially adept and skilled. The service. . it was alright. I would like to give ichi  stars but the service portion is what's keeping them from it. Couple of things noted regarding service: No call back when leaving voicemail for reservations, spoke to employee on phone and was informed that she would call me back. . . . never did, flexibility with customer requests and the level of attention to customers in general could have been better. Even tho. . . . I would recommend and say that this is one of my favorites in the city. In time, I can only hope that the service will improve. The bf and I had a great sushi dinner at Ichi. Ichi was highly recommended to us by friends whose taste we trust, so we had high expectations going into dinner. I'm happy to say that we were not disappointed and that we will be back. We ordered:*  different types of nigiri  $  $.  per pieceThe saba and kinmedai were my favorites. I really liked the addition of various ingredients that complemented the fish, especially the green tea sea salt + yuzukosho on the kinmedai and the ume paste on the three line grunt. The rice wasn't as good as the rice at Maruya, and some of the fish seemed a bit floppy. However, I know Monday isn't the best fish day (I couldn't move the bf's bday!), so I'll come back another day of the week. * Amberjack tataki  $Served with kaiware, tobiko, garlic chips. Yum!* Negi tuna hand rolls  $.  each* Kanpachi kama  $Delightfully salty skin and soft flesh. * Beef tataki  $. Tender beef, yummy sauce, crispy + addictive burdock root. The pickled cukes on the side were really good too. * Somen with shiso pesto  $The sauce made this dish taste interestingly like an Italian angel hair pasta dish. I prefer my somen in broth. The food total was around $ for both of us. I found the prices very reasonable. The atmosphere was extremely laidback and casual. Hiphop was blasting, and I felt like I'd walked into a house party where everyone knew everyone else at :pm on a Monday. (I had just been to Maruya the previous week, so the contrast was huge. )There were  hiccups in the service that I think are worth mentioning: ) I emailed  days prior to dinner asking to be seated at the sushi bar and got a reply from one of the owners, Erin, confirming my request. When we showed up, we were seated at a regular table. We showed the host the email from Erin. We were told we could wait for the next available sushi bar seats, but one of the servers suggested we not order food before moving over. (I guess transferring in flight orders would have been too difficult. ) We drank sake and waited half an hour to move. (Note: My cell phone reception was awful when I got the call from Ichi to confirm my reservation that afternoon, or I would have double checked. )) Our bill was a mess. I was so tired at the end of dinner that I paid without looking at the itemized receipt. When I did check it, I saw that the first  items on it were definitely not ours. A couple of things that we ordered were missing. (I suppose the fact that I didn't notice we were overcharged based on prices alone was a testament to how reasonable prices were!) I sent a detailed email to Ichi. Luckily, being the Asian girl I am, I had pictures of every item we had at dinner to help with my case. Erin and the staff were very friendly and very responsive in setting things straight. It took several emails to sort out all the issues, but they sent me my $ refund and threw in a little extra too. I was happy with the outcome, but I will definitely check my bill before I pay next time. We read that this place was one of the top sushi places in San Fran, but we were greatly disappointed with the service, as well as the poor selection of remaining food.  First of all, they had not updated the address on open table so we went looking for the old place and had to turn around.  It's fine if you don't post an address, but don't give me the wrong one. . . Wouldn't this be one of the first things you change when moving to a new location?!So we get there and we are sat at the bar. However, our drink waitress forgot about us. Then the sushi chef (from behind the bar) comes by to take our order, so I ask him about the saki, but in broken English tells me ""we don't have that here"" and walks away. Ookay.  Finally our actual waitress comes by and now we are able to get some saki. . . We have been sitting for  min by now. Another min go by before the sushi chef comes back around. We order the red tuna (best thing we had) and tuna belly (also very good) to start along with  hand rolls (awful hardly any fish and all rice). However, for our next order they are all out of the tunas as well as several other menu options. We tried the ocean trout and the Japanese barracuda, both of which were so so. Overall, terrible disorganized service, wrong address, and lack of remaining menu options led me to the  star review. One of the best sushi restaurant in SF!  Not too far from th St Bart, walk on Mission St to th St. I waited at pm for their opening at :pm on Sat night //, they recently opened on Tues // and already all the fans from the old place have found out, but it's not too crowded.  We got  seats at the sushi bar even without reservations!  Pretty casual place you don't need to dress up.  They shout Irasshaimase to everyone that comes in  it means Welcome!Mural is awesome made from a SF artist, check it out.  Chef Tim made all the chairs, bar stools, and lights. Daniel was our sushi chef.  Chef Tim was training the hot food cooks.  We let Daniel know we were only medium hungry and got  different course for our omakase.  All the fishes were really fresh & we liked them all.  Our total was $.  with  courses ( hot dishes & rest were  nigiri for each of us) &  beer before tip.  You can do it cheaper or more expensive. Separate bathrooms in the back. Dining solo. Had no idea I live so close to this amazing Sushi place. Just had an orange ginger dry hopped mead and now working a Sochu drink made from Sweet Potato. Marie at the bar was so nice and great at explaining the drinks. .  STARSMe: ""Did you want to check out ICHI + Ni Bar on Wednesday?. . . . Omakase and Izakaya dishes?""Mr. NSS: ""Sure. . . I love Japanese. ""*Evil laugh* because I know it's his turn to pay. I know, I'm horrible. Having been to Ichi at their former location a block away and loved it (my review: bit. ly/bPqPR), I was ecstatic to check out their new location (across from Pizza Hacker) that opened on Tuesday. The new space is about three times larger AND they now offer a izakaya (Japanese tapas) menu. While they now accept reservations on OpenTable, I hate their reservation policy. Not only do they require a credit card to secure reservations (with possible cancellation fees), I received ZERO dining points. WTF. Additionally, I made reservations for Wednesday at : pm and requested sushi bar seats. When calling to confirm my reservations, I was told that sushi bar seats are first come, first serve regardless of whether or not you have reservations. Hm, this defeats the purpose of making reservations no? I hope they consider changing this but until then my rating is rounded down because of this. To secure sushi bar seats, we waited in line  minutes before they opened at : pm. Do come early because all the sushi bar seats were taken before  pm. Beware of line cutters, people. This fobby Azn couple thought it was perfectly OK to chain smoke in front of the restaurant and blow the smoke toward bystanders, then cut everyone else in line when the doors opened. Gr. . . . One important thing to note is that you can only order from the full menu (sushi & izakaya) if you sit at the sushi bar side. If you sit at the izakaya bar side, you can only order from the izakaya menu (no sushi).  Compared to other izakaya restaurants, the izakaya menu is very small and focused with about  things on the menu:  cold dishes and  hot dishes. An absolute must order is the Motsuni ($. ): bit. ly/dwtci. The English cut short ribs and beef tripe were incredibly tender and the sauce was full of robust umami flavor. A total Japanese comfort dish. Seeing how much I enjoyed the Omakase at Ichi's previous location, we requested a Nigiri Only Omakase which will range in price depending on how many pieces you order. We each had  pieces (including oysters) which was about $ per person which was reasonable. What I appreciated (while some may not) is Ichi doesn't provide soy sauce or wasabi and the sushi chefs will explain every fish being presented.  The sushi chef (we sat in front of Darin/Darren) will season the pristine cuts of fish with various accoutrements like green tea sea salt, ponzu, garlic oil, etc that will best highlight that particular variety of fish. Why ruin a beautiful cut of fish by dunking into a pool of soy sauce? The shari (rice) was perfect; seasoned well and didn't fall apart upon picking up. If you're like Mr. NSS who is chopstick challenged, it's perfectly fine to pick up the sushi with your hands to eat. Like a good sushi chef would do, Darin/Darren started the omakase with a variety of firm, white fish selections and then progressed to a more fattier cut like umi masu (ocean trout). Their umi masu was so AMAZING that we ordered two orders: bit. ly/oWLFkj. If you like sake (salmon) and/or toro (belly), this is a must order as it was like a triple cream butter that just melts effortlessly in your mouth. Here are pics of our omakase sets: bit. ly/lhCaC and bit. ly/cuwNt. Ichi's omakase ranks among my top  places for omakase along with Akiko, Ino, Yume (Alameda), and Sushi Sam's (San Mateo). A tiny drawback is Ichi doesn't serve ankimo,  blue fin otoro, or unagi because they're not sustainable. I can appreciate that but I since foie gras was banned, ankimo is the only way I can get some type of fix. Expect to spend about  hours if you partake in omakase and also because they're crazy busy. . . even on a Wednesday. While I do like their new, hip location playing hip hop in the background, I found the sushi bar seats were so close to each other that we were rubbing elbows with our neighbors. It would have been nice if there were hooks underneath the bar for coats and purses. I'm usually adamant about only going to Japanese owned and ran sushi joints but Ichi is the exception. While the sushi chefs may be white boys, they do sushi ohh so right. Shout out to several parents who brought their kids to the sushi bar with them. Not only were they super well behaved, they seemed to have enjoyed eating sashimi and nigiri. Love that they're such adventurous eaters at a young age. Me: ""If we have kids in the future, we can bring them with us for omakase. ""Mr. NSS: ""Sure. . under one condition?""Me: ""Ok. . . . ?""Mr. NSS: ""You can foot the $+ bill. "" *Evil laugh*Me: ""On a second thought, maybe bento boxes are a better idea. . . . """|1|96|1|Routine Inspection| Moderate risk food holding temperature
Leatherneck Steakhouse 0|4.0|Steakhouses in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|133|0|3.88888888889| Spectacular views and service, you CANNOT go wrong with Leatherneck Steakhouse.  We were fortunate to get reservations for eight people on short notice during Oracle Open World week, and not ony that, reservations with an amazing view of downtown San Francisco. The Leatherneck Steakhouse is located on top of the Marine hotel on Sutter street.  When our party arrived, we were greeted by very friendly hostesses and seated directly in front of the window front view overlooking downtown.  Our waiter was spectacular and provided incredible service throughout the meal.  Our table ordered a number of appetizers including the tuna tartar, calamari, and cheese plate.  While most of our table ordered a variety of different steaks, I couldn't refuse the salmon. I must say, while our table highly applauded their dishes, I have truly never had a juicier or more flavorful filet of salmon.  It was absolutely amazing. Overall we were all really pleased with this restaurant, and by the way, if you're waiting at the bar, they have glasses of goldfish as their bar food.  Can't beat the snack that smiles back :). Went to the leatherneck steakhouse because it was close to our hotel.  First off the staff was very friendly, courteous, and prompt.  Secondly the view was nice I would say it would have been better after dark or at sundown.  The steak was good, my wife's lamb was good though cooked in a Moroccan style which really seemed strange for the type of restaurant it was. Mike is a wonderful bartender, with a great personality!  Hm, wonder why all of my reviews seems to revolve around bars and drinks.  Wonder if I should be worried.  NOT!?! great service, great view, and the food is even betterso glad we randomly found this placestarted with drinks to enjoy the great viewpuree of veggie soup to start was simple and delicious  the way a puree should be made  sans creamour steaks were cooked perfectly  petit filet for the wife w/ mac n cheese and  oz ribeye w/ shrooms for me  we both loved our mains w/ the sides  these are high quality steaks (my ribeye was tender, marbled but not super fatty and packed full of flavor) at a fraction of the cost you pay at other spots we cannot wait to come back Dim lighting. Amazing view of the city. Piano on the background. This is one of the most intimate and romantic places to enjoy your steak. Appetizer: Prosciutto wrap tomato basil Entrees: Prime rib and petite filet oscar (crab, asparagus, bearnaise)Sides: Mashed potatoes and truffle tater tots (MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE! I will come back just for 'em tots) I saw the good rating of this restaurant and decided to take my parents there for their last dinner in SF. I know steakhouses like this usually run out of space quickly so in the morning, I deliberately came to the restaurant and asked if a reservation was needed. They told me no, that there would always be empty tables on weekdays. Perfect. When we showed up for dinner at :pm, the waitress told us that they actually would have a party in the restaurant and they wouldn't take any walk ins. I was told that I wouldn't need a reservation, but I understand that things change. However, their way of talking just makes my head burn. Both the waitress and the manager were rude and disrespectful, not showing any signs of regret or apology for the mistakes their people made. We walked out and talked to the reception downstairs for the hotel, with whom we had a much better experience. Their staff was a lot understanding and helpful, and got us a reservation at a different steakhouse. I will come back to SF many times but never walk into this restaurant again. My fiancée and I had a : reservation on a Saturday night. We showed up at : but, even though we were early, they got us right in and sat us at a table by the window. The food was delicious (and very affordable) and the view was amazing. The live pianist was extremely talented and personable. He played unlimited requests (I think he played  of our requests) and made a point of talking with everyone who came in and left and greeted the regulars by name. For dinner I ordered the petite filet Oscar and it was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing. We also had the truffle tots  definitely a must try! Admittedly, the service was a bit slow. However, we weren't really in a hurry, particularly because we were enjoying the live music and the view, but it could be an issue if you had somewhere to be after dinner. Definitely stop in the bathroom  it has a surprising amount of character! Overall, this place has a level of elegance and style that is hard to find anymore. Nice looking restaurant with great views. I came here wearing a Hugo Boss sweater, Seven jeans and D&G white shoes. The waiter turned me away from the main dining area because I wasn't dressed for appropriately for the floor. She sat me in an dead area with no other diners. I walked away after sitting for a few moments feeling disrespected. Was a guest of friends for a very special going away celebration. Have heard wonderful recommendations about this restaurant but had no idea what a true dining experience this would be. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted by the very gracious manager, Edda. Our service was prompt but leisurely. Out wonderful server, Tracy, could not have been more professional or personable. Her knowledge of the menu and assistance in ordering just the right entrees and wines was outstanding.  This was a wonderful dining experience with great food, wonderful ambience and outstanding views. I highly recommend the Leatherneck. I loved this place, the food, the service, the views!  All stellar!  I am actually afraid to tell everyone how awesome this place is because I may have a long wait next time I try and go LOL. . .  I had an end cut prime rib and it was off the hook!  Green beans were amazing and I had some amazing glasses of wine  red wine  Chalone I think. . . Hubby had the filet and he mowed it down.  We also had the truffle tater tots which were yummy.  We went here on Valentines Day and got to sit at a window seat.  We also came here for lunch the day before and had a great salad and pulled pork sandwich.  This place is not well known but it is definitely and A++ place to eat. . . Valet parking was nearby and not very expensive either. . . Highly recommended. . . I think it is all about. I can't deserve more than anything from any food shop. It should be the best one in this area. Everything was so cute here. I never forget to order TRUFFLE TATER TOTS. I never thought it could be o delicious! Food decoration is also cool and good looking to raise your appetite!! I'm gonna keep this review real short and sweet:Best steakhouse in San Francisco. No questions asked. If your looking for the best steak in town at a nice restaurant, Leatherneck is where you need to go. Wow, this place is incredible! Amazing food, gorgeous views, even a live piano player (who just happened to be playing some of my all time favorite songs from The Phantom of the Opera). We started with the crab cakes. Now, I love crab cakes, and pretty much always order them if they are on a menu when I go anywhere, and I've had some really good crab cakes in my life, but these were the best I've ever had. Perfectly seasoned, not overly cooked, and they had a great sauce drizzled on top (not quite sure what it was but it was delicious!) Next was a simple wedge salad, with a blue cheese dressing that was to die for! Then I had the sea bass, and my boyfriend had the glazed salmon. We shared because both were incredible. Every bite I took just melted in my mouth. I loved the food so much, for the first time in my life I asked if I could speak with the Chef to give him my compliments. He came out right away, and was very nice and thanked us for being there. He recommended the passion fruit cheesecake for desert. Now we were quite full, but the way he talked about the cheesecake seamed like we just had to try it. We shared a piece and OH MY GOD it was unbelievable! Anyone going there just has to try it! We also had a bottle of their house red wine with dinner which was a cabernet sauvignon, and was quite nice. The service was superb, the views were breathtaking. I would recommend going anytime, but especially for a special occasion (we were celebrating an early Valentines Day). Great, high quality food. Definitely feels like a  star restaurant without  star prices. I cannot wait to go back! This spot is a gem. Phenomenal view and a classy ambiance to compliment it. The bruschetta was on hit, and the truffle tater tots were also quite nice. I may be a little biased since anything with truffle on it makes it better in my eyes, but even still, they were delightful. And the ribeye that i ordered was a fair size, and cooked just how i asked. Looking for a last night in SF treat during my last visit, I wanted to check out a relatively inexpensive steakhouse and the Yelp monocle led me here. Awesome view, super nice service but I didn't like how I couldn't take my meal at the bar. Instead I had to be THAT guy who sits at a table for  by himself but aside from that, I had a delicious rib eye and those truffle tots, holy crap that was good. Be sure to eat the tots while they're still hot to get that delicious truffle oil taste and hot crunch. Once they start cooling down, they start losing their properties of awesomeness. The view is actually so cool that I could see the floodlights at the stadium in Oakland that night for the Raiders game. i am giving this restaurant one star because i was very disappointed and displeased with the service here. a few days before coming to this restaurant, i called to make reservations for my brother's birthday. a male hostess answered the phone. he asked if i was a guest at the hotel, my name, and phone number and time and date that i wanted to come in for dinner. he said he will write it down and that i was set for that time and date. so a few days after making this reservation, i come to the restaurant. i told the hostess that i had reservations at pm, but then he said that my name was not there. he even let me check the book. and i checked for myself and my name WAS NOT THERE. the person i was talking to on the phone said he would WRITE MY name but OBVIOUSLY didn't because my name was not under the time and date. I was very annoyed and pissed off because the male hostess i talked to the phone lied or forgot or something and did not write the name. it was my brother's birthday and i was pissed that he didn't even write my name like he said he would. the hostess said he didn't even have a table for us and that we had to wait until happy hour was over. he didnt even TRY to accomodate us after not even putting our name on the list in the first place. (im not sure if he was the hostess or not that i talked to on the phone). he just said wait for happy hour to be over. i said okay we'll do that but he didnt even ask for my name or phone number.  For that i am never going back because of the TERRIBLE service. i didnt even try the food. . . but dont come back here due to poor service and when the employees don't try to accomodate you after forgetting to put your name on the reservation list. By the time we arrived at the restaurant for our  pm reservation, the restaurants as out of Prime Rib.  I ordered  first courses, the French Onion soup and the Ahi Tartare. The server came back and said they were out of the French Onion soup.  I ordered a salad instead.  She proceeded to forget my second first course (which was to be my entree).   Then I was informed that the restaurant was also out of the Ahi Tartare.  Our server, Marissa, was rude and totally inattentive to our needs (we couldn't order a second drink until we flagged down a busboy.  But she was quick to deliver the check which included a built in tip in excess of what we would have been willing to give her in light of her poor attitude. I took a group of . We had a wonderful time. The service was very attentive and the food was excellent.

Leatherneck Steakhouse 1|4.0|Steakhouses in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|133|1|3.90909090909|" Wow!  This steakhouse is so affordable compared to many in the City.  They give you so many lil appies when you sit down, nice breads, dips, crudite and butter of course, with some mighty tasty baked garlic.  We totally enjoyed!We each ordered steak and again were amazed at the prices:  $ for small  ozs Filet Mignon and NY Steak.  Both came with wedge salads which define the rich and gooey pleasure of blue cheese ""ole school"" dressing.  We even popped for an amazing rich and creamy Panna Cotta with pear topping dessert, coffee and a nice bottle of Cabernet wine.  We really feel that the prices are subsidized overall by Marine's Memorial being a membership club.  Anyone can eat there though, and I do suggest reservations as we were there promptly at :pm and they were already full for the evening.  The piano bar is a nice touch and the views are incredible!  ~Ms. Ali We found the restaurant to be very quiet with excellent views of San Francisco. We ate at the Seasons a couple of days before and I can honestly say that the steak is far better at this restaurant. Cooked exactly the way you ordered it (RibEye & Filet). The Iceberg Wedge with blue cheese was surprisingly excellent and the Bearnaise sauce is fantastic. The Oysters Rockefeller is exquisite. Service was among the best I have had in SF. The ambiance is similar to a what an officers mess in the military and the attention to detail shows. Best steak restaurant we visited on our  day trip to SF. Onion soup: too little cheese, and I barely tasted onion in the soup!Prime ribs: completely flavorless! Even the raw horseradish sauce isn't as strong as that in House of Prime RibsAmbiance: good view of SF if you sit right by the windows. This place was like a retirement/senior home, as the avg age of diners there was probably . Definetly a  star experience. This is a private club, but allows the general public to eat.  The dining room is on the  floor with a beautiful view of the bay from the wall of windows.  We decided to reserve for the sunset, but unfortunately it was a very foggy evening.  But what the hell?  This is after all San Francisco. We ordered the  oz. prime rib and split it.  Spliting charge was $, but this included  salad wedges with very good blue cheese dressing and crumbles.  After reading about the truffle tater tots we ordered them along with asparagas with hollandaise sauce. The warm rolls were fantastic. Everything that was said about the potatoes was right on. Absolutely delicious crispiness.  The asparagas was totally tender and yummy.  The prime rib was done perfectly with a slightly salty crispy rub.  The service was friendly, attentive, and professional.  Water glasses were constantly refilled and several times the waiter and maitre de stopped by the table to ask if everything was okay. I would suggest this hidden gem to anyone who wants a unique and memorable dining experience in the City. For old people. Good view. Meat is good. But everything else seemed pre made hours ago. The crudités at the beginning of meal was so dried out. As soon I saw that they served us dry ass jicama, I realized I didn't have to be proper.  The ahi tuna tower was bland. The filet mignon was cooked to order and pretty good. So was the mushroom side. Dessert was panna cotta. It tasted like it was made yesterday. Otherwise, good service. Dinner came out to . Wish the food was better. Came here on a whim after reading the reviews on yelp and we were pleasantly surprised. It's not a super fancy place, and the service was a bit on the slow side although very very friendly. Nice ambiance as they had a pianist playing beautiful music at the bar. We ordered a filet mignon and a ribeye  both were cooked as we ordered, and tasted great. Had the bernaise sauce and horseradish sauce on the side. Based on other reviews, we had the truffle tater tots  definitely a MUST HAVE  and the macaroni and cheese. The wine list is unique in that it featured wineries owned by military families. We enjoyed a tasty pinot noir. For dessert, we had the chocolate pot de creme. All in all, a very nice evening and the food was really good. I'd defnitely come back here the next time I'm in San Fran. Interesting throw back in time. . . . . dress code for the guys. . . . . great view, my date and I  arrived for sunset on a clear day.  We split the  oz. prime rib and ordered three sides: truffle tater tots, swiss chard and string beans.  Iceberg wedge with delicious ranch dressing.  Plenty of food for two and the service was good.  Piano bar.  Friendly staff.  and again: great view, ask for a window seat.  BTW way she loved it. Awesome food and even better views. We arrived while it was still light and had a full panoramic view of the city as night fell and the lights came on, spectacular! The fillet steak was brilliant and the service was good. This place is very underrated.  Amazing views, food and service.  Mac and cheese is a must! First time here! The truffle fries are PERFECTION. Crispy, delicious, not too oily, I was in heaven!! Delicious!They were out of prime rib and two people in my party wanted it, so they were disappointed, but the truffle fries, m lol The Pros: great view reservations not difficult affordable drinks good house wine prices were pretty good truffle tater tots were awesomeThe Cons: spotty service  filet was dry & cold prime rib was off tastingso overall, the service and food taste will be sacrificed for a great view and a more economical and lower quality meat.  Without the view, the steak isn't worth the price."|3|94|2|Routine| Inadequately cleaned or sanitized food contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 11/26/2012 ] Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils  [ date violation corrected: 11/26/2012 ]
Leatherneck Steakhouse 2|4.0|Steakhouses in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|133|2|3.88405797101|" Great service. Great view, oysters were best ever. Wow!  What an experience. . .  $.  for a Beefeater Martini.  I am not sure what else I should say.  My colleague and I didn't actually eat a steak here but I had the Cod and he had the chicken.  We were both impressed with our meal and the service not to mention the view.  Did I mention that a stiff Beefeater Martini was only $. ?  They even had a live pianist. food old OK, nothing special.  Price good, close to Theaters. First had reservation time wrong by one hour later. Then told after meal that our table had been needed, yet there were many empty tables an NO ONE WAITING. Very rude!! Would not go back again. I hesitate to write a review of this place in hopes that people will never find it. Even the line cooks can cook meat like executive chefs and the views are some of the best in San Francisco. I was here for lunch on a Wednesday and there no problem getting in. They have a dress code (collared shirts and no ""loud pants""), but are not priced like they have a dress code. They were out of the rib eye sandwich (one of my staple lunch items) so I tried the S. O. S. which is a San Francisco Fresh thick slice of sourdough with a poached egg on top and Chorizo Gravy with kobe flat iron cutlets. I don't know how many years this place has been here they have made sure the food is top quality, and that's what matters to me.  The service was okay for lunch, I mean it's no Rotunda, and the mexican who served me could have probably attended a few more customer service classes but he was nothing to complain about. I cannot wait to get back here and try the elusive steak sandwich! S. O. S. is to die for. The view is amazing. Service was adequate although I had to ask for a refill which makes me feel like a rubberneck looking for a waiter sometimes. I would not recommend the bread pudding. It reminded me of everything I dislike about conventional bread pudding. Soggy, rum flavored and raisens. Not for me. I came for lunch but to get the true experience I would love to come back for dinner and a sunset. My husband and I stayed at the Marines Memorial Club and Hotel and this restaurant was on the th floor of the hotel.  We ate here twice during our trip.  The first time we went, the food was great and the service was wonderful.  The filet was juicy, cooked to order, and came with a delicious sauce.  We shared a side of mac and cheese that we loved.  The Bailey's Cheesecake was a great dessert to end the meal as well.  The second time we ate dinner there, I was less impressed.  My steak was cooked to medium well, not medium, and our server was less attentive (it was also pretty busy that night, so he had a lot going on).  Overall, the food was still yummy, but not the same quality as what we had before. The restaurant itself is quite nice with a really pretty view of the city lights, even if you aren't at one of the tables right by the window.  I would go back again and hope to get the same experience as our first visit! This restaurant is definitely kicking it old school. They even have a dress code (although it's mainly just ""wear a collared shirt and long non ridiculous pants"" if you're a guy). Has a live piano and a small bar, and there seemed to be a lot of people who actually were in the service (or just looked that way). Speaking of that  It's on the th floor of the Marines Memorial Club & Hotel right off of Union Square. You'd basically never know this restaurant were here if not for sites like Yelp. The view is pretty awesome, actually, esp. considering you're really not paying any extra. We had the massive iceberg wedge with blue cheese and a smattering of veggies as the salad, along with some bread and veggies with hummus as the ""free"" thing they serve before the meal (side note: what do you call that?)The waiter seemed a little rushed, like he was trying to hard, but everything came pretty promptly and the other staff members kept the glasses filled with water, etc. But the steak I had (oz filet) was excellent  cooked medium (as I asked), bernaise sauce on the side and with not a sour note throughout. Plus bonus points for having a table with no reservation for me and my boss (always good when you can make that happen last minute). BF knows I love my meat. Sometimes I crave it pretty bad and we end up at a steakhouse. Since it was Christmas time we thought it would be nice to check out the Christmas tree in Union Square. I booked Leatherneck since it was ideal, location wise, and the reviews seemed to be decent. We showed up and there was hardly anyone there at the bar. We waited about  mins and were seated near the window with the awesome view of the city. Beautiful. There were a few large parties in the dining room. It was kind of loud with the kids screaming and crying and the protégé boy playing Christmas tunes on the piano (not by request except from his mother). The more wine I drank, the more the noise level got tolerable. Our meal started off with a wedge of iceberg lettuce with what resembled ranch sauce. The lettuce was so COLD and crisp. It was so good. For the meat, I chose the prime rib, which was very good. Cooked the way I like it. BF chose the peppered steak, which was kinda too pepper y. For dessert we shared the crème brule which was okay. Not the greatest and not the best either. Service was a bit slow but that was because of the large dinner parties. A few of the items on the menu, like the tater tots and chard were out. I would come back if I was craving steak and in the area. But it didn't wow me as much to make it a recurring visit. Love this classy restaurant with beautiful views! We ordered the absolutely delicious and scrumptious Roast Herb Chicken. . . . it's heavenly! And the Roasted Sea Bassis so very tasty and wonderful!. . . . Go ahead and try something other than a steak!The iceberg wedge salad with ranch dressing, which comes with each entree, is visually pleasing and delicious. And to top it all off, a yummy warm Raspberry Crisp withice cream and orchid (to wear later) is the crowning end to a special meal! Was at the clift hotel and this steakhouse kept coming up as best in area.  Finally found it in the marines hotel on the th floor.  Sat at the bar next to a couple awaiting their table which added good conversation.  Vodka tonic was light but good.  Ordered steak at bar s waiting to get seated.  Was excellent.   lean ounces and plentiful.  I will be back when I'm in sf on business again.  Great place but make a reservation. We went to a business dinner with a party of  and were pleasantly greeted with a phenomenal view of the city. We're thinking about moving here and that view is one that I could get used to! Wow. Not bad to look at while sipping a glass of wine and eating a filet!The service was impeccable. The water glasses didn't get / emptied before being topped off. They were very friendly and professional. Top notch and  star worthy. The food was good but not great. I always find steak houses to be unexciting but good and serviceable. I've never really had a world class steak at one of these places but always leave satisfied. They were all perfectly cooked to order and presented well so they do what they do well. The filet was very tender and of great quality. My wife was happy with her kobe au poivre. To get a good quality meal and be able to check out that view again I would go back. This place is definitely overrated! Waiter was rude, french guy! Wait was long even with reservations and food was cold. Steak cold and macaroni and cheese was boiling. . . and there clam chowder sucked! Everybody up there was stuck up and rude! Didn't help explain our menu until we were done with what we ordered, really? Come on, we did ask before! View was nice but service and most plates were bad! One of those diamonds in the rough restaurants in SF. Awesome view, food and reasonable price. What else can you ask for.  Chopped salad was great. Steak was perfectly cooked. Any place that offers complimentary alcoholic beverages to its hotel guests during happy hour deserves five stars!Semper Fi! Love this place for the breakfast buffet and happy hour. As a regular guest of the Marine Memorial Hotel, you can't beat the happy hour (great selection and complimentary for guests of the hotel). It also has the best State side hotel breakfast buffet I've ever had. Haven't yet had dinner here. I'll need to run out of all the other places in SF that I need to try before I have breakfast AND dinner in the same place. SECRET TIP: The servers are hustling to take care of everyone during the often busy happy hour. I've found a great system. A generous tip up front triggers the 'bottomless glass' mechanism so you don't have to fight with the crowd. Sh, it's a well kept secret. Semper Fidelis. The food here was great. We had the clam chowder and ahi tuna for starters. The clam chowder was okay and the tuna tower with the crab and avocado was delicious. For the entrees, I had the  ounce prime rib and the fettucini and rock shrimp. The prime rib was good quality and tasted better with the steak sauce. I liked the fettucini better. The mix of shrimp, mushrooms, tomatoes and chard was delicious and had a slightly tangy taste. If the night had been clearer, the view of SF would've been much prettier. Yelped for a steakhouse in SF and this looked intriguing. Here is what I thought:. Nice, intimate setting. No need to raise voices in conversation. Nice live piano in the background. . Drinks very good. . Prices very fair. . Got a window seat so incredible view of the city but no bad seat in the house. . Hubby and I both had the filet mignon. Very tasty but I would say a tad more cooked than asked for (next time would say rare instead of med rare). Garlic mashed were great. So overall a very nice evening and would definitely go back! By far the best dining we had the entire time we were in SF,  I had the filet mignon with the asparagus and mushroom and leeks as sides. Perfect steaks. Great views and great staff. The only drawback is the decor which resembles a multi purpose room or chow hall. If this were changed they'd be at  stars. Great experience. Highly recommended. Excellent restaurant, excellent service, excellent food, and excellent views expecially at night.  I ordered the  oz prime rib and it was incredible. I also ordered the garlick mashed potatoes which was full of flavor.  My wife ordered a sole fish dish and it melted in your mouth good.  Great for a romantic dinner or a place to lounge with a great view. First off I want to state that their customer service is phenomenal. I mean it's really outstanding that it puts all other places to shame. We came with a party of  for as a birthday celebration and the limo we had taken shows up late and then takes us down the longer roads ( I know he tried but showing up on time would have been really helpful). So we tell our waiter that we are basically on a time crunch. Eat, pay, leave. Didn't really get too much time to just sit, relax, and enjoy it all. We got our food just as quickly as we ordered it and I want to also thank all the other customers who probably had to wait a tad longer because of our food. The food was just as outstanding as the service. I ordered a spinach salad, prime rib cut, the asparagus, and mashed potatoes (serving size of side dishes are perfect for ). Everything was delicious! While waiting for your food they give you a tasty roasted garlic to spread on your bread and a cold vegetable dish that came with a sun dried tomato dip. I dislike raw carrots but their raw carrots with the dip kept me eating more and more. Even after my entire meal I kept eating more. I plan on coming back but this time I will take my sweet time enjoying my food and surroundings. They have a piano player who played Disney songs to Hotel California. Awesome! If you want a nice dinner with amazing customer service and a beautiful view I highly suggest this place. Also, when we told them it was her birthday they even brought out a tiny dessert and candle. Thanks Leatherneck! ""This is the life"" my father expressed while drinking a complementary (as guest of the Marine Memorial Hotel) Gin and Tonic staring out at the beautiful San Francisco cityscape from the th floor of the Marines Memorial Club. It's often difficult to see the Forrest through the trees when searching for restaurants on Yelp. I was looking for an experience, not just a decadent food or a well reviewed restaurant; specifically I wanted an amazing, classic view of the city in an upscale restaurant that had traditional ambience.  Yelper Adam B's description, ""the closest you'll get to Mad Men in San Francisco"" for me sealed the deal like Don Draper as I often long for the bygone era (minus the messy social issues) of sorts, well at least to enjoy with my father in his heyday. My family has been staying almost exclusively at the Marine Memorial Club for years as it's my father's favorite hotel in San Francisco, especially as a retired USAF Colonel. It only seemed fitting that I'd take him for a nice dinner upstairs. My brother and I both started with the out of place for a steak house appetizer shrimp and scallop ceviche served ""up"" in a martini glass loosely wrapped in a leaf of butter lettuce. The ceviche was fresh, cilantro loaded and surprisingly spicy. After a few bites my brother and I looked at each other simultaneously and frowned, ""Do you feel that?"" I asked. Gulp. ""Ah! Fire! Hot! Hot! Hot!"" We'd both gotten an unexpected bit of habenro realizing we'd overlooked this crucial little ingredient on the menu. Leatherneck is a steakhouse so I felt somewhat obliged to order, well, a steak  the  oz filet and for my brother, the miso glazed salmon with Asian vegetables. As expected, both of our meals were delicious along with the super rich truffle tater tots we ordered as a side as all sides are ordered separately and come family style. Despite feelings of culinary regression, they are totally gourmet tasting of rich, earthy, gooey mashed potatoes encased in a fancily deep fried shell. I could only eat two. Service was impeccable, our waitress was most attentive and I'd expect nothing less of a steak house serving proudly atop a hotel that exists as a living memorial to the USMC. PS  Leatherneck has a dress code and in an age with increasing casualness, I was excited to don my new salmon hued, drapey, belted H&M dress with classic black satin Max Azaria sling backs. Most of the other patrons were smartly dressed as well, men in jackets and such, except for the distracting man at the adjacent table wearing a baggy velour tracksuit! Is this  and can I ask him to leave, he's spoiling my ambience?! Decor is ok, but the food is great. I personally recommend the Rib eye, Mac and cheese, and Mashed Potatoes. . This restaurant is a special gem in the heart of San Francisco. The breathtaking views will immediately grab your attention but it will be the inviting ambience, friendly service and wonderful menu that keep you coming back. Come before the show, after the show. . . you will not be disappointed! Came here with my GF on saturday for a nice dinner after a long day at the academy of science.  The restaurant is located on the top floor of the marines memorial club and hotel and the view is spectacular.  You can see clear out into the bay and into Oakland. We were promptly seated and the waiter was super nice, the free glass of wine was pretty awesome too.  They bring out a nice spread of stuff to start you off, bread and butter and some veggies and dip. We ordered the prosciutto and mozzarella appetizer, it was a little expensive, $ for a slice of warm cheese wrapped in the prosciutto and  small pieces of bread.  It was however delicious. The steaks came with an iceberg wedge salad which I didn't really like, it was drenched in ranch and iceberg lettuce doesn't have much flavor to begin with.  Felt like I was eating a fancier version of a cheapo buffet salad. Onto the steaks, I got the oz new york and my gf got the oz filet.  First impressions, why the heck did it come with horseradish sauce?  nd impression, meh.  The steak was so so, on par with an applebees caliber restaurant steak.  Something worth   bucks, not +.  It felt a little dry and while the meat looked right, it wasn't that warm and there was just something off about it. While the service, view and everything else about the dinner was spectacular, this is a steak house and the steak should be the most important part of the meal.  The sub par steak gets this place a , but all the other redeeming qualities brings it up to a . This place is the definition of Meh. Only thing it has going for it is the view of the city and I like the fact that its supports the marines. And most of the people were either in the military or vets. The bad part is that the service was HORRIBLE, food was mediocre, and the decor is boring.   The place is definitely a time warp. I'm pretty sure they are stuck in about . The average age of the guests that come here is about . There's nothing wrong with that, but I don't think it's my scene, I also think that's the reason the food is so bland. I ordered the miso salmon, which I could have made at home, my friends got the prime rib, and filet mignon. They all said it was just ok, not worth the price. There are way too many amazing restaurants in San Fran. Stay away from this place! The first time Yelp has let me down!  The decor, service, food, music were a time trip to   good if you like that kind of thing. The wine list was a paper sheet with  Cabs  terrible. The food was awful.  We had a prosciutto wrapped mozzerella that was disgusting  the meet was gray, the cheese too thick.  The cesear ""prepared traditionally"" had no anchovies and the lettuce was gross. The truffle tater tots sounded awesome  they were instead over fried pieces of potato with zero flavor.  The service was very poor.  The hostess at one point came over to make sure we knew the restaurant was in honor of the military  she tried to name the branches for us, but couldn't remember them!Awful. This is the closest you'll get to Mad Men in San Francisco.  It's my new favorite pre theater restaurant!  Perfect location in the heart of Union Square.  Not touristy and not a mob scene.  Great views and natural light since it's on the top floor.  Fun atmosphere with tons of stately looking men in collared shirts quickly and efficiently devouring their steaks.  Classic food with innovative twists. Roasted Garlic: A simple touch that is so appreciated.  Most places don't offer roasted garlic and, when they do, they charge at least $ for a bulb that was less than ¢.  Here it's offered gratis alongside the butter and makes for an amazing bread spread. Iceberg Lettuce Salad: Classic.  Included with the steak purchase.  I'm normally anti iceberg, but there is something retro about cutting into a quarter of a head doused generously with chunky blue cheese dressing.  Granted, this could have been heavenly with bacon, but  the creamy dressing against the crisp watery lettuce sufficed to keep my palate interested throughout. Prime Rib: I asked for a medium cut and this was more like medium well, with only a hint of red.  Guess the lesson is to ask for a notch rarer than what you desire.  Loved the sides of the cut that were engulfed by crispy fat wafers resulting from hours of slow braising.  The inner meat was too tough for my tastes, but probably more a factor of the aforementioned doneness issue.  Wasn't a fan of the house steak sauce since it tasted too much of cloves, but the béarnaise was exquisite!Truffle Tater Tots: Best. Side. Ever.  Imagine mashed potatoes mixed with black truffle then extruded and deep fried to look like mini churros.  Don't even dare taint this with ketchup!  I'm shocked that no other restaurant in San Francisco has tried to bootleg this. Bread Pudding: Massive.  Dense.  Full of hearty goodness, but probably too heavy a pairing after a big steak.  Best to share  per  or more people. Loved the Rib Eye and mashed potatoes.  Excellent customer service!Restaurant is a little small though. Didn't really like the piano player, more for an older crowd. Lovely, upscale steakhouse feel with fairly reasonable prices. Located in the historic Marines Memorial Club & Hotel, take time before or after your meal to stroll around the lobby and look at the displays. The restaurant is on the th floor. If available, ask for a seat by the window for a nice view over the city and water. They start you out with a small, complementary crudite plate and bread with roasted cloves of garlic and butter. Yum! All of the entrees also come with a wedge salad with blue cheese dressing. For my main course, I got the filet mignon, cooked to my specified medium rare, with a nice, tender texture and seasoning on top. I would preferred slightly more of a char on the exterior for textural contrast, but it was a nice piece of steak nonetheless. Sides are a la carte and say they serve two. I was dining alone (in town on business) and the server was nice enough to bring me a half order of asparagus when I asked (and only charge half the price, which I didn't ask, but certainly appreciated). I love asparagus, but these were steamed (vs. grilled or sauteed, which are both superior methods in my opinion) and over cooked. Also, the hollandaise sauce was thin and foamy instead of rich and creamy. But, a minor part of the meal, which was great overall. Its hard to make me a fan of anything. Just look at all my other reviews. I arrived early and seemingly there was a full reservation list and most of the tables were taken. We were seated as soon as a table became available earlier than our reservation. This was a nice touch. The Salad simple enough was a quarter cut wedge of Iceberg lettuce served with your choice of dressing. In my case I ordered the Blue Cheese and it was nice balance, not too pungent or overpowering blue cheese. I ordered the Seabass it was served in a Safron broth with Manila clams. This was excellent and on this dish alone I give this place high marks. It was perfectly cooked, not overdone, maintained its moist center. My friend had a  New York steak and it seemed a little more than Medium Rare in temperature, but still in the neighborhood of ""Warm Red center"" (barely)  We had the Calamari appetizer, it was well executed with the nice crunch batter. This was served with a a homeade cocktail sauce that was suprisingly well balanced with just enough horseradish to give it the right kick. We also had two sides that are ""a La Carte""  The Creamed Spinach  was good, but the real kicker was the Truffle flavored Tater tots. This was a nice rendition of mashed potato, a good truffle flavor, reconstituted and shaped into two inch long, Tater Tots then fried.  My other critiques it  that it could have been done with a hotter oil so as to reduce its absorbtion of oil. The service was very attentive to a fault, and anticipated our needs. He made good suggestions without being pushy. The views are great from this location, you can see across the San Francisco city Skyline, and its about   blocks from Union Square. Looking out the window off the th floor (I think thats the correct floor) you can see clear across into the Sir Francis Drake Hotel and the top of it is the Starlight Room. The whole place is rich in history and great tribute to our Armed Forces. I recomend this place and I already have reservations for a second event here. Great views, wonderful service, delicious food and a diverse menu. In addition, you support an organization which supports our troops?  A great experience! Great food. Good Food. Moderate Prices. Bad Service. When here for a buddy's birthday. Everything aligned expect the lacking and slow service, which left us wondering whether the server was half the time on a night where only two other parties were in the restaurant.  If you don't care about service and appreciate good food at moderate prices, this place is for you. This place was AWESOME!  The food is really simple, traditional American.  What do you expect from a place called Leathernecks?! Anywho, my prime rib was made to perfection, the Fiance's porkchop was huge and tender and the sides were TO DIE for.  My daughter LOVED the mac and cheese and mashed potatoes.  She also really enjoyed the view from the th floor.  The servers were very attentive and sweet to us.  The ambiance is calm and maybe it wasnt the best place to have a  year old eat at, they were not snotty about it at all.  There is some what of a dress code and you can't use your cell phones up there either.  What I enjoyed was the piano player, who will ask you for your requests.  We tipped him and he played all these cute disney songs for us.  =) It was a great night for us. Oh man, got off the elevator and walked into this great room and got slapped in the face with this view of the city skyline that knocked me off my feet. Wow. This was a first for us. We were seated right next to the windows. Pure old school. Relish tray and even roasted garlic for the bread. The entrees come with a wedge salad with blue cheese and sides were extra but were plenty for two people. Wife ordered the filet a notch more rare than usual and came out perfect. Every thing was delicious. Our server Miguel took care of us but was not pushy, just right. Great experience. Elevator down and onto the street to become part of that awesome view from the th floor of the Leatherneck. good food, amazing ambiance, great staff. all in all unbelievable value. perfect spot to dine with that special someone and have a great time watching the city. The service here is really good.  The wait staff is very attentive.  What's more impressive is the view.  When I was eating dinner, the fog kept rolling in and out.  It was really a sight to see. The prices are also very reasonable for a steak here.  There was something interesting in the marinade, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it.  I asked out waitress, but she couldn't tell me.  The sides are quite large, so be prepared to share. *Total San Francisco Hidden Gem*This was a complete  star experience. We went here for my dad's birthday and reserved a window table, which I would highly recommend. The view is great. Between the food, service, and piano player, which added a fun and elegant element to the evening, I can not have asked for a better night for my dad's birthday. P. S. There were even Marine's there. . . since, ya know, it's at the top of the Marine's Memorial Building. Service was great.  View was excellent.  Atmosphere was quiet & there was a live pianist.  The food was delicious.  Icing on the cake was that the prices were quite reasonable  got out for quite a bit less than damage from other steakhouses in SF. Great spot.  Fantastic value.  Will definitely be back. Thank you yelp! Went to Leatherneck on Saturday night and had a fantastic time! While we were by far the youngest people in the restaurant, we had fantastic service and the food was excellent. The view was amazing, despite the rainy weather. . . We ordered the filets, which were great and cooked perfectly, and the tator tots lived up to all the reviews. It was our friends birthday as well, and they brought out a free dessert for him! Also, make sure to ask for the ""yelp"" glass of wine, not only did they give all  of us a free glass, but they were not shy on the pour! :)Overall, had a fabulous experience and would definitely return! Sincerely loved this place and would definitely recommend it!My boyfriend and I walked in without a reservation around  on a Saturday night and were asked to wait about  minutes so they could set a table up for us. They put us in one of the two dining rooms with amazing city views (from the th floor), which was appreciated (I think they could have sat us sooner otherwise) and allowed us to grab a drink at the bar. Once seated, we were given a basket of sliced, toasted bread, butter balls and a clove of roasted garlic (amazing touch). There were also some veggies and a dipping sauce, as well as a couple of olives. We ordered the oysters rockefeller for an app, and they were to die for! Our meals were equally amazing,. .  iceburg wedge, steaks (I got the filet mignon) cooked perfectly, creamy garlic mashed potatoes (to share). . . wow! I wish I had room for dessert! We also took advantage of the complementary glasses of wine for Yelpers, and got  glasses of house cab which we both loved. However, the waitress had not heard about this and was hesitant to give us the deal until I showed it to her on my phone. . . so come prepared. All in all, $ plus tip for a two hour dining experience was well worth it. The view gets  stars, service gets  & food gets .  All in all, underwhelming and overpriced.  They could do well to start with more competent wait staff. Amazing view of the city from this restaurant.  The food was pretty good for the price.  The steak was a little overcooked for medium but still tasty. I recommend getting there well before they close because they tend to rush you out otherwise. This was a totally funny way for my friends and me to end our Friday after being in Napa for wine tasting. My friend found it on Yelp and made reservations for . The restaurant was nearly empty. I must admit, when we all walked in with jeans and I with my suitcase I was concerned.  They have a dress code, but we must have been okay. And, c'mon, the place had only a few tables of serious looking diners. However, my concern was again piqued when a matronly manager looking woman ran up to me as I followed the hostess back to our table and asked if she could help me. You know, in the 'Can I HELP you because you sure seem to be in the wrong place, sweetie?"" way. I then heard her say to the hostess ""Did they just walk in off the street?"" Frankly, that started things off a bit wrong for me. For all she knew, I was a decorated Marine. (I'm not, but that's not the point. I have seen Marines wear jeans before, even for dinner. ) No matter, the rest of the evening made up for it. This place is old skool.  It would be fun to dress up in s clothing and have a Mad Men themed evening here, for example. I had a Manhattan to memorialize this. The only way to go is old. I had the French Onion soup, which is as expected but satisfying. The lettuce wedge with blue cheese was another retro touch.  I ordered a fillet, which was cooked to my specifications (I'm a medium gal) and creamed spinach and mashed potatoes to share with my friend. We remarked at the end that we easily could have split those with more people, even if it says ""serves "" on the menu. I think that if we as a  group of  ordered  or  to share, that would be sufficient. The only thing was was regrettable was the red zin that I ordered to accompany my meal. Since a portion of proceeds from that wine go to our troops, I'll forgive that. (Combined with the fact that I had just spent  days tasting all variety of delish reds in Napa). The views were fantastic, and they gave us a great table to watch the urban pageantry. Despite my initial experience with the manager, she later came up to make sure everything was as expected. Our waiter was efficient and friendly. The only problem posed was when we tried to pay with  credit cards. The waiter, though, fixed the issue by running separate tabs, which some of my party balked at, but I found truly accommodating when you think that they probably don't do this that often. All in all, satisfying, and I'd go back. Excellent view and great food at a reasonable price.  My husband's steak was overcooked, but the flavor was great!! Thank you yelp for a great rec! Went there last night for BF's birthday dinner. The bar and restaurant are gorgeous  just too bad with all the crappy weather lately that we couldn't enjoy the view. anyway. Service was impeccable. The food itself was outstanding. we both had filets, shared an order of calamari and the garlic fries. the individual iceberg wedge salads were delish and so cute too!and for my bf's birthday they brought out dessert on the house and sang for him. i was really, really quite pleased here and would love to go back! Great service , Great Food . . . . and oh yeah did anyone mention the VIEW? You are abut even with the start light room. Penguin is right on with the views of the park etc etc. Took wife and cousin for wife's th and had great time . Started with calamari french onion soup and the oyster Rockefeller . . all were great. dinners came with wedge salad with their own dressing that was quite impressive. never would have tried a ""wedge"" of lettuce unless it was given to me. but that's just me. roasted garlic for your bread. the Mrs had the prime rib good size and ""pretty good"" her words. Cousin Dre had the shrimp pasta that she ""loved"" her words. and a Beef dish with a oz American Kobe which was awesome in flavor aroma and presentation. we all shared the asparagus hollandese , massed potatoes. so good we had to finish those first since they don't travel well. the ladies had way more food so they some to go. Just picked this out with a little from my Yelp friends and it paid off. Thanks!! Julie M was either high or at another restaurant than the one I ate in last night with my friend. The views were fantastic! One can see the East Bay and the Bay; the ball park, part of the TransAmerica building and a commanding view of the Union Plaza area, altho you can't see the plaza itself. The atmosphere was warm and charming, with live piano music, nice linnen and fantastic service. Meals include a nice set up of bread with soft butter balls, a cooked garlic glove and fresh veggies/olives with a pimento cheese dip. We had the Ahi tuna tower and the oysters rockefeller to start. B loved her tuna with avacado and crab. I enjoyed the oysters, but the spinach was a little stronger than the rest of the dish. I had the Alaskan halibut, which was very tasty and tender. B's steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned well enough that nothing was needed to top it. For sides we enjoyed the chard and I do highly recommend the truffle tater tots. Really tender inside with wonderfully crisp exterior and a perfect hint of truffle. For dessert, she got the chocolate pot, a mousse with cherreis and topped by whipped cream. When our server, Cynthia, lit up when asked about the bread pudding, I was sold. It was warm and delish with whipped cream on top. I wanted to marry this dessert. The service was very warm and attentive and not at all rushed, which was great as B and I had a lot to discuss. A nice meal shouldn't be any less than  minutes, so I seriously suspect those who complain about how hard it is to get their servers attention! There were plenty of people to assist any of our needs. I suggest a dinner reservation to allow for the watching of sunset, as the colors are spectacular and to see the city change from day to evening was magic and romantic. Their menu is small but varied and the prices are not bad for the value. Spend some time checking out the floor below (beautiful library) and the ornate lobby of the hotel. And while it's labeled as the  floor, realize that there are  floors not numbered, so it's actually the th floor. FYI. Sitting here right now.  Looking at the beautiful view.  The ribeye was tasty yet lean.  The truffle tots were salty and tasty.  We didn't even use katsup.   The mac and cheese was creamy goodnes.  Service was awesome.  My Makers Manhattan was  dollars.  Yep.  Beautiful night, beautiful view, great food, great price.  Awesome service.  Ask for Eddie. Never heard of this place until I checked out the Marine's Memorial Hotel for a wedding reception venue.  When my fiance and I were shown this restaurant during the tour, i knew we had to come back.  The view our the windows of this top floor restaurant are great. I had a filet mignon, that was good, just slightly more cooked than I ordered it, but tasty nonetheless.  We had a few appetizers, the ahi tar tar and some baked oysters, I cleaned both plates. But the MUST have recommendation I have for the night was the truffle tater totes.  It's a side order to the entrees.  I would come back over and over, just for the tater tots.  Everyone around us ordered them as well, it must be one of their specialties. surprisingly good under the radar steakhouse with a killer downtown views. old school ambiance and menu; the salad accompanying my steak was a half a head of iceberg lettuce smothered in heavenly bleu cheese dressing. t bone was very good; side of truffle tater tots nothing less than stellar. the martinis are top notch too. . . i definitely recommend heading up to the th floor of the marines memorial building. you won't be disappointed. yum.  solid t bone that comes with free iceberg lettuce wedge with blue cheese salad.  very inexpensive compare to other steak houses. must order truffle tater tots.  Its mashed potatoes squeezed out of a pastry bag then baked then seasoned with truffle.  an artisinal tater tot. . . . never imagined one existed. without a doubt, a secret dining place. My wife and I were looking for a nice steakhouse on my birthday.  We didn't want to go somewhere noisy and crowded.  Leatherneck Steakhouse fit the bill perfectly.  We had reservations and were seated promptly upon arrival.  A few minutes later we were given bread, butter, some vegetables, and a nice roasted garlic spread.  There was a live piano in the background and people talking quietly at their tables.  Although we did not have a window seat, the view of downtown San Francisco was incredible.  The word to describe the atmosphere is ""classy. ""We ordered a prime rib and rib eye steak and shared an ice burg lettuce salad, asparagus, and mashed potatoes.  It was just the right portion for two people.  The meat was tasty, succulent, and done just right.  The rib eye was lean with just a bit of fat trim for flavor.  I didn't put any sauce on it since a good streak should stand on its own. Throw in a glass of wine and it was truly an enchanting evening.  Since this restaurant is tucked a few blocks away from Union Square, it probably doesn't see a lot of tourist foot traffic.  That provides the peaceful and upscale atmosphere which is sometimes lacking around that area even at nice restaurants. Great food and even better company at the Leatherneck Steakhouse. I was the lucky recipient of an invite to dinner at the restaurant on the th floor of the Marine's Memorial Club and Hotel by  very gracious hosts.  We had a leisurely dinner in honor of a veteran Marine who just happened to be my ex boss.  A bit of shop talk, a bit of reminiscing, and some really great food. In regards to the food: I nibbled on the non meat parts of the appetizers, a spinach salad was my main course  very good, and I gorged on all of the delicious sides (creamed corn, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, and asparagus w/ hollandaise).  The saddest part was that everyone around me ordered steaks, which smelled truly mouth watering.  Extremely tempting, but never fear, my vegetarianism remains intact, I didn't surrender!For dessert  bread pudding topped with whipped cream, yummy. Very classy joint, the service was superb  thank you MW, I had a lovely time. I love to be surprised in a good way.  Leatherneck Steakhouse knocked my socks off!  When I heard the name, I immediately thought it was some funky place in the Castro.  I'm just sayin'.  Turns out, it's on the th floor of the Marines Memorial Club (near Union Sq. ) with some of the best dining views in the city.  'Leatherneck' is the adorable bulldog mascot whose likeness sits in the lobby and dots everything from the silverware to the table decorations. . . love!!Food is old school. . . iceberg wedges anyone?  There's a pianist most evenings and a bar filled with interesting conversations of war exploits from all eras.  Just get your best s vibe on and roll with it, because the steaks are awesome and much more reasonably priced than Morton's or Ruth's Chris. I've been back for lunch and that's another treat. . . on a clear day, the views are phenomenal.  The atmosphere is calm, service is very sweet, and you'll find yourself thinking that you'd fit in better if you just had a martini in your hand. . . Oh, unlike the snooty Olympic Club next door, non visitors are welcome to dine and even (gasp!) to stay in the hotel.  More on that awesome experience in another review. This review is for the Leatherneck Bar. . . This was a fun location to hang out at for awhile on a December Saturday night, before heading out to a ""black tie"" event (remember THOSE days?). We had made reservations to get in, prior, by calling. We were all decked out in our penguin best, and eye catching dresses as we stepped out of the elevator, which turned a few heads just with our arrival. A quick drop of a name, thanks to the prior reservation, and we were IN. The bar is pretty small, and very crowded. But, to have the opportunity to enjoy a cocktail, and a nice view, both inside the bar and outside to the city, made it worth the extra effort. With most of the clientele being of military relation, the courtesy level was extremely high. And, when was the last time you encountered that in a crowded bar?  Live piano provided the music, as several used the musical device as a bar. Good conversation was enjoyed by all. Did I mention the military personnel? Yeah, just wanted to make sure. Every so often, you stumble upon a relatively unknown (to you) type of restaurant that you end up loving. Then you leave and find yourself torn between shouting out its praises, or keeping it a secret so it doesn't turn into one of those places that you need to call three months in advance, or promise your firstborn son to, just to get a reservation. Tonight that is precisely what happened to me and my group of five. No, I hadn't given away my yet to be conceived firstborn. We happened upon what is clearly one of the best kept secrets in the city. Who knew there was a steakhouse in the Marines' Memorial Club that could rival Alfred's in San Fran, or Smith & Wollensky in Manhattan, or Luger in Brooklyn (or for those of you who like chains, Ruth's Chris and Morton's)? Unless you are a retired Marine, sailor, or soldier, you probably wouldn't have known, either. (For the record, this restaurant, and I believe the hotel in general, is open to the public. So there's no need for you to enlist just to get a juicy steak here!)The food was excellent. We feasted on several appetizers, not realizing how sizable the portions were. For our entrees, our group ordered t bones and rib eyes, each of which were seasoned, seared and fired up to juicy perfection. Coffee and desserts were equally amazing, and I highly recommend the raspberry crisp and the bread pudding. Service was friendly and efficient. Our server was very attentive and came back repeatedly to refill our water glasses and wine goblets, also to check if our food was to our liking and if we needed anything. The hostess also came by and talked to us for a few minutes before she moved on to the next table. She's like your grandmother or your favorite aunt whose smile warms up any room and makes sure you're eating well. And the view! Whether you're a long time San Francisco resident or a visitor in town for only a week, you'll love the sweeping view from the th floor, which is high enough to see the top of the Trans Am building, yet still low enough to see people walking on Sutter and nearby Union Square. I see Leatherneck as a good place for business dinners, birthdays, anniversaries and other special occasions. But you can also go there if you just want a quiet dinner of juicy steak with a bottle of red wine. I think there are three dining room sections where you can dress up or dress down as you wish. We'll definitely go back to this place the next time we're in the Bay area, next time I'm booking a table for dinner around sunset. Out of , restaurants in San Francisco, how and why did I choose this one to go to on our first night of our weekend in S. F. ?? If this had been an Apprentice task, Donald Trump so would've fired me. We made reservations for  pm and were promptly seated (cuz the restaurant wasn't even poppin'). The views that the website boasts about? Well, if your idea of a dazzling view is  looking at the tops of buildings and their A/C units, well then you are in for a treat here! Our drink orders were taken, brought to us, and then our server all but disappeared. We had to flag him down to order our appetizers. Crabcakes were forgettable according to my boyfriend, my friend's proscuitto and mozzarella was equally forgettable and my French onion soup was just ok. Entrees were blah. My sirloin steak had too much gristle  gross. My BF's New York strip was boring and my friend's shrimp fettucini was way underseasoned. At least the garlic fries were good!Service was atrocious. Where were these servers hiding out at?!! The place wasn't even busy!! Oh my Lord, and don't even get me started on the piano player  the music was nice  but then some old broad sat next to him and started singing ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" at the top of her lungs. FML. . . This was one of those experiences where you're thinking you would've so been better off going to TGI Friday's and ordering a steak with Jack Daniel's sauce and a jumbo Long Island Iced Tea. Pass on this!! I found this restaurant using yelp ratings only (no prior experience with the restaurant or even part of town).  We held a business dinner here for  guests. I was able to call ahead an reserve a table without any trouble. As far as the restaurant goes. . . Food was good. Service was OK. Average atmosphere but nice view. Overall it worked out well. Thanks Yelp Reviewers! I picked this place after seeing a higher yelp rating than Morton's!  I had two lovely ladies visitng from Brazil and they wanted a good steak.  We were greeted in the bar by a  yr. old drunk Marine with plenty of ""salty"" war stories, oh, but wait it gets better; then a  something linebacker type couldn't stop staring at the ladies kinda creepin them out, shoulda left then, but we wanted that  star steak. I have to say the ervice was good and the prosciutto and mozarrella (warmed) was excellent.  I ordered the NY Steak and my frinds had filets.  The NY actually couldn't be cut with an sharp steak knife and was so tough and sinewy it was inedible.  The filet's were definitely tender, but it tasted old and with absolutely zero flavor; like eating a dishrag!Sorry, I'm not out to trash the place, but come on, better than Morton's; don't think so Well the food here was just about great and the view is pretty. My steak was perfect and the side of garlic mash potatoes were stellar. They should be for the price. The appetizers were lacking. The calamari was so salty I had one bite and was done. The shrimp cocktail was pretty but nothing remarkable. The service was awful. Some of our party was late so we had drinks at the bar. We were told we had to be seated and order because they were going to close in a hour. Well after a half an hour of the hostess talking to someone else we were still waiting to be seated and felt stress over the time. The waiter forgot to put in an order for rack of lamb and then tried to push the prime rib. So we all had our food at different times. Not good. We were the only ones in the place but waited over  min for a bottle of wine.  We were then told we had to wait to see the dessert menu. Just weird crappy service. The dessert was great and the specialty coffees were strong just not served when the dessert came. I don't think I will be going back. Good food.  Good service.  Reverent atmosphere. I don't think anybody in our party even knew this place existed prior to our visit last night.  I was a little cynical of a steakhouse that uses the name 'leather' to describe itself, I'm usually not a huge fan of leathery food. First off, don't try to order a fancy drink from the bartender here, he'll inform you that the average age of his clientele is  and they don't drink froo froo drinks. . . so stick with scotch and soda. . . This place was actually delicious, the ribeye was terrific and cooked perfectly, the truffled tater tots, mushroom platter, onion rings, french onion soup were all fantastic.  The only reason for  stars and not  is that the service wasn't very prompt.  It took about  minutes after we sat down for the server to even acknowledge us, which is bizarre considering there were only  or  other parties in the place. I would definitely come back here again, but it is fairly touristy, so probably would wait until I have a visitor in town to frequent this place again. We went here last night with a group of  after seeing Dame Edna. It was close by and there were some ""military people"" in the goup. The main dining room seemed very nice with a view. We got put into the second room at two tables for more privacy and space. This room had a more ""banquet hall"" atmosphere. The food was solid what I would expect at a ""good"" restaurant in Kansas or Iowa or some place like that. For SF it was sub par. Service was acceptable. For the same price you can get much better elsewhere. So it's my parents' birthdays  significant birthdays  and we asked them how they would like to celebrate.  Ideas included: go away for the weekend party at one of our homes party at the old folks' home where they live dinner anywhere their heart desiredWell, their hearts desired to eat at the Leatherneck Steakhouse.  None of us were enthused, but went along with the program.   We thought it was an odd choice since my family is not very pro military.   My dad was in WWII, but doesn't talk about his experiences, which included the Battle of the Bulge and liberating a Nazi concentration camp. The manager of the MM Club was very helpful and gave us a wonderful, semi private table in the back of the restaurant.   The room itself is lovely  great view, very bright and they have live music.   When we arrived one of the hotel guests was drunkenly serenading the rest of the bar and restaurant with her version of Memories.  We had brought our own table decorations, flowers and place cards and the table looked beautiful, set with heavy cutlery, crystal glasses and these way cool salt and apper shakers that had the Leatherneck emblem  a bulldog  engraved on them.  We were taking bets on which one of the four sisters would rip them off. The server that was assigned to us was a bit of a problem.  Her English was very poor, and she never approached the table unless I called her over.   She basically stood against the wall for the evening.  It became a little tiresome to beckon her over to take the orders for  people, to ask questions about the menu, to order cocktails, etc. The food was actually pretty decent, and we even managed to make the vegetarians in the party happy with mac & cheese, salads and truffled potato puffs  yum.  The carnivores enjoyed steak and pork chops that they carved up with their scimitar shaped knives.   My fish entree was also good, even though the crab in my crab cocktail had seen better days. We had a bit of a disconnect with dessert.  We had brought separate, special desserts for both parents and they were stashed in the restaurants kitchen.  When I told the server that it was time for dessert, she brought out the two desserts with candles and we all sung happy birthday  but she hadn't taken anyone else's orders, so we all sat there and watched my parents relish their tasty treats.   At this point, we had been at the restaurant for nearly three hours, and we all wanted to leave, so the rest of us skipped dessert. All in all, a good place for a special occasion  and the price was right too!  We ate n' drank like fools and it was less than $  a bargain by SF standards. Oh  and my parents had a blast, thanks for asking! I would give the food here four stars and the price and value three stars.  I've been to Leatherneck's here in the past for social cocktails and other brunches.  Came here yesterday with co workers to celebrate a co worker farewell luncheon.  Located on the th floor of the Marines Memorial Club and Hotel (see my other review: yelp. com/biz/marines mem… ).  This restaurant is also open to the public if you want to drop by if in the area to experience some spectacular vistas over looking east to south east downtown SF.  You can see AT&T park from the restaurant!  I ordered the Angus Beef hamburger.  I was surprised that it was actually very tasty.  It was cooked medium just the way I like it and came on a sesame bun with fresh leafy lettuce, red onions and potato wedges. I had an ice tea and raspberry sorbet for desert.  The sorbet tasted freshly made with fresh raspberries.  Okay, I was thinking:  ""but for $.  ($.  including tax+tip), it BETTER be good!""  These prices are anticipated at hotels/places like this but what can you do?  marineclub. com/leatherne… A hidden Gem in SF  if you are in to steak and a great view come here, but make reservations first.  You don't have to be a Marine to visit, eat at the restaurant, or stay at the hotel  so head up to the th floor and let the experience begin.  If you are in to happy hour the bar holds happy hour from   for guests of the hotel  non guests are welcome as well, but you pay for your drinks. I personally like to get there after   sit at the bar have a drink then head in to dining area for dinner.  Your view is of Union Square, and across the skyline is the Starlight Room & the Bay.  The sunsets are amazing to watch from the th floor as the amount of light that fills the place is amazing.  I've read the reviews and while I can appreciate an honest review,  I can say we've  never had a bad experience here and we go regularly.  Just because you have (for example) eight people at your table doesn't mean one appetizer serves all of you  I mean if you ordered crab cakes you probably get two so of course  it's not enough appetizers for everyone at the table.  Also if you run out of bread ask for more these servers are literally there to make you happy. The meals also come with a salad that is HUGE  so I'm sure once you've had bread & salad you won't be complaining your hungry once your dinner is done.  The pork chops, prime rib, steak all excellent choices, and you get to choose side dishes if you so desire to go with your meal. They are big enough to serve at least  people easily so you can share.  It's a somewhat romantic spot, and some evenings they have a pianist come in and play for a few hours which definately sets the mood.  I am a fan of the Marines Memorial Club & The Leatherneck Steakhouse!  p. s.  Try the Leatherneck Ale it's great!P. S. We've been back numerous times since my first review because I can't get enough of this place. Last night we celebrated my birthday and had a nice romantic dinner  window side. I took some pictures of the views & our meals which I've uploaded to Yelp.  It was fabulous and my Filet Mignon melted like butter in my mouth. These other reviews make me think there are two Leatherneck Steakhouses in San Francisco.  The one I visited last night with my family was terrible, with problems from start to finish.  The bartender was rude and made the worst sidecar I've ever had.  I couldn't drink it.  Not enough bread or appetizers for the table.  My uncle's fish was undercooked.  My crab was overcooked (and they were ""out of"" the crackers and little forks, which the waiter told me with no apology or suggestion for how the hell I'm supposed to eat my ""crab leg dinner. ""  Um, ok?).  My aunt's fork (which was apparently a score) was dirty.  Service was terrible.  The entrees arrived at different times and we had to ask them to bring the side dishes we had ordered.  They weren't hot.  My stepmom had to try three times to get the waiter to take her drink order.  I ordered two glasses of Zinfandel and they came in two different glasses (one a cabernet glass), again without explanation.  The berry crisp was inedible: not hot and no ""crisp. ""  One star for the tater tots, which were great, which was no surprise.  How can a tater tot not be great?  If someone could let me know where the other Leatherneck Steakhouse is, the one with the good food, I'm there. Don't ask me how I ended up at Leatherneck Steakhouse located at the Marines Memorial Club and Hotel for dinner. Nevertheless, it was pleasant experience. The dining room resembled one of a typical pricey hotel restaurant, somewhat elegant but extremely quiet. What I remember the most was the spectacular view of the city from our table and my perfectly cooked rib eye. The rib eye served literally on a silver platter was so perfect and juicy I still remember it to this day. The entrees come with a classic relish and an iceberg wedge salad. Sides like mashed or baked potato, creamed spinach, mac & cheese, etc are $ each but serves two. Personally, I think it should also be included with all entrees. Everything else was pretty typical from the crispy calamari, baked potato, NY cheesecake and the warm berry crisp. Spectacular views, solid food, great service. Strong pours on the drinks and a modest but serviceable wine list. Don't let the Marine Corps thing scare you away  when you walk into the hotel you'll pass a rack of medals; turn right to the elevators and you're greeted by a statue of a bulldog wearing a USMC uniform. That's it  no bloody murals depicting the landings on Iwo Jima or Herman Hanneken making off with Peralte's body. And no, the waitstaff isn't made up of retired Marine NCOs. Pairing crab cakes with a bottle of Kendall Jackson reserve chardonnay made a great start to our evening. It's amazing a place like this isn't packed all the time. Great views of the city in a low stress setting. Recommended, especially at sunset."|3|91|2|Routine| Improper food storage  [ date violation corrected: 5/8/2012 ] Improper cooling methods  [ date violation corrected: 5/8/2012 ]
Florio Bar & Cafe 0|3.5|French in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|241|0|3.52941176471|" Consistent and classy. You can't go wrong sitting at their amber lit bar with a cocktail, hamburger (grilled to gooey perfection with cowgirl creamery cheese and onion on rye), and pommes frites (crisp, thin, and salty). Service is unobtrusive and seasoned. Great spot to dine alone or with a partner, as the dining area is a bit small for groups. Pros: Lavazza coffee was good! quick to be seated classy interior designCons: slow to receive food (even when we were the only patrons) French toast was burned (and flipped upside down to hide char)Bottom line: come here if you're really hungry and every other restaurant on Fillmore has a long wait Came here on a date. Great, cozy and vibrant atmosphere on Saturday nights. Cocktails, wine list and food was wonderful and the staff was particularly courteous and friendly. Definitely would recommend and go back. .  of  star. Overall my experience there is not bad although they don't serve Ice tea. The compliment bread with butter is very good. Perfect to eat with butter or dip it in sauce. We ordered the prawn as appetizer and it was amazing. I love the spice they put in the dish and great to deep the bread in it. The bolognese sauce with bacon was delicious. Very tasty even though the pastas were little soft past al dente and little salty. We were too full to get to the dessert round so save that for next time. We love this place. . . but think about the provenance. . . the owner is owner of a few other GREAT places in SF   Market Bar (Ferry Building Farmers market) and Bix to  name a few. . . this place is definitely a neighborhood place in the feeling but the service and food is worth the trip even in you don't live nearby. Essential to a place like this is a great bar, you can go in alone or with a friend and have a drink and get a great dinner. My favorite bar person is Tara. Just love her. She never steers us wrong on wine and food pairing and she is fun to talk to.  I also really like the host, he is so stylish and used to work at Hermes. He is so fun to talk to. The wait staff is very professional and knows their stuff. We have dined here easily  times at a table and the service has always been great. The roasted chicken is a staple like Zuni café and never disappoints. You can order it for one or two people and its a always tweaked in terms of sides with it for the season . The weekly fish and vegetable is also awesome. They tend to be seasonal and more farm to table which I love. They also have some great wine producers  that can be had by the bottle or glass or even by the tap.  They also have great rose wines from France is which can be spotty to find in SF. They have a full bar and do a some great weekly cocktails too. On a final note I am picky about a place being clean. No issues on the dining room and equally important, the bathroom is always clean and nice. If you don't know where to go for dinner tonight  a friend, a date or a business meeting, this place is just right and there are a ton of bars and other places to go after you have dinner. This is a place you can take you elderly aunt, your younger cousin or your fun friend from out of town and have an equally good time. I wish they were open for lunch! Very nice, sophisticated menu, venue and service. Good bar and wine list, good apps and high quality, limited menu. Have eaten here twice and both meals were very good. Friend and I tried to get into SPQR for Saturday night dinner, but unsurprisingly, the wait was over an hour, so we strolled over to Florio and found a spot at the bar. I should have checked Yelp before ordering, but I was craving pasta, so I decided on the gnocchi. Sadly, when the dish came out, all I found were   tiny pieces of dough scattered on my plate with a bland white sauce poured over. This dish was definitely not filling and I felt like I was eating an appetizer. I asked for extra bread just to satiate my appetite. My friend ordered the burger which at least looked substantial in portion and came with side of fries. Service was attentive but not the warmest. I felt bad though  we were sitting at the bar, so our server had to manage making drinks for everyone else at the restaurant. Will I be back? Potentially for drinks before having dinner somewhere else on Fillmore St. Great atmosphere, good service, and the best roasted chicken for two I've ever had.  Comes with roasted veggies and a side of pommel frites. Lost a star because the noise level was god awful.  We were there on Saturday.  Waiter told us to try Sun/Mon/Tues. Will certainly give it another go. . . . 'cause of the chicken! Walked by this place and picked it based on atmosphere. The meal ended up being really good.  We got the carafe of white wine which was good. Nice and fruity tones.  We shared a roasted pear salad which had a really nice overall taste if you got all of the ingredients into one bite (was a bit peppery though).  Our entrees were the chicken and hanger steak.  Both were prepared perfectly,  I got frites on the side,  They were great, but afterward I felt they were a bit over salted (could just be me, I mean, fries are supposed to be salty).  Dessert: caramelized apple tart (yes, highly recommended); vanilla and persimmon gelato (persimmon gelato was awesome). Pasta and crab was wonderful and loved the atmosphere oops. i got the wrong restaurant. I've deleted my review but left the stars out of embarrassment. I can only comment on the bar, and one bartender (Gerald was the name on my receipt). I have never been treated so rudely in my life. I was at the bar, with a couple of friends for a couple of hours while we were waiting for our table at State Bird, so we were ordering drinks and appetizers. Service  of drinks at the bar was unbelievably slow for a restaurant that was not crowded. But, that was not offensive, only annoying. This bartender never once asked if we want another round. We literally had to beg him to take another order. Then one more joined our party and it took a long time to get Gerald's attention. When we finally did he responded, I am helping these other people first because they were here first. Um, Gerald, no they were not. Our friend was waiting for you to grace us with your attention long before they walked in. And the entire time we were there you actedas if we were some sort of nuisance. I am not sure why he did not want a small, quiet group of young professionals spending money at his bar. But don't worry, Gerald, we never will again. I was visiting from out of town and found Florio in Yelp. The place perfect for what we were looking for. Great food. We ordered the pork belly, which could have had a little more flavor, and burrata which was great. The main course consisted of the meatball, amazing and filling, and the seafood squid pasta dish, which was the best in the menu I thought. I highly recommend this place for ambiance and good food. Spaghetti with meatballs made from veal, pork and ricotta was delicious. The little gem house salad was also wonderful, but maybe a little pricey for the portion. Ambience is very cozy. All in all, a delightful experience. Fantastic dinner. I had the sweet corn soup with dungeness crab and they were right about the juicy & flavorful roasted chicken. It came with some great greens and delicious mushrooms cooked just right. Great energy and very close to our church at St Doms. I hadn't been to Florio in  years since I had lunch with a friend and before that, a send off dinner for my then boyfriend before he moved to DC. It was one of our favorite restaurants among many; given that fact, it was time for a return visit. (And on my birthday no less expectations were running high). I started with the Barbary Coast cocktail (spiced rum, angostura bitters & lime) and it was refreshing and delicious. But then came the potato leek soup. Topped with creme fraiche with a taste of lemon, the consistency of the soup was far too thick. I think it was a combination of sitting too long and having far too much starch in the soup. It was gluey;  I was starting to worry. Luckily, the fresh corn and mascarpone ravioli were outstanding and restored my faith:  Five or six little saucers of savory goodness with a dramatic plated presentation of two post modern smears of fresh beet juice. The aftertaste of the pasta wrapper, though, was a bit chalky; it just missed pure perfection. I still would've licked my plate if it were socially acceptable. The service, though the service was perfect. Every staff member worked with each other in perfect harmony. I never had to wait nor feel hovered over. They are true professionals. I wasn't charged for the disappointing soup and I appreciate not having to ask. My experience was good, especially the service. I'd want to return soon to see if I hit it on a slightly off night. Sweet spot in an outstanding dining corridor of the Fillmore Strip. WOW, my new favorite restaurant. Service was superior, food was innovative and bursting with flavor. I had white corn and mascarpone ravioli with blackberry coulis creme fraiche and fresh sage. So great. Then the desserts were out of this world. Butterscotch pot de creme and blackberry cheesecake. I can't wait to go back! Florio feels like French brasserie that's comfortable and inviting when you walk in.  It's got a great mahogany bar, classic dark wood accents and an open kitchen. We started off by sharing a bowl of the potato leek soup which was warm and delicious. Ever tried fiddlehead fern? They remind me of a cross between a green bean and an asparagus; and when they're sautéed in lemon, red chili and olive oil, they're delicious! Next up:  Mussels.  They were cooked with shallots, capers, spring onion, garlic and preserved Meyer lemon.  The sauce wasn't to be wasted; that's when the crusty French bread came in handy!Overall the food was very good, but the service (non engaging/grumpy waiter) and the general attention to detail were a bit lacking.  Would we go back?  ~ If they improved the service, probably.  I came here on a weeknight for date night. We got a half carafe of the rose du jour, which hit the sweet spot for our budget and taste for the night. I had the beef and veal meatballs & spaghetti and he had the seafood stew. The meatballs were great! Good blend of the two types of meat and tasty, not breaking the bank. Seafood stew was a bit watery for a ""stew"", but tasted fine. I'd probably try something else next time. The service is great and it's a cute cozy Italian place on Fillmore surrounded by cute shops and bars to do things before or after. Only problem is that it's tough to choose between all the restaurants! Head here on a Sunday evening and sit at the bar.  Order whatever is on the wine tap and get the special  spaghetti and meatballs (Sundays only).  Butter lettuce salad has a dressing I can't figure out, but want to. $ for a tiny, dry and salty piece of halibut.  Service was mediocre.  A total disappointment. My very first time dining at Florio a couple of weeks ago. . . I should have written the review the day after, because now I can't remember the names of the dishes or the name of our friendly server. But I was so happy when he suggested this place. I've walked by this place countless times and it has been on my long list of restaurants I want to try in the city.  So naturally I was excited to check this place out. I immediately fell in love with this place the second we walked in. I just love the dark wood through out, white linen tables with candles. . . the overall vintage romantic decor. I didn't even have to taste anything, especially when he told me that he's seen Robin Williams dine here. . . I had no doubts that the food would have to match the intimate ambiance. . . and it did. We started off with a glass of champagne. And as I vented and poured out the tension in my head and then received excellent advice, I soon became extremely hungry. He ordered the olives, which is one of the few things I never eat. And I had warm seasoned almonds which were surprisingly yummy & addicting. He ordered a bottle of   Cabernet Sauvignon (ugh, I can't remember the name. . . But I think it was local. . . Napa or Sonoma). . . which paired well with the steak I had. He ordered the chicken. Both were delicious. Customer service was excellent. I look forward to coming back. Almost like stepping into a cafe in Europe. Loved the dark romantic atmosphere. Had the air chilled chicken entree dish, um Fabulous! So much flavor! Tried the pecan tart for dessert: made me want to melt into my chair it was do good. Was surprised by my boyfriend for dinner here for Valentines Day :) I was a happy camper I came here for dinner with my sister and dad before a show at the Fillmore on a Friday night.  We were the first to be sat since we got there right when they opened at : p. m.  Our waiter was very helpful and let us know all of the best options on the menu.  Our cocktails were delicious and my dad and I both had their specialty one that involved bourbon, ginger and an orange liqueur. For an appetizer we got the speck, herb almonds and chicken pate.  The speck and almonds were very tasty but the chicken pate was left practically uneaten.  For main course, I did a half and half of rib ragu and fennel & lamb sausage which was great that the waiter told me I could do since I was having a hard time deciding.  I enjoyed both but probably favored the fennel & lamb. My sister had the potato gnocchi which was tasty.  For dessert we ordered the pistachio gelato and pecan tart but they messed up and gave us an apple crisp instead of the pecan tart which was a bit disappointing.  The pistachio gelato was overwhelming and way too much pistachio. Overall, we enjoyed everything except the chicken pate and the gelato but had a great dinner over good food, cocktails and wine with just a short walk to the Fillmore! Went here for dinner last night on a date first timer! We got the burrata which was amazing and then the beet salad which was also good. . . big chunks of mozzerella cheese . . . . for entree we got the steak frites but I must say the meat was chewy =( and we also got the pasta with lamb I beleive it was. . . I left full and I'd go again but would be leary of the meat. . . . probably should have said somethiing but we didnt. Service was awesome! Very attentive and just the right amount. The french fries were the only good thing that was served.  I was thoroughly disappointed.  The trout special was really fishy, salty and dry.  The kale caesar was saturated in dressing with big chunks of fish (not in a good way). To Whom Is Reading,This was for  Wayne Cheng, pm, table for , Feb th, This is my very first Yelp review I have ever done because I felt there has been no need for me to do any; but in this specific case I feel the need to. I was a huge fan of Florio, but the recent visit has completely shattered the view I had on the restaurant. I reserved a table in case there was going to be a wait & all was well upon the our arrival. We sat looked over the menu/ wine listing & this is where the slight problems started, the waitress (older women around her mid 's long brown hair in a braided ponytail, average build if you waitress is this woman please request to be served by someone else) she was very vague with her descriptions on some of the wine & asked if we needed some more time which I was fine with. A few minutes come by & she actually more irritated looking when starting to talk to us & I didn't like the fact she was leaning on the chairs talking to us which I thought was rude. She gave us a few more minutes after asking about the main course she was more rushing us in the process which didn't make sense when the place is open till am. The waitress's look on her face was unpleasant the entire time when she came back    & was rushing us more with her body posture & look in her eyes. If your stressed at work for some reason then you be professional still & refrain from unpleasantly expressions. Food was ordered & wasn't offered any extras the come with the eating there, so I had to ask the man who is charge of the front of the house for it & he seemed displeased as well when it's such a minor thing on his behalf. I told my guest I was sorry  times for the behavior we're experiencing from the place because I talked nothing, but the utmost of the restaurant. My guest said ""Well it's the fact we're here & hopefully the food is better than the service. ""The main course came. I ordered the Scallops & my guest ordered a seafood soup. Of course the presentation was flawless, but when I started to eat my scallops I noticed a grittiness to the texture & I pulled out bits of sand from my mouth; this was the same problem with the rest of my dish. My course was washed thoroughly, but I never said anything to the waitress or the head of the front house. I was telling my guest how completely shattered my view now was & was telling him making sure the waitress heard me because she next to u with a partition separating; hoped that she would change her tone, but nothing improved whatsoever. She asked us only once ""How is everything?"" She never came back to refill water, we've both said ""Thank you,"" but was ignored. Never offered dessert menu, but we weren't going to stay after the annoyances going on. The thing that really pissed me off the most is that WE had a SERVICE CHARGE for ONLY  PEOPLE. I'm originally from Sonoma County's Wine Country, but the service where I'm from is absolute. I moved to SF  months ago, but since I have been here I have never experienced such crass service in my life. I told my guest we should have gone to Original Joe's because they are prim & proper there & the owner is very personable. Do not waste your time coming to Florio, unless you actually want to I hope your experience will be better than our's. I love coming here as a cozy date spot with a friend or a partner. The service is GREAT, I love the host, and the atmo is quiet yet makes you feel like you are really out on the town simultaneously. It's charming and the food is yummy and rich. Also, great cocktails! Tonight we had the pate (with enough leftover to take home!), the endive salad, and the orchichiette. I wouldn't get the salad again. . . it was a bit bland, but everything else was perfect. The wait was too long at all the other restaurants in the vicinity. That should have been a clue! I was punished for ordering a $ hamburger by the cook burning the bun until it was black!  She did tell me the meat would be black (I was ok with that)but not the bun. The waitress was very rarely around ,I think we saw her twice, once to take the order and once to give us the check( BAD SERVICE). The food was very mediocre, skinny little fries, watery soup and horrid cheesecake. If you have a choice keep walking up the street to ROAM. A great new burger place with great organic sides. And half the price! Oh, and do not bring your own wine to ""Floporio"" their corkage fee is $! Big waste of time and money! Too bad, we were celebrating an important occasion. Woodhouse across the street had an hour wait so I went here with a group of . First of all seating is limited so if you have a larger party be warned. We were celebrating and had brought a bottle of champagne and had to pay the corkage free of $ which seemed a little steep especially since all she did was open the bottle. We had to ask to have it put on ice and had to pour it for ourselves. The service was definitely below average and for the price its not worth it.  Out of the  of us only  of us liked our meal. The fries were WAY over salted and I love salt. The steak was undercooked and the seafood stew was just bland and the portion was small. The scallops were really good and the only thing I would recommend. With so many options in the neighbor I'm surprised this place does so well. Go to Fresca or Woodhouse instead. This was not my first choice for dinner since it only have .  stars on yelp, but I decided to give it a chance anyway.  Unfortunately, I will have to say .  stars is generous.  The service was mediocre at best.  Our server was very pleasant but also very slow.  We waited  min after we said we needed ""just another minute"" to decide on entrees.  The other server in our area bumped into my chair and proceeded to push the table out of her way and told us OUR table was in HER way.  She then proceeded to spill ketchup all over the table next to us including the guy's shoes.  She did not even apologize or seem sorry. In regards to the food, my steak was rubbery and the fries were cold.  They were also out of three items on the menu  one of which was my appetizer (balsamic broccoli and artichokes).  They served it without the artichokes.  Less than amazing is an understatement. Had a great Bellini here cant wait to come back and try the food outstanding meal every time. . . service staff friendly. . .  a neighborhood gem. . . great tasting menu that changes with the season. . . Totally agree with the other posters here about the uneven service, unfortunately we seem to have experienced the lowest part of the scale on our recent visit. I know it was late, but really,  the place was hardly empty.  Not like we were impinging on your ability to get out of there on time.   Yes, we know the kitchen was closed.   But was rolling your eyes when we asked for some nuts (that had just been served to the person next to us, btw) really necessary?     And then no attention paid to empty glass?  For the whole time we sat there?   Disappointing, because we live nearby and it's so convenient and looks great  a perfect cozy, intimate bistro, as some lucky posters have noted,  but unfortunately  our actual experience was the exact opposite. Hust not interested in dealing with passive aggressive angry service at the end of  a long day   ugh, we'll go elsewhere."|3|94|2|Routine Inspection| Wiping cloths not clean or properly stored or inadequate sanitizer  [ date violation corrected: 4/9/2014 ] Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities  [ date violation corrected: 4/9/2014 ]
Florio Bar & Cafe 1|3.5|French in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|241|1|3.91666666667| Popped into Florio on a whim, after lucking out at the movies and not being in the mood for Harry's Bar. It was pouring cats and dogs out, and the mood at Florio was inviting. The man and I nestled up at the bar and were promptly handed some drink menus by the bartender.  We had coats, scarfs, umbrellas, sweaters and the bartender was kind enough to point out the hangers and umbrella buckets by the door; nice touch. My litmus test for any bartender is their ability to craft a Manhattan, and this one did not disappoint. We tried the swordfish and the asparagus soup, both of which were perfect. In all honestly, who can put a price tag on ambiance. Good wine, fun cocktails, perfect sized dishes and lovely company what more could a girl ask for? I've eaten here twice now. The maitre d' is one of the nicest guys I've ever encountered and will make the entire experience enjoyable. The rest of the staff is also just the best and will go out of their way to make sure you have a great meal. Now. . . The Food. . . . Chicken, for the love of god. Order the chicken it's incredible. The vegetables are seasonal so be cognizant of that when you go. I've been in the spring and the fall and gotta say I'm a sucker for root vegetables so I enjoyed it more in the fall. Butter lettuce salad, bread, chicken for , and a half carafe of wine. It's a perfect meal and a great time. They are always full but never a line out the door, enough back ground noise to break the silence, great low light, very cozy feeling. I'd suggest making a reservation but sitting at the bar and having a glass of wine isn't a bad way to wait. All in all just go, you'll enjoy yourself. Fantastic spaghetti and meatballs and an awesome bowl of pistacio ice cream. Solid : food is consistently fresh and well executed across categories, they honor their reservations, the service is prompt and professional, and we haven't had any unpleasant surprises. Solid winners: salade lyonnaise, roast chicken, steak frites, pasta.  The produce can change significantly from month to month, but these anchors are safe bets, and whatever the changing cast of fruit/veggies might be, it is always high quality. I believe they also use Acme bread, which is a plus in my book. They say a good impression begins with your server. He was not too sure of the entrees or the wines. Needless to say the wine he offered was horrible and my entree was blah. Was not Attentive nor de he anticipate the needs of our table. Sat with only  glass of wine. He never came and asked of we wanted another or something different. What  could have been a good experience made worse by the lack of service. If there is a next time I'll request a server that know his stuff   Have had better service at Denny's Nice, dark, romantic with a little retro glamorous feel. Sat at the bar and had a nice meal and lovely cocktails with St. Germain! Friendly staff. . . Solid food. . . Good wine. . . Date Spot? Hell yea!Expensive? Sure. Taking someone out is not the time to be cheap, so man up and hit Florio Still a great place. I get to come here only once a year or so, but the top notch staff remembers me and treats me like a regular.  Their special cocktail of prosecco, gin, and fresh lemon juice is a refreshing summertime treat.  The chicken (I've had it twice) is always better than jus' plain ol' roasted chicken should be.  Juicy and flavorful and this time served with fancy French carrots and schmantzy peas.  The best news is that the special dessert that I had last summer seems to have worked its way onto the regular menu.  Pot de creme flavored with vanilla, orange, and bergamot, the stuff that makes Earl Grey tea so delicious.  Yes, it's a small portion but I'm pretty sick of heavy supersized desserts when all I want is a little something sweet.  And anyway, this little Tiny Tim of a dessert is so flavorful, cool, and subtle that it wins out over any goliath molten lava cake.  Florio is a friendly, bustling little place, a little expensive, but a great experience for those who love great bistro food and charming, interesting waitstaff. Food was okay, not necessarily outstanding but very good and reasonably priced for the ambiance/service/quality. My girlfriend really likes this place.  I took her to dinner there, and ordered the Seafood stew (a combination of mussels, clams, shrimp, & cod).  My girlfriend had the pan roasted chicken with frilly red mustard greens, brussel sprouts, and a side salad.  For starters, I had the foie gras au torchon, local brooks cherry preserves, house made brioche.  It was quite good, though the brioche was a little too soft and would fall apart when trying to spread the foie gras. I was very disappointed in the seafood stew which was pretty much bland, served in a shallow dish with an over abundance of celery, onions, garlic slices, to make up for the limited seafood.  They really need to work on this dish, as the broth is watery, lacks substance, & flavor.   The pan roasted chicken however was very flavorful and cooked to perfection.  The bread was very good as well and I ended up eating to much to make up for the meager seafood stew.  The service was very good, and I enjoyed the classy old school ambiance. For the money, you can do much better. If it will make my girlfriend happy, I will gladly take her there again, but otherwise I'll pass on this one. Oh my. Florio is a glutton's heaven. After an appetizer that I can't for the life of me remember and more amazing bread than we ever should have had, my group of four each ordered individual salads  two little gem and two lyonnaise. My little gem had a worm in it, so the waitress was kind enough to bring me a new one, but both of the salads were mouthwateringly good. Seriously. The portions were also huge, so I would recommend splitting a salad if you've got dinner coming. We then split the whole chicken and the  ounce ribeye. Between four people. It was enough food for eight, and you better believe that we ate until our pants were bursting. I have perhaps never had such good chicken and steak. The chicken was perfectly seasoned, with just the right amount of crisp on the outside and juiciness on the inside. The ribeye was incredibly high quality, tender meat, just cooked enough to not be blue on the inside and oh, oh so delicious. On the side? Brussel sprouts that had been just a little browned on the outside and unbelievable duck fat fries. Top it off with two bottles of wine per the waitress's excellent suggestion, and I was in Seventh Heaven. I think someone ordered dessert, but I was way too stuffed to be paying attention at that point. Florio is definitely at the top of my list for the next time I'm back in the Bay, and would make for a great date (or double date) night. We all were in the mood for burgers and since they were highly recommended, that's what we all had.  Surprisingly good for an Italian restaurant!  Very nice atmosphere, service a little slow but it was very busy.  Seemed a little pricey but not too bad. . . .|3|98|1|Routine| Food safety certificate or food handler card not available  [ date violation corrected: 3/6/2014 ]
Florio Bar & Cafe 2|3.5|French in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|241|2|3.5|" Comfort food that delights in a warm atmosphere.  Stunning staff.   Don't think I've ever seen meatballs that big before  and they rock. My only critique: it could use an obscure ale (French Farmhouse or Belgian) on tap.  Oh, and if you want some excitement ask the chef about the giant Hawaiian clam. I love the food at this place, decor is a little old school. My favorite is the steak frites (much better than Des Amis, Wayfare Tavern, etc).  It's always cooked perfectly, juicy and tender.  I've also had the burger and different pastas, all very good.  The apple tart for dessert is very delicious. . . freshly baked.  The crust was buttery and flaky and the apples were perfect, not too sweet.  Gelato is really great too.  It's homemade.  Very smooth and creamy.  All in all, food is a solid   stars. Every time I'm here, service is not the greatest.  The waiter never check on us.  During the entree, I finished my drink halfway through my meal and ran out of ketchup for my fries.  It would have been nice if he would have checked in at least one time to make sure everything was ok.  Waited about  minutes for dessert (we almost cancelled it and left), during this time, I finished my coffee.  The person quickly dropped off the dessert and I had to chase then down to get a coffee re fill.  Service gets a  stars. Food here is great but they need to work on the service.  But, I'll still go back because I seriously crave a bunch of items on their menu all the time. Nice cafe. Good food. Gave it a try while enjoying the Filmore Jazz Festival. The food was wonderful!  I had the steak frites and they were to die for.  My date had the chicken and it was wonderfully cooked.  The service was a bit gruff, but I'm definitely going back.  Nice room, too. For the pricing I was expecting better everything. Service: We stood around waiting for someone to help us, when finally we just seated ourselves. (even though they had a host)Our server wasn't on top of things, not because he was bad, but because they over booked him. He was the only server in the place! Since he was the only server in a over  table place our food was forgotten about! It took us  min. to get our food! After we Finally received our main dish, and it was so bland I didn't even finish it. We waved down the host for desert. (our server was running around with his head cut off and didn't notice we wanted desert) Our desert was creme brulee , and it shouldn't have been served. one side was ice cold and the other was lukewarm. consistency was watery. Yuck! The only thing that I liked about this place was the salad, and the wine. But I won't be going back! I like the dark interior.  Old school ish.  Across the street from awesome frozen yogurt.  Good Classic Italian food. A bit expensive but fancy fillmore. Classic spot. Elegant Brasserie with an exceptional bar and service. Perfect spot for Sunday night dinner. Great range of menu selections, light, full on, or even Le' Burger. . . Excellent fare, prepared and served properly! I was excited to try Florio after viewing the menu on their website.  S and I were going to see a film at : that our friend's daughter co wrote and starred in called ""I Think It's Raining"", a couple of blocks away.  That necessitated something very close by and a res. for : at the latest, : would have been even better.  Florio opens for dinner at :.  We walked by at : and there were a bunch of sitting at the bar, so we walked in only to be stopped by the charming host saying they weren't quite open.  All the people were actually the wait staff doing a nightly tasting. . always a good sign.  The yelp rap on them seems to be that they have very small portions for the price.  I actually thought that would be good, because I could try out more plates without getting overly full.  Time constraints kept us to only three items each though, and I appreciate how mindful our waiter was of our schedule, getting us out exactly when we asked :.  S and I always try to negotiate our picks so that we get different things and can taste each other's maximizing the variety. Tonight, however we both definitely wanted the sweetbreads.  On line there were two sizes offered, but in actuality there was only the small.  Dang!  Because I could certainly have eaten a bigger portion of those perfectly crisp on the outside creamy on the inside thymus glands with earthy and delicious chanterelles (didn't see any of the promised shallots, though).  And we both gravitated towards the Russian Kale  S in the form of soup with potatoes in a very light cream base with the perfect kick of garlic.  Me with the sauteed Russian kale, accompanied with roasted shallots that had a great balance of lemon and just the right offset of salt.  We both ended with the salted caramel pot de creme.  In retrospect, I probably should have passed.  It was good, not great.  I liked the flavor, though it was a bit one dimensional, but the texture was a bit off, not silky enough.  I like to reserve the consumption of that many calories for only the exceptional. We each had a glass of whatever the featured sauvignon blanc was and the total was $ and some change including tax and healthy San Francisco, but sans tip. Rating:Food:  /Service: /Atmos/ intangibles:  /Value:  /Total:   (a good solid B) Florio's is a great little Italian French California style cafe & bar, nestled quietly on Fillmore street, just a few blocks away from Japantown. I was intimidated by the look of this restaurant at first, because it's I'm ambivalent about Florio. On the one hand, it's an elegant classic, French brasserie that feels comfortable and inviting. On the other, service and the general attention to detail seems to be casual and a bit hit or miss. I recently met a friend for dinner at Florio. I arrived a little bit early  decided to sit at the bar and get a drink. Alas, there was no room at the bar, there didnt appear to be any space to just stand around, and no server paid any attention to me  I ended up going to the Grove for a beer. My friend & I finally connected & made it to the restaurant. We were greeted by a friendly attendant and offered our choice of the available tables (a nice touch!) However, then things went downhill a bit  our server for the evening seemed distracted and seemed overly focused on a private party in another room. We had a lot of difficulty tracking him down throughout the evening. Eventually, we got out orders to another servers (a couple of Steak Frites orders  well done!)  We had to fight off a few attempts at up sell of their different available appetizers, but at least we managed to get our food (and drinks) orders in. Sure enough, the steak was amazing  cooked to perfection, tasty fries, plentiful portions. Worth the ordering effort (and the not cheap price. )Worth it for the food, and for the elegant ambiance, but in truth, Florio could do much better. A local favorite, reliable stand by, and home of a delicious sidecar! The Skinny:if you answer yes to:Do you like chi chi places with interesting dishes?Are you willing to pay xs tapas prices for / / tapas sized plates?Are you ok with paying $ for   leafs of lettuce?Do you Put atmosphere above all else?Then this place might be for you. Dishes sound nice, food was tasty but we dropped $ for  people and if we didn't get the frites I would've still been hungry. However, some people enjoy the set up here and it is the Fillmore area so. . . we wanted to do a nice thank you dinner for someone, but next time I might insist on the Taiwanese place on Clement!Note: service is top notch  definitely a strong point I have never been so angry about a dinner in my life, since it costs  dollars and the service/food preparation was poor!  Ordered the Ribeye for , a  dollar piece of meat, and it came out very overdone, with no attention or empathy from the waiter.   This is after a  minute discussion on steak temperature while we were ordering. I wanted to make sure it was going to be red in the center. He said ""don't worry, I understand, that is how we do it"". The lady who was bringing out the food was confused, and turned back, then came back with it. it probably was the wrong order. I understand mistakes happen, but the waiter didn't serve the meat, and he certainly did not come by to ask if everything was alright, we could not get his attention. By the time we got the meal, we were so hungry we ate half of it, then we got the rest to go.  This was the first time I saw the waiter since we ordered. I showed him it was practically well done. Barely any pink anywhere. He shrugged it off, and we got the rest to go.  The next day, not only did my husband see he was overcharged on the bill on his bank statement, but when we went to eat the leftovers, the little fries that come with the steak were not even in there!  That was the best part of the meal, and we were saving them for later. Additionally, the guy who looked like the manager was just hanging out by the bar, looking aloof. He went to hang up a patron's jacket, but it was over another patron's shoulder while he was eating, and he kept asking ""Does this bother you? Does this bother you?"" Plus some guys standing by the bar were talking about getting hookers. The other customer looked really annoyed.  We tried to get into SPQR and Fresca, both hour waits.  We were not trying to spend so much money, but hoping it was exceptional at least. This place doesn't seem to care about people spending hard earned money!  You don't buy a  dollar piece of meat every day. The last time we did that was in Florence in .   years! They just don't care. We will never go back! Walking into Florio one of those places I've been wanting to hit for some time now, but never got around to it, I instantly liked the early th century feel of the aesthetics, all dark wood and white table cloths.  The service was good, our waiter informed and personable without being intrusive.   I was surprised, and a bit dismayed, to find the menu so lackluster, but the food was quite nice so all's well that ends well.  Our table split between the roast chicken and ribeye, both of which indicate some frustration with the lack of choices, but at least it wasn't pizza and burgers which is happening all too often these days as restaurants are desperately going for filling the tables over thinking over their offerings, and I would have walked if we'd been offered Mac n cheese. The chicken seemed brined (I have no problem with that) as the herbs infused the meat with a delicate flavor it wouldn't have had if they had simply been rubbed in.   Beyond that, it was nothing I couldn't do at home, and the ribeye was about the same.   I had a delightful chicken liver pate, and finished my meal with a tawny port and the cheese plate. I would come here again, and as much as I liked sitting down to dinner, it seems that it might be more fun to sit at the bar and eat appetizers instead. Bathrooms are M and F, which puzzles me in San Francisco as women were always waiting for a sister to finish, when the single facility mens room had a lock and was just as available.  Some women would take the invite and skip the wait, others refused, so why doesn't the restaurant do the ladies a favor and make the toilets gender neutral? Nine of my friends and I arrived at : for a th birthday dinner on a Sat. night.  The restaurant was still pretty full  which isn't surprising since it's not a very big place.   Everything was perfect.  The staff was looking out for us, constantly filling our water glasses as we ordered more cocktails from the bar.   The menu is simple but has variety and the quality was excellent.  The best part is the price.  It is NOT over priced and very reasonable especially because the quality is so high.  Looking for a reason to go back. Let's see. . . . where do I start? We walked to Woodhouse Fish Co. , but there was a  minute wait, so then we went across the street to SPQR and it was a  hour wait, so we walked into Florio and there was no wait. . . and now I understand why.  Let's start with the rude host that finally acknowledged us after  minutes of standing there. I told him I felt invisible and he came unglued, snipping at me with a snide, rude tone. So, we sat, only because we were to tired to try to find another place that wasn't packed. Service sucked and the food sucked even more.  ordered Cioppino and Mike had their Pasta Alfredo with pea's and pancetta.  Both dishes were bland, tasteless and boring. I poured parmesan on mine and piled salt and pepper on it, and still was barely edible.  I would never go back, and can't understand how that place is in business. I so wanted to like this place!  It is right down the street from my apartment and has a great look about it, but it just misses the mark.  First we had dinner there and while my spaghetti and meatballs special was very good, my husbands pasta dish was only okay and was a served in a laughably small portion.  We also shared two appetizers, the salmon crudo and the marrow bone, both which were really flavorless compared to every other place we have had those dishes.  To top it all off our waiter was stiff, unfriendly and snotty.  Because we really wanted to like Florio, we went back last week just for drinks.  They had a very interesting drink menu so it seemed like a good idea.  It wasn't.  Unfortunately the bartender didn't seem to know how to make the drinks.  My husband ordered the oldest of all cocktails, a sazerac, which they have on their menu.  She made it completely including shaking it over ice and then straining it into a martini glass (it should be served up in a rocks glass) and then noticed it looked way too pink. So she poured it back into the shaker and then added bourbon.  My husband gagged it down and didn't say anything about how it is supposed to be rye and not bourbon in a sazerac or that she had the proportions of all other ingredients wrong.  But we did notice that several other drinks were sent back and the manager finally came over to tell her how to make one drink, which again is on the menu. After much debate, we chose Florio as the place to splurge for a special occasion.  We had a lovely experience there.  Our server was friendly and polite, the ambiance was sort of rustic and lounge y at the same time, and everything was tasty.  Here's a rundown of what we ordered: ""The New Fillmore""  a cocktail made of bourbon with orange peel  my husband loved it; ""Bisou""  a cocktail made of your choice of gin or vodka, with cucumber, ginger and mint  I liked it; A carafe of a cabernet/syrah blend  it was okay, got better as it opened up; although it wasn't the best wine ever, it was really nice to be able to buy a carafe, which was about  glasses, for the price of  glasses; A ""blistered"" pepper and squash appetizer, and a beet/fig salad  both of these were good.  The portions are a bit small, but the presentation was lovely and the combination of ingredients was great. Goat cheese ravioli with sage, and the ""poulet roti""  both of these were good, too.  They were not wildly creative, but they were very tasty.  The ravioli was a medium sized portion; the chicken was a substantial portion. And finally  the creme caramel (really a flan, not a creme brulee) and a scoop of chocolate espresso (it was gelato or sorbetto, I can't recall which).  Yummy. Thumbs up! This is a cute place to stop late night if you are on Fillmore.  it is a warm atmosphere, and low key. Walked in for a quick bite on a recent Friday not knowing anything about Florio and my fiancé and I left very impressed with the food, but the service as well.  Summing it up in brief we asked to split a salad and swap out the dressing and they served up the salad as requested without hesitation.  Food runners also took care to expedite etc so we always felt well taken care of.  Bottom line, pleased and would return. I've been here twice for dinner and had two completely different experiences. The first time (a Wednesday dinner), I noticed the age demographic was older (+) and the service was stereotypically French (distant, rude). The second time (a Friday dinner), the age demographic was more mixed and the service was great.  The waiter's name the second time around was Jerry. Food quality was good. Impromptu girls night. . . and wanted to go to Woodhouse, but the wait was going to be over an hour. . . so we headed across the street to Florio.  I've walked by Florio so many times, but never tried it. . . I'm not sure why but I'm glad we tried it the other night. We had the steak frites. . . . ah yeah, splurge and get the damn steak frites!  It is DA BOMB!  The steak is so tender, juicy, and flavorful!  The frites are crispy and yummy!Add a glass of Malbec and end the night with a scoop of blackberry sorbet and you have a fabulous girls night dinner!! Cool vibe at the bar, though we went straight to the dinner table. I had a Sazerac cocktail, which was made very well. All the cocktails at our table were served up, which I thought was kind of funny. The food was really good. I think everyone was pleased, especially me. I got the pork chop, which was probably the thickest pork chop I've ever seen, and definitely among the best I've had. Also tried the rabbit gnocchi, which was quite good also, though not stellar. All in all, I would certainly go back. I will say that there seemed to be a significant markup on most items  i. e. this place ain't cheap at all. Maybe because it's nestled between a host of ritzy interior design stores? I don't live in Pac Heights but have passed by Florio many, many times in my forays to the area and yet never managed to stop in.  We happened to book a reservation last night for the first time and really enjoyed it.   out of  of us loved our entrees (the th is a bit fussy  so we considered his review more subjective than the rest of us).  AND we tried the sweetbreads as an appetizer  which was the first time my husband and I had done so  and were pleasantly surprised.  The service was very good  attentive without being too overbearing  and we loved the French Bistro atmosphere.  We will be back. My guy and I dined at Florio for  reasons: () It had the ambience of a Parisian cafe  This spells ROMANCE, no?! and () It was close to Japantown's Kabuki Theater. Like several of the other reviewers, my rating would be a .  star, which I have rounded down to  because of the price range. The service and Sonoma rosé were as pleasant as expected, and the crunchy pomme frites (as appetizer) was satisfying.  We had pork papardelle and the chicken for mains. Loved the pasta, but the chicken was under seasoned and a little dry. It doesn't come close to the wonderful fowl I had at Oakland's Wood Tavern. Pros: Good ambience, efficient service, portions were generousCons: There are just too many standouts in San Francisco for Florio to be a must try. My rating is .  but there is no way to give it so I round off to a  star. Living in Pacific Heights, it is difficult to miss this place or ignore its well earned popularity. Looking at the long line over weekends for brunch, try not to come too hungry as it  might take   minutes (like at a lot of places). The vibe is lively and it is a good place for a brunch for two or hanging out with friends. It can be a little pricey ( dollars sign) but is worth that  much fora good time and happy stomach. We were on our way to Dosa for dinner before a movie, when Florio's menu caught our eye. Felt like the guy would prefer this to Dosa. Very glad we decided to try Florio. Wild Alaskan King Salmon, Asparagus, Ramps & Farro, Beurre Blanc. . . . what a perfect dish. The duck was a special that evening and came with a boozy sauce that included fresh peaches a cherries. I wanted to pick up the plate and lick it after all the duck had disappeared. I had ordered it medium rare per our servers recommendation and it was a bit too rare for my tastes. Sent it back to be cooked to medium and it was perfect. The house pinot noir was a great pairing with this dish. We would definitely return to Florio I am going on record recommending the sweetbreads  Florio is as good a place as any to try a part of the animal you may not have tried before. I honestly don't eat sweetbreads enough to compare Florios offering to other places, but I remember very clearly putting a piece in my mouth and enjoying it immensely. That is all that is important. Also, the braised greens get my recommendation. You should be eating more vegetables anyway. Our server was quick and knew the menu and wine list well, but I felt a little rushed; maybe it was just me. Also, having the hosts station in the middle of the restaurant instead of by the door is a little odd, but it's a pretty minor thing. Its no reason not to go and enjoy sweetbreads. I'm teetering at a .  but will give this place a  because I enjoyed the bartender who acted as our server tonight. Food on the whole was tasty, especially liked the scrambled eggs with the prosciutto. Menu was a little on the pricey side but decent for a nice evening out. Didn't get a chance to try it but the fries also looked very yummy. Reco from the employee  try the steak frites, it's what they are known for. Ahi special and butternut raviolis were wonderful! Everything great. A very good unique twist on Italian along Filmore. This place does a good job of separating itself from the rest of the ""Italian"" market in the Bay Area. The girlfriend and I went to check out this place several weeks ago.  We had gotten our fill of the North Beach Italian scene and were looking for something different. This place delivered on that premise.  The food was Italian but different from the generic ""Italian"" that we, Americans, think of.  Yes, they served pasta, but it was a special twist on the same formula. The wine selection was good, and the waiter succeeded in fulfilling our requests when it came to a bottle recommendation.   The dining room is small, but not uncomfortable if you are used to the smaller bistro scene of the Bay Area or other places like NYC and Boston.  I didn't feel like I was sharing dinner/conversation with the random couples on either side of me. I loved this place so I am surprised they only have .  stars.  I was wowed by many things on the menu. Very surprised by how much I liked the radish app so surprising, who would think radishes would be a highlight.  Also a highlight the burger! m very good. And the mussels entree was divine. Coming back for another go again! TGIF takes on new meaning when the F stands for Florio!  It's been a long time, dependable favorite of mine and an easy magnet that draws friends and neighbors for 'happy hours,' sharing wonderful bistro fare (steak frites, roast chicken, pasta), or celebrating those special occasions.  Service is always accomodating and impeccable.  A memorable occasion they played a part in was a birthday celebration for a friend who was stunned with the presentation of a flaming birthday chicken Florio's succulent roast chicken in a casserole dish surrounded by mashed potatoes and birthday candles (symbolizing a pagan end to spring chicken hood). Another treat happens there on Sunday evenings (and some Mondays, too) when Florio features veal meatballs as a special.  Not to be missed!To sum it, Florio is that rare restaurant where management, staff and kitchen always seem well oiled and in synch for providing a pleasant dining experience! Not great. Super cute decor. Nice touches on water glass monogram.  Live paint job on facade. Lots of disappointment on many dishes. Great bathrooms. Really yummy and has a great Parisian/s club vibe. Really diverse menu and everything i've tried has been very delicious. Definitely a good go to place for a romantic dinner for two. Loved the food here.  We tried the seafood stew, chicken and the cod.  Really well seasoned. Portions were a tad small and somewhat pricey, but well worth it. Excellent service.  Would definitely recommend. We live in the neighborhood. Walk by the place often. Ate there years ago and found it missing. Tonight I decided to try again. Started well, friendly staff but the food is unexciting. Steak over charred. Salad dressed to much and to tart.  Fries are amazing. Very nice. Got charged .  for a glass of ice and diet coke and one refill.  About a total of  oz of coke.  Pretty silly and not endearing to the customer. . Over all average or below.  Not very bad and bot very good. Wine list is limited and not very well developed. Too bad. Great location.  Which is probably why they are still there. We had a great time in this little restaurant! We sat at the bar and the service was impeccable. The space is small and it was very busy all evening (Saturday night). The bread and butter was delicious! We enjoyed the wine and cocktails and next time we are in SF we will definitely be back! I went to florio on a Sunday night, I was pleased that I was able to call about an hour ahead to reserve a table for two with such short notice. The restaurant was full, two small tables were available and we were seated prompty. All great things. . . It took a good  mins or more for the waiter's first visit, we ordered drinks and received a couple of fresh warm rolls. Then menu was very interesting, we ordered a butter lettuce salad, winter squash, I had the steamed mussels and she had the seafood stew. All great dishes. We spent a lot of time waiting, when we asked for more bread we were told they were out of the rolls and we were given stale sliced bread. They can't seem to handle when the restaurant is full, and the staff had to ignore tables to keep things moving. Most of the staffed appeared lost and unprepared, the host even had to take orders and serve dishes, causing a bottleneck at the host podium. Try this place for the food at an off time, otherwise skip it. I finally came here after walking past it so many times and reading some of the glowing reviews. Our party all had the steak frites, which are supposedly their specialty. It was surprisingly salty, so much so that I had trouble finishing it. I'm not an expert and couldn't tell if it was meant to be that way, but it was a bit much for me. The meat was quite tough, not really what I expected. Maybe it was difficult for them to cook that cut of meat as medium. We had beer so I can't comment on the wine, but the place was very well put together. And by that I mean the servers appeared very professional (if a bit snooty with their stylish thick rimmed glasses) and the place was very elegant, if a bit noisy during peak hours. I'm glad I tried it but wouldn't recommend it as a must go kind of place for people in the city. I'd be willing to go back and try their other menu offerings but am not in any hurry. Reservations are a good idea as it gets busy. Street parking in the evening on weekends might require some hunting but is manageable. Walking up Fillmore afterward is fun as you can walk off that steak (yeah right), talk with your friends, and check out some of the stores. They were very accommodating for our reservation since one of our parties was running late. The space is very intimate yet somehow you still have your privacy. The waiter recommended a very yummy seafood dip (i don't remember what it's called. . . had too much wine) So I got the open face hamburger with the frites. It was perfect. I could've used a fancy aioli for the frites, instead we got good ol' fashioned heinz. My friend got the gemeli pasta with rabbit. All I can say is WOW. I stole a lot of his pasta. . . . . I will be conflicted when I go back. I do want to try new things (hangar steak) but that gemeli is so delicious that I might just order that again! (I think the gemeli is not on their regular menu, since I don't see it on their website. . . so i better go back soon!) If you enjoy FOOD POISONING, Florio is the place for you! Next time I want to vomit for  hours, I'll save myself the $ and go to Taco Bell. To top it off, our server was beyond rude. Ya, chubster with the glasses, I'm talking about you. Would it kill you to be pleasant? I had dinner at Florio a couple of weeks ago on a Friday night with my friend who is quite the foodie. We went to try their special truffle menu and it was amazing. Started with the carpaccio with truffles and what I believe was shaved Asiago cheese with Italian parsley amazing!Next we split the tagliatelle pasta with white truffles. . . the pasta was cooked to perfection and the truffles were wonderful. For our main entree, we split the Poulet Roti the chicken was wonderfully moist and the brussel sprouts complimented dish well. I would have preferred baby carrots to summer squash, but that's just a personal preference. Finally, for dessert we had the Tiramisu. I hadn't had Tiramisu in years, probably not since the days when I used to hang out at The Steps of Rome and so I was curious to try Florio's version. It did not disappoint. All in all, my friend and I had a wonderful time at Florio and we will be returning. After  years of dining in San Francisco, my recent visit to Florio by far is the worst dining experience that I have ever had.  The food is at best mediocre and the wait staff is terrible.  Especially the overweight bald waiter who is so inept and had no concept of customer service.  I will definitely never go there again ! I'm conflicted about Florio. I went here thinking it was an Italian restaurant, but was delightfully surprised to find it's both French and Italian. After perusing the menu, we decided on the bruschetta (pretty good) and grilled shrimp (so so) for appetizers. The bruschetta came with fresh tomato slices, yummy pesto sauce and some thinly sliced prosciutto. The shrimp was grilled and topped with basil leaves and served on skewers. While both dishes were good, I could make each one in my own kitchen and save about $. As for the main courses, we ordered the roasted chicken and bolognese. The chicken was the best dish. It was a big portion, cooked right and very flavorful. The bolognese, however. . . was basically macaroni with old pieces of meat in some tomato based sauce. The minute our waiter served it, I looked at it and knew I would feel like throwing up. After one bite, I grabbed my napkin and spit the food out. The meat really was old. . or tasted old. It was one of the worst past dishes I have ever been served at a restaurant. I'm even more disappointed because I was initially  excited about this place and couldn't wait to add it to my list of favorites. Sadly, that won't be happening. . Florio has potential, but I don't see myself coming back. The restaurant is pretentious, and the food and prices do not do it justice. I thought the staff was a bit pretentious. Granted I wasn't looking my finest that evening, but so minimal to non existent in term of greetings or service. Would someone please smile once? The food was ok. . . I had the hanger steak frites. Steak itself could have been a little rarer on my medium rare order. While the middle was nice and red, the outside (espeically the ends) got quite tough. I did love the fries though! My friend really didn't like her gnocchi with rabbit for some reason. I didn't try it myself though, so can't really judge accurately there. Our server Bradley rocks, the manager. . . not so much!My husband and I went for dinner last night celebrating our anniversary.  We ordered drinks, pate and the skirt steak.  The drinks and pate were good, but the   minute lull to get the steak was a bit disappointing especially since the back dining room was half empty. At that point we were in a hurry to meet friends and after asking the waiter how much longer, he could tell we were getting a little irritated.  We explained that at this point we needed to get going. The steak came out soon after but we actually needed to take them to go.  The waiter was very apologetic and felt bad and said he would see what he could do.  The wait I could get over, paying  to eat my food out of a card board box the next day, I could get over, but the worst part is that the manager must not have agreed that the wait was long and that we were unhappy and he had the waiter present us with the full bill.  He apologized profusely and said unfortunately there was nothing he could do.  He was embarrassed at this point. The manager put this on him and never came to our table to even check in but made the waiter deal with it.  I work in the restaurant business.  I wasn't looking for a free meal and had no problem paying however the fact that the manager put this on the waiter really bothered me and showed that he missed the class on hospitality.  He didn't care that we were dissatisfied.  Because of the manager, we won't be coming back but wish Bradley all the best. My search for great neighborhood Italian on Fillmore goes on. . . To be fair, the service at Florio was excellent and the meal started out great. We were all pleased with the appetizers but really, how can you mess up french fries, fried green beans and heirloom salad pretty basic SF fare. The entrees were a disappointment. The seafood stew was very bland and the  specialties (according to our server)  pasta bolognese and ravioli was equally meh. What I liked: seated immediately on a busy Thursday night, warm service and nice ambiance. Great ambience.  It definitely feels bistro like.  Very intimate and European.  A bit cramped, but cozy. OMG. . . the fries are so delicious!  They were crispy, warm, and flavorful.  Try those with the mussels.  The grilled veggies were so fresh and tasty.  I loved the smoky taste blended with the sweetness of the fresh veggies.  I couldn't believe how sweet the roasted beets were. So, that' all we had, but I'll be willing to try it again. We went to Florio on a busy Saturday night, and got one of the last open tables. We ended up getting the corn bisque and a steak  both of which were split for us by the waiter  who asked if that was ok, and I think we ended up getting extra frites with the steak as a result. The hangar steak was truly great  good flavor, well prepared and flavorful (and they nailed the ""medium"").  The corn bisque was not quite as flavorful as the corn soup at Nopa, but pretty good nonetheless.  We also had the Padron peppers (which were yummy) and the Bourgogne Rose. Overall, I would say that these guys did a fantastic job, especially for a crowded Saturday.  I don't often review, but I wanted to give these guys a solid for treating us so well. yum, yum, yum! Actually wanted to go to SPQR, but since there were no tables available there, we hopped into Florio instead as a spur of the moment late night dinner. Contrary to some of the other reviews, we were not greeted or seated immediately. We waited a bit awkwardly at the entrance in front of someone else's table before we were led to a table about   minutes later. It was a busy late Saturday night though. The main entrees on the menu were not particularly eye catching. The more interesting dishes seemed to be the specials like the burger and the fish of the day. Unfortunately, the sea bass was all sold out by the time we got there. We ended up ordering:~Batter Fried Asparagus: Almost anything fried tastes good to me, and this was no exception. Especially good with the garlic aioli. However, doesn't seem like something you couldn't get at a TGI Friday's for half the price. ~Moroccan spiced chicken and zucchini skewers: tasty and recommended! Didn't expect to see this one at an Italian restaurant. ~Ricotta Ravioli: Came with about five pieces of ravioli. Don't order this if you're trying to fill a hungry stomach!~Polenta Gnocchi: I think this one had four silver dollar sized pieces of gnocchi, which was different than the usual ball sized gnocchi I was expecting. This was definitely a quality over quantity dish. ~Lumachine: The only decent sized portion out of the three entrees we ordered. Quite tasty, but presentation was average. Reminded me of something you could get at a Pasta Pomodoro. A not good, not bad restaurant, but nothing to rave about. It's a safe bet though if you're craving Italian pastas or a burger. I came to Florio with a small group of colleagues and friends for dinner.  The food and drinks were delicious, the atmosphere a sexy French/Italian mix, but what really impressed me was the service.  The Maître d' greeted us immediately and I didn't even have to tell him the name of our party he guessed it!  We were invited to wait at the bar for the rest of our group (we were pretty early). I chose this opportunity to sample one of their house cocktails, the ""Italian"" .  It's made with Bombay Sapphire, Prosecco (il mio buon amico), fresh lemon juice and an orange garnish, served up.  It was delicious and refreshing and no, it didn't really taste any different from a French . For my first course I had a fantastic roasted beet salad with big chunks of fresh beet, creamy goat cheese, almonds and watercress.  It was very popular at our table and is a must order.  (Tip: don't be alarmed if you see anything pink come out later.  In the bathroom.  TMI, I know.  Sorry. )For my second course I was in the mood for something light and chose the lumachine, which is a shell shaped pasta.  It was mixed with fresh asparagus, a spicy house made sausage, garlic and pecorino cheese and I couldn't help but hoover it, it was so good. Alas, I was too stuffed for dessert, but they had a number of tasty options.  This is a great spot for a date or a small group and they have a private seating area that you might want to inquire about.  It's sure to impress (and hey: they even have a fancy lookin' burger if you have picky eaters with you). This place was fine but I wouldn't rush back.  I liked the atmosphere, and our waitress was very nice.  My mussels were delicious, but the gravlax starter had far too much cream sauce on it.  The boyfriend liked his clams but wasn't overwhelmed by the pate.  The cocktails were very strong.  The main problem with our evening was the acoustics.  We were seated right next to (as in, five inches from) a pair of *extremely* loud women discussing their divorces and sex life in great detail.  The restaurant was nowhere near busy enough to justify seating us so close to someone else, let alone to obnoxiously loud people.  (To be fair to the restaurant, we probably should have asked to be reseated, but we kept thinking they were about to leave. )  On the whole I was a little underwhelmed. We've gone here a number of times with friends and family, and have always had a good experience. The food is not overly French or Italian, and admittedly is on the basic side, but I've always found it to be delicious and unpretentious. I like that they offer half carafes of good wine for a reasonable price (usually about  or  glasses for $  try the Malbec!). It can get loud and is typically frequented by a slightly older crowd, but that's kind of what you'd expect from a small restaurant in Pacific Heights, isn't it? Give it a shot. And if you have a group of  or  definitely ask to be seated in the room behind the curtain. :) I have been here multiple times and think it is a great place. Good bar, good food, nice atmosphere. It is a well run shop! Have had the burger, the lumachine, cheese board, swordfish and halibut. They do a great job with the fish  appetizers were very good, good, good drinks as well. A couple times we have come with friends and they have given us the small, private room which is a kick. As others have noted dining at the bar is a good experience too. Snore. This place is a bore. The people who worked there were nice and polite and they made a good sidecar. The food was OK. My friend ordered a hamburger, well done. It was still pink in the middle. It came on one piece of toast, garnished with pickled veggies. The pickles were nasty. I love pickles. Not these. It had a salad. No fries. My friend cried. A little. I ordered the gnocchi. I don't know where they went because all I saw on my plate was three pieces of polenta in a nice sauce. The fried asparagus was . . . use your imagination because they clearly didn't. I've been going to Florio for years.  On occasion I've sat at a table, but really, i like to sit at the bar and watch the action.  I can't comment too much on the menu because I pretty much always order one of two things. . . either the steak frites when there are two of us or a burger.  The new open faced burger with melted cheese and grilled onions on focaccia, served with french fries (on which I consider myself an afficionado) is awesome.  And when you order ""medium,"" medium is what you get. While attending the San Francisco International Film Festival, between seeing Father of My Children at the Clay and Wake Up In Fright at the Kabuki, I stopped to grab a bite.  Since I have a broken shoulder, which means I can't drive and don't have the patience to stand around waiting for buses (or taxis for that matter) I walk from Pac Heights to my abode in the Haight.  My friend Donna thinks I'm a target for muggers, so begged me not to carry a purse.  I couldn't not take a purse  there are certain things that I must have  but I could at least divest myself of heavy items, the biggest of which is my wallet.  So, I was traveling light, no wallet with choice of credit cards; only one card and no cash. . . kinda' crazy, I know. I enjoyed my burger with a glass of Malbec. . . the timing was perfect to move on to see my next movie.  I was a happy camper. . . right up until my credit card bounced.  Oops. I didn't know what to expect. . . stay and wash the dishes?  The manager, John, was so kind.  He let me off with a promise to return, which I did next day.  I ask you, how many restaurants do you know that would let you walk out without paying the bill and only a promise to return? Florio is a great neighborhood place.  The dishes are straight forward and always delicious.  If you are not too hungry, the small version of the pastas   or the mussels will hit the spot.  The atmosphere is cozy with an old world charm. It's always a test of  a restaurant's service and timing when you dine alone. Last night, after a great bike ride across the bridge and back I decided to treat myself to dinner at Florio. I had never been, despite being on Fillmore almost daily, so I thought I'd give it a try, especially because the combination of French and Italian is mainly my influence for cooking. I was sat across from the bar at pub height tables, which was perfect for one and would be nice for two people as well. Their wine list is very nice (any place with Navarro is good by me) and they serve many of their wines by the glass in half carafes as well, which is great for me because I usually have two glasses of wine. I started with the beet salad which was deliciously paired with soft goat cheese. I could have done without the grapefruit slices underneath it, but I can see where the chef was going with it. I went with the evening's special for my entree, braised lamb shoulder in farro with spring green onions and green olives. It was a perfect combination of tender lamb mixed with a delicious sauce and farro. Each bite held its own flavor but complemented each ingredient nicely. For dessert I ordered the ""pain au chocoate"" which was more of a bread pudding (hint quotation marks) instead of chocolate croissant. If you like a crispy outside with gooey chocolate goodness inside, then this is safe bet for you. Finishing with coffee, I was very satisfied with my meal. The service was great and I did not feel rushed from course to course, as can happen when you dine alone. My server was friendly and very helpful on dish descriptions. Overall, a very nice dinner. I've never tried Sicilian food before, but I do like Florio's take on it.  The setting was semi casual and the all wood interior did make it difficult to hear. The service was a little slow, it seemed they were short staffed that night. The meals were good.  I enjoyed the large portion of saffron seafood stew. Their gnocchi dish had an interesting twist having more of a polenta consistency. I would try Florio again just to experience more Sicilian cuisine. Florio sent me a gift certificate after my reaction to the fiddleheads. Very sweet of them. We went back and thoroughly enjoyed the meal. (Steak. Pommes. ) To follow up, I was the only guest at the table to react that way  which matches the research on incidents with this foraged green. I went on a hike in Marin recently and just looking at the fern sprouts gave me the heeby geebies. We should all remember to be careful with exotic ingredients. There is no way of knowing how our bodies will respond to something new. What a wonderful place  we were transported. The atmosphere is cozy and chic at the same time. The service was amazing  very friendly and professional. Cocktail menu was unique and the ""Parisian"" that I ordered was yummy. Best of all the food was fantastic. We had the fried asparagus to start and the roasted chicken for two for dinner. Everything was perfect  the  veggies and fries that came with the chicken were wonderful. When the check came I felt it was all worth it and then some. Reasonable for sure. I liked this restaurant alot. It was a bit noisy for my taste but I still enjoyed having dinner there. Last minute dinner plans but we were able to get a table right away through opentable. We started off with the chicken pate over crostini with some pickled onions and pickles. Very tasty. Had a carafe of their house chardonnay and it wasn't bad. Our other appetizers were the pomme frites and butter lettuce salad. Salad was just like a regular salad with just a bed of lettuce. Pomme frites were super yummy with a aioli dipping sauce. They give you a pretty big portion of fries. On to our main courses: I had the asparagus and sausage pasta, my dinner mate had the open faced hamburger. I really liked my pasta and the fact that it came to the table piping hot made it even more delightful. I didn't try the open faced burger but my dinner mate seemed happy with it. We ended dinner with sharing a chocolate something  cake and coffee. It was just too much food but everything was delcious and service was pretty good for a busy Friday night. Liked this place alot and will be back. There is no meal that tastes better than a free meal. My wife decided to treat me to dinner so after a visit to the De Young and the King Tut exhibit (which by the way if you have not viewed it yet, get your ass over there as this is the final month in SF!) we made a reservation on opentable and headed to Florio. When we arrived in the neighborhood there was a very short supply of street parking so we took advantage of the valet service ($. ). Our table was ready so we were seated right away in the back of the dining room. The seating is tight and the floor is very busy which means any trips to the restroom can be a challenge as it is a maze getting to the back of the restaurant. But if you really need to go, just feel free to climb over the tables and snatch a taste of everyones appetizers. Our server was prompt and super nice. She explained in detail the offerings and the specials. She took our drink orders and had them in front of us within just a few short minutes. My wife started off with a Junipero martini. The gin is made by Anchor Steam and she is a huge fan of it. I was curious about the Chimay Belgian ale ($. ) and  loved it. Big hearty and dark, but not syrupy dark like a Guinness. For our starter we shared an order of a lightly breaded bean dish called the ""Pole Bean Fritti"". It is served alongside with a green garlic aioli sauce that had a slight spiced flavor. It went great with my beer. Our main dishes were simple as I went with the hamburger served open faced and topped with fontina cheese and caramelized onion. I substituted the greens for a side of fries. My wife went with the steak frites which was served with a high quality bernaise sauce. Word of warning, I could have passed on ordering fries with my dish as the portion sizes are huge and we could have easily just shared hers. I nor my wife even made a dent in our fries. But this is no reflection on the quality as they were delicious. Both dishes were very good and perfectly cooked to order. Our wine for the night was a French Gigondas which was priced right around $. We always have good luck with Gigondas and this one again was right on track. The service was excellent and I love the busy hustle and bustle which makes you feel like you dining in an actual French Bistro in Paris. Careful with the bread as it is terrific but you can easily get filled up on as they keep it coming to your dinner. Sorry Jennifer L, but we did skip on dessert, but we did share an ice cream sandwich when we got home later that night.  / Stars It is an odd mix of Italian and French, a mix that would never be possible in the old continent so at least we can give them a point for the originality of that aspect. The food was good but not extraordinary: I had the burger (rare) with a side of fries. The dish came with pickled vegetables that I simply could not eat and had to put aside. But the fries were great, by far the best part of the meal. The wine list was rather poor and  for once  I just had tap water! Good Steak Frites and a pretty appealing wine list. Liked this place way better than its neighbor SPQR Quick stop on a HH Wednesday, got the Manciat Poncet White Burgundy.  (They make a white burgundy?? I've got a lot to learn. )  Grade A ambiance and service.  Would definitely come back to try the food next time.  sent from iPhone This must have been an off night but the worst service! Our server was barely civil and almost through us out so she could reseat the table. Food was excellent but I left with such a bad feeling I would not go back :(  of us went for my brother's birthday.  can't say i was expecting a lot from the yelp reviews, but i'm always game for something new. we're all family so we're not afraid to dig into each others plates and eat quasi family style.  makes it easy for me to comment on so many dishes. there's a flavor paradigm here: this brasserie is like a lot of (the better) French wine  interesting/good flavors but restrained. speaking of wine, one clear plus for this place was the corkage $. (don't get me wrong, their brief wine list was more than adequate to cover most people's needs.  i prefer to bring my own because i get more bang for the buck. )for those of you who find wine important with the meal, we opened our bottles in the following order and found that they paired well w/ the food: a  Santa Barbara pinot noir / E. Guigal Gigondas/ Sonoma zinfandel. we started w/ the Sicilian green olives (firm, meaty and nutty great start!), prosciutto/fig preserve bruschetta (nice contrast salt/sweet), and the sardines (not too fishy/fresh bed of onions/herbs).  so far so good.  everything went well w/ the pinot/Gigondas we brought.  my wife had the soup du jour  potato/leek.  not too salty and just creamy enough. for entrees, we had the hanger steak/pork chops/seafood stew/roast chicken.  all came w/ good portions.  between my brother/nephew/me, we never leave food on the plate.  we ended up taking some doggy bags home. the chicken is their ""signature"" dish of sorts.  quite moist and well seasoned.  comes in a bed of sauteed squash/brussel sprouts/shiitake.  this was an easy to eat  dish doesn't slap you in the face w/ overwhelming flavor.   subdued.  you don't have to sip your beverage periodically to cleanse your palate (but did anyways w/ the pinot!).  you can just jump eagerly to your next bite.  i can see why regulars keep coming back to this dish on a weekly basis. The seafood stew was okay.  I like my stews robust and hearty.  This was hearty but flavors were not flavorful enough.  The fish/shellfish were moist, so that's a plus.  my brother finished it w/ relish. the hanger steak and frites were as good as I've had from a brasserie on the west coast.  the frites were crispy on the outside but moist enough on the inside.  the steak was tender and perfect medium rare for me (more rare than medium, if you know what i mean).  seasoned well but not overwhelming.  i'm the kinda guy who puts a steak sauce on EVERY steak.  i didn't need sauce. the pork was tender.  a little salty for some of us.  i thought it was fine but not a noteworthy dish.  not something I would order again, but can't say it was bad.  service was attentive.  the owner (?) made sure we were cared for.  i find it necessary that dishes are promptly cleared and water is constantly filled.  they did that.  our waiter was enthusiastic and friendly.  we gave him a litter more than the standard %. all in all, this place is solid.  (we didn't have their desserts so can't comment on that. ) i can see why it has a loyal following of regulars.  price is easy enough on the pocket so coming weekly won't crush your budget.    the menus strengths (esp. chicken/steak) are definitely worth coming back for.  the service was attentive enough and friendly.  portions were large so you don't leave hungry.  i give this place a .  stars when all of the above is considered. my two cents. A star for service, another for ambiance, the third for frites like they do aux france, and the fourth for perfectly roasted chicken and a butternut squash soup so good I literally asked for more bread just so I could soak up every last drop lingering in my bowl. The decor really lends to the experience of dining at Florio. I, personally, am a fan of dark mahogany, gentlemen of leisure, and sipping wine within the warm, dim, glow of candle light. Florio is beautiful inside and takes you back to mid century Europe. Seating is a little tight but in a cozy way. The servers were extremely attentive and genuinely friendly they checked on us at least  times before we were ready to order. Time between order, appetizer, and main course was perfectly spaced to allow for full enjoyment of food and digestion (very important, indeed). To start, the butternut squash soup. It was seasoned just right with sage and rosemary, with a consistency that wasn't too soupy or too stewy perfection. As a main, we ordered the poulet pour deux. I don't ever eat the skin on my chicken, but I ate some just for this occasion tender chicken, doused in its natural juice, encased by a crispy but not greasy skin, and smothered in perfectly cooked vegetables! I had never tried brussel sprouts until this meal, but I think I found my new favorite veggie. According to my dining partner, sprouts are often uninspiring and can either undercooked too easily and over cooked to a point where they charr. He was also impressed with their simple yet savory take on it boiled almost to the point of being cooked and then grilled on medium heat just to the point of being a bit soft but with a slight crunch. So good. And the frites? What can I say. I was in Paris again. That is all. Minus one star for the unexpectedly drab bathroom and because I find its best to sample more than one entree before really making a definitive  star decision on a place. I'm expecting, though, that a second dining experience at Florio will up their average. Jusque là. . . Hello!  Mr. Waiter.  We're at your restaurant, right in the middle of the main seating area, not too difficult to find.  You might be curious to know that we might want a dessert, or another glass of wine or that we really enjoy the food, however you seem to like to ignore us.  That's ok.  We were in good company at the table and can manage without you.  By the way the Veal Milanese is delicious and chocolate bread pudding is currently leaving my fiancee speechless.  Luckily for you, the food will save your tip. i plan on writing another review once i actually TRY the food loli use to deliver meat here almost every other day and this restaurant had the nicest chefs and one of the cleanest kitchens ive seen (and believe me, ive seen tons of kitchens in SF)  stars for being extra clean and having fresh product to serve. . . FLORIO. . . you can earn that last star when i go visit for dinner :] Florio is a classic standby on Fillmore Street that often gets overlooked by the flashy new additions to the neighborhood  Woodhouse! Pizzeria Delfina! Out the Door! SPQR! Last night we decided to skip the new kids and head back to Florio, a decision that we don't regret in the slightest. First things first, we walk in and belly up to the bar. Our bartender greeted us with menus and a warm smile and the night was off to a great start. I ordered a bottle of A. Rafanelli Zin which they were out of but the bartender offered us two half bottle at the full bottle price, a nice gesture and one we gladly accepted. I'm a burger guy and decided to give the open face burger a shot. While the meat was nicely seasoned it was cooked more M MW instead of the MR I requested. No matter, it was still pretty damn delicious. The fries were hot and crispy and must have been crack laden as we devoured them in no time. We made new friends at the bar* and I was offered a taste of the hanger steak which was sublime. Next time I'm in the mood for a steak I'm coming back to Florio to order their take on the classic steak frites. Let's see  fantastic service, great food and new friends. I see no reason why you shouldn't give Florio a shot! Who knows, you might see me bellying up at the end of the bar, making friends and tucking into a steak. *yet another reason to belly up to the bar  new friends and bonus food! Oh how I liked it here. First of all the service is really good and friendly. And the atmosphere is nice and cosy, feels European and original. The food is really tasty. I had the rabbit and it was delicious. My husband had the flank steak and the frites. and they were perfect too. For starters we had a very creative arugula salad which was a daly special. Florio never looked to exciting to me from the outside but now that I've been there, I might not be too sad if the wait for a table at SPQR is too long. Besides, there's more space in Florio :) Florio is probably our favorite somewhat splurgy place on upper Fillmore. The service is great and more importantly the food is also excellent. We prefer eating at the bar, which is very convivial. Hint: the tables in the bar area in front are alot quieter than the ones in the back by the kitchen if you are on a date. A few weeks back I had the pleasure of sharing a deliciously decadent meal a deux:We feasted famously on the Bone in Rib Eye Steak a la Bearnaise for Two, Pommes Frites & Sauteed Spinach. Sipped its perfect match with a carafe of the Seghesio Zinfandel and finished with sweet finesse scooping up a classic rendition of luscious Creme Caramel. I enjoyed the convivial romantic atmosphere. Service was pleasant, paced with a European sensibility as befits such a meal. Wonderful.  Recommended. Four very shiny stars. I have only been here for drinks, so i cannot comment on the foodAs a bar  they make their martinis with love. Florio is consistently wonderful on all levels service, food, presentation, ambience. ,, and amazingly, it is only getting better.  It is literally our home away from home.  The wait staff is among the best in the city.  The restaurant is warm, lively and inviting.  Very French bistro in feel on all levels.  Tonight we had a wonderful succulant heirloom tomatoes salad with a lovely tomato tarragon vinaigrette dressing.  The chicken is consistently delicious as is the hanger steak, salmon, braised pork, mussels, pate.  Great strawberry rhubarb crisp tonight. Doug Biederbeck is one classy man.  Definitely gives you a retro, bistro look back at what San Francisco was/is/and has been known for for many decades.  Good food.  Good service.  Well thought out design and decor. really fun, authentic Paris bistro feel inside.  the steak frites were in cre di ble.  excellent; some of the best i've had in the bay.  my other friends' dishes, however, didn't look THAT spectacular, but i had a taste of the braised pork shoulder which was incredibly flavorful. the wine was great and the service was even greater.  it's in a great part of town and has a really fun vibe  i highly recommend. We picked this off OpenTable for a bite before the Fillmore and were utterly satisfied. We had a reservation for the dining area in the back half but chose to sit at the bar (lit in a perfect Donald Judd meets Bourbon Manhattan glow) to have a street view. My boyfriend had a frisee salad with slow cooked egg, which was delicious (although slightly more cooked than he expected) and the roast chicken with caramelized squash, which was deliciously seasonal and perfectly cooked. I took advantage of the Sunday night special  spaghetti and meatball(s). The meatball is huge but not overwhelming, veal and ricotta in a bolognese style sauce (more cream than tomato). . . so, so good. Finished it off with perfect cappuccinos. Great bartender! The service at Florio was excellent.  Everyone, from the maitre d to the busboy was pleasant.  Our server was very friendly, attentive and accommodating, so much so that I wish I could give Florio a higher recommendation, but I felt the dishes I ordered were lackluster to disappointing.  My friend and I split the chicken liver pate, which was superb.  That was the highlight of the meal.  We then split a plate of french fries, and I ordered the duck pasta while she ordered the mussels. The duck pasta was a bit overdressed, in my opinion, to where the flavor of the duck was lost.  It was salty and the pasta was overcooked.  The mussels were really disappointing:  fishy smelling and dry.   My friend offered me a plate of  mussels and I ate two.  The first one was just awful.  I wanted to spit it out.  I took the second one to see if the first was just a bad mussel, and it wasn't.  The restaurant is really cozy and intimate, and while we were being seated, I thought Florio was a place I really wanted to love and return to again and again.  Unfortunately, the food was disappointing, especially for the price.  Given the numerous choices in SF, it's unlikely I'll give Florio a second try. This is my favorite neighborhood spot. I feel that most of us don't critique our favorite small places because we don't want people to find out about our little secrets. However, when our favorite places aren't getting the recognition they deserve, I get worried. So, here you are. Contrary to the last reviewer who indicated that yelpers have bad taste, I and my fellow yelpers have a qualified and informed palate and high expectation in service. I found the service to be superb at Florio, every time I've been lucky enough to dine there. Whether I was sitting at the bar for appetizers and drinks or enjoyed a romantic dinner in the dining room, I found the service to be prompt, polite and classy. I was never rushed nor was I waiting too long for my beverage or the next course. The sardines with fennel are out of this world and an excellent way to start the evening. The Veal Meatballs served on Mondays are incredibly large but nonetheless we've never had a problem finishing our plate. You know how sometimes the best burgers are in french bistros, well that's the case here as well. And the mussels with pom frits are delectable (and that's coming from a girl who grew up on the beach in the northwest where we literally picked our own mussels from the pilens infront of our home). Its small, dimly lit, a tad bit crowded, not a library on the noise scale. . . but I loved it. The host was very friendly, the server was efficient and the food was really good. Will be back. note: review for drinks only, did not have dinner here. but it was a surprisingly great spot to get drinks!  quiet, plenty of seats at the bar on a saturday night, good bartender, extensive bar selection  really, got everything right.  martini + eau de vie + pineau brillet made for a really nice evening.  definitely my new drink place when I find myself in that part of town Was once great but no longer.  Service slipped and quality of food slipped.  I've been disapointed here for the last couple years.  I remember loving it every time in the  timeframe I have a feeling Florio will get higher marks than it deserves because most Yelpers have bad taste.  I think the place is average to below average.  The steak with frites, which should be exceptional, was something any Joe with a hibachi could grill up.  The plating was sloppy and the price above average.  Florio could be a quick dinner spot, but certainly isn't a date spot or somewhere I would go with guests.  The owners are friendly and the crowd on average is a bit older, but Florio is just another spot on Fillmore to me. We lucked out!  Parking on the street, next to the front door.  We weren't planning on having dinner here, but we were the first party through the door, at :. Really good first course; salad and duck liver pate.  I had the pork shoulder (good), my mother had the duck confit (better), and wife had the seared scallops (perfect). Shared a dessert; creme caramel (pretty good). The tab was about .  (no booze).  The service was pretty good.  The place filled up, before we were done. Florio has always been an easy ""go to"" spot for a casual, good meal. Unfortunately our ""go to"" place turned sour the minute we sat down with service that bordered on callous and ornery.  Our waitress had very little interest in us, our food  interests or our dining experience. I confess we expect good service and perhaps take it for a given; tonight we were appalled by the lack of service in spite of spending a lot of money on cocktails, appetizers, steak and wine.  Not that the amount of your bill should ever dictate level of service! Now we will question coming here again despite living within  blocks for the last  years.  And it was all due to poor service we experienced.  I hope management takes a moment to read reviews and make changes.  This is a great neighborhood restaurant that has slipped due to poor service and escalating menu prices. This cozy French restaurant in the Fillmore has a charming atmosphere and pretty good food but the prices are a bit steep for the quality of the food. Maybe I'm a snob for French food (I probably am), but this place is pretty lousy.  It's too bad, because I was excited to try it.  It looks great, but does not deliver. Service: The wait staff was adequate at best. Wine: The wine selection sucks, and is overpriced. Food (the worst part): It's just not good.  I was surprised how lousy their chicken is  it's actually impressively mediocre.  The vegetables were tepid, bland and unexciting.  The steak was tough and tasteless.  Such a disappointment for someone who loves French cuisine. Price: And it's overpriced.  I hate being over charged for crummy meals. Friendly, tasty. Unpretentious. Relaxed. Old schoolGo for a warm friendly evening with your friends. Don't go for mind bending dishes or fawning service. I'm sorry, when you walk into a restaurant you expect to be greeted by the host/ess and sat. . . right? WRONG, we were greeted by what looked to be the owner, and then told to go off in the direction that she pointed to and wait for another person to sit us. . . looking behind me there was another couple that looked like they knew the owner. . . so basically we were trash canned while she helped her friends. Food was not good, tasted cold, had to send back something to be ""microwaved"". . . who knows. Wasn't a good experience. Having walked by this place a hundred times, I decided it was finally time to give it a try.  It sure does look cool, what with the French bistro setup and all.  Upon Yelping it I became a little dubious, as a number of reviewers hated on the service and the prices, but I had to try it for myself. Upon our arrival the host sat us almost immediately, giving us our choice of available tables  much appreciated.  I hate it when there are  open tables and they just give you the worst one by default.  We sat down and the server was Johnny on the spot with the water and the bread (which was mighty good).  Generally I'd say the service here is pretty solid.  I don't know what these other Yelpers are talking about. First of all, per our server's recommendation we got a carafe of syrah, which was a generous pour, and at $, cost the same as a mere glass of wine at some places I can think of.  I would note here that the server recommended the less expensive syrah  another feather in his cap  and it was mighty good and lasted us the whole night.  I wish I'd remembered its name actually so I could go buy a few bottles. We got the antipasti, which was a generous portion of good, crisp pickled vegetables; honey laced prosciutto; firm, spicy saucisson sec (a lot like Molinari's salami actually); large wedges of tart pecorino; and some winter squash.  It was excellent  we polished off the dish in minutes. I ordered the hangar steak and frites, medium.  My wife ordered the Provencal seafood stew.  The former was generously portioned, cooked per my order, nicely seared on the outside, and generally satisfying.  My wife's stew was very similar to cioppino.  The portions were not as big as, say, Tadich Grill (home of the best cioppino in the world if you ask me), but it was very good indeed, with fresh ingredients and a nice snappy sauce. The desserts looked appetizing, but we elected to skip them.  The prices were not unreasonable, comparable to any middle to high end restaurant in the city, entrees at or around $ apiece, and as I mentioned earlier, the carafes of wine are a steal. Also, as a pre dinner cocktail they offer absinthe, complete with the water and the cube of sugar.  Had I not been on a completely empty stomach I would have had one.  Based on our experience this evening I definitely will come back to Florio, and next time I'm starting with a bang: it's absinthe for me. Older crowd. Solid menu. With so many decent restaurants on Fillmore we found ourselves a real dud here. I've walked by this place several times and it always seems fairly busy so I figured it must be OK. Not so much  the service was typically French and worse still  the waiter didn't seem the least bit interested in telling us anything about the food and it took us a good  minutes to order a drink from him. By the time the food came, I was hoping it would be worth the wait but I was clearly mistaken. The food tasted like I had a cold in that it didn't really taste of anything  the mussels were bland, chewy and generally devoid of much flavor. My wife's tuna dish looked like they had dumped a can of tuna out and mixed it with some oil and a bit of salad. The waiter didn't check back to see if we enjoying our food and I was happy to get the check and get out of there. You couldn't drag me back to this place. At a time when you're counting your pennies, when you eat out, it's gotta be worth it. Which unfortunately leads me to say that this has to be the most disappointing meal I've had in the city in months, if not years. Both in terms of service and food. But I have to say it's the service that compels me to write a one star review! It took  minutes for someone to take our drink order, to start. Then later in the meal, it took  minutes for another round to come to the table, and by then we'd finished eating and were ready to get out of there. Add to that, we ordered a spinach side dish TWICE, and it never came out. Now,  I consider myself a tolerant person when it comes to restaurant service, and usually over tip. But this was ridiculous. As for the food, I think I got about six cheese/leek ravioli for $. All of this is to say, I won't be back. There are too many good restaurants to drop my hard earned cash on in this city. not a bad lil joint.  we wanted to go to SPQR but there was an hour wait and we were catching slumdog millionaire in a lil bit so that was out of the question.  florio is right next door and it's not too bad.  what it does it does nicely and simply.  we met  other friends and we started w/ a variety of different things.  i had the winter squash soup as a starter and other than a lack of salt, it was OK.  another friend of mine had the same and if memory serves, he liked it.  my wife had gotten the salad and she liked thought the vinaigrette was a bit much.  for mains, i had gotten the duck and thought it was OK and lacked that oomph that duck dishes have.  my wife and one of our friends got the ravioli dish and they bought liked it as it was nice, light and perfectly sized.  our other friend had gotten the pork shoulder and from the piece i had i would say that it was the best dish at the table.  overall, we had a pleasant experience and i thought it was a good place to walk in to on a whim. I'm a sucker for dark bars reminiscent of s Paris, and so I'm a sucker for Florio.  Love sitting at the bar and ordering mussels and a cheese plate and some wine or a Martini.  Great atmosphere, great service, and delicious wine and food. Technically, .  stars. I went a year ago and thought the experience was fine but nothing special.  Great friends of mine say this is one of their go to spots, so I agreed to go with them last week.  They raved about the food and the service. As it turns out, food was really good.  We split an order of the goat cheese bruschetta which was fantastic (and I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese. )  Followed it with the bib lettuce Caesar which was remarkable. . . seriously one of the best I've had in a while.  Coincidentally, the entire table ordered the Pasta Bolognese, and we were all very happy  pasta perfectly al dente with a delicious sauce  great on a cold night.   The service, however, was nothing special.  Our waiter seemed to forget we had been seated and it took him  minutes to find us to ask about drinks.  Then once we had drinks, he disappeared again for  minutes.  My friends admitted it was the worst service they had ever had there.  Luckily, good friend and good conversation saved the night. . . I would do a  and / on this one.  The staff were phoenomenal, efficient, welcoming and profressional.  The food was good, not great.  Had the hangar steak with frites and it was a pretty tough piece of meat in terms of the gristle content.  Hangar Steak is not  a prime cut, so I expect some, but I think this piece was a bit on the rough side.  All in all an nice place to eat.  I'd come back. Florio was alright but nothing to really rave about. I actually strolled into this place thinking it was SPQR and from what I've heard I would've been a little more satisfied walking a couple doors down, but that's to be decided when I finally make it there. The atmosphere was dope, they definitely earned a star there. We were seated in this curtained off little back room like straight mafioso. The lighting was perfect. Where they lost points with me was. . . . . Very stingy w/ the balsamic vinegar. When I asked for balsamic they brought out a little tartar sauce cup. ITALIAN RESTAURANTS TAKE NOTE: There should be a little bottle of balsamic and olive oil on the table when we first sit down. I know it's expensive but your food isn't exactly cheap and you guys seem to be doing fine. Splurge a little on your customers. Shame on you Florio. Also stingy w/ the bread. There were five of us and they brought out three pieces of bread which we had to start breaking and passing around like it was the last supper. When we asked for more bread they brought out three more pieces only this time is was ONE of the rolls they originally brought out CUT INTO THREE PIECES. Stingy, stingy, stingy The Bolognese while really not disgusting just didn't really strike me as that great. I am super hard to please when it comes to Italian though so that may play into it. The sauce consistency was there and to my surprise there was enough meat in the sauce (most of it was ground beef though when it's supposed to be mostly Italian sausage or at the least half and half) but it was bland for the most part and just didn't do anything for me. Not really much else to say as I didn't partake in any appetizers or wine, I think with the offenses listed above though two stars is generosity. I've been walking by this restaurant for a while, but never went in until a few days ago. Small and cozy and lovely food. I had the pork shoulders which was absolutely yum. So tender and juicy! I can't remember what my friends had, but they enjoyed their meals too. We paired our meals with some sparkling Prosecco. We ended with some Fourme d'Ambert bleu with honey and truffle oil. Yum!(Oh, my friend was not happy that the bread they served was sourdough. Understandably so, I guess. ) BELLA, BELLA, BELLA! After  weeks on south beach I ventured out with some friends to celebrate some events. . . and we ended up at Florio The place was really sweet  cozy and warm! The mat re de was welcoming and sat me without my friends having arrived yet. . loved that! The waiter was great  attentive but not invasive to our close knit evening of catch up and celebration. We ordered the chicken livers to start  yum! The Rib Eye and Fries. . . OMG so good after no meat in  weeks!! We also shared an order of pasta (I already said I had dieted for two weeks!!) The total experience was great. . . great food  great service  great ambiance and reasonable price $. Look forward to going back! On a gloomy Wednesday night, we had dinner here because SPQR was packed. I was not impressed by the presentation or the flavors of the appetizers. We had the caesar vinaigrette salad and the chicken liver pate. Both were average and I would recommend skipping it altogether. For entrees, we had the duck confit and steelhead salmon. The duck confit was amazing with crispy skin and juicy succulent meat that falls right off the bone. The candied apple slices paired well with the duck.  The steelhead salmon was tasty. For dessert, we had the chocolate truffle torte which resembles a brownie with a side of whipped cream. The taste of the torte was much more complex than the deceptive appearance. It was the consistency of a dark truffle and was so decadent melt in your mouth goodness or a sunshine of chocolate delight. Overall, the ambience is romantic and intimate,  short wait without reservation, and ok service for San Francisco (I've had better). My suggestions are the entrees, dessert to share, and a carafe of wine. And if you like duck, it is priced at $ (similar to lunch prices) and is a great deal and appropriate serving size for dinner. Walked in on a Saturday night.  We had the chard ravioli, pork shoulder, mussels, and I had the sauteed spinach.  I had been there once before over  years ago and I remember my dinner had been over salted, but this time everything was perfect.  The mussles came with a side of creme fraiche and chives on a toasted brioche and it was super rich and ridiculously divine.  My sauteed spinach with whole garlic was also wonderful.  It was a nice generous serving and delicious.  The pork shoulder was very rich and amazingly tender and the chard ravioli was nice and light compared to the rest of the fare.  The wine in the mussels was a bit strong, but my taste buds are super sensitive these days.  All around a nice dinner.  We waited a bit for the food and it tends to get cold near the door, but a nice local place to have dinner if the economy hasn't gotten to you. Florio turned out to be a very pleasant surprise the first time we (my better half and I) went there. The decor is warm and inviting, and the staff is very friendly. The food is relatively simple and good (just the way I like it). The wine list has a couple good ones on there, which always helps a meal along.  It's a great place to grab a steak with fries, a good fish dish, or some other bistro type grub. It has become a solid restaurant in our neighborhood rotation, and I would recommend anyone on Fillmore street looking for an unpretentious place to give this spot a go. Quaint and accommodating is what Florio is. We strolled in looking for drinks, light fare, and dinner. We got a warm hostess, privacy, and more than our stomachs could handle. They serve plenty of food here. Lorraine D ordered a lovely carafe of red wine for the table. Jess M had a craving for brussel sprouts which were not on the menu as a side dish. They were in a salad. Our waitress went to the kitchen to see if they could make her a platter of brussel sprouts  and they did. She also ordered a three cheese platter for her and Lorraine D to share. I ordered the roast chicken with sumer squash. The roast chicken was tasty and drenched in butter. My only complaint is that instead of a mixture of summer squashes, it was all zucchini. I felt a little misled. We skipped dessert and went straight for the bill. We were plenty full from what we had. The wine was great as well as the ambience. This is a restaurant for older folk but it was also a nice place to gather and catch up with friends. It's not as loud as the other ""hot spots"" on Fillmore. Great meal at the bar, served by an attentive and informed bartender to two old friends. I had the beet salad  among best ever  and a half order of the papardelle bolegnese. He had a salad and the halibut, both excellent. Great room, coll vibe and music. . . this place is a winner. All in all, I must say this place is very charming and decor is of old school, which I fully appreciate. Our reservations were for pm and we were seated immediately by John (a handsome gentleman at the front podium) .  My friends and I were seated at a lovely table for four in the corner, quite content. We had martinis (perfectly prepared) a starter dish of  crab cakes ( also perfect and presentation was excellent)  and proceeded to order our entrees. So you can see we were settled in and as I mentioned before, quite content.  We were then asked to move to a table in the center of the room as there was a party of six arriving and they wanted to pull up two tables together. . so we collected our belongings and moved.  NOW . . . . you would think for the inconvenience that the establishment would have comp our drinks or offered us a dessert. . . . . Tis not the case. . . so even though our server was amazing and kept on top of everything (and the place was packed)    Our hanger steaks: perfect fries: crispy . . . service: OK, I'm only basing my review on the bar and ambiance, not the food : But I must say that this place is charming.  Cozy and quiet, a perfect little place for quiet company.  The bartender was super friendly and served up some great kir royals.  So  starts on the bar and ambiance, now I need to try the food :) Last night around :, we were heading out to grab a leisurely dinner at our new favorite ceviche spot, Fresca, and then down the street to the Fillmore by  to see the awesome Spoon concert.  But the cat had other plans for us.  She apparently thought it would be a good idea to climb up on to our neighbors' freshly tarred addition they are building and get herself covered in sticky black tar.  Why?  Because she has a brain the size of a cat.  So instead of heading over to Fresca, I spent an hour chasing the idiotic beast down, hauling her in to the sink, applying solvent to remove the tar, and then shampoo to remove the solvent, all while she is scratching and biting the hell out of me because  it turns out  cats don't appreciate being doused in paint thinner and then shampooed with a kitchen sprayer. By now, our Fresca reservation is long gone and I am in a foul mood, partly because   I can't lie  I love that cat and I was worried I hadn't gotten the solvent all the way off and she was gonna lick herself and die from it.  Mrs. Z kindly pointed out that the solvent would just make her even stupider, and that I had nothing to worry about because she was already at rock bottom stupidity.  Mrs. Z always has the knack for making me feel better. So, with just under an hour to spare we wandered in to Florio looking for dinner.  It has a really cool French bistro feel to it, very busy and bustling and maybe just a bit too noisy. We were attended to immediately and when we told our server our time constraint, she was all over it.  We shared a salad, which they pre split for us  a much appreciated touch which many restaurants forget.  My roasted chicken was excellent as was Mrs. Z's halibut.  Really a great meal, served up instantly and with good cheer by Jennifer, our server. After we finished off our meal and a carafe of their delicious Sancerre, Jennifer offered to bring us another glass of wine to share before leaving.  True to form, her pre split single glass of wine was more like two full glasses.  That kind of thing costs the restaurant very little but creates so much good will. I think Florio may be our new pre Fillmore place. You'll be glad to know the cat's not dead, and she didn't even seem all that pissed off at me this morning.  star for fresh ingredients and another for the good tasting food.  stars less for the over priced menu, crackhead looking waiter and again way overpriced everything. Food is not that bad, but man, what the fuck was wrong with out server? He straight looked like he was high, way high, to be talking to customers. Price is just ridiculous. Drink price, I would say $ more of SF average, $.  for Black Label? Come on now what the fuck is with the extra  cents?Really the food is the best part of the place, but not worth the price. That explains why the place was so fuckin empty. Yup. Oh Florio, how I wish you were much better. Florio is in a great location, looks great from the outside and from the interior as well.  So far so good. . . The menu has some appealing items and I'm excited to dive in.  Sad to say the food wasn't as good as I was hoping.  Also the service was only okay, granted the waiter was swamped but aren't they all?The marinated olives were good but that's a pretty hard one to mess up.  The chicken liver crostini was good but a little on the small side and left me wanting more. I had the pasta with pancetta and it was a total let down.  The sauce was weak and didn't have the strong flavor I would expect from a good Italian restaurant worth it's salt but there was plenty of pancetta.  Granted, I'm part Italian and I like a robust sauce  this sauce would have been sent back in NYC or Chicago, that I can tell you.  My dinner date had the roasted chicken. The chicken was good sized and looked good, I did try a few bites off her plate and the chicken was juicy but again not really flavorful, even with the vegetables. Folks, I don't think I'm a harsh critic, I do think I've been spoiled by some great restaurants (even inexpensive one) when I lived in Boston and Chicago. I wish I could give Florio more than two stars.  Maybe it was an off night?  I will return and see what happens and provide an update in the near future.  If Florio could do better, I would probably come back a lot since it's right in my neighborhood. Florio is another reason why I like dining in my neighborhood. A very cute little place with a lively atmosphere. I appreciate the size of the plate: just enough to enjoy every bite of the delicious duck confit (served on a frisee with crispy lardons and mustard vinaigrette) and still have room for the sublime melon and cherry sorbets. I must say that I was in great company, making the experience even more enjoyable! My first experience with Florio was on a Sunday night with a friend and her ex boyfriend but current fling.  The waiter pushed the veal meatballs which seemed just right for my as yet unabated hangover.  Ok, when I say that there were two meatballs and they were the size of softballs it is NOT an exaggeration.  Super tender and very moist which was rather surprising given the pure heft of these bad boys.  On my second, more recent, visit to Florio, my girlfriends and I arrived early for our :pm reservation and enjoyed a cocktail at the bar.  The cocktails made us snacky and I was pleased that the waitstaff was relaxed, even on a Friday evening, and let us enjoy some radishes with butter and sea salt and the pate at the bar rather than rushing us to our table.  Both were enjoyable though the pate was a bit. . . pate y.  Which is to say it required a baguette in order to be palatable, but then was very much so. I shared the entrecote for  (with bernaise, fries, and steamed spinach) with a friend and thought it was excellent.  The A. Rafanelli wine (though now the varietal is escaping me) was an excellent pairing.  I think you can't go wrong with this place for simple yet highly enjoyable bistro fare in a cute atmosphere. Florio has pedigree being run by the same folks who gave us BIX.  Just shows that genetics isn't everything.   The venue is nice enough, a long thin front room widens in the back.  The tables in the center of the room are well spaced, those on the wall less so. My waiter appears, tells me that the Florio Sunday special is veal meatballs.  Later, listening in on an adjoining table I find that I was presented the truncated version of what was available.  The soup of the evening was nowhere mentioned, to me at least.  A large meatball in a puddle of tomato sauce appears.  The sauce and meatball are well matched, each being somewhat bland.  The meatball has more taste of grain than meat.  Roasted halibut over fava beans and corn sounds good.  The corn and beans have the near consistency and taste of canned succotash.  The halibut however is properly cooked and flakes at the touch of my fork.  It has a clean taste that makes me long for more.  You see this somewhat pricey entree consists of a quite small piece of the sea. Rice pudding with cherry compote.  The compote has little taste of cherry, the rice is creamy but clumped here and there.  A miss for the BIX people. A nice place with a lively atmosphere. It was packed and fortunately we had reseverations. I had the duck which was nicely prepared. Very tasty. I wish the portions was I little bit bigger, but very well prepared. My friend had the fish which was nicely done. My other friend had the steak, which was good, but a bit overcooked, I thought. The fries that came with the steak was really good! Overall, we had a great time here, nice place! this is a cozy little joint. . . i had the seared scallop and arugula salad and the hanger steak frites. my scallops were a little overdone, my hanger was perfectly cooked but a little underseasoned (but i douse everything i eat in s&p). the frites were insanely good. . . mine did NOT taste like they were from sysco. (i like them better than zuni's!). i also tasted the roasted chicken which was FABULOUS tender, flavorful (though not better than zuni's). also had a really good chilean cab. the food is definitely satisfying if very far from revelatory. oddly, for a place on fillmore, all the patrons on a sat night were +.  i'd come here occasionally if i lived here. very good service, not obsequious, but attentive and easy to get ahold of. I wish I could give Florio more than  stars, but the dinner my husband and I recently had there was terrible.  The arugula salad that I ordered as a starter was decent, but it all went downhill from there.  We ordered the steak frites for , and the steak was nearly inedible.  For around $ for an entree for , that was pretty disappointing  we each had about  bites of steak that weren't just pieces of fat.  To top it off, the fries were so obviously from Sysco that it made it hard to enjoy eating them.  My husband pointed out how easy it is to make your own french fries, and how unacceptable it is for a French restaurant to serve frozen fries.  It's too bad that the meal we had wasn't higher quality, because the place is so cute and very Parisian, but I don't think we'll be trying it again. My daughter, Joy (Joyita A) took me to this low key lighting restaurant just blocks away from her SF home.  Cool place . . . had a similar vibe to Le Zinc, but more sexy, demure lighting. Joy and I failed to call in advance for reservations for this last Friday evening, //. Due to failing calling ahead for seating reservations:  We waited for about  hour sipping on Sancere wine at the mohogany bar.  Delectable, savory, buttery tasting wine opened up our palates receiving our sumptuous meal served an hour later . . . I remember eating at a very French restaurant on the Marseille waterfront:  Dining experience was taken at a very s l o w, leisurely pace.  Florio reminded me of that magnificient Marseille restaurant's ambiance and their food concocted by  Star French Chefs. Food:  Joy is a true food efficionadista, so I know Joy will take me to a restaurant worth spending $.  for two peeps to eat at a sit down restaurant.  We ordered the steak and frites dinner.  All I can say is, ""WOW!""I couldn't eat the whole meal, so I took the leftovers home.  Surprisingly, the french fries and veggies were crisp and not soggy when I reheated the fries and veggies in the oven.  The steak was fork tender when re heated, too. I will surely return to this retaurant because:. Staff was helpful, kind, and gave excellent customer service. Ambiance was delightlfully sexy and very demure. Dinner was a triple home run!I am truly impressed with Florio.  KUDOS! We checked this place out tonight after SPQR had a  minute wait (they don't take reservations  bet Florio loves this).  We started with some fine cocktails  that bartender knows her stuff.  I had the beet salad and the sirloin (medium rare) and both were very good.  Arugula came with both of them, and it was the best I've had in a long time.  The steak was very thick and cooked just right, and came with pommes frites and a butter bernaise sauce.  Memorable meal.  Nice atmosphere and service  kind of reminiscent of the current day Manhattan vibe.  I guess it was more expensive than we usually go with ($ with the drinks and tips), but it was a fine night out. First off: Go there on a Sunday or Monday night and get the meatballs. You will not be disappointed. Florio is not too crowded, is easy to get a seat, has a good bar, nice atmosphere and tasty, reliable food (did I mention the meatballs?). If you're feeling scene y and want to deal with big crowds and lots of noise, try SPQR down the street. Don't get me wrong, SPQR has some great dishes (deep fried Brussels sprouts), but sometime I'm just in the mood for a cocktail and a good bite in a casual environment. Anyhow, back to the meatballs; they're better than Quince, they're better than Bar Bambino, and they may give Pizzaiolo a run for their money. Sit at the bar, have a drink and enjoy. i want to like this place. i really really do. it  seems to have all the things that i like but each time i go there it  just never clicks. the food is so so. and, the service is blah.  the last time, i walked in with a very large group of very hungry, very thirsty friends and the staff looked like they really couldn't care less.  the low stars are for vibe and blase service and food. in this town, you gotta be on your game. I go in and there is this mahogany bar, reminiscent of Paris. Amber lights abound with white linens on tables. The smells of deliciousness fill up the place. yes. i am home. Bartender was a great server who convinced me to get the special. SPAGHETTI WITH VEAL MEATBALLS. There were millions of things to get but as soon as I ate one bite, it was a definite foodgasm. The bartender was excellent at helping with choosing a wine and it complemented the cheese platter perfectly. The bread was a brown bread with nuts that came with a fig and red wine compote that was gorgeously delicious. I asked for more and I got more of it. Best Jam Evar. The dessert was just as fine. Melodic Chocolate Awesomeness. I'm definitely going back again and I have no idea why I hadn't in the last five years I've lived nearby. I joked, that I would consider marrying the chef now because his food is so fucking delicious. Update // for dinner_I came at just past . I asked the host if the kitchen was still open. He looked at his watch, and said, 'just for five minutes more,' and smiled. I was seated and started looking at the menus. I looked up and thought, Ooh, boy do I like the amber lighting! It would be perfect for a date. They also have a private room that can be closed off by a velvet curtain, if someone had a birthday party here. (hint)They do provide half orders for the pasta per the waiter. The waiter tonight was helpful. I chose the Bolognese sauce with the handmade flat noodles. So f'n happy. First bite, I had to close my eyes. Flavors of porcini, parmesan, parsley, sage (i think), the robustness of the meat, garlic, onion, salt, sweet, oh my God. i saw the chef today, he was on his way out the door. He stared at me. Maybe because he saw this wierd woman taking each bite with her eyes closed. I liked the spaghetti so much, that i took the bread and cleaned the bowl with the bread and ate that. I told the waiter to not wash the dish as proof that I ate every bit of it. So I can definitely say that Florio is consistently yummy. Total damage tonight was  bucks for spaghetti and  for high end tea. . Not bad. Portion size was perfect for this elf. I don't know about the negative reviews, but this is my second time and I left super happy.  I'm coming back again for sure. food, sex, and traveling for food and sex is what life is about. What do you think they meant by ' eat, drink, and be merry?' Last minute reservation, got seated right away. Staff were super friendly. What more can I ask for?Everything at Florio is decent but agree with Steve D that it wasn't like 'wow I'll remember it forever'. I had my eye on the duck  oh no they're out of duck that evening. My fall back was the steak. . . bit heavy handed on the salt but the steak was cooked to perfection. The fries are also fantastic. My boy had the bolognese pasta. The sauce was divine! However I would rate Vivande (up the road) higher on the pasta scale. We shared the mussels and a caesar to start. . . the salad was lovely, and mussels cooked well (but yet again, too salty). For dessert we shared the chocolate torte. . . oh yeah, they used real chocolate in that dessert and you can tell. Overall. . its nice. Its pretty. Its a little crammed and intimate, but OK. It won't wow your guests but everyone should walk out happy. We went here one night and had a fantastic experience.  The service was wonderful.  We felt like we were the only ones in the restaurant.  The service alone deserves  stars. The food was delicious.  We both had the roasted chicken, which was phenomenal.  For dessert we had pistachio ice cream, it was absolutely devine. We would definitely go again! Been here a couple times.  Both times got the steak frites.  Quite possibly the best frites I've ever had.  Service is good.  Good fall back place but not one I would seek out for a special night.  If you're on Fillmore shopping around or out there for the night, it's worth it to pop in but I wouldn't go out of your way to go here.  The mussels were not good. It was my first time visiting and I really enjoyed the experience. I thought that the food was great and the atmosphere was unique. Don't think that they nailed the Italian food however the French entrees were quiet delicious! Can't wait to return. Going with a solid  on this one.  Overall a pretty good dining experience, but if you're looking for good italian this isn't exactly a destination restaurant. I do have to give them credit for good butternut squash ravioli though, and would recommend trying it. This is the place for PASTA AND MEATBALLS. Thats it. Everything else I've had has been ok but probably not worth the price. I dream about those meatballs though. Best I've had in the city so far. They come in portions of either  or  . . . with or without pasta. If you get  meatball you also get less pasta FYI. The meatballs are huge. Probably half pounders. The catch is that they only offer them on Sundays, and it's not even always mentioned by the waiter(although they'll make them for you if you ask nicely). When are they going to learn that they need to add this to the everyday menu and promote the hell out of it? Nothing else is really worth the time but the meatballs still keep me going back at least one Sunday a month. My dining companion and I came into Florios just before their closing time and were still seated and waited on with a smile, we never felt rushed and were encouraged to have multiple courses.  I started with the soupe de jour which was corn chowder with pancetta as well as the Bourgogne Rose de Pinot Noir.  We also had the cheese plate (with fig preserve) and the terrine which was really good good consistency and flavor, served with a tampanade of figs and currents and is made in house.  Even the table bread is homemade and very good. With the cheese we had the Muscat which was really excellent.  I ordered the chicken for one as my main dish which was really good, but I had to take a lot of it to go because the portions were so big.  My date ordered the hanger steak frites with the Matre d'beurre (lemon, parsley, salt and a whole lotta butter) which was very well cooked and also a huge portion.  Neither of us could stomach dessert.  I have to say the smiling waiter really made all the difference It's rare that you get a server who is memorable and friendly without being overbearing. Went for a glass of wine with a friend on a Friday night, the woman at the bar was happy to let us taste a few wines, and the Bourgogne Rose de Pinot Noir was incredible.  The space is small and intimate, and though we didn't eat, the food looked incredible.  We'll be going back for dinner soon. While waiting for  table up the road that never seemed to free up (' more minutes', later: ' well can you wait ANOTHER  minutes?') we walked by Florio and had to check out the menu.  The place looked so inviting, and the menu appealing, we walked in and happily found a table right away.  The atmosphere is cozy and warm. . . lots of dark wood detailing and candle light.  Feels like a true neighborhood bistro. To be honest, a little more expensive than we were looking for on a Wednesday night, but the setting was special so we treated ourselves, and the food was good. I had  lovely pasta dish and salad, my partner's steak was also pleasingly juicy and perfectly cooked. Awesome local spot. . . I live only a few blocks away, but had never been before.  They have a new executive chef, so I figured I would check it out and see if I could add it to my short list.  YUM!  We started with the tuna crudo (delicious, different and PERFECT) and then two of us shared the sea bass and the risotto.  (oh  and they serve the BEST bread ever. . . ).  The risotto was amazing and the sea bass was jam packed with flavor and cooked to perfection.  The wine list is nice and has something for everyone at any price point.  The service was awesome and I love the decor. . . very quaint and comfortable, dimly lit and intimate.  I will definitely be back  again and again. . . My compliments to the chef he has made a regular customer out of me! Update: Had another great dining experience here recently.  Daisy K and I split the steak frites and a pasta dish  great choices, great flavors.  Perfect frites! Made even better with a side of the bernaise sauce. Great service. Love that it is in my hood!*Had my first true dining experience here!  Have been here several times for drinks/snacks at the bar, which has always been fun, despite very lacking service.  Most of the time the bartender seems more interested in conversing with fellow servers rather than checking on/tending to clientele. Completely different experience dining!  Service was very attentive, though perhaps over caffeinated.  Food was fantastic.  The tuna crudo was very tasty and had a great kick, however the plate had a few very tiny little bites.  I enjoyed a light pasta dish with bright, fresh flavors of tomato, garlic and basil.  My friend had the special pork confit.  I was not at all sure what this was going to be like, but it sounded great  the waiter even said he would pay for it if we did not like it.  Safe bet on his part  that was an awesome dish!  Despite being all too aware why it was so crispy delicious and the pork was so deliciously succulent, I would order that again! The one criticism is that until we were provided a little votive for our table, we could barely read the menu in the very dimly light ambiance. Comfortable, but dimly light. I stumbled across a restaurant called Florio at  Fillmore Street last night near California Street the meal was nothing less then superb.  Prosciutto, melon, spinach and oregano for starts, a shared dish of cioppino with a delicious preparation of shell fish, crustation and chorizo.  The shrimp literally dissolved in the mouth, cooked to perfect point where taste and structural integrity near exploded, the shellfish sat popped open while resting in a spicy canjun broth and topped with toasted garlic bread loaded and waiting to sop up all left over broth.  Cream corn brought it all home as a side dish and we walked out at $ after drinks.  I just saw Ratatoullie this week and was dying for a good meal so this place hit the spot.  Decour is awesome, we ate at the bar and greatly enjoyed conversation with the barkeep and the head chef.  Ask for recommendations as the menu changes with the seasons, as it should. I go to this place just for the chicken liver appetizer.  Trust me it's tastier than it sounds.  It's more of a pate on a toasted slice.  The pickled vegetables are good as well as the carpaccio though make sure it's the smoked one that night. The mussels were a little soft each time I've ordered it so I don't care for that dish.  I do like the steak but replace the fries with spinach  yum!  For you non meat lovers, the rigatoni is pretty good.  i couldn't hold off on eating the next day pasta leftovers till lunch and had it at am. I'd skip the profiteroles (too dry!) for the creme caramel. The host is friendly and always accomodating.  This place is close to home so I usually walk but if you can't find street parking, they do have valet. Food was good, but service was not. Ambience was ok, not great.  It was quite dim and it seemed like an older crowd. We had to flag down the waiter for our bread and it wasn't even busy there.  Service was just ok. This is a great neighborhood spot but the food has been slipping for years.  I've ordered steak there at least  times and each time I have to send it back because it is too rare.  When the steak returns, it is cooked beyond recognition.  So, I started to order fish.  The fish is so bland that no amount of salt helps  and it tastes 'fresh frozen. ' The fries are delicious.  Stick with the fries and a nice cocktail. The service is welcoming and professional, but I wish they would work on the kitchen. I wish I could bathe in their warm artichoke appetizer every night.  Seriously, fill my tub with butter, egg, and artichoke and let me O. D. on the drippy, gooey goodness. Unfortunately, it's not always on the menu.  I feel this proves the existence of Satan I am writing to Dawkins about it.  In the meanwhile, I will continue to hit up Florio's regularly. I've never had a negative experience there (unless you count the old cougars and sugar daddies that frequent the bartop).  The food is always tasty and filling: I can recommend their marinara, tagliani, seafood stew, and scallops dishes (Florio's regularly breaks down my vegetarian guard).  My dates usually go for the chicken or steak both of which have been reported as ""Awesome!"" and ""WuLarggh"" followed by lots of drooling. As for dessert, just order chocolate.  That's what I always do and it's always lovely at Florio's.  P. S.  Ask up front for LARGE water glasses with ICE this whole I'm drinking warm water out of a Barbie cup is so eighties. The few times I have eaten at Florio, I have had an exceptional meal.  The atmosphere is relaxed French bistro.  The crowd is neighborhood locals.  The food is French country rustic with several bistro favorites like steak frites. On my last visit, I was dining with mother and sister.  I think this place is perfect to take family or good friends.  For a first date, I would probably go somewhere a little more edgy.  But that's why I really like Florio; it's comfortable and familiar with some pleasant surprises on the menu. On this occasion, we started our meal with chicken liver crostini.  I've had it the last couple of times, and the earthy chicken liver mousse is balanced perfectly with a drizzle of sweet balsamic reduction on a crisp crostini.  My entree was superb.  I ordered a house made pasta with clams, house smoked bacon, with garlic, spinach, tomato, pecorino, and a touch of cream.  It was so good.  I was really shocked how good it was, and it wasn't too rich either.  We skipped desert because we already had plans to get it elsewhere in the mission, but I'm sure it would have been lovely. I will continue to come here, especially when I feel like dining on some very good food while relaxing with friends and wine. When I first saw Florio it had all the makings of being a great place to take friends for dinner in my neighborhood.  It had a decent menu, full, bar, it was dimly lit and seemed to have nice ambiance. However, it turned out to be rather unremarkable.  This is not to say the food is poor or the service leaves something to be desired, but it felt very average in every way (while charging Pac Heights prices).  I had the mixed green salad and the hangar steak  both dishes were fair.  On the night I went, the restaurant was pretty full so it felt a bit packed like sardines and the volume of the ambient noise made it difficult to maintain a conversation without significantly raising your voice. Where I was looking for a nice meal at a relaxed neighborhood restaurant to catch up with friends, I think I was disappointed at how off the mark Florio turned out to be. Went here a long time ago and got the burger, if I remember correctly. Nothing too special. . . I only remembered this place while looking at the Fillmore shop site lol. The stars are all for the service.  The service was very good. The food however, was so insanely incredibly unbelievably ridiculously SALTY. . . did I emphasize the NaCl content of the food here? I do like salty food but I almost thought I was going to have an aneurysm!This place would have been the perfect neighborhood spot for us but we just refer to it now as the ""salt lick"". My second visit after a long hiatus.  The scene is interesting, and the food is above average.  This visit was a date event, and the ambiance was romantic, service attentive.  In short, it was fun.  Waiting for my companion to arrive, I met some interesting, if I can use that word, characters around the bar.  Forget that.  Back to the food.  Stick with the meat entrees.  The lamb and beef are surprisingly excellent. Go for the Rigatoni and you wont be disappointed! I dig this place. The crowd's more mature than your  something crowd, so that helps.  The food is tasty and the ambiance of the place feels right. I'm not a regular, but on occasion, when meeting someone for some conversation and wine or a fine meal, this place offers a good choice.  Price is upscale, but sometimes the evening is worth it. FYI, I've never been here other than on dates or hanging out with someone of interest.  This place just feels like a nice cozy scene to me. I went here on  a Friday night, without a reservation and had no problem getting a table. Granted it was a small table, but I got one. The menu is kind of small and since we were not that hungry, we just got the olive oil dip ($) and order two main courses. I had the roasted chicken and it was amazing! Very tender and it had great flavor. My date had a pasta ragu and it  was good, but I thought it was a bit expensive for the portion size. The wine list was pretty good and the service was also good. The place seems to have a lot of regulars, as the staff hugged several guest as they arrived. If you go, you must have the chicken! Okay, all the food here is excellent and I'm a bit of a star whore so maybe a  or .  is more accurate BUT the extra star is for their ""for  bone in"" ribeye. Some background: I spent a non trivial amount of time and money trying to find the perfect ribeye (to see the non bone in winner read my other review). Here's what I found  the swank places aka steak houses were just okay. They erred on the filet mignon (meaty with little marbling) side. If that's what I wanted I would order the filet mignon. I won't run anybody down but one place served the toughest medium rare steak that would've made a prison chef very proud (don't ask how I know). . . And I thought good meat came from Argentina  wrong. So, Florio's really hit the ball out of the park (I'm also an analogy whore) and I really did go to EVERY place in town and ordered rib eye, medium rare. My arteries are probably no worse for the wear since I've bought all that media hype that red wine can cure, uh, anything. So Shiraz me baby. . . Okay, back to Florio's. . . They don't even make a big deal out of it (been to Florio's tons before and never thought to or was recommended to order the rib eye). Since it was there and I was on my Excessive Meat Death Wish Tour how could I resist. . . Note: it's for two folks so be sure to get some other debauched or soon to be debauched person to join you. . . The steak shows up on a large platter with the ""bone in"" not in (as opposed to Bobo's and other bone in places). This is a good thing. I loved the Flintstones as a kid but I already feel Philistine enough without gnawing on the bone as well. . . Extra bonus: it's a HUGE bone and if you have a dog, he will LOVE you. . . The portions are tremendous so be prepared to eat a very hearty meal. . . Okay, it actually gets better. Every dish I've ordered here is amazing. The place is very romantic without being the WE channel or Lifetimey on any level. Classy and intimate would best describe it. . . The staff are very very very nice and educated. Wine, food, your missing sock  they know it all. I don't care too much about the restaurants in this area of Fillmore street, but I do find myself returning over and over again to Florio for the steak frites.  (This place is usually an afterthought when I'm wandering up Fillmore after seeing a movie at the Kabuki. )  The staff is attentive and friendly, and you can easily get a seat for two without a reservation.  The atmosphere is exactly what you expect a french bistro to be  dark wood, small tables.  My steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and the frites were just a tad too salty for my taste (my bf thought it was fine).  I'd still go back. Florio is one of my favorite restaurants in SF.  The chef, Ed, is very talented and I love when the menu changes and reflects the freshest and best of the season.  He has great contacts with the local farmers, one night he did Porcini mushrooms baked in parchment and there was such a fabulous smell when the waiter opened the package at our table  only to be followed by great tasting mushrooms. Don't know what everyone is getting so nuts about the radish app, ask the server what the preparation is and if you don't want raw radishes, order something else. Be sure to order the rib steak for two when it is on the menu, with the fries and bernaise sauce  you won't be sorry.  Also, the slow cooked pork is great. Service is good, place is noisy but with a good vibe, and the bar is busy. I like to drop by this local site.  The bar is decent and the Caesar salad is decent.  On a recent visit, my friend and I managed to get seated at the bar on a busy Friday night (without reservations). We shared a sparkling fresh salad, a savory pawn dish, and carafe of red wine recommended by the bartender.  I would return again, but next time with a reservation  I'm just not going to be that lucky again. Portions: TinyService: Server was nice, host was rudePrice:  expensiveI was happy we were seated in the cute little window nook, but the restaurant was too loud.  I couldn't hear anything the waiter said and could tell I was annoying him. We ordered a cheese plate.  It was a disappointing platter with three slabs of cheese and four little pieces of bread.  I was looking forward to some fig, jam, or something to go with the cheese.  Even the bread quickly got gobbled up and I had to just eat the cheese with my fork. The pork and dark kale was delicious.  The pork was very tender and I love kale.  I tried some of my friend's scallops and thought it was OK.  Someone else ordered the pasta with cabbage and only took one bite.  I didn't bother to try it. I think I will go back and try some of the other items on the menu.  It's a cute place to eat. This place was alright, nothing special. For a Sunday night, I was expecting something low key, but this just didn't do it for me. I thought the waitstaff and host were trying ""too hard"" if that makes sense. The wine list is just ok, though I did have a nice Pinot. The radish appetizer we tried was average at best. The vinagarette sauce wasn't very flavorful and the radishes themselves were a bit undercooked. It just wasn't a fresh, succulent bonanza of flavor that I was hoping it would be. For the main dish, I ordered the hangar steak and fries. I asked for it to be prepared medium rare, and it came back to me done medium well, which was disappointing. The steak itself was also just average, and a bit on the bland side. The fries were too salty, as well. The atmosphere was ok, lots of soft lighthing and music just loud enough to remain in the background. A big negative though (cost 'em a star on the scale) was the  or  fruit flies that kept buzzing around periodically over the table during the meal. I find that to be absolutely disgusting. Overall, the meal was adequate, but definately nothing special. I've had better steak at Outback Steakhouse. I probably won't go here again, but the location is central to Fillmore Street shopping and there's always Harry's down the block if you want to continue a mediocre date there. Florio's got the right look. I remember when it opened, just slightly sad to see Oritalia leave, my first reaction was that it was a charming looking restaurant. At first I treated it as just a nice place to go for a drink, the bar is elegantly cozy, if that makes sense, not too big to have to wait for service and not too small that you can't find a seat. Nicely stocked. The bartender is so very nice, too. I tested her with my barometer of mixology, the Negroni, usually I can tell how good a place is by how well they make a Negroni, otherwise I'll just stick to beer or wine. Florio's Negroni was great. I guess I had been there a total of three times, just for a drink after work, each time plotting to come for dinner. Eventually I took a friend of mine to Florio as a birthday present. They sat us in a high traffic zone right next to the swinging kitchen door, it was a drafty spot, so I had to wear my coat thru dinner, which I find mildly uncomfortable. Looking around at the other tables I felt our table probably shouldn't have even been there. Waiters and bussers were swishing by at great speed with arm loads of plates, I was certian one was going to slam into me and break my nose, fortunately that didn't happen, I'm sure it was just my imagination, other diners would probably have felt quite undisturbed there. Oh, and the table wobbled. We ordered modestly, just two appetizers, the radishes were good (NOTE: another reviewer didn't like them. Florio doesn't really do anything to them, they just wash and trim them then serve them nice and cold with some fancy dipping salt. If you like radishes (like I do), or crudite, this is a fun way to eat, but I don't know what anybody else would be expecting really) and some mixed olives, then straight to entrees, one order of Rib Eye and one Petrale Sole, the sole was for me and I'm sorry to report I was still noticeably hungry after finishing. We had a couple of drinks, two each and coffee to end, no dessert and the bill was over a hundred dollars, which surprised me because I was still hungry. I left strangely disappointed.  If I go again it will be for one of their nicely done cocktails and little else. I have not had dinner here, but I have had drinks and dessert. . . . and can I just say. . . Mm.  My friend and I came here last night to grab a drink since we didn't want to battle the crowds at Harry's Bar down the street.  We took a look at the dessert menu and had to order the Creme Caramel and the Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Gelato.  OMFG.  They were both so good (we shared, bien sur), but my fave was the Chocolate Cake  molten chocolate oozing out of the center, not too sweet, piping hot fresh out of the oven. . . . wow. . . orgasm in your mouth, seriously.  The drinks were well poured.  Not a bad place for dessert and drinks, for sure.  I have yet to try an entree, though. The atmosphere is very cute. . . typical french bistro.  If there is steak frites on the menu, I am getting it. . . and its good here.  There is a cute round table behind a little curtained off area that is great for an intimate dinner party of  or so. It's the closest your going to get to being in a european bistro without going to Europe. Great food, great service, great decor, great drinks, great host, great fries, great chicken. I went here on a night I didn't have Harrys Bar in me (sorry George).   They have a good wine list but they hustle you in and out.  I felt like I was in the Central Valley eating at TGI Fridays!!  We ordered a bottle of  wine and some appetizers and the waiter was overly concerned we weren't going to have dinner.  He came over a few times to ask  well are you going to eat?  They also dropped our check really early.  I didn't go out in a wife beater, torn jeans and dirty tennis shoes that night  so really not sure what the deal was!This place is just ok.  Chez Nous is far better just a block down the hill. Food is always changing and it's a great neighborhood place. Hit or miss on the service. I can't believe the low ratings.  The atmosphere just oozes old school classy San Francisco.  Dim, loungey style lighting with beautiful wood and brass and golds. Crowd pleaser brasserie type menu.  Lots of the ingredients are local and organic. . pm on a Weds, there were plenty of younger people.  Either way, the older folks just give it character imo. . . Oddly enough, I had never been to Florio until last night. My friend considers this one of the best bistros in town, partly because there's a nonchalance and casualness to it. I personally found the service to be only ok, but the food easlily made up for it. Wifey and I went with the Chicken for Two ($), which was as perfect as chicken can get, served with crisp fries on the side. Honestly, we had enough left over for dinner for two, if not three, that's how large the serving is. It's also served with a nice spinach, so you get your greens.  There was a sense that most of the other patrons were regulars, and I like that sort of thing. It was nice to be able to walk in and be seated, again giving way to that neighborhood feel, although I think we just might have lucked out. Fillmore is always bustling and I've probably tried most of the other eateries on those blocks, but it's good to now have Florio in my gastronimical repertoire. Ok boys and girls, don't waste your time, just head straight to the bar. . . .  and order a beer and the Steak and Fries. Why? Because the fries give McDonalds a run for their money and this is the first place that has realized you can't put raw rosemary on a steak. . . . Have you ever had raw rosemary? It's like eating pine needles. Give the it a little hot oil dip first brings out the flavor and make them much more palatable. And yes this place is generally an old folks home, so head there around : on the week days or  on the weekend ( mins makes a hell of a difference) when they're all on their way to bed. Cute decor, very bistro looking.  Waitstaff were nice enough, had a few glasses of white wine which could have been better.  The sweetbread salad and the petrale sole were decent but  the roasted chicken is the dish that makes a visit to Florio worthwhile!oh yes, and don't get the panna cotta.  it has the consistency of paste. Atmosphere is nice, but since when are a few radishes with butter and salt an appetizer worh  dollars. . . I would hope the gourmets would take issue.  Could one not prepare that at home for less than a few dollars at Safeway? And furthermore, what would drive one to make this inane ""dish""? This place is only worth going for the steak frites, which breaks the bank but leaves one, hopefully, forgetting all the complaints they had with the bad service. The best place to pick up someone much older than you.  If you're into that sort of thing.  What?  Fucking ageist. Also, do not order the radish appetizer.  Just trust. Is there a Fillmore Street revival going on or what?  Regardless, attitude left when the dot com bubble burst.  Apparently not at Florio.  We waited over an hour for our : reservation and then my food was bad.  That's what I get for straying from the Yelp reviews, but fish sounded good, as did the sides it supposedly came with.  What showed up was a large, empty plate with a lonely fish lost somewhere in the middle.  The rest of my crew had good food and we definitely enjoyed the free bottle of wine to compensate for our wait, but it wasn't enough to give it another try . We've been there a number of times when we are in a time crunch but we have left disappointed and still hungry. They have tiny pasta portions and they find it acceptable to place rolls of bread on the table to be eaten with their cheap smelling olive oil. I ordered a soup that was none too memorable (too salty, actually) and we ended up going across the street for a milkshake afterwards, since we were still hungry after our $ meal! The waiter we had was unkempt and kept bringing me a glass of water (with no ice) the size of a dixie cup, and when i noticed other tables were getting larger glasses of water with ice, i asked for that, and he begrudgingly brought it to me. odd, since we were ordering wine. Save your money unless you don't mind parting with your hard earned $$. Despite the Italian name, the cuisine here is closer to French bistro. You may be tempted by more ambitious dishes on the menu  which changes daily  but to avoid disappointment, order the roast chicken, which is a regular offering. Succulent and moist, it's served with a generous heap of fries, among the very best in town. If your entree selection doesn't include them, be sure to order a side  they're worth the a la carte charge. Everything is priced according to Pacific Heights sensibilities, which is to say higher than it should be, and the prix fixe dinner priced at $ is really no bargain if you add up the a la carte cost of each of the three courses it includes. Service is always friendly and attentive. Love this place. Easy to get in, not stuffy, great steaks and friendly, euro style  service. No rush unless you're in one and if you're in one. . . MOVE BACK TO ORANGE COUNTY! Also, it's not damn loud like practically every other rest in the city. Atmosphere galore in this classic nieghborhood French bistro up in Pac Heights.  They've got the details right in the decor and it just feels like France when you walk into Florio off Fillmore Street.  Locals dot the bar and the place fills up early, so you might want to get on Opentable and book a table if you know when you're likely to go.  The food ranges from just OK to excellent, so this isn't the place for epicurian transcendence, but the great atmosphere, decent prices, and range of options make it worth a stop. The sweetbreads aren't nearly as good as Chez Spencer's but everything else was just lovely. Especially the waiter. . . I ate here last night with a friend who had given it medium praise, and I really liked it.  The service was nice, the atmosphere was pleasantly lit and comfortable for a dinner on the late side.  I was tempted by several things on the menu but ended up eating a really impressive branzino (impressive because I had never heard of it AND it tasted so good) with roasted fennel and an accent of a chimichurri like pesto. . .  In general, good bistro food yet somehow Italian, AND they had a warm chocolate cake with cinnamon gelato on the dessert menu. . .  I suppose the prices were a bit high, but then I am used to going to taqueria cancun for my dinner. I've had two very nice meals here, including one that was an anniversary dinner.  Cramped seating but nice interior.  Slightly overpriced."|3|92|4|Routine| Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 3/8/2012 ] Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils  [ date violation corrected: 3/8/2012 ] Low risk vermin infestation  [ date violation corrected: 3/8/2012 ] Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 3/8/2012 ]
Cityhouse 0|3.5|Steakhouses in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|88|0|3.25|" I can only really speak about the late night menu. It's not that great. Had the trio sliders that tasted like paper, the Buffalo chicken tasted stale, the fish and chips were kinda eh, the garlic fries were flaccid, and the lamb chops tasted like bad Indian food. Plus sides were the service and the drink menu. Asside from that, you definitely come here just for the ambiance. After doing some last minute Xmas shopping with a friend. . . I needed something quick and fast (read: no long line) which is challenging to find in Union Square normally. . . let alone a couple of days before Xmas. As we were walking back to the parking structure I looked up and saw a sign for ""Cityhouse"". We ordered calamari, hummus & pita, lamb, and sliders. Everything was okay except the greasy, bland, & slightly fishy smelling calamari (possibly old oil). Great customer service, good place to watch sports games, spacious, and quiet. Would I go out of my way to eat here again? NoIf I was about to pass out from not having any nutrients in body and I was close by. . Would I come here again? Yes Came here for lunch on a Saturday after checking out of Parc . The place was pretty dead; I was seated right away and ordered a New York strip. It came out probably  minutes later, and was way overcooked (I asked for medium rare, but it was nearly well done). Around this time, the entire staff seemed to disappear, and it was another  minutes before somebody walked by and asked if everything was ok. It took another  minutes to get a new steak.  stars for garlic fries, and the second steak they brought me was pretty good. My husband and I went into the city to see a show at the Warfield and wanted a nice dinner close to the theater.  This place was perfect  great location, fantastic food and  a very attentive waiter.  If you enjoy people watching then a table near the large windows is perfect. . . lots of activity on the street. We had a couple of drinks in here while staying in San Francisco. The service was great and their drink menu, draft selection, and wine list were pretty good. We wouldn't go out of the way to return unless we stayed at the hotel, but it's good to know that their selection is there. My typical game day go to spots include crowds, nachos, and lots of yelling.  Cityhouse was a refreshing change up to the usual, and a great spot to enjoy a meal and/or game. We sat close to the bar, the nice wait staff tended to our every wish when it came to changing channels given the all important football and baseball games going on simultaneously. We tried the heirlooms & burrata salad ( stars), the salmon ( stars) and the halibut ( stars).  Everything was delicious, if I had to gripe about something it was that the food wasn't very hot when it was delivered to us.  We were hungry, so didn't bother having it sent back. All the dishes were beautifully prepared and presented. We didn't have cocktails but given what groups around us were ordering, they looked enticing. Cityhouse is a great choice for a classy, tame, and vibrant dinner out whether or not you're looking to catch the game. Good food. Good service. Nice place. Sketchy neighborhood. The crab cakes were amazing! We stayed at the Nikko next door and ate here due to them having a gluten free menu.  Overall the food was very good, my bone in rib eye was to die for.  We began with the salumi platter which was very good.  My only complaint was that even after questioning and informing the waiter about my husband's GF needs, his lamb chops were still served with the fried onion ring on top!  We simply removed it and didn't complain, but that leaves questions in our minds as to what actually went on in the kitchen. We ate here the other night because we were staying at the hotel.  Our server, Anthony had zero personality, and he was obviously annoyed that we didn't want drinks. Clearly he was basing his tip on the price of dinner, and not good service since he was horrible.  I ordered the vegetarian pasta and I stated that it doesn't say it has cheese, but that either way I do not want cheese.  He repeated ""no cheese. "" When my food came there was a small amount of cheese melted in and mixed up in the pasta.  Anthony was no where to be found.  The guy pouring water came over to ask if we needed something and I explained the situation and i told him maybe it was already in the sauce and he said it wasn't.  He took it to our server who sent him back to me telling him there wasn't cheese on top.  So I showed him the cheese.  He took it back to the kitchen and took care of it brought it back.  This is the guy who pours the water. . . taking really good care of the problem while Anthony stared from a distance.  He waited until the problem had been cleared to come over and vaguely ask if it was good.  No apology or acknowledgement that anything had gone wrong.  He came back once to force desert on us, and then give us the bill after he gave up.  All our food was ok but the place was empty at dinner time on a Saturday night, for a reason. Food is decent but too pricy for what it is. Don't have much to review about this place because I stayed at the Parc  and my package offered a breakfast buffet. I'm not a breakfast person so to me everything was okay, but the waiter who served me (Lorenzo) was GREAT EVERY MORNING! We were staying in the hotel, stopped in for dessert and a drink on the way back to the room. Dessert was fine, but it took about  minutes to get it. Probably not the server's fault. He was quick with drinks. My husband and I stayed at Parc  Hotel this past weekend for  nights.  We decided to check out the restaurant and let me tell you, it was AMAZING!! We both had steak for dinner and it was cooked to perfection just what we wanted. The dessertwas delicious.  Our waiter Jefferson was excellent and very attentive in serving us. The view from our table was also nice looking over Market street. I've stayed at this hotel before but never tried going to the restaurant.  Our overall experience with the hotel stay and restaurant was definitely a great experience.  We can't wait to go back!! Food was great, especially the lobster bisque.  Service and ambiance was also great.  Drinks were a little weak and it's a bit pricey, but I'd definitely go here again. This review is just for the bar, and it's a nice one!  Obviously overpriced, being a hotel bar ($ for cocktails, sometimes as much for the beer) and the service can be spotty  or great! They took back my friend's cocktail that she didn't like and quickly made a fresh, much better, different one. Highly recommend the elderflower collins, especially if you like St. Germaine. . . which, let's face it, you should.  This one was just about worth the $.  The salty chihuahua was nice but not quite as good. Certainly no artisan, trendbreaking mixology happening here, and it's not a sustainable every weekend kind of activity, but it was a good place to come with my friend to congratulate her and catch up after her performance at EXIT Theatre down the street! Pretty good food, non chalant service and prices that are too high for the quality of the meal. This place I will only eat in again if I stay at the Parc . This is not a breakfast destination and there are many better restaurants to eat at nearby."|3|79|6|Routine Inspection| Permit license or inspection report not posted  [ date violation corrected: 3/10/2014 ] Improper food storage  [ date violation corrected: 3/10/2014 ] Inadequately cleaned or sanitized food contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 3/10/2014 ] Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities  [ date violation corrected: 3/10/2014 ] Unclean hands or improper use of gloves  [ date violation corrected: 2/7/2014 ] Food safety certificate or food handler card not available  [ date violation corrected: 3/10/2014 ]
Cityhouse 1|3.5|Steakhouses in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|88|1|3.22222222222| I LOVE the location of this lounge.  It is on the second story of the Parc .  Although I was only semi impressed with the service at the Parc itself, the staff went above and beyond here at Cityhouse.  They were fast and friendly.  The appetizers were pretty good.  The wine selection was ok, nothing impressive at all but it was nice to hang out here and then be able to walk back to the room which was just a few feet away.  The location is perfect as well. I thought this was a nice bar/lounge located inside the hotel. During our stay here, we came here a number of times. They have great happy hour options. The prices are a little high  I mean come on it is located in the heart of Union Square in a hotel, what do you expect. They have a pretty good appetizer combo  choose  things for $. Not bad. A few of us shared this, over drinks. Pretty good. It's convenient if you are staying in the hotel. Definitely not my first choice, but we started out here before we headed out into the other part of the city for bars. Service is good and attentive. Cityhouse is located in Park  Hotel which is nice, but restaurant don't even bother. Service was slow and unorganized. Food is bad and overpriced, presentation is sloppy. Hostess really nice older Asian lady was great   stars! I loved this place when their happy hour was  drink full price, second drink  cents. Now their happy hour isn't as good anymore and it feels like their drinks are not as strong anymore either. Tasty bar bites, but still rather pricy. Wish they'd go back to the older version. Friendly servers/bartenders though! My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out since I enjoyed my stay at the hotel so much, I thought hey the food must be good, turns out I was wrong. . . yuck. We had the crab cakes, New York strip and braised short ribs. Everything was just ok. . . nothing special. . it was way too expensive for the quality and quantity of food. We ended up going to eat at the Westfield mall food court after :) So the lamb lollipops are a life changing experience. But you really cant lose with the Cityhouse Trio.  bucks with enough food to keep two hungry folks satisfied is a damn good deal in an expensive city. Got the sliders and calamari as well and they were also tasty. Our waiter (forgot his name but he was attentive and very nice) and overall service was top notch. We stayed at Parc  so we had to try out this spot, almost felt obligated to, and I'm definitely glad we did. I'd chow here again regardless of if I was staying at the hotel or not! We went here for our BFF's birthday dinner and man aren't we glad we did! The steak  is perfect! I requested to surprise her with a birthday cake and the receptionist suggested their complimentary cake :) The tears from my friend and the look on her face is priceless We will definitely be back for the extra mile service and great food!Thank you Cityhouse! Wow. Granted, we had a large ish party (), but it took over an hour to get our food  grilled cheese sandwiches, cups of soup, and pre made salads. Ordered right off the lunch menu. Unbelievable. Food was just OK, made better by the fact that everyone was ravenous by the time we ate. Won't be going back.

Cityhouse 2|3.5|Steakhouses in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|88|2|3.46511627907|" This review is based on their desserts. . . which were not impressive whatsoever.  Came around  ish and there were a good amount of people in the bar area having a few drinks.  The place is surrounded by flat screen TVs by the way.  As you are seated, they offer you a small bowl of complimentary snack mix.  We ordered the dessert sampler ($), which consisted of the creme brulee, apple crisp, and chocolate orange pot de creme, as well as their bread pudding ($).  All of them were just un spectacular.  If I had to choose the best, I guess it would be the creme brulee.  That was all right.  Was not a fan of the others: Bread pudding  I swear I can make better at home.  Apple crisp  basically a cobbler, nothing special.  Chocolate orange pot de creme: I just don't prefer chocolate in a pudding like form and mixed with citrus flavors but that's just me.  Oh, and also tried their signature cocktail.  I believe it was called the Golden Apple(?).  Not a weak drink, but that's also because I'm a lightweight.  lol The  star rating is only for the food.  Food was good! I had the Filet Mignon and my wife had the Grilled Salmon.  She also liked the Lobster Bisque. Service was terrible! We waited  minutes for our food.  I asked for a horseradish and our server totally forgot about it.  We had to ask someone else to refill our water, server didn't even notice the empty glasses on our table. It wasn't even busy since we had a late dinner reservation. Cityhouse is the restaurant inside Parc .  It is overpriced, as most hotel restaurants are, but I was so hungry upon my arrival, I chose to eat from their special prix fixe menu.  For $. , I got salad and a vegetarian pasta dish.   The bread was delicious, though I did not care for the breadsticks.  The salad was uninspired with very little dressing.  While I enjoyed the simple pasta dish  asparagus and squash with marinara sauce over linguini, it was definitely not worth the price.  Also, while I was asked if I wanted pepper on my salad, I was not asked if I wanted it on my pasta.  Other than that, service was good. I also stopped in briefly for a glass of chardonnay.  The wine was good, and the snack mix at the bar addictive.  However, I would probably not return, unless in dire need of food. This place was empty when we walked in for a Saturday lunch. The atmosphere is contemporary and neat, the food is standard American fare and the views passable. Basically, no reason to come back!I had the soup of the day, which happened to be zucchini and potato puree. It definitely sounds a lot better than it tasted, but I did manage to survive the overwhelming lack of flavor. For the main course, I had the fish and chips. The fish was delightfully soft and crunchy. The only downside: I could probably fill a whole tank of fuel with the oil oozing out. The chips were french fries garnished with basil. I would have much preferred the thick British chips traditionally served with chips, but a dash of lemon soon fixed that. Overall, nothing worth writing home about! If it was just based on food, they would get  stars.  However, the lackluster service brought it to  stars.  Steak was cooked perfectly.  They give you plenty of food that includes a sauce and  sides with the steak.  The lobster bisque was amazing and the creme brulee is a must. For the service, we were not not greeted until i went to the hostess to see if we had a server mminutes after being seated.  The hostess stepped up and took our drink orders.  At the same time, I see other tables being greeted .  When our server came over to deliver our soup spoons, he didn't even introduce himself.  In fact, we had to ask if he was our server.  the service stayed the same throughout the meal, with having to find someone to ask for stuff.  Including the check. If not for the service, i would go back, location, view and food are great Came here for drinks on a Friday and it was surprisingly busy.  Seems that there were a lot of ""business"" groups around.  It was only myself and my gf where we had to find our own seats in the lounge area, which was fine.  But until we see  guys come in and were attentive by their server and got their drinks before we even got a menu!?!. . really??. .  She could of been overwhelmed. . which is understandable so gave her the benefit of the doubt.  We decided to sit somewhere else and was more attentive by our servers, so they did redeem themselves.  Overall a nice place to get a few drinks with friends/family and chill. Three things: ) Cityhouse ""house"" wine.  ) Scallops  ) Bone in ribeye. . . and that's in random order.  Loved all  of those  love this place and certainly going back for more.  Start off with a cocktail at the bar and make your way to dinner here.  It's fabulous! A couple of friends and I came here for the Dine About Town Experience and we were satisfied. Had an awesome seat right next to the window, overlooking the main street, and the food was good. Otherwise, nothing real special. I met a friend at Cityhouse for drinks and a catch up. It is the perfect location. We sat in the lounge area for a couple of hours and the noise level was perfect for carrying on a conversation. . . often times this is not the case. Although the price of drinks is a bit hefty, the pour was generous. Great place to hang out. The food was ok but the service was great! Came here for DAT in Jan. It has a nice ambiance for a group of people. As for going on a date, nay.  I had the salad, which was okay, but a bit saucy. The halibut was decent, a little on the dried side. The dessert was creme brulee, which was good, everything I expect it to be. A friend got the chicken, which was pretty good and moist. Other friends got the steak, which was okay. Overall, it was a nice experience, but I would rather go to a more worth while DAT restaurant. beautiful view of union square . . . but just very normal avg American food at a high price. I thought something was wrong when we came here for Sunday lunch at pm, & it was completely empty!! But anyways we sat down & I ordered the French onion soup ( which is probably the only upside to my meal). French onion soup was great, lots of onions & cheesy goodness baked on top. I also had the turkey Panini sandwich (very disappointing). It came out on a fat French roll, and was lightlygrilled, not even hot enough to make the cheese melt. Is that considered a Panini? Not in my book. Our server didn't seem like he knew what he was talking about either, so in the end, not a place I wouldsuggest for anyone to try; unless maybe you're staying at this hotel & theres a huge storm outside and you don't want to step foot outside to try any of the better restaurants in union square. I came here on Saturday with a group of ladies. We came here for Dine About Town for lunch.  I had the french onion soup and turkey sandwich with french fries. I also got to try the fish and chips, hamburger and part of a salad.  The food was ok. Being a Saturday I would think the place would of been full of people. It was slow day for them. It was nice to dine and look out at all of the shopper walking around. This is  a nice place if you like to people watch. The service was good I came here for Dine About Town during lunch. The restaurant was pretty empty, but that was cool because we got to sit at a table with a great view of Market. French Onion Soup  Good, lots of onions, lots of bread and toasted cheese. Angus burger  Nothing fancy, but done well. Served on a dutch crunch bun. Overall, this place is nice. It would be a great place with a view to stop by for some drinks after work. My husband and I were staying at the Parc , so I made reservations at Cityhouse. We were seated right away. The atmosphere was very nice and formal, however because of all the travelers in their traveling attire, the dress of the patrons was all over the place. The server was very accommodating with suggestions and was conscious of the fact that we had to be out of there because we had tickets to the Symphony.  He kept checking in to make sure we were on time. We did the ""Dine about Town"" (I think that's what it's called) for $ per person. All the items are on the normal dinner menu though.  I had the Spring salad and my husband had the Caesar. I preferred the Caesar. We each had the NY Strip with Mushroom reduction, green beans, and potatoes augratin.  Excellent!  The steak was cooked just how I ordered it, the server had me cut into it before he left to make sure I was happy.  It was juicy and tender.  The veggies were great too.  (Side note; I've seen a lot of pictures with an onion ring on top of the steak.  We didn't see that at all. )For dessert, I had the cheescake with strawberries and my husband had the vanilla bean creme brule.  Both very good. Overall, it was a great experience and the food was delicious. Had dinner here Saturday night with some friends before heading out for a night out in the city. The restaurant is in the same area and the hotel bar/lounge and I believe they serve the food there too. We started with the shellfish platter which consisted of oysters, shrimp, crab legs, lobster & tuna tartare. This dish was plenty big enough to share between  people and for $ was rather inexpensive compared to other restaurants that offer the same type of dish. For the main entrees, I had the Bacon wrapped Swordfish, honestly they had me at bacon wrapped as I probably would have ordered anything bacon wrapped there lol. Fish was cooked perfectly and the mash potatoes it was served on had a sweet taste that complemented the fish very well. My GF had a fish dish that I dont recall but she loved it as well. The last entree was the vegetarian linguine pasta that my friend ordered. It was a pretty big portion as he couldnt finish it all but he definitely had to take the left overs back home with him so I guess thats a good sign. The decor and ambiance were great as was the service overall this was a great experience and I wouldnt hesitate to eat here again. we stopped in on a monday night to buy a pitcher of beer (. ) and we got a free plate of buffalo bites. not bad. we also sampled the sliders, fries, and creme brulee. the sliders were okay  nothing out of this world. the fries and dessert were standard fare. the lounge area is quite swanky with lots of flat screens and comfy seating. if you're in the area it's not a bad pick  perhaps if we had ordered off the bar menu our experience may have been different but it was still good. and service was excellent! Review of Bar area, Dinner menu, and Breakfast Buffet. Our first night at Parc entailed a  hour escapade onto Market Street. Originally setting out for a bottle of water and some anti itch cream (I was rocked by a mosquito the night before I drove up) at a local drug store, my so called ""friend"" decides to conveniently lead me astray and we end up at the Westfield shopping plaza. Now it should be noted that I HATE shopping, and my travel companion has been my designated but unused fashion consultant for over  years. I've been putting off and rescheduling our little outings for a while now and in SF, I find myself hostage and decide that I might as well get it over with. But we had a good laugh. . . . at my expense. After roaming around a mall for  hours on a Friday night (I also avoid going out Friday and Saturday nights), I needed a drink so, we end up at Cityhouse and we order a couple glasses and sit down on the fairly uncomfortable couches. A dish of bar snacks were delivered to us and we drank and chatted amongst the loud and rowdy weekend crowd. The bar is well stocked and the bartenders did a decent job in keeping up with the masses. Not too much on draft but they have Guinness so that's all that really matters (to me). All in all, an above average looking bar area with plenty of lounge seating, dim ambient lighting, and flat screen televisions. Dinner the next evening was pleasant. I ordered the salmon and he had the filet. The salmon was tender and flavourful. The filet was lightly seasoned and cooked perfectly rare. Dinner salad of spinach, goat cheese, tomatoes, and green beans was refreshing. Sides of asparagus and spinach were fresh and cooked tender. Service was prompt and friendly. Breakfast buffet was similar to the Hyatt Manchester in San Diego, but on a small scale. This isn't a bad thing mind you. The offerings were great and cooked well and nothing, not even the scrambled eggs, was soggy. Surprise treats were miso soup and individual yogurt cups instead of the usual tub. I enjoyed myself with sausage, bacon, eggs, potatoes, bell peppers, yogurt, oatmeal, strawberries, coffee, and orange juice. I'm such a fat ass, but I was a happy fat ass. Service in the morning is attentive but not friendly, but that's all right since breakfasts are meant to be quick. All in all, Cityhouse is a nice place to grab a drink or a decent breakfast, but the dinner, though good, was not as impressive as other establishments of equal price range. . . but of course I have to consider that this IS in the lobby of a hotel so,  stars over all. Came here one morning for a nice breakfast while waiting for some nearby shops to open up.  At first we didn't know where to eat and found Cityhouse either on Yelp or just on our maps application. First impression: there were a lot of folks waiting to be seated, most of them looked like they were part of a group of hotel patrons or tourist group.  I don't think the line is normally that long it was probably just this group of folks that we caught onto the tail end.  Almost felt like giving up because there were so many folks in line, but it was worth the wait. When we finally got up to the reception area, we were greeted cheerfully and quickly led to a nice window table.  On the brief walk to the table, I start catching glimpses of the layout of the dining and lounge area and was fairly impressed.  The restaurant has a nice bar and lounge located right smack in the middle.  Great design work, very modern theme with nice lighting.  Despite the upscale appearance and modern edges, everything was still quite comfortable, inviting, and actually inhabitable.  The seats were comfy and they had nice clean silverware and black napkins. We opted for the a la carte items off of the menu in lieu of the breakfast buffet.  Ordered up some fresh OJ, coffee, eggs benedict, and french toast with fresh fruit.  Hard to really mess those things up, so I'm glad to say that they didn't. The waiter service was great, so no complaints there.  At the end of the meal, we left happy and certainly would not mind coming back to try their lunch/dinner/lounge.  It's a bit on the pricey side, but to be able to stretch out your legs in downtown SF to enjoy a pleasant bite to eat can definitely be worth the gold. The location was perfect to grab a bite before a show at the Warfield. The bone in rib eye was a tender delight but I could have passed on the New York strip. The sides were nothing special, we did the three forms of potato; puree, gratin and garlic pommes frites with herbs. Another disappointment came when my dirty martini arrived. It didn't taste like it was made with the care and love that I've come to expect from fine dining experiences. There's just too many great places in SF to settle for less than magical. What a pleasant surprise!I usually steer clear of hotel food, for the reasons that many of you have: . it's overpriced. . it's usually an afterthought. Both were proven wrong after having lunch here. Thanks to my aunt who treated us out, I got to see this hotel which had undergone a major remodeling. Inside, the design says modern, hip and classy in an otherwise blah looking exterior. The lunch menu is unfussy, with sammies and salads making up the staples. For the location, the prices are affordable from $ $. (A selection of different cuts of steak is also available, prices starting at $+)My smoked salmon sammy had slices piled neatly inside a dutch crunch roll, with capers and red onions providing a nice taste contrast to the saltiness of the fish. The crispy fries were adorned with parmesan and herbs, it was so delicious!Good thing we didn't pass up on dessert because the dessert trio proved to be more than decent: strawberry rhubarb crumble, creme brulee with vanilla shortbread and chocolate orange pudding. None were overly sweet, although I wished the pudding had a more pronounced orange flavor. Service was courteous and attentive, even with a big group of  people in the restaurant, we weren't neglected. At some point, we had  different servers checking up on us. Lesson learned: don't judge the book by its cover. Especially if someone else is paying. I had the pleasure of coming here with a group of people who work for Wyndham and Parc , so I was able to sample quite a bit of the appetizer food, which was delicious. First, though, I must compliment the wait staff in the bar area  extremely friendly and professional and I was amazed how our server remembered everyone in the group's drink and refilled just as people were running out  he was really attentive, yet not intrusive. As for the food, my favorites were the trio of sliders, the potstickers, the hummas and pita plate, the garlic french fries (awesome!), and the housemade chips (yes, truly made in house).  We also had what I believe was the tenderloin (may have been the NY strip  my apologies if it was), and the bernaise sauce was out of this world. The atmosphere was hip and modern, and the bar area was large, with a lot of comfortable seating.  I would definitely recommend a stop here for happy hour or dinner if you are in the area. inside the Parc  hotel. . . it's more of a lounge. my bff and I wanted to try it here on a Friday night. It was pretty empty. Service was good and atmosphere was actually cozy. Lobster bisque: very good and they even split it for usCrab cakes: You get  big pieces and there was alot of crab meat in it. So goodScallops: YummyShared the New York Steak: Cooked to perfection and well seasonedSide: Roasted mushrooms. Yummy Glasses of white wine to go with our meal. . . . that made our night complete. It's nothing special, but the food and service was good and company was excellent. Date/Time: Friday, :pmOccasion: Dinner Party of:  FourOrdered:  DAT Menu: lobster bisque appetizer, NY strip sirloin entree, sauteed wild mushroom side, vanilla creme brulee dessert, Location: Very chic! Definitely expected otherwise but clean and modernTotal incl gratuity: $. pp ($)What a great value their DAT menu was. . . . that's the first thing I have to say!  Normally their steak alone is $.  so we essentially got the soup and dessert free.  The lobster bisque was very good and chunky.  They definitely don't skimp on the lobster meat.  It probably could have been a little thicker but still very tasty.  I enjoyed the steak.  It was prepared medium and it was exactly as described  red with pink sides.  It came with a stack of potatoes au gratin, which was very rich and very good.  Mushrooms were delectable. . . then again, when are they not.  The creme brulee was a nice way to end the meal. . . nothing too special but enjoyable.  I would highly recommend this place for DAT though I'm not % convinced on coming here regularly.  A more romantic feel so maybe some place to take a date. Decided to try this place for DAT & an early father's day celebration.  The restuarant is on the nd floor of the Parc  hotel.  Walking in felt very modern, somewhat of a ""cold"" feeling. . . maybe it's the color b/c everything was different shades of brown.  The few staff members that I did run into were friendly enough & nodded hello.  The restuarant was dimly lit, but there was enough light from the large windows that we could still see each other easily.  Pretty roomy & not a lot of people, but then again it was a Monday night. I actually had the same menu as a fellow yelper  st course: Lobster Bisque (very tasty w/chunks of lobster), nd course: NY Strip (cooked perfectly & a huge portion!), rd course: creme brulee (very creamy, but needed to be torched just a hint more), & a glass of the  Petite Sirah to accompany my meal.  (Will be going to BevMo this afternoon to look for a bottle. . . )  My dad had  st course: the mixed greens (he enjoyed the light flavor & refreshing taste), nd course: Pan Seared Mahi Mahi (good portion, nice flavor), rd course: NY cheesecake topped w/strawberries (he said he enjoyed it, I didn't try it).  My mom had the same items as I did, but her nd course was the / Rotisserie chicken (great flavor!).  The only thing I have on a negative point was that everytime I cut my steak, my plate would slide back & forth. . . I felt like asking for a nonskid plate!  I made do though. Our table overlooked more of the Cyril Magnin street, but we could still see the Halliday Plaza, Nordies, Bloomies, tourists and the pigeons.  Our server was great, very attentive, but not too attentive that you wanted to tell him to get lost.  The hotel parking garage was valet, $ w/validation. . . all in all we had a great experience. This is a lounge around pm, dark and pleasant enough to wait for  friends out of the rain.  It's accessible through a confusing maze of beige high ceilinged entryways that have seemingly random, scattered placements of midcentury furniture  like you'll walk past a red Barcelona chair next to a cactus.  Peculiar. If you can find your way here, the bar is nice and the staff is very attentive.    More of a stop over than a destination, see it as an attractive but nondescript hotel lounge:  pretty, comfortable, and boring. Review is only for the bar.  Nice staff and good sized and strong martini drinks, at the typical SF hotel bar price of $ . They were able to serve one of our not so common requests for cucumber infused vodka. They provide nuts at the bar, which I always appreciate.  While proceeding to get very alcohol affected, my friend and I had a great time chatting with the folks around us.  I know a lot more about tattoos now.  The bar staff was friendly and we had more than one round.  Though we kept toying with the idea at eating there, and picked at the complimentary olives and grapes we were given, we decided to hit a restaurant across the street.  I did like the lounge feel of this bar, and would not hesitate to schedule this place in as the first stop to a nice evening.  It is walking distance from so many cool spots. Definitely want to try this place for happy hour. I have a complaint about the happy hour at Cityhouse. On the website it states that happy hour specials are buy one drink or bar bite, get the next round for $. . When we got to Cityhouse on Friday night the menu states that it is % off the next round, not $. . False advertising! I wasn't sure if I read the website correctly so I didn't mention it to our server (who was great & attentive. . . no complaints there). I guess I should've spoken up. I got the Pearadise cocktail, which consists of pear vodka, elderflower liqueur, lime juice, & ginger beer. I like all of these ingredients so I thought they'd make a yummy drink. No go. It was almost like drinking fragrant soap. The ingredients just did not work together. I drank it though cuz it grew on me after a while. And I did get a decent buzz off of it. The ambiance has a typical hotel bar feel. The Parc  was recently remodeled so I'm sure this is an improvement on whatever it looked like previously. This may be a good place to meet up, grab a quick drink, then move on. I'm really surprised by the poor reviews of the food here. But we'll get to that in a minute. I was a little nervous about making reservations here for myself and an uncle visiting from out of town (who happens to be a world traveling VP of  a major corporation) since the reviews were so mixed, but I really wanted to find a good steakhouse near his hotel and I was not dressed for any of the fancier options (this was a little last minute, and I had no time to change).  But, with the exhortation from my uncle to choose something pricey, I compromised on this place and buzzed through Macy's for a new blouse and jacket before meeting him at the Hilton. Cityhouse is next to the front desk inside the Parc  hotel, the lobby of which was much more attractive than I realized. (Note to self: next romantic weekend. . . ) We were there super early, about :, so we were practically alone in the restaurant.  The bar/lounge area was pretty hopping, though.  We were given the best table in the house, as I would have hoped, overlooking the Cyril Magnin/Market street intersection (which is exponentially prettier after dark). My uncle seemed unimpressed by the wine list (I wouldn't know), but the syrah he settled on was really pleasant.  We both ordered the ribeye steak with peppercorn sauce (all sauces come on the side, FYI). For sides, I chose the sauteed mushrooms and spinach; my uncle chose the carrots and potatoes au gratin.  We waited about  minutes for the food, but since we had a year or so to catch up on we weren't bothered.  In fact, I must point out that the level of service exactly matched what we wanted: available and cordial, but not insistent or fawning.  Perfect for having an animated conversation. And the food. Was there some sort of horrible kitchen accident on the days that some previous reviewers ate here? Because both of our steaks (medium and medium rare) were done to a textbook level (and I am married to a chef, folks).  And the sides!  I purposely saved half the mushrooms for leftovers with about / of the steak (which was gigantic) because the mushrooms were DIVINE. I would have saved the spinach too, but it doesn't microwave well as I have learned the hard way.  Both of us commented on the flavor of the steak, which was really quite nice; serving the sauce on the side to emphasize the natural flavor of the steak is a nice touch, since some places smother you in spiced nonsense. I hardly used my sauce. Oh! And the cheesecake was really nice also. Anyhow, overall it was a great experience.  It's not a place I can afford to visit often, but the location is perfect for my frequent business traveler relatives and the food and service are great.  The ambiance was sort of non descript in comparison to the wondrous lobby outside, but it didn't really bother me. I came here for DAT with a group of friends and we all loved this chic and modern place.  Without a doubt they serve huge platters of heaping good food.  Nice bar on the side for happy hour.  Drinks were only $.  after intial cocktail or appetizer. . can't get that deal anywhere else.  Service was good and attentive. Appetizer Lobster Bisque Soup (how can you go wrong? huge chunks of real lobster and lots of it on the bottom).  The cup is at least a large serving bowl size. I got pretty full off this alone. Main entree Prime Rib (juicy, tender and cooked to perfection.  the juices oozing out were heavenly) and did I mention its a HUGE portion? And served with a side of au gratin. Dessert Creme brulee, normally so small but really they made this enormous and hard to finish.  It was delicious and creamy and not too sweet. I would go again! For a hotel breakfast, not a bad spread at the buffet. Stick to the smaller option with the cereal, fruit, coffee, juice, pastries, etc and it will only cost you  bucks. Being a SF native, I would never had tried CityHouse if it weren't for Dine About Town. Had dinner with some friends (party of ); everyone ordered off the prix fix menu which actually had a decent offering. Three course dinner consisted of . lobster bisque, . NY steak, . creme brulee. Be careful on how well they cook the steak, tends to be overcooked. I was satisfied only because I ordered mine rare which came out short of med rare. Surprisingly the portions were good, taste was ok, culinary presentation was nice, atmosphere lounge like. Half the restaurant is a bar/lounge. However, for a hotel restaurant, I thought it would have been located on the top floors but was shocked to see it right next to the reception desk. Would I go back again: probably not but good to try. This is a place. . . that is forgettable. I came on a Friday night around  PM with a group of friends who were doing the dine about town thing. i decided to opt out and got the sea bass; it was decent enough but not anything special. i know it's a steak house so perhaps the steak is good (although a couple of my friends got the steak and i don't recall them mentioning anything memorable about it). from the dine about town menu, i did have a bite of the mixed salad (it was normal), the cod (that wasn't very tasty) and the creme brulee ( again, normal). service was fine; didn't have any problems with it but i guess i expected a bit more due to the price of the food. from what i remember, the place is quite dark and the dining room is pretty large. when we were there on friday at  pm, it was probably about  % full, which is probably not a good sign. eh. . . i probably would not come back here. there are other places to try that are better and probably cheaper. San Francisco restaurant week brought me to Cityhouse. I wanted a restaurant around Union Square and wanted someplace different. I am not usually a fan of steak places though this place has a cool atmosphere and a good menu offering good non steak options  more then just  choices. From the restaurant week menu I had the mixed salad, cod, and creme brulee. The other person had the lobster bisque, New York strip steak, and the strawberry cheesecake. Mixed sald was normal, not amazing but nice in color display and the goat cheese added nice flavor. The lobster bisque was a small bowl but very full in flavor. I enjoyed the texture, and you could see he lobster pieces in the soup. I tasted the steak and thought it was good thought I am not much of a steak eater. Though my companion enjoyed the flavor and thought it was cooked appropriate to his choice. The cod that i had was amazing. I love when fish just melts in your mouth and this dish did just that. I was surprised by the flavor and freshness. If you like your fish really cooked and flaky this is not the dish for you. If you love just slightly cooked then you must get this. The desserts were good but nothing special. Restaurant week desserts are almost always cheesecake and creme brulee. The cheesecake was better because it was lighter and fluffier then anticipated but still keeping that thick taste. Overall i would say come for the lobster soup, cod, and cheesecake for restaurant week. Otherwise would come here for a drink and the cod! note  my rating is based on the food only here. Ok about the decor. The interior of this place is cool. There are nice large windows where you can look out over Market. Though you are really just watching cars drive by and people out and about. The white wave wall really captures my attention in this space. The lounge and bar area are also very tasteful in modern decor. Okay well the one thing that place misses on is the service. We had a reservation, were a little late, but then had to wait. There were plenty of empty tables though. I don't think this place is often busy for food service. It shows in the service. The people are nice, and professional in appearance. They are just slow here, perhaps because it is understaffed. For us it did not matter because we did not have to be to our next engagement for a few hours and it was raining outside anyway. However if you were in a hurry or just want attentive service without long waits between courses then this place is not for you. Meh. Disappointing. Whilst on a trip to S. F. i was staying at this great little hotel, Abri to be reviewed later, and yelped a few places and settled on this one. The bar area is cool, but the crowd was pretty douchie. Whatever. . . I was in the restaurant. The waiters were attentive enough, but the food disappointed. I ordered the filet mignon, Medium, and get it totally cooked Well. No Pink At All! So the waiter passes by and asks me how everything was, I asked him to step closer to take a look at my steak. He doesn't hesitate to say, ""oh, medium, like you asked"", I was like WTF? Is this guy messing with me? So I asked him show me what part of the steak is medium, and he actually tells me, ""Well, that's how we make medium here""! That was enough for me to leave. The thing is, this place had potential. What a shame. I had dinner at the cityhouse for my st birthday. I had the swardfish w/ mashed potatoes &  my boyfriend had tenderloin with gratin potatoes & onion rings. Both of our dishes were excellent! I also had a skky dive to drink, it was very delicious.  The waiter was attentive to us and also let me pick a dessert off the menu for my birthday. The city house was great, I'm sort of shocked that it has mixed reviews. We stumbled upon this bar since we couldn't see any other bar in walking distance of this area. i really liked the decor of this bar. We only went for drinks, but we should've had dinner there. We sat at the bar area and orders bar bites. Their drinks were a bit weak, but definitely creative. And their bar bites were so good. We ordered the sampler, which is four of the bar bites. the chicken skewers with peanut sauce is amazing. It tasted like it's from a thai restaurant. The calamari was awesome as well, especially with their dip. The garlic pomme frites were great too, but I like all fries. and the other one we ordered was the pulled pork sliders, tastes good, but not really my favorite. Would definitely go back again, and maybe eat a full meal. I had to think for a second about whether or not it deserved one star.  But it really is one star. . . I wanted to give it another star, but I would never come back, ever, so. . . one star. I picked this place for its menu (lobster bisque, onion soup, steak selections and non steak selections), modern decor, and the location.  As far the decor, you can tell they skimped on a few things (what's with the chairs?), and their soup bowls are rather outdated. Someone mentioned the view.  I don't know when looking at Carl's Jr. became a view.  Luckily we sat on the side that stared down Fifth St. , and I agree it wasn't half bad, but I'd rather be at Seasons for a similar view. . . and much better food.  The slight price difference would be worth it.  The menu was so promising. . . but the results were not.  My steak was over salted, and rough.  I could feel every bumpy texture in the meat as it sanded down the sides of my mouth.  The over salting was perhaps for the wounds it left behind. And what's with the onion ring on top?  I had the potatoes gratin, and I don't think they used the right cheese; it was far too pungent for its own good, and it was too dry.  The spinach was okay.  It helped with all the saltiness.  The bearnaise sauce was sad.  Didn't really dock them for this, though, because I consider it a difficult sauce to make well. The lobster bisque (this is going in order of how bad it tasted, not the order that the food was served in). . . too thick.  Not enough cognac taste.  Had decent amounts of lobster meat, though. The mussels were also disappointing.  The bacon broth didn't taste like anything.  BUT!  The mussels were really fresh.  So, point for them, the only shining beacon here. I wasn't going to write a review, and I really didn't want to write a negative one.  It was the bf's birthday and they brought out a creme brulee (although they left it out behind a counter, where my bf could see it, for  minutes).  Staff are very courteous and attentive (no one was there though, Sunday night).  The creme brulee was complimentary.  I've had better but I have no gripes about it.  I left a good tip since honestly, the service was great.  It's not their fault what happens in the kitchen. If you're thinking of this place. . . don't.  Just. . . no. I really wanted to give this place a rave review, but a few things were off.  I'd say this was more of a .  review but I skewed higher because the restaurant tried to make the wrong things right. We went on the th of July after a Giants game and before seeing Spamalot.  I was craving steak like crazy and convinced my husband to splurge.  We decided on Cityhouse (which is a terrible name, I can never remember it due to it's generic quality) because it was new and in the neighborhood and had generally positive reviews. The ambiance is modern and kind of calm.  The place was not busy when we arrived.  Our waiter was extremely attentive to the point of being mildly annoying and he really pressed us to order way more food and beverages than we required.  But he was sweet and he accepted our responses to all of his questions without continuing to push. They start you out with a bread basket of all different types of breads and breadsticks.  We did not order apps as we had been in the sun all day and drinking a bit of beer, so we weren't starving.  I had a vodka martini and the hubs had a Jack and Coke.  Both were well made but a bit on the pricey side, which I was expecting, the exact numbers escape my memory. Most of the entrees ran in the $ $ range.  You get a cut of meat, a choice of sauce that comes on the side, and  side dishes of your choice.  The hubs had the filet ordered medium rare with creamed corn and potatoes au gratin.  I had the ribeye ordered medium with mushrooms and grilled asparagus.  All the steaks came with an onion ring on top.  If you like onion rings, I would suggest ordering those as a side because they were wonderful.  The quality of meat was top notch, the portions very reasonable, and the sides were very generous. Here's the downside.  When I pay this price for food I expect it to be cooked properly.  My steak had zero pink and my husband's had a small line of pink through the center.  For medium and medium rare?!  Over cooking meat this good should be a crime.  We were both extremely disappointed.  In some places I wouldn't make a fuss, but considering they are new and I knew I would write a review, I thought they should know that they aren't doing it right. When I told the waiter he didn't actually look at the meat he just said he would tell the chef.  He came back several minutes later and told us that dessert was on the house.  We had creme brulee and a strawberry rhubard tart.  Later the manager came over and apologized for the mistake on our meat. Overall reviewService: . Steak: . Sides: .  (I especially recommend the au gratin potatoes, they were awesome, if you like your asparagus a bit charred, that is also good, mushrooms and creamed corn were good)Sauces: .  (they came out a bit cold and they are served in tiny portions)Desserts: .  (pretty standard fare, nothing amazing, but not bad either)Drinks:. Price: . I honestly hope they listen to their feedback as I think the restaurant has the possibility of being quite good. as good as it gets for a steakhouse in the city.   the  oz ribeye was cooked to perfection and it was obviously a great cut of meat to begin with.  tender, melt in your mouth meat.  and I loved that when I ordered medium rare, they delivered medium rare.   the sides are generously portioned and a little more sophisticated than your typical steakhouse sides.  the view from the dining room is beautiful and the decor is cool also. We decided to start our Guy's Nite Out celebration (in honor of my friend's upcoming wedding) at Cityhouse.  Located in the Parc  Hotel, Cityhouse is the new restaurant on the nd floor and hotel lobby.  With a slick modern decor, great street views, and an enticing menu, Cityhouse had me excited about the meal we would be having.  Open since March of , Cityhouse is primarily a steakhouse, though the menu does have an ample selection of seafood items.  On a Friday night, the restaurant had only a few patrons but the accompanying bar area was packed with people watching the NBA Playoff games and here for the Memorial Day weekend.  We all started with a few appetizers and picked a meat selection that was appropriate to our guy themed night.  The steaks and main meat selections all allow you to choose one sauce (bernadaise, horseradish, mushroom reduction, peppercorn, or mint chutney) and also pick two sides (potato au gratin, creamed corn, sautéed spinach, mushrooms, garlic pomme frites, etc. ).  Things were looking good. As the appetizers arrived, it was obvious that the execution of Cityhouse was a bit off.  With only three appetizers, the servers managed to forget one item, give the other two to the wrong people, and it took at least  minutes for the appetizers to come out.  I'm not really sure how long it took as we were blessed with great conversation and company, but it took a very long time.  Fortunately, while the service was a bit off, especially for a hotel restaurant, the food was solid.  My French Onion soup was delicious and my friend's lobster cocktail was fresh, albeit expensive ($ for  claw).  The entrees came out after another prolonged wait and service was much the same.  Each entree was given to the wrong person, the sides were not matched appropriately, and finally, some sides were just plain wrong.  We had orders of buttered carrots and sauteed mushrooms, yet orders of potato au gratin and creamed corn appeared.  There really was no rhyme or reason and it was somewhat humorous, perhaps in part due to the free flowing alcohol.  Luckily, as with the appetizers, the kitchen did better than the multitude of servers.  Our steaks were uniformly excellent and while my  oz. ribeye was not Alexander's Steakhouse quality, I was happy with the tasty, tender cut and medium rare preparation.  The sides, especially after they brought out the correct ones and let us keep the incorrect ones, were very generous in portion although not as strong as the steaks.  In particular, the asparagus was overly salty, the creamed corn was salty too, and the sauteed mushrooms were a bit sour.   Overall, though the service was a bit disorganized, we all had a great time here with excellent steaks and stellar conversation.  Cityhouse was a perfect spot to start our night and conveniently located for all we planned for the night ahead. . . Cityhouse accepts credit cards, including American Express. The Parc  Hotel recently renovated their lobby moving it to the second floor and totally changed their old Veranda Restaurant to Cityhouse.  Come check it out!  The decor is fantastic!I had dinner here with friends the other night and the menu was impressive.  Try the Scallops with Risotto  Yummy!  Their Salads are a good sized portion, which I like and you can probably split it between  people.  I ordered the Sea Bass and it was prepared in broth and cooked perfectly.  The New York Steak and Ribeye were both also prepared very well.  You get to choose  sides with your steaks. All in all, the food is excellent for a new restaurant in the city and it is not strictly a Steakhouse but there are plenty of other items on the menu if you don't feel like red meat.  I heard the Pork Chop wrapped in Bacon is yummy as well so I may have to return to try it. This is the brand new restaurant at the Parc  Hotel. It's called cityhouse. It has a large dinning area, plus nice bar, and very large lounge area with many flat screen tv's. Modern and sophisticated decor. Great place for happy hour & bar bites, but also a great place for a very nice dinner. Lots of steak and seafood. Basically you pick your protien, the chips for it to be smoked in, and the sides you want. Nice service, and great atmosphere."|3|100|0|Routine|This inspection has no violations.
Grandeho’s Kamekyo 0|3.5|Sushi Bars in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|184|0|3.75| Pretty good food.  Miso soup was good.  Got salmon roe sashimi (two) and tuna sushi ( small rolls). My son made a similar order.  Total $.  Seems too pricey.  Good service, nice atmosphere. I used to think this was a great place but they have raised their prices significantly and reduced the size of portions. I think a nice restaurant that charges $.  for a fountain soft drink and then another $.  for a refill as this one does is lacking class.  $ for a fountain soft drink is more than the VERY small sake. I'm not going back.  They've lost a customer. Grandeho's Kamekyo is a great neighborhood place.  I have been coming here for some time and thought a review was due.  The food is always fresh, reasonably priced, and there is plenty of Sake and Beer.   The Sushi Chefs are great to talk to and talented at their art.

Grandeho’s Kamekyo 1|3.5|Sushi Bars in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|184|1|3.22222222222|" Tonight, I am inspired to write my very first Yelp review after an expensive and truly terrible meal. I should have known when they set down a menu whose pages were plastic coated. But in my hunger, i missed the sign. ""Would you like miso and edamame to start?"" ""Sure. "" I wouldn't have guessed a dish of mediocre edamame was going to cost me $. . Things progressed as you might expect. . . bland fish, the driest salmon skin roll I have ever had, etc. $ later, I urge you to avoid this spot at all costs! Been going here for years and have never been disappointed. Taking my parents tomorrow for a quick lunch. Guaranteed to have a hamachi delight : ) This place has fresh sushi and is reasonable priced. The service is quick and friendly ever time I have been there. My favorites are the maguro, hamachi, and rock and roll. This Japanese restaurant is run by Chinese. Very friendly staff but the quality of the food is not good. The tempura batter is heavy instead of fluffy, the soft shell crab is caked in batter, the teriyaki swims in sauce. . . If you like authentic Japanese cuisine, this sadly is NOT it Hate to give a place two stars, but the sushi was just no good, and the service took too long. Went for lunch, and even though it wasn't packed, it still took quite a while to bring over our sushi. I had a veggie roll, and my friend ordered a tuna roll and some sashimi, and at some point during our lunch, we both had to spit out our food for some reason or another. For me, the seaweed was so chewy that I couldn't even swallow it, and for my friend, the sushi smelled a bit strange and just didn't taste right, so of course we both completely lost our appetite. Safe to say I won't be making any trips back there. Freshest Sashimi I have ever had in SF! Great customer service! You can always see the same people coming over again and again. My suggestion is: only go for Sashimi if you decided to dine there; order the sake box (shot) if you love drinking (I think it's pretty cool); ask Byron for suggestions if you do not want to do any of the above!! Very nice restaurant for drinking and Japanese food! I will definitely come back soon! I agree with a reviewer below that it's definitely a ""no fuss sort of place. "" That said, service was great, and as others mentioned, no wait. I had some dry sake, salmon nigiri, fried tofu app, and a couple rolls. All were above average and prices were decent. When I'm craving sushi but too tired to venture elsewhere, I'll come here. It's quick, friendly service. Salmon sashimi is fresh and delicious. Rolls are just okay. There's never a wait. It's a no fuss sort of place. Kemekyo is fabulous!  The seafood is outstanding The place has an excellent selection of very fresh seafood, also some exotic fish that you don't see on a menu very often. We love it when Chef Yo is there.  He is an excellent chef & really knows his stuff.  The miso soup with clams is delicious. Go early as the place fills quickly for dinner.  Lunch is good, too.  Even though we live in Bernal Heights, we love this restaurant, & look forward to our next visit."|4|82|6|Routine| Low risk vermin infestation  [ date violation corrected: 4/29/2014 ] Wiping cloths not clean or properly stored or inadequate sanitizer  [ date violation corrected: 4/29/2014 ] Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils  [ date violation corrected: 4/29/2014 ] Foods not protected from contamination  [ date violation corrected: 4/29/2014 ] Insufficient hot water or running water  [ date violation corrected: 4/29/2014 ] Moderate risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 4/29/2014 ]
Grandeho’s Kamekyo 2|3.5|Sushi Bars in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|184|2|3.0|" This is hands down my favorite neighborhood restaurant.  I come in and order Chef's Choice from Byron and he totally makes my night every time.  I love that not only is this place delicious, but you can always get a seat, the staff is amazing, and I leave smiling every time. Expensive for Lunch @ .  for the Bento Box but the fish was fresh and the presentation was stealer. I would recommend this place to anyone that likes Quality food. Pretty good sushi.  My boyfriend and I come here to get our fix  a. because it is close to where we liveb.  rarely ever a long waitc.  decent serviceif you are looking for an over the top sushi experience, then this probably isn't the place for you  but if you are needing some decent sushi rolls, then give it a go. This place is like a disappointment factory. When I moved into the neighborhood I was warned that the sushi here wasn't that great, and the general lack of patronage in comparison to nearby places testified that folks in the area had arrived at a similar conclusion.  Months passed, and after untold times of passing the place on the way to and from the N line, I finally grew curious.  My father came over to visit for dinner, and I suggested that we give the place a try. ""I think they're Chinese"" he whispered to me as we entered the restaurant, referring to the couple who appeared to be running the place.  Later he confirmed to me that he heard them speaking in Chinese (my father is Chinese but my mother isn't, and so as is common in mixed race/language families the father's language was not passed on). The food, well, it tasted like sushi made by non Japanese.  The flavors weren't quite right, the sashimi lacked the freshness that makes sashimi so wonderful, and the rolls were eminently forgettable.  A month ago I could have told you to grab real sushi at the authentic joint around the corner on Carl run by an elderly Japanese couple.  Sadly, that place has closed and so if you live in Cole Valley to get your fix of any sort of Asian food you'll have to trek out to the Sunset or settle for a dinner of mediocrity at Kamekyo, which will almost certainly leave you full, but disappointed. I love this Sushi Bar!  Friendly service.  Quality ingredients.  Prices are not bad for what you get.  If you are visiting the city this is a great place to visit. Fruit flies and bugs flying around the restaurant during my entire meal. Flies lurking on the walls. That's really all I have to say. I've lived and dined in the wilderness and have tolerated flies in that setting. Just doesn't seem to fit a pricey sushi place in San Francisco. Sushi quality also very low. When I told the  waitresses about the bugs these were my two responses:. Umm, sorry, I will let the manager know. . Yeah, I am sorry, we have had this problem for a while and are trying to fix it. Sorry to you both, but your responses were incompetent and so was the experience at your restaurant. Sucks for me because I wasted a meal in San Fran at this establishment. I grow up in SF and I have been looking around to try Asian food. This place is fantastic with their service and I love their Sashimi especially the Salmon and yellow tail. I can tell their fish is not the one you can buy at Costco or Safeway, it's really the Japanese Sashimi grade! Love it and I'm planning to stop by there again with my family! I doesn't have the world's best ambiance, but the quality of the sushi is fantastic and the staff is great. There's an early wave of families with kids (and it's a great place to take a kid for a pm dinner), then a second wave of locals. We usually ask the chefs behind the bar to create something for us, and they never disappoint. *This rating is based on   in restaurant and take out meals*We live walking distance and desperately wish that this place was good because there isn't much variety in Cole Valley. However, after trying (and failing) to enjoy either take out or in store food on multiple occasions over the past  months, we are calling it quits. Furthermore, we sadly note that this place has been on a steep decline from mediocre to downright bad since . Rationale for rating:The sashimi is poorly cut. It is thick and cut in such a way that you notice the ""grain"" of the fish. It is tough. The spicy rolls are covered with sriracha so that is the only flavor you taste. (Yes, I know spicy rolls are inauthentic, but they can be done in such a way that you can still taste the type of fish. )This place is expensive about $ /person (food only) at dinner time. This pricing is at or above higher quality sushi places in the city for that price. Also and this is the dealbreaker: *the fish is not fresh*. It all has a distinctly ""fishy"" flavor and is not enjoyable and perhaps not advisable to ingest. To the owners () please consider abbreviating your menu and focusing only on the most demanded seafood, so that you can turn over the inventory quickly and only serve your customers the freshest product. (eg, skip having multiple kinds of salmon and just have one high quality cut)(b) on point # above, take this seriously. My husband and I were concerned about eating the last stuff you served us for health reasons. () please teach your sushi chef how to slice sashimi and nigiri. That is the heart of sushi where you cannot hide the quality or freshness of the product and cutting the fish properly highlights its goodness. () please go order a few spicy rolls at  or  sushi restaurants that have  stars on yelp, do a taste test with yours, and consider changing the recipe. () please ask whomever pours miso soup in to go containers to fill them up. My last order was only / full in a small styrofoam cup. () check other sushi places in the inner sunset or inner Richmond for price/quality comparison and get Kamekyo in line with the market. () sorry to be pedantic and bitchy, but you're going to go out of business if you don't fix this stuff. For your sake, your employees, your customers and your neighbors, take Tupac's wise words to heart and make some changes. What an F'n rip off.  I hate, hate, hate bad mouthing neighborhood mom and pop places, especially in my hood but come on Kamekyo.  $.  for four pieces of spicy salmon rolls?  Let me repeat $.  for !, four, cuatro, quattro however you want to say .  I thought they gave me an empty bag for my takeout, but nope there was my  measly pieces of sushi.  The sushi itself isn't bad, but its not OH MY GOD amazing either.  If they had normal prices( or served  pieces of sushi in a roll like most places!) it would probably get  stars from me.  I don't think I will ever go back and if you want to try it, God speed.  I warned you. Best chicken teriyaki I've ever had. The miso is also the best I've ever had. Not a big sushi fan, although I know the sushi is great and the tempura is pretty good as well. Overall one of my favorite Japanese spots of all time. Well, this place was a pretty average sushi joint.  My husband and I were on our honeymoon in San Francisco and we wanted to try some sushi since it's one of our favorite foods.  This place was recommended by our hotel and it was near the Haight Ashbury neighborhood, which we wanted to walk through and check out. The restaurant wasn't packed, but we decided to sit at the bar anyway to watch the master chefs at work.  Service was pretty slow for a Wednesday night, so we were in there quite awhile just because it took a long time for the server to come back to us when we wanted to order more rounds. We paid a $ corking fee for our wine (yikes!) that we bought at a nearby liquor store.  I'm not even sure if they serve liquor here, but that was a pretty expensive bottle of wine overall considering we paid almost $ for it at the store.  Yeesh. The sushi was alright.  Not anything totally memorable in terms of quality or taste and the menu was pretty standard.  The menu had all of the things you'd expect at a sushi restaurant and some 'signature' items that were not noteworthy or sounded too weird to want to try.  All in all, I probably wouldn't go back, especially I lived in the city.  I'd definitely check out more options and chat with more locals to find a better sushi joint in San Fran.  This is more a nice spot for the people in the neighborhood who want a place close to home that they can walk to during the week. Grandeho's Kamekyo can do better. Service was alright. . . the server seemed way too busy for the amount of diners and brought the wrong order to us and had to be beckoned over by guests at the only other table. While the seaweed salad had a generous portion, it's price was a bit hefty as was the general menu. Ordered one roll which was mediocre and nigiri which was very nice. I wish it was a better experience so I could frequent more since it's in my neighborhood but likely not with so many awesome sushi spots out there. If I do head back, I'll stick with the nigiri/sashimi and a beer. Old dry fish. My instincts told me it was gonna be average, but I was really hoping for it to be better because it's the only japanese place in my hood.  Agreed with prior reviews that the menu is uninventive and prices are high for what you get.  I have a relatively bland palette (prefer not too spicy, not too salty) but my chicken udon was utterly flavorless.  It's such a shame because it's a nice cozy space in a convenient location.  Next time I'll venture to nearby inner sunset or inner richmond when I have my noodle soup and sushi cravings! Loyal neighborhood customer here!  I think I average sushi from Grandeho's twice a week.  The chefs and wait staff are always very friendly to me, and the sushi is good.  It seems a little pricey compared to other sushi joints nearby, but I'm willing to pay a bit more for the convenience, and to support my local businesses. Specialty rolls are always tasty, and their sweet, sweet wasabi sauce makes my mouth water, but I usually end up getting a few standard rolls and some sashimi.  Gyoza is also yummy! Kamekyo's comfort food hits the spot if you're craving Japanese cuisine and happen to be around the neighborhood, but I don't consider Kamekyo a ""destination restaurant"" because the food is not bad, but far from outstanding. On the other hand, the atmosphere is warm and quite family and kid friendly and it is not difficult to get a table here. The friendliness of Kamekyo's servers and chefs toward our baby was refreshing particularly after we had been told to leave neighboring Hama Ko after our baby ""yelped"" (as babies are prone to) once. Kamekyo takes its cuisine seriously, but apparently not as seriously as Hama Ko (which is most definitely not family friendly  make a peep above the median noise level and you will risk being reprimanded by Hama Ko's chef and his wife)."|4|88|4|Routine| Moderate risk vermin infestation  [ date violation corrected: 8/27/2013 ] Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils  [ date violation corrected: 8/27/2013 ] Foods not protected from contamination  [ date violation corrected: 8/27/2013 ] Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 8/27/2013 ]
Grandeho’s Kamekyo 3|3.5|Sushi Bars in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|184|3|3.36054421769|" I ate here recently and was not impressed.  I actually didn't feel good after eating lunch.  Will not be back. Pretty decent food but I just couldn't believe the prices. I mean. . the food was good, but simple. The prices definitely didn't match up. If I wanted to spend $ per item, I could go to many sushi spots in the city and have something that was way more delicious and way more creative. I had the bento box lunch special and I was pretty happy with the portion size. This seems to be the best value for your money. Also, their tempura is pretty delicious and well portioned too. However, if you come at night, the price is increased, so yeah. . don't do it. It's really too bad because if the price was a little bit lower, or the dishes more creative, I could easily see this being one of my regular spots! Saturday night, prime dinner time ~ after seeing the long waits at the other nearby establishments, my group of four sought refuge at Kamekyo from the pouring rain. This was a good place for a catch up ~ not too loud, a table was available, friendly service. I had the nasu dengaku (eggplant glazed with miso) and a mackerel roll. The sauce on the eggplant was too sweet for me, the mackerel was so so, a bit dry. The prices on the menu seemed expensive for what you get. Perhaps they have a high rent to pay? Substandard sushi for high prices. The rolls are meh. The agedashi tofu, I will say, was quite nice, but seriously, it's deep fried tofu  not complicated. Super fast and sweet service here! The tea and miso soup is spot on. The fish is so fresh and the owner is always working at the sushi bar. If you ask him to make you his favorite roll its spectacular and *spicy!! stars all the way from eyes to mouth to stomach. . . Walked in towards the end of lunch hour and it was completely empty.  This should have been a hint, though two other tables came in while we were dining. Expect to pay $$!  We came here because one of our dining companions wanted Japanese food and we had errands in Cole Valley.  However, I wasn't expect a  item lunch bento box to be $.   The items are good sized portions and it comes with rice, soup, salad, and fruit, but the salad was not really edible (mostly frisee served over slaw, no dressing).  The pork was over cooked and chewy, though the sesame chicken was moist and flavorful. We also ordered a roll, but it wasn't anything special. Having eaten Japanese food for most of this week elsewhere in SF, definitely disappointed, especially for the price.  Doubt I'll be back. + for service. Note: the donburi and noodle dishes at lunch are more on par with other places (around $ $) Had not had lunch with Gina in ages.  We want to address the mortgage meltdown and save the US economy.  But first, LUNCH.  Well parking wasn't much of a problem and guess who's at Grandeho's (Is this like Brandy Ho's on Columbus?  I love their house cured ham with whole garlic cloves!)  Sushi Chef ""Yo"" from ""Yo's Sushi Club"" formerly within the confines of ""The VooDoo Lounge,"" on th and Mission, then Yo's own place on th and Mission.  T'was not the greatest location but the YO's sushi and sashimi was   stars easily.  So that's my point with Grandeho's.  YO is there.  YO is a pretty traditional Japanese sushi chef.  I've seen some places where some of the ingredients are *questionable. *  You never have to worry about that with YO.  If it's not the best, if it's not fresh, YO WON'T SERVE IT.  I won't mention some of the behind the scenes experiences I have had with ""Non Yo's"" but suffice to say, eating raw seafood, you want a ""YO"" taking care of the food.  Gina and I had the sashimi and sushi combinations in the interests of expediency.  It's not easy solving all of the world's economic ills.  We're starting with the Bay Area and I'm serious about this.  With our combined acumen in banking, real estate, short sales, et al . . . but that's another story for another time.  Thai Amy wants to go have Vietnamese Chicken Noodle soup right now, so I have to wrap this up. Sushi and sashimi were quite good, YO threw in some other dishes that were also quite tasty, service was attentive but it's all about ""YO"" who I've known since his Dairmaru Sushi days up through now.  Good man. . Great sushi chef.  Think he's off on Sundays and Tuesdays.  Maybe I will expound further, later . . . now's time for some Turtle Tower. . . The sushi rolls were pricey considering the pieces fell apart as soon as the chopsticks touched it. The soy sauce ""had a strange taste,"" according to my friend. I dunno I was kind of dissatisfied. . . Especially because it was So expensive!! We were hoping it'd be our go to sushi place in the neighborhood.  Oh well. Reading the reviews I realized that this place didn't change. when I went there, the service was so bad that we gave a $ tip for a dinner of , the woman was standing in front of our table, keep taking our beer to check level after every sip, took the soy sauce away after the first sushi rolls: dinner was blend and service made it worst. Was sure of my rating when she tried to bullshit us (realizing that we were all European) saying that we need to pay some extra tax since we took some California rolls!! For a local cole valley neighborhood spot, this place is nice cause there's usually no wait and it has decent sushi. This place functions best as an outlet for people unable or unwilling to go around the corner to hama ko. . . . kinda like how people eat at bambino's when they are tired of waiting for zazziei really only go here when hama ko is closed or full and I feel super lazy i always crave japanese food and it was a no brainer to come here when i was on this  block stretch of shops and restaurants. it was the only japanese place. there were no customers at the time either so my girlfriend and i knew we would get some pretty fast service. i think much that needs to be said has been said here but ill say that their fried chicken (name of the dish escapes me right now dahh, was something generic though) is perfectly fried. ive never had japanese chicken so perfectly done. just enough crunch on the outside with enough meat to balance it out. it wasnt heavy either. the sauce was a little on the salty side though. very filling portions. my girlfriend had a bento box and everything in that box was well done and presented too. their salad dressing was good, tasted healthy but i think for some may need getting used to. it has a sort of bitter taste to it. not sure what it is but it was unique. the waitress said it was a mix of oranges, ginger and some other stuff. im a fan of it though. lots of ""uniqueness"" in this place again, their miso soup even tasted different from other places ive been. im not sure how to describe that one but it was a welcomed change. had also a dynamite roll which surprised me that it was cooked tuna instead of raw but was still good nevertheless and very well presented. good price for that roll too. price is on the heftier side but it is expected for this sort of neighborhood. very cozy restaurant. if you eat at lunch their knee height open windows that open to the street add to the dining experience. i have to come back here to try their other specialty rolls. I've lived around Cole Valley for  years and have probably dropped well over  grand eating, lounging and sipping their delicious fare throughout. The decor is traditional simple  a sentiment describing both the food and drink served here. A palette perfectly suited for enjoying the freshest cuts of sushi. The Hamachi, Tako and Uni are the best I've ever had and I've eaten at a lot of Sushi bars. If you love Crab, order the Spider Roll it's very meaty and decorative to boot. Your kids will love it here, and so will your parents when they drop in for a visit. Although they don't take reservations, the wait is never long. The visceral experience will have you marking this spot for another occasion. We loved the tempura shrimp sushi and the crab roll.  OMG!  Plus warm saki , I was in heaven.  I don't like raw fish, but what amazing alternatives they have.  I felt the prices were reasonable too. I've eaten at so many crappy sushi restaurants that get great reviews because they fry the hell out of their rolls or add gobs of mayo to them. Grandeho's in Cole Valley is not one of them.  They provided us with what we paid for: fresh, delicious sushi.  All of the fish we had was great.  The hamachi kama (cooked) is one of the most delicious fish dishes I've ever had. The bento box we shared was also tasty.  Tender white meat chicken teriyaki, crispy and flaky tempura, and mayo less Cali rolls. The miso soup was the best I've had, and the salad dressing is also fantastic. The service couldn't have been better. I'll be back soon! Cozy spot for sushi but at about $  for an unremarkable roll I will pass. This is one of those last resort places you go to for sushi because you didn't feel like getting on the N and heading over to th and Irving. I mean it's okay but not worth the money you're paying for it. Oh and avoid the teriyaki like the plague, watery teriyaki sauce n was just gross : / Love this place. This is QUALITY Sushi in thick cuts. We always have the Hamachi (incredible) and the dynamite roll. This place is a real asset to the neighborhood. We try to go at least once a month. Good for a late lunch. I've been a real negative Nellie and I feel this place deserves an update. I was really jonseing for some shushi the other night and it was raining hard and I found myself in front of Kamekyo's. A cold damp voice deep down said ""Stop being such a curmudgeon and give this place another chance""  so I did and I'm glad I did because it was a good solid experience for the price. I had a rainbow roll and it was fresh and tasty and the fish just melted in your mouth. I don't know if it's because of the weather or the holiday season, but the night I went it wasn't crowded and I really had a lovely relaxing time. I didn't feel any pressure to free up a table and the wait staff was courteous and attentive. The unsavory structural issues had been dealt with and the carpet was clean (for the record, I am still against carpet in a food establishment). Boo to the lady at the sushi bar trying to connect with the owner by asking ""I hope you guys don't actually eat cats. . . hahaha"" ahem. . . wow FOOD POISONING. Yes, my boyfriend and I both got food poisoning from eating here (and I got a yelp account for the sole purpose of warning the rest of SF). No sushi craving is ever worth trading in your health. In San Francisco visiting my sis and when it comes to food, sushi is a big overlap in terms of what we both find YUM. So off to Grandeho we went. Pretty unassuming looking place, cute and cozy but nothing special decor wise. I open the menu and woah! this place is pricey. But the service, at least, was top notch. They were over to take our orders in a flash and the food was out before we knew it. I had seared albacore, a side of miso soup, and a spinach roll. The miso soup was much better than the usual stuff you get  rich and flavorful, even hearty. It's like the difference between a house salad of iceberg lettuce and one that contains seasonal fresh greens. The albacore was really good but I was sad there were only two rolls. The spinach roll, however, did not disappoint either. Crunchy, fresh, TASTY and I'm not even a big veggie lover. My sister ordered a bento box, which she pronounced 'oh. my. delicous'I'd probably come back, but hopefully next time I'll have an expense account or something. Consistently good.  Kid friendly.  The hamachi sashimi is to die for. Not good.  Came here for a business lunch and was not impressed.  I am far from a sushi connoisseur, but I do know what fresh fish is supposed to taste like it, and this place's fish was not.  The maguro sashimi (one of my favorites) had no flavor, and didn't have the melty quality I'm used to.  Got a California roll in my Bento box, and it definitely tasted stale, but luckily not fishy.  Stale was the theme of the meal, and the rice followed suit.  And maybe I've gotten used to low sodium soy sauce, but their soy sauce was the saltiest I've ever had.  One star for the miso soup (but is it possible to even mess up miso soup?).  One star for me not vomiting like I thought I was going to. I'll be sure to avoid this place in the future. First, not a lot of choices here so if you want all the fishes of the sea then head somewhere else.  But, if you are not too picky and are ok with keeping the choices to a minimum I think this place is worth checking out if you are in the area. Not my favorite place for sure but because I live right around the corner it makes it hard to not frequent this place.  The fish is fresh but expensive and the wait staff is definitely friendly. Since I have moved I make here once a week and so far I have enjoyed myself.  If that changes I will make sure to let you know. . . . . We've eaten here a few times but always thought that the sky high bill was attributable to vast quantities of saki consumed during dinner.  I'm sure that was a large contributing factor for the high price but it wasn't until we ordered udon and a roll for take out that we realized how expensive this place was. For the money, you'd be better off at Eos or Hama Ko. I agree with Rachel B. , this place is just hands down gross. I was lured in because they had a nice table on the sidewalk and it was a rare, warm SF night. I glanced at the empty tables inside and decided not to risk ordering any raw fish, as I was worried that the fish might not be too fresh. I figured I would be safe if I ordered only cooked items. I ordered the beef sukiyaki and tempura, which was disgusting. The slices of beef tasted old  it had not been marinated and had been cooked to the point where it was both rubbery and powdery  I don't know how a restaurant can manage to do that simultaneously. There were some gross vegetables dumped on top  the carrots were so old they looked dried and had cracks in it, the green onions they put on top were wilty. I was so hungry I might have eaten it if it had been smothered in a tasty sauce, but even the sauce wasn't palatable. It's been a long time since I've gone someplace extremely hungry, ordered something with absolutely zero expectations as to how it might be (I've never ordered sukiyaki before), but geez, I think asking for something to be at least palatable isn't asking for much. My husband ordered the chicken teriyaki and it looked okay, lumps of chicken breast smothered in teriyaki sauce, but methinks $ bucks for dinner that looks like it came out of a cheap Chinese take out place is horrendous. If you want to go to a great Japanese place, head a few blocks over to Ebisu instead. Surprised by the other ratings, as my impression of this place is that it is simply way more expensive than it should be.  I should probably take off more stars for the priciness, but I'd say, aside from the oddly high prices, this place is an average Japanese restaurant.  Service was good, but we really couldn't figure out why everything cost so much. One novel thing on the menu is the Ume shiso roll, which has an intensely salty and sweet taste of preserved plum  not for the faint of heart.  Also, one roll we ordered had huge chunks of eel on top  probably more eel than you normally get on a roll (but I'd rather pay less and get the normal amount of eel). Our meal did not come with edamame or miso soup, which are each about $ pp extra.  I'll definitely miss the reasonable prices, free hot tea, edamame and great food at Hotaru in San Mateo. I'll have to keep looking for other sushi places in the area with more reasonable prices. I have been here a few times now and can say it's some of the freshest, highest quality sashimi I've had in the area. The sushi itself has always been perfectly cooked, always with great flavor. The miso is very good as well. The prices do vary greatly and it is overall probably a little more expensive than your average spot, but the quality and cuts of the fish are well above average and worth it. Also, there are some items that are very reasonable. I left today with spending *under*  dollars for lunch, which included a roll, miso and hot tea. Take a look at the back of the menu, not just the specialty items. There are a few things they could easily fix with the decor, such as taking down or replacing those faded posters, but I actually like the vibe. It has a very homey and mom & pop feel, which the staff exhibits as well. I'm not sure if it's run by a family, but it certainly feels like it. This place give you nice big pieces of fish at a good price.  Too bad I live so far away or I would visit here more often. Four star food at five star prices!The service is good and the chefs know their stuff. The fish is top notch  super good sashimi.  They do have some signature items, like a beef roll (cooked beef in place of nori! Neat!). Dragon roll, rainbow and other standard rolls are about average but cost about $ more than the same thing elsewhere. If this place were reasonably priced, I'd give it four or four and a half stars, but it's not. It's terribly overpriced. My husband had the winning quote: ""their prices should be based on the food, not the rent. "" We all need our own sushi spot. This is mine. While I may have had better quality or great ambiance at an expensive sushi place. . . if I could pick one place to go to forever, it would be here. This is why. Byron knows how to cut his nigiri. He doesn't cut it so thin a topping overpowers it. You get a nice slice of fish to savor the flavor. I stick to my basic favorite nigiris: hamachi, sake, butterfish, maguro and after that Byron throws on what he thinks matches my taste. The staff is awesome the ambiance is just plain nice sushi bar. I love to sit at the bar and watch them work their magic. Oh and always chase down your sushi with their mango mochi ice cream. Average and pricey. Lunch specials were around $ so I went ahead and ordered a couple nigiri and one roll. The fish didn't make my mouth scream with ecstasy kinda like drinking fizzless sparkling water yawn. It is down the street from UCSF and it offered something different than hospital food hence the  stars I hate to say it but this was probably one of the worst sushi places I've been to in a long time. I'm trying to come up with a redeeming quality. . . maybe the tea? It was good tea, and the miso soup is red miso which was a nice surprise. The toro piece was decent too but lacked any flavor. Sushi, or any food for that matter, has to start with fresh and quality ingredients. That's where this place first failed. When we got in my dates first comment was ""it smells like a fish tank in here. "" I chuckled but should have walked out at that moment. The salmon sashimi was tough on one side, as if cut poorly from the fish and not properly trimmed. The maguro had no flavor at all. The dynamite maki tasted as though tuna three days past expiration had been used and then turned into canned tuna left in the sun. The spicy hamachi was ok. Then came the last dish, the clay pot shrimps. I tasted the sauce and was thinking ""oh yay! Something to redeem this meal"" as it tasted like a decent sukiyaki sauce. Then I had a mushroom, still good. Then, unfortunately, I ate one of the shrimps. I couldn't bite through it. I had to pull at the shrimp to break the tail off. It was soggy and not ""I've been cooked too long soggy"" but ""I shouldn't have been cooked"" soggy. I'm pretty sure I don't have food poisoning, but while eating there, I seriously wondered if I would after the meal. De friggin licious meal here the other night.  I was alone and sat at the bar and asked the chef to be creative.  I ended up with some sashimi and a delicious, unique roll unlike anything I've ever ordered or seen on a menu elsewhere.  The fish was exceptionally fresh and melted in my mouth.  Miso is good too.  As a whole, it's on the pricier end of sushi joints (expect to pay $ to $ for a special roll), but it's a great little neighborhood spot where they remember the names of repeat customers. I docked one star because I've eaten here  times and one meal was lackluster.  I'm not particularly surprised by the variance of the reviews: it can be hit or miss sometimes. This is a decent restaurant. I would not hesitate to eat here, if I were in the neighborhood. But I would not make a special trip. It's an casual, simple Japanese restaurant with the quality of raw fish you'd expect at this price point. this place has The Best hamachi in town,I mean melt in your mouth buttery decadent hamachi. . Other things I really dig: their tsukemono has pickled garlic cloves!Their ahi sashimi is very fresh, & the chicken teriyaki is divine. A bit on the pricy side, but consistently good quality This is my favorite sushi restaurant in San Francisco.  The sushi is always very fresh and delicious.  My friends and I return to this restaurant whenever we get a chance.    Buy some beer and offer some to the chefs behind the counter.  I've always had a fun time at this restaurant.  The chefs always manage to add a few of their non menu creations onto my plate.  I always recommend this place to friends who are iffy about trying sushi.  They always walk away as big fans of sushi. The Shrimp Tempura Rainbow Roll is da bomb!The Good:  The sushi is good all around.  Not the absolute best in any one area, but a solid performer in all.  The staff is friendly and remembers my special requests. The Bad:  It might lean a bit to the pricey side, but not bad for the quality.  The Shrimp Tempura Rainbow is like $, but worth it. The Ugly:  I got nothing for this place.  It's just a solid place. I thought that this place was pretty decent for a neighborhood japanese restaurant. They have the regular variety of sushi, sashimi, rolls and cooked items that most other places offer. I do have to say that there was nothing notable about the fish. I ordered the bento box with the saba shioyaki, sashimi, rice, etc and a friend of mine got her bento box with salmon teriyaki and tempura. Everything tasted fine but nothing that particularly blew us away. It's good but I wouldn't got out of my way or cross town to come eat here. This is the best sushi I've had outside Japan, and with the exception of one place in Osaka, the best sushi I've ever had. The fish is unfathomably fresh and the rice is super flavorful. The trick is to sit at the bar and ask them to just make you dinner. There's all sorts of incredible fish not on the menu, so you can get Walu and a whole hoard of other amazing delectables. The only problem is now it's tough to go anywhere else! This review is only for the udon. I did not personally try the sushi, but I was with friends who had been there before and they were disappointed with their food that night as well. I had an order of tempura which was good. It was good but not a standout. In addition I had the vegetable udon. It was only okay. I was thrown off because the broth was slightly sweet which I was not expecting. I think it would have been better had the broth been more savory. It also wasn't too cheap. I don't know that I'll be back. My date and I got the worst food poisoning from this restaurant of our lives. I won't even tell you the details. I will say that we were disappointed with most of the food at the time we ate it. . . and even more so when it came back up. We especially didn't care for the abalone sashimi, the florescent lights which now line the sushi bar (I understand the concept of saving energy but get dimmers, ok? The last thing I want my date to examine is my pores) and the lack of recommendations from the sushi chefs (we asked for their best roll and they actually all said to order the California roll. Are you kidding me? That's really the best you can do?). I will never go back. Ever. The best was when we asked the waitress about the lighting by the bar and she recommended another local restaurant! We should have taken her advice. Was seriously starved and thought I'd just dash in to pick up a couple of rolls to go. Shrimp tempura roll: succulent shrimp, tempura wasn't as crisp as I would have liked (but it's to go so could be my fault for the  blocks I walked home), sauce divine and perfectly proportioned amount.  Fresh sprouts and cucumber rounded out the  rolls. Hamachi vegetable delight roll: incredibly fresh fish with pearls of tobiko, sprouts and lettuce (I don't do avocado but that's supposed to be in here).  Larger rolls but only  to an order. Why only a  star review then?  Because those ten rolls, though super fresh, set me back $. .  I'll save this place for when my palate is more discerning and my wallet isn't flat broke from  days of celebrations. My husband and I went to Kamekyo's for dinner tonight and loved it! Great fast and friendly service. Warm and clean atmosphere and amazing sushi. We had one order of miso soup, edamame, and  different rolls for a grand total of $! We sat at the bar which we would definitely recommend since the sushi chefs are so talented and nice. It was our first time eating there and we went there for lunch. Wanted Japanese food, me and two other friends went inside. The lady whom I believed the owner gave us a dinner menu with everything about three to four dollars more. She hesitated when being confronted the reason that a dinner menu was presented. We insisted to have the lunch menu because it was lunch. Not expressing herself well, we did not have a clue what she was trying to explain. . . maybe she was trying to make up stuff like they don't serve the lunch menu on a Sunday's brunch time? Bad taste if that's the case. $ for a rainbow roll and as my friend said I should make sure I lick the plate. Sounded ""unclassy"" but the portion was small and fishes tasted like water. We ordered three small rolls and one special roll and the total came out of $. The lady asked if everything was okay whilst presenting the check and I recommended very nicely that with their pricing, they should make sure that the food portion was big. She was offended by telling me that they have been in the business for THIRTEEN years which, to be frank, I was speechless and to tell you that it was just my personal opinion. So we went on Yelp on our way back to the car, and only to find out that they just recently acquired that restaurant which HAD very good reputation and basically I think they had ruined it. MY suggestion to them is that if they don't know Yelp or any social media which are how people review businesses nowadays, go online and read their reviews. It is critical to accept comments when the business is still new. Don't lie to people that you have been in the business for  years because you have not, the previous owner who did a fantastic job on the place did. If you cannot live up to the original name of this restaurant, consider yourself changing the name. Everything else in the neighborhood is awesome, have yourself a face lift to match the area please. Wow, what a tragedy. Things change. This place used to serve giant fresh slabs of fish on fluffy rice. Tonight, the fish in my tuna roll was defrosted mush. This was the first time in my life I have ever left sushi on my plate uneaten. The rice was clumped and stale. The rest of the fish was just okay and I guess the huge chunks of wasabi were trying to mask the taste of the old fish. If all that wasn't enough, their prices are still on the high end. I miss the staff of yesteryear too. This place has lost its charm. I hate to dis a restaurant in my neighborhood, but with so many great sushi places in town, it seems this one is ready to sail off into the sunset. My condolences. Instead: Try Koo on Irving. Sushi Bistro is an interesting alternative too. new ownership.  not worth your time.  if you live in cole valley or are completely desparate then go for it.  but not a destination and i won't be returning. Expensive and poor quality. Fish was not fresh. Poor service. Will not be returning. In May , the previous owners of Grandeho Kamekyo sold the place to sushi chef Byron who has worked at the restaurant forever (at least as long as we have been coming to this restaurant over  years ago!).  The restaurant is now called Kamekyo and head chef Yoko san no longer works here.  Along with Yoko san's departure, his delicious sauces also left the house.  But. . . lucky for us, new owner and head chef Byron is also an awesome chef.  Last night, we returned for our first meal after Yoko san's departure and Byron impressed us with his culinary skills.  We took our usual seats at the sushi bar and left ordering to the head chef.  The different sushi and rolls Byron made for us were just absolutely beautiful and very tasty. (I've posted photos of some of our dishes last night with this posting so you can see for yourself how beautiful they were!) Flavors of different fish and ingredients used worked well together, and his style was intricate. Byron also introduced new fish to the restaurant (e. g. Escolar/Walu).   When you visit Kamekyo, let Byron know the types of fish you like, flavors you enjoy, and he'll make something tailored to your taste. I went here on Monday night before gong out with my boyfriend and friend.  We were really excited to hit a sushi joint that was not closed at pm. It smelled a little fishy, but I was not ready to judge.  First mistake: I wanted to order a roll that was on he menu, but add spicy tuna and tobiko. The lady did not seem to understand what I was trying to ask for, and made it sound WAY more complicated than I was wanting it to be. Second Mistake: She offered a roll that was neither on the menu nor on the specials menu board. Because it seemed that all the rolls were around or under $, I did not bat an eyelash at her suggestion. After all, it was another fairly simple roll (A er roll). Third Mistake: I asked for low sodium soy sauce. I prefer it because the less salt means the flavor of the fish is not over powered by the salty regular soy sauce.  She brought me regular, and even my company agreed it was NOT low sodium. What if i were not able to consume high amounts of sodium do to medication or health reasons? Fourth mistake: When the bill was brought to us, we had already stated at the beginning of our meal that we would need to split it (only in two bills), and she did not. When we looked at the bill, she had charged us $.  for the er roll!! Never have I paid that much for such a simple roll at a place that averaged $ for a roll!!Fifth Mistake: She refused to put less than $ on a credit card, when clearly you walk in the doors, and there are TWO huge stickers on the door stating they take Visa and MasterCard, with NO ""minimum limit"" anywhere!! Not even on the menu as far as I can tell.  So we have to fish out our last cash (which we needed to get into the club), and could not leave a tip. While the fish was fresh, it was not enough for me to say anything nice about this place!!  There are far better places to spend your money on sushi in SF!!  Dont give these guys your biz! Service has drastically improved. And the sushi is large and fresh. I can now upvote this place to a  star. So it's a good place. I've been there two times already and it always pleases me with yummy food. BUT is absolutely overpriced if it wasn't for the service, i'd give it just one star, but the waitress was so nice i added a star just for her. the sushi here isn't bad, but it isn't good either and way overpriced! i went to eat by myself for lunch, really? $ for one person for lunch? all i had was  pieces of sashimi,  uni nigiri, and a dragon roll and coke. yes, the pieces and the rolls were huge, but only because of the rice. they the quantity over quality trick here to make you feel full so don't be fooled. i don't mind paying high prices for sushi if the quality is there, but these prices were ridiculous! there is far better out there for cheaper prices! there's a KiKi on th and irving that has the same quality sushi but  times cheaper! and they offer coupons! needless to say i won't be going back! it's a rip off! with so many yummy sushi places in the city, why pay outrageous prices for sushi that's just ""eh. "" I think the sushi here is good. Not blow me out of the water good, but good. However, it's super pricey. Yes, I expect sushi to be expensive, but this place seems over the top. Maybe it's because it's one of the only sushi places in the 'hood. First of all we love Grandeho's. Don't worry though. They aren't closing. When I saw Emily's review, I immediately ordered some sushi to go and went down to pick it up and find out what was going on. Apparently the building changed owners and they have to put a sign in the window to that effect. Nothing is changing except I guess where they send their rent check:) Go fast and go often, Grandeho's as we know it will be closing next month.  This is the very BEST sushi in the city.  It's the best sushi I've ever eaten.  Epic, gorgeous, perfect.  I am so very sad that we'll soon have to eat elsewhere. ok. here's the thing.  really, i want to write two reviews  one for dining at a table and one for dining at the bar; however i will save you the time and eye muscle movement and tell you to never ever ever do anything except sit at the sushi bar. came in for a casual friday night dinner before heading out last weekend and, of course, sat at the sushi bar.  we asked the sushi man (adorable btw) what was good that night and he suggested the lightly seared tuna and salmon.  The tuna was UH MAH ZING!  Simply delicious, served on rice with a bit of scallion and what looked like diced lemon and ginger in a little dollop on top of the fish. there was also a light ponzu like sauce.  it was amazing and we ended up ordering two more pieces of it!  The salmon was perfect, melted in my mouth and we also got  piece of hamachi  just delicious, fresh, not fishy at all. we had two rolls at all and i'm a little embarassed to say that i dont quite remember what they were because the sashimi was just so good!sushi and sushi bar aside, i do like to grab the beef udon soup/noodle thing when i'm feeling a little under the weather.  It's flavorful, has tons of broth, noodles and veggies and at $ provides  hearty meals. huge sushi doesn't necessarily mean it tastes great. had lunch there & i was amazed that they would serve sushi on cold, undercooked (or was it just old?) rice. yes, they were huge, but not tasty. and the tempura was standard bad, thick batter, not crispy. but it's hard to find good tempura. i would not go again. I absolutely love this place.  Its close, they are fantastically friendly, the service is really good and the fish is truly excellent.  Sitting at the bar makes a difference and Yoko is nothing but personality and talent with a knife.  Alas Yoko has retired, but Byron aint bad either. unlike most of these reviewers, I've eaten at Grandeho's at least  times in the last year and a half and I have yet to have a bad experience there. Consistency is hard for most restaurants, let alone places that rely on fresh raw fish for their menu, and this place has not let me down once. The place is a bit cramped, I'll admit that. They do try to squeeze one or two more tables than is comfortable for the average american person such as myself. As for the menu, the kani is amazing, as is the maguro and the hamachi. Their miso soup is always perfect, never too salty or too soyish. I recommend the tempura shrimp handroll, which is not on the menu, but is usually on the specials board, and even if it isn't, they will still make it for you. nice setup with the sushi bar in the middle.  i sat at the bar and ate, after a long wait. it was good, not outstanding, but service was excellent.  (sh there's a better sushi place just around the corner) Update //:  I find myself eating at Grandeho's more frequently than that first review would suggest. The service is all you could want and the food is good. Its an all around middle of the road experience. I can't give  stars to a restaurant that charges $.  for edamame. Edamame should be complimentary, or $. The service was wonderful, and the sushi was lovely. Fresh and wonderful. The miso soup is some of the best around. A little pricey. . . Nigiri was $.  for  pieces. Total bill for  $ plus tip. Got some sushi to go. California Roll (boring, I know) and Spicy Tuna for the carnivore and Shitake Roll and Tempura Veg Roll for the herbivore. The Shitake Roll was, I grant, fairly inventive and, for us lovers of fungus, nice to see on the menu. Not fabulous, but not bad. Same for the Veggie Tempura Roll. California Roll was reported to have real crab, which, I guess, is not always the case, but the real deal here. The Spicy Tuna was said to have a slightly different spiciness/flavor than the many, many Spicy Tuna Rolls devoured by the resident carnivore at other sushi places. Again, though, not really amazing. In other words, it is simply good sushi. Now, that probably doesn't play well for most, and, honestly, I would not go out of my way to get sushi here. The rolls were rather small in my experience and for their size, a tad on the pricey side. It happens to be convenient and consistent. The staff, both on the telephone and in person, were very, very friendly and our order was ready on time and nothing was missed. You hate to walk blocks home and find they forgot your seaweed salad (which, by the way, was quite tasty). The story starts with my co worker/friend Mike mentioning the word ""sushi. "" After that, our minds were made up! We are going to get sushi across the street right after work. Everything just hit the spot. We ordered:Cali RollSpicy Tuna RollShrimp Tempura RollRainbow RollPhilly RollWe sat at the sushi bar. Space was a little tight, but that didn't matter. . . I was hungry! The sushi was good, everything I expected. I rate it  stars mainly because of the service given to us. The sushi chef (who was worked there for  years, wow!) was comedic. He kept us laughing while serving tasty food. The fish tasted fresh. Yum!star knocked off for space and price. High quality sushi and Japanese food. Fresh ingredients and great service. My fiancee and I usually go here to treat ourselves, because it's a  cozy local restaurant that always delivers perfect dishes. The only issue we have with this restaurant is it's pretty high priced. However, it's definitely worth it if you're a fan of sushi. Best Sushi in S. F. !! I lived in Cole Valley for  years before moving to the Mission.  I ate at Grandeho's more times than I can count so I've got years of experience with them.  Overall I'd say the sushi was above average and most of the time borderline great.  It is kinda small and always busy and the staff always tries to be pleasant and fast if you're not known.  If you are a local however and go as often as I did then they consider you a friend and are able to open up a be a little friendlier.  It doesn't mean you have to be local to get good service, but in a place with this much traffic they're happy to see a familiar face.  They're also the kind of place that would scold me if I would go a month or two without coming in.  For being small though the place is warm and friendly and nicely decorated.  Its a great environment for eating sushi with friends or sitting at the bar and having the chef's test out creations on you. Like has been mentioned before this isn't necessarily a place to make a crosstown trek for because there are plenty of good neighborhood sushi joints, but if you want something consistently good food and fun staff to banter with for a weekly sushi excursion then this is definitely a great place for that. Very good sushi, but I hate the service here.  I came once at : pm on a Tuesday and asked for a table for two.  There was an empty table for four, but I was told that since there were only two of us we had to wait.   minutes later (and starving  its was : pm) we were finally seated.   minutes later a group of  assho. . . err. . . I mean. . . people came in and were seated at the precious table.  While I sort of understand the whole efficiency aspect of it all, it was late on a weeknight and I likely would have been done eating by the time the larger group came (did I mention I eat sushi faster than I drink water?).  Also another large table opened up shortly after the table for  came in.  This happened over a year ago and I still want to go on a wild rampage of revenge.  I imagine it beginning with me cutting the heart out of the hostess and then feeding it to her in a handroll on her precious, precious table.  I then address the remaining staff as follows: ""As your customer, I encourage you from time to time, and always in a respectful manner, to question my logic. If you're unconvinced that a particular plan of action I've decided is the wisest, tell me so, but allow me to convince you and I promise you right here and now, no subject will ever be taboo. Except, of course, the subject that was just under discussion. The price you pay for not seating me in a timely fashion is. . . I collect your fucking heart. Just like this fucker here. Now, if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!""Of maybe I just won't go for a while.  Yeah, that'll show em! Sushi was really good, but nothing blew me away except for the toro, which was absolutely fantastic (with a price to match), and the specialty dragon roll.  It's the type of place I would frequent if I lived nearby, but I doubt I'd cross the city to go there.  The salmon was pretty weak though, but I don't think I've ever came across good salmon in SF. Arrived on a Sunday night at pm with a party of two.  We took seats at the sushi bar, and were instantly up sold on two bowls of miso.  Well played, hostess. Sushi was quite solid, but nothing spectacular.  Highlights included the scallops, the tuna delight (packed in with some great herbs), and lows included the dynamite roll (yes, yes, I'm a white guy ordering sushi.  What'd you expect, me to write about the sea urchiin?) and the relatively plain salmon. I haven't tried sushi yet at the polarizing Hama Ko down the street, but I could see myself coming back to this place if there was no crowd and I had a serious fish craving. This place is a great place to go if your in the area.  The sushi is very fresh and well made.  The place is clean!  I have had some great saki bombing times here and also some quick bites.  I highly reccomend it. A friend once told me that it was one of his favorite sushi spots in SF so my girlfriend and I decided to check it out on a Thursday night.  It was a little late (probably around pm) but we easily slipped right in at the sushi bar.  The rolls aren't the craziest combinations in the world but they're AMAZING.  The spicy tuna wasn't mired in a sticky mayo mess. . . it was very clean and tasty.  The hamachi delight was also a real treat but the rainbow roll took the cake.  Surprisingly for me, we really fell in love with the nigiri.  Whereas most sushi joints give you a small, wafer thin slice of fish, these guys used big, fat, fresh slices. On top of the fish, the service was great. . . the chefs were extremely nice and were more than happy to share a beer on our behalf, and the hostess joked with us all night like we'd been in there a thousand times. If I could give this place  stars, I would.  It was a bit pricey but you pay for what you get.  The food was great and the atmosphere and service made us feel like family.  Probably one of the best sushi experiences I've had in the city. Honestly didn't have the best service  forgot about our drink order. But I gotta admit the chirashi and agadashi tofu was very very good. Some of the best tofu I've had in SF. Despite it being amazing food, I still feel it is a bit overpriced simply due to the fact it is in Cole Valley. I think there are definitely better values out there. (price example: $ for a salmon skin roll, $ for ama ebi  really?) Just moved here from Sacramento, where of all places, we had a fantastic little sushi bar where the owner knew our names, and we could watch him fillet fish in front of us (see Kru). We had no hopes for replacing that feeling, until we came here. . . Yoko is awesome. The sushi I had tonight was buttery and delicious. The hamachi melted in my mouth and was in huge, beautiful pieces. We had been in once and were remembered and treated extraordinarily well. The prices were high, but the quantity was on par with the price, so I had no problem with that. Found a little neighborhood hangout, and I'm very excited about it. The sushi is ok. . My first time ordering sushi at this place it was decent. Second time the salmon was fishy. . you know what this means  not fresh. When trying to order via phone the front desk woman is super rude. Not sure why when their sushi is below average and super expensive. You would think she would be gushing with kindness. Never spending a dime at this place again. Certainly one of the better sushi restaurants in SF. Quality fish and a nice selection of out of the ordinary options. The main reason I go here is the Dynamite Roll. I've seen items with the same name in other sushi places, but this one is unique, and delicious. The staples are also quite good, particularly the tuna and yellowtail. I also typically order this grilled hamachi dish (I'm blanking on the name). Service is excellent  extremely friendly waitress who I have come to know over the years. Atmosphere is pleasant but nothing to go wild about. Biggest downside is the price, which makes it a once in a while type place. Definitely the best in Cole Valley, on par with the best in the city. For the quality of the fish (definitely not good), prices were high ( rolls,  nigiri,  soup and a beer were $).  The service was fine, but the atmosphere is utterly generic and I just wasn't impressed by anything I ate. Hama Ko was closed (Monday), so I thought I would give this place a shot, but next time I want sushi on a Monday, I will trek out of the neighborhood or wait until Tuesday. i love this place!the wait staff, the chefs, the food, the ambiance, the prices  genius!!staff: friendly and efficient, remembers your order and delivers within a reasonable amount of time. by the third time i went there, the waitress remembered my drink and dessert. chefs: knowledgeable and approachable, essential for a sushi chef. food: delicious, fresh, great cuts. ambiance: intimate without being intimidating (you can speak at a normal volume and not be self conscious); casual and relaxed. prices: you get what you pay for, which is very quality fish. go there. now. Pros: Delicious Rock 'N Roll.  I ordered it and everyone at the table couldn't get enough of it.   The staff is pretty funny.  They joke around with you, especially if you are a regular and the chefs are cool as well.   Simply put, everyone I dined with was satisfied and hoped to come back soon Cons: A bit pricey.   Not the most authentic necessarily, but we were really happy with our meal.  I'm glad I live in the neighborhood and get get yummy Unagi or Yellowtail whenever I want! Once again an original and the first, also in Cole Valley. Excellent Sushi, chefs are always down to take a SAKI shot with you. If ur a regular like I am, the chefs hook u up with their own specials that they come up with as they go. I love the Maguro, Unagi, Roe and Rock n Roll. . . . Place gets packed on weekend nights, so come early evening to catch a seat at the bar. The food is excellent but pricey, but then again this is Sushi and this is Cole Valley. Good quality fish, fresh food, pretty tasty. My dashi for my tempura udon could have been more flavorful, but mostly everything was good. The prices are a touch steep, but it's Cole valley. I feel bad giving them three stars because there are some places I enjoy much more that I have also rated  stars, so they are more like a . . I have only ordered take out, so I cannot comment on service, although they do tend to be rude when I come to pick up the food. I don't think they are rude universally, however, because I see them treating regular customers very well. I can accept that they are nicer to regular patrons, but I do wish they could be a bit more friendly since I pay a lot for their food too. I am not a sushi aficianado, so my comments don't apply to the quality of the fish. But, the food is generally ok and the sushi rolls and ahi sashimi serve as good stand ins, although not remarkable in my mind. I was surprised by their high zagat ratings, so someone must like this place a lot. It is not me. I certainly would not travel to cole valley to eat here. My tip is to ask for the miso dressing on your salad. It is much better than their standard orange dressing I did takeout, so I can't comment much on the service, though the decor was uninspired. I went with the veggie roll, and it was one of the more inventive versions I've ever had. The pieces were stuffed with veggies, so much so that each piece was a two bite minimum. That helped me get over the fact that there were only four pieces. The rest of the menu seemed standard, and pricing was neither cheap nor ridiculous. A standard option if you are craving sushi in cole valley. Seems like we either love it or hate it. Hmm.  Well, I came from cena last night at Grandeho's a happy and loving customer. The service, the neighborhood friendly ness, the fresh and clean flavors of the hamachi, spider roll, and other nigiri were lovely. As most (discerning) yelpers will know your memory of dinner often corresponds with your experience of dinner. Were you alone? On a date? In an atmosphere you are familiar with? Did you fight with your partner? Did you go home and get dirty? That's part of the beauty of food and eating. Your experiences mingle into a single imagined memory of what you consider your entire dining experience. I wax only because this meal was at the end of a beautiful (almost magical) day, and I was craving amazing hamachi and was rewarded with lovely food, service, and company. I'd go back. After paying the prices here, you will feel like someone's ho. . . So I found this to be a rather average sushi restaurant.  It has some novelty in that it's small and intimate and if you live in Cole Valley you don't have to leave the neighborhood for a decent sushi dinner.  Probably a good date spot if you're really intent on not leaving Cole Valley. The biggest problem is probably the prices.  Don't get me wrong, I don't mind paying for stuff, I just don't like paying more for something that could be had elsewhere for less.  I ordered the Chirashi, which came in at about $.  It was a *little* bigger than your average Chirashi order but nothing too special.  Yes, it was fresh and tasty but nothing spectacular.  Standard sushi (i. e.  pieces) is probably $.   $ more expensive than most other places. Which brings to light the menu.  It's decent but it doesn't seem to have some of the options other places have.  After perusing the menu for awhile, my dining partner this night asked ""Dude, where's all the crazy rolls and stuff?""  which is to say, you'll find your regular suspects but nothing too original on the roll side of things. This place is probably a  or .  as I will likely not be back unless there's a birthday or something, but this place does deserve respect for the excellent service.  The woman who was the hostess was very affable and funny.  The way she greeted and spoke to me made it feel like I had been a regular for sometime.  There were also a good amount of ""minions"" running around to refill my water glass. Too expensive of a restaurant to have the staff give you the bum rush. I ordered pretty standard fare (two avo maki, an ume cucumber maki, some edamame) my companion ordered some sashimi. I wanted to order some agedashi tofu and after a little back and forth (I wanted to check if there was any fish/fish oil/bonito chunks the size of my fist that come standard) we found out it wasn't vegan and skipped it. That's fine, my specific diet having ass is plenty stoked on an avo roll and I'll eat your kid's stroller if it has ume on it. Two super simple veggie rolls, one edamame, an order of sashimi. We drank water. Our bill? $ (plus tip). I literally did a double take, thinking that we got the wrong bill. I'm no dope  I know that sashimi is expensive, but I normally don't check the prices like a hawk in casualish restaurants like this. I'm also not a cheapskate  I love living beyond my means and eating a good meal that costs me a lot. However, this was not that meal. The quality of the sashimi (according to my non vegan companion) was ""ok"". He didn't order anything special like Toro from The Land Before Time nor did my rolls cause my mind to melt with their amazingness. It is the first time I have felt like I should have been paying better attention to the menu prices though, which is too bad because based on the service (not terrible but not positive) and atmosphere I would have gauged that as a $ meal for two. Maybe that's my hint that I don't belong in Cole Valley? Point taken. The fish and the fish selection is exemplary.  The decor is also impeccable  very clean and at the same time modern/traditional. I got a lunch order, and I was immediately blown away by how expensive this place is.  $.  for an order of Amaebi?!  That better be alive and the size of a lobster for $. .  I ended up getting hamachi, hirame, aji, and hotate nigiri and a gari saba roll (saba, ginger, onion).  All of it was very tasty and good, but I felt a bit ripped off paying $ for that.  $ would probably be more reasonable.  But whatever. . . I should come back and try eating at the sushi bar. Pic of my foodz: yelp. com/biz_photos/fV F… edit //:I've been back several times, but now I've taken to asking them to give me $ worth of nigiri.  That seems to be a much better deal, as I get about  pieces of big cuts of premium fish. I am beginning to become convinced that the lower ratings on this restaurant are actually part of a complicated conspiracy to keep everyone from across town away. I hate to spoil the fun but I can't hide my feelings any longer. My boyfriend and I go here somewhat regularly (coming all the way from the Mission) and rate the quality of the fish as: delicious. We only ever get nigiri so I can't speak for the quality of other things on the menu but, regardless, I have only ever had excellent experiences here. The service is always friendly and quick and the fish is always fresh (dare I say, melt in your mouth). I highly recommend the hotategei. Surely monkfish liver pate is not Americanized sushi.  Neither is Ama Ebi (sweet water shrimp), which comes with the shrimp head and legs deep fried in batter, a delicacy most Americans wouldn't dream of eating.  Neither is tobiko (flying fish roe) with a raw quail egg yoke on top  one of my favorites.  Neither is hotate  giant scallop, by far the best way to eat ANY scallop.  And neither is, best of all, toro  translated varyingly as tuna belly or fatty tuna  the sort of description that would turn off the uninitiated American.  If he/she only knew. . . The people who have given this place a star or two must be talking about another restaurant.  I keep coming back here precisely because of the variety they have  rare among sushi restaurants even in SF.  I order all of the above every time, and have always had a blissful experience here. I've never ever once had a problem with the service, and judging from the number they invariably have waiting for a table, neither have most other patrons.  On the contrary, they've always been extremely friendly, have always had a smile, and have never dropped the ball. In short, this place is so good I have a hard time stopping myself at the ""full"" stage and invariably walk out of there positively stuffed, and perfectly happy.  I only wish they had more room so I wouldn't have to wait for a table. Extremely disappointing!  In San Francisco, anywhere is better than this place. Mediocre sushi that's overpriced. . .  This place is so unremarkable that I almost passed out in my miso soup. . . There are better places all over the city. . .  go somewhere else. . . Why does the rice taste so overpowering?  Why is there so much of it?  Why don't I like this place more considering that it's right down the street? One of my father's favorite sayings is: ""I'd never work for Disneyland because then it'll never be fun again. "" Likewise, I don't often feel the need to publicize my local culinary affinities, and risk possibly over crowding them. There are exceptions, however; especially when refuting the crowd that has turned my beloved home's Marina district into an intellectual ghost town. If you cab'd it over from anywhere north (and inclusive of) the new made up neighborhood 'Nopa', then just rest assured that even the worst review you're possible of crafting, using the synonym finder in MS Word, is considered even less trustworthy than when the president speaks. If your idea of evening attire involves jeans that purposely have holes in them, I'm going to go out on a limb and say you probably know very little about what makes a good neighborhood restaurant, let alone a good sushi bar. Grandeho's food is fantastic. The sushi served holds its own against any other I've yet eaten. Not only have I never been sorry for spending the evening with the kind folks working there, I've recommended it to friends or family only to positive reviews and thanks. No, it's not the least expensive; but what worthwhile sushi is? Yes, there are only a few tables available, but I've never found the service to be lacking or even slow. I'm not a class warrior and don't try to hide our neighborhood's fantastic dining options. I don't even think all of the poor reviews are without merit; perhaps Grandeho's has had a night off, here or there. In my many visits I've never been let down but, considering that very little is outside the realm of possibility, it could have happened occasionally. I would suggest, however, that if you've received poor service, is it not also possible that you're just a crappy customer? This isn't the UN of dining; if you're an ugly American, you're probably going to get attitude while abroad.  Why should it be any different at home? This is not so much a review of Grandeho as it is a commentary on the people who gave this restaurant a review of one or two stars. I just want to say thank you! I will resist calling you a bunch of chumps but instead express my gratitude for misrepresenting this place, For while you are quite entitled to your opinion, it just means more sushi for  me. I have patronized this place ever since it opened and am a loyal customer. Yes, they know my name and I do get favored treatment. Yes I buy the chefs beer and occasionally get special treats. For those of you who berate the sushi, well I have never ever had a bad piece of sushi (and it is as good as Tsujiki) and for you who have had bad service, please take your attitude back to the marina where it belongs.   So once again my gratitude. Grandeho will continue to succeed because it is a great neighborhood sushi bar I wouldn't say it''s cheap for it's SERVICE. . . . yes folks. . . I still believe in good service in restaurants. . . . every time I go there I feel like I am rushed with my dinner. . . . gone there oh about whole  times. . . . . every couple of months. . . . I guess I forget how shitty the stuff is. . . . it feels like a ""to go"" environment somewhere in tenderloin, not to mention being bumped into without any considiration every time the waitres was bringing the food to the other table. . . . there's no "" would you like some water"" there's no "" thank you"", just a cold feeling of ""eat your god damned food, pay us and leave"". . . . . that's how it felt. . . . oh. . . their interior decoration is nice, and the food isn't bad. . . Went late on a weeknight, but the fish was still fresh and tasty, and they didn't try to rush us out the door, which was nice. My only complaint is that they wasabi'd some sushi which they didn't mention in the menu, and thus was very surprising to my tastebuds upon eating it. everytime i walk by this place, i keep telling myself, i'll try it next time.  and finally, i come for a quick bite to eat and it's one of those restaurants that you go to but you move on to try some place else.  it's rather disappointing.  the miso soup was like no miso soup i've ever tasted.  some restaurants make it too salty; some make it with the the puffy tofu and some leave out the seaweed/green onions, but here it's a little sweet.  @#*huh?  i love shuga but not in my miso soup please.  although my sashimi lunch special portion was good, the  tuna fish was not as fresh as i would like, and the white fish had a really strong fishy smell.  and for the first time ever, i was unable to finish  pieces of sashimi and i only finished half of my shitake mushroom roll (which was alright but i've definitely had better).  my stomache wasn't too happy.  to be honest, the only thing that was good was the green tea.  with so many great sushi places i have yet to explore, i probably won't be back here anytime soon. I hate to say this, but this place is pretty terrible. It's right in my neighborhood, so I really want to like it. The first time I went, it was terrible. I went a second time with my boyfriend, hoping it would be better and it was even worse. Sitting near the back, we had a perfect view of the people in the kitchen spraying and scrubbing fish pieces off the floor, and it smelled very strongly of bleach. Made me lose my appetite.  : (The fish was not at all fresh, and one piece of nigiri I had was actually going bad and I couldn't finish it. The green tea was really just hot water, the crab in the California roll was really dry and shredded and did not taste fresh  pretty gross. The seaweed salad was FROZEN when we got it. Very disappointing. We could hardly wait to leave. When we finally got the check, it came with two butter mints wrapped in American flag printed cellophane. But the wrappers were already opened on one side, and there was dirt  and lint in them. Like some old grandma took them out of her purse after  years. Talk about adding insult to injury. If you want good sushi, go anywhere else in the city. This place is an utter waste of money. Not much to recommend about this Grandeho's.  The first time I ate there it was passable if not memorable.  A recent trip yielded more memorable food, but not in the way that any restaurant wants to be remembered.  The rice was warm and had a very off taste to it, and the fish had an unacceptable temperature because of the temperature of the rice.  The miso soup was just sort of ""meh"", and the service was slow.  We spent more than a few minutes being pointedly ignored despite trying to politely order more food in a vain attempt to get something tasty that night. I would have given them a third chance to score a run, but the other reviews here seem to confirm my suspicions, so I think I'll pass. It was a bit late, but the place was mostly full, and when we walked in we asked if they were still serving. We were assured that they were and were ushered to a table. So we were a bit surprised when the hostess started very efficiently removing unused things from our table before we were finished eating, and grabbing the soy sauce to refill it. We felt rushed and it kind of spoiled the meal. The sushi was fresh. But it wasn't special. If I want food without service I can save my cash and stay home, or go to the drive through. Reading through previous reviews which seem pretty much a mix bag I'm here to synthesize everything and give you what you need to know about Grandeho's  I'm not going for funny votes, just keeping it real:Grandeho's is not a get in your car and go to sushi sushi joint.  It is the good, cheap sushi joint around the block where you can slip on your keds and you are ready to go.  We lived around the block and Grandeho's was a weekly occurrence for us.  Good quality sushi (some of the chef's are better than others, too) and very friendly service.  After just a couple visits the hostess already knew our drink order every time we came in. . .  Comfort sushi? Does that make sense?I would definitely recommend this place for people who are not expecting the world and who can come without some of the pretensions that often frequent more expensive sushi places. This sushi is ok.  It's not amazing, but it does its job. The staff however, give this place a  star rating from me.  They've always been friendly and super attentive.  When i sit at the sushi bar by myself, the sushi chef's pay attention to me.  In a town full of questionable definitions of ""Service"" this place is sincere in their nice ness. I figured since I like Cole Valley and work in Cole Valley, might as well try this sushi place, in Cole Valley.  I was not impressed.  Felt like I paid more than what I received.  I left with no lasting impression as to why I would want to visit this place again.   It seemed like it was painful for them to give me five () pieces for every roll I ordered. There are other good places in the near vicinity, that will have my business.  Not into ""Just Okay, Sushi"".  If you are, then this is the place for you. An adequate sushi joint that benefits mostly from overly friendly servers, decent bento boxes, and being within walking distance of my satellite homebase in Cole Valley. However, if I ever get into a fight to the death with Chuck Norris and he roundhouse kicks all my teeth out, I'm coming here for their tuna sashimi. Some of the best I have ever had. The pieces are huge and yet soft enough to simply melt in your mouth. (That's what she said!) I go here out of convenience since they are right around the corner.  Their sushi is good, but nothing special.  One thing I hate is that the waitress always insist that they don't put ""wasabi sauce"" on of the the rolls I regularly order. . . every time I have to insist that they do and the waitress again insists that they don't. . . and sure enough, there is wasabi sauce on the roll when I get it!  Problem is I usually get take out so its not worth the effort to go back and have them do it right.  Oh well, the fight goes on. We love Grandeho's!  The fish is always amazingly fresh, the staff is like family.  Sit at the bar, and ask the chef what's good. . . you're in for a treat! went with a friend from Seattle who was in town and told me that this was his favorite sushi joint in all of SF.   So, my expectations were set high, and with so many amazing sushi places in this city, I was a little skeptical to be honest. when we were finally seated (it's a small place, and gets crowded on the weekends), my buddy ordered for the entire table.  I don't know about the ""Americanized Japanese covered in sugary sauces"" that I keep reading about in these reviews, but we stuck to the sushi. . . and it was really, really good.  The fish was very fresh.  The scallops were to die for.  The Unagi was like dessert. The bill at the end of the night was a bit hefty, and I kind of expected it from the quantity of food we ordered. . . but I was full and happy so it was worth it. I have high expectations for sushi; after all, we live in San Francisco. So unless you want Wal Mart quality at Neiman Marcus prices, stay away from this overpriced ""gem. ""To note: We went on a Tuesday night around pm; there were two four tops available. However, they made us wait as they wanted to keep them open for the veritable throng of customers they were expecting. (Unlikely, since they close at pm. ) The staff took rude and discourteous to a new level, acting snippy when we asked if we could perhaps sit in one of the open tables instead of waiting. Upon us explaining (after they said no and we waited for five more minutes) that we would be going elsewhere since they clearly couldn't accommodate two hungry ladies, they begrudgingly offered us one of the tables and proceeded to hover the entire time, rush us through the ordering and food delivery process. Entire time of order to delivery of sushi: five minutes. The food itself was tasteless and mediocre; the California roll was blas and the only highlight was a spinach appetizer that looked horrifically unattractive but was edible. The prices had clearly been raised (seemingly exponentially!) since we last dined there; I don't see any reason to be paying $.  for a side of seaweed salad. All in all, despite the proximity from my house, I'll never return. If I wanted to be treated rudely to eat unappetizing food, I'd go to Dick's Crab Shack. I'd suggest you do the same. Dan's and my relationship with Grandeho predates our relationship with each other. I think the waitresses were a little upset when I showed up on his scene 'cause he no longer flirts with them mercilessly. Now he is slightly merciful in his flirting. Grandeho is our local sushi joint and we eat there a couple times a month. I agree with other reviewers in that you should NOT make a special trip to this place from another part of town. Parking is difficult. You will be disappointed in the price. Leave it to the locals. We love our Kamekyo just the way it is. Added bonus: Luca from Godzilla is now working at Grandeho. When Luca was at Godzilla the quality of the fish and the prices were unbeatable. We use to go to Godzilla a couple times a week for the Teke Don, but have stopped going since his departure. Although dinner now costs twice as much at Grandeho as Godzilla, we love having him just around the corner. His sashimi cuts are so beautiful I could cry. This is where I used to dine when I was a beginner, I'm now an intermediate sushi eater, so you will not catch me at Grandeho's unless something terrible happens to every other place where I go to enjoy eating my little underwater creatures. They're friendly, so at least you can enjoy that! Grandeho's whatever you call it is just okay. Don't sit near the back close to the kitchen 'cause it smells like pee (maybe they were having bathroom problems, I don't know). I went out on a limb and tried their crazy named seaweed salad and almost puked all over myself. I mean, maybe it's a delicacy for some people. To me it tasted like a bunch of tiny slithery snakes would. Maybe I'm just not Asian enough. I'm obviously not claiming to be an official on sushi, but I've had my fair share. It wasn't spectacular. Fireworks weren't going off in my mouth or anything. I'd go back , but just 'cause it's close to my pad. And I definitely won't be ordering the slithery snakes salad again. I live near here. That's the only reason I go. That's the only reason anyone should go. Here's why:) The sushi is fine, not great, not bad, just fine. ) The time that I called ahead and stood in line to pickup my order only to have the cashier reach around me to the woman in line behind me and process her take out order first because she knew her. Um, I was there first sushi lady. )The prices are a little high for such bad attitudes from the staff and the lackluster food. This place is a ""proximity choice"" for me, not a destination. It gets the job done when I have a sushi craving and am feeling lazy. Unpretentious but tasty!  They're very friendly and remember me by name even over the phone. . . I thought I was special but I see that they do this for others as well.  :)  We mainly come here for takeout; I only wish they were a little closer to Hayes Valley. Grandeho's Kamekyo translates, in traditional Japanese to 'crap house. ' Really, it does. The first time I ate there the food was mediocre. The rolls were stuffed with dry rice, and the fish tasted like it had swam south a good time ago. I remember waiting for  mins or so just to pay the check. Tonight I was there, aparantly just before closing time, and they opted to serve me food without stressing the severity of closing time. They stole the soy sauce, the edemame and then turned the lights out while I was eating. Yeah, and the food wasn't very good either. I gave it a second chance only because it is across the street from my house, and because some jackhole called it the best sushi place in SF. You sir, are a liar and a  drunk. Don't do it friend.  Take the bus to Tsunami instead. One word: Blagarah!!Listen I'll be the first to admit I've become a bit of a sushi snob since I moved here, but how this ""Connecticut strip mall sushi"" can have four stars is beyond me.  I know some people don't like to travel to get their fix, but how far is Ebisu seriously?  I always judge a place by their sashimi, and it was very stinky, very small, and very gross.  Unless your getting something deep fried (even stinky gross fish tastes good deep fried), I'd go elsewhere. Currently stands as my favorite sushi in the bay area. I used to live a block away from it and frequented weekly at a minimum. Their fish is impeccibly fresh, they've more than reached the freshness critical mass required for a decent sushi restaurant. If you think you've had sushi, you havent, until you've been here. try the gomae, block of spinach with sweet sesame seed sauce. No other place comes close to pulling off that dish. In general, if you have some salmon, it'll melt on your tongue as it should, and you'll leave there feeling so full you couldnt possibly eat more, yet have the sensation of walking on clouds. yes, you'll know it when it happens. One of my fav sushi joints in SF. Yoko San is an amazing sushi chef. He prepares mouth watering sushi and also wonderful conversation. The fish is super fresh. I would highly recommend the toro and the hamachi. The toro literally melts in your mouth. Yoko San prepares some awesome combinations by adding additions such as apricot sauce to his creations. The cooked food is very good too. They have this grilled fish appetizer that is so tender and tasty. The service is amazing. They brought us edamame and tea as we were waiting for our seats at the sushi bar. One bad thing is that parking is very difficult in the neighborhood, but I think it's well worth it for the quality of sushi you get from Grandeho. I've been there  times this week.  Geez.  OK, so I agree that it doesn't have the hyped up atmosphere of a Sushi Groove or Tsunami.  But you also don't have to dress in all leather to get a good seat at Grandeho's!  The sashimi sampler is always perfect, and I've started not ordering anything else at the sushi bar. . . because some amazing off the menu concoctions show up if you just sit quietly and let it happen.  Speaking of the menu. . . don't touch that thing.  It's silly.  It lists off every california style roll you'd expect, and a bunch of cooked food. . . well, it's laminated, that's all I have to say about that.  Anything laminated in a sushi bar isn't worth having. Sit at the bar, allow the goodness to roll over you (no pun intended) and let Leslie pick your sake.  It's a good world. Lest ye think otherwise, I *do* eat food other than sushi. . . but, my two favorite restaurants happen to fall under the sushi category. I love Grandeho's so much that I've spent  birthdays there. Delicious and fresh. Sweet staff. Quick service. It's god Great neighborhood sushi place. I go there regularily and they know me by name, even when I call in over the phone. Always friendly and anticipate my order before I say it. If there's a wait they'll let you go to Finnegan's next door for a drink and come get you when you're table's ready. best. sushi. ever. huge fresh slabs of quivering goodness. 'spensive?  sure.  but i don't eat cheap sushi. It's definitely on the pricey side.  I'm a bit hesitant to say ""over priced"", but I have gotten better sushi for less elsewhere.  Do get the fried ice cream here  it's delicious. Amazing food, good service, and Sushi chefs are really friendly and love to talk. It is a bit pricey but we left there very happy. After we spent twenty minutes trying to park, we finally ate dinner and it pretty much sucked.  I can't say it was the worst meal I've ever eaten but it was not worth the work it took to get to the restaurant.  Not a great deal either.  Skip it and go to the Zazie restaurant next door instead. Okay, this place is so not worth a trip to Cole Valley unless you really, really like Americanized Japanese food covered in sugary sauce.  And like, that's not even that great. Time and a place for everything and this is NOT IT.  The only reason to come here, besides what I just said, is if you live in the neighborhood, you are totally exhausted and you want something resembling Japanese food, which are the reasons I've come here. And every time I leave feeling like a whale stranded on the beach & I feel robbed, because I know this shit is not worth  dollars a person. The only other reason to come is if you are under  or if your two mommies are throwing you a small birthday party. Last time I was here, these two  year old kids came in carrying skateboards and wearing billabong or whatever and I nearly fell off my chair laughing when I heard these two punks ordering amongst other things, a ""spicy tuna hand roll"".  Oh, and could we get some edamame, please? Who are these kids? When I was , I thought getting a quarter pounder was a big night out. I did not eat sushi until I was  years old and I was completely terrified and thought they were going to hand me a live eel that I had to kill myself. Anyway, Grandeho's. Only worth it if you have temporarily lost your will to live. Which means: I'm going there tonight. A local fave for sure but outsiders just might not get it.  Sure, it's no Tokyo Fish Market, but it's pretty fucking good.  And if you know how to place your orders strategically, it won't even break the bank. Had dinner here last Thursday with my husband. The sushi is decent, the fish fresh, but so not worth the price. The service was mediocre too. I felt like they couldn't  wait for us to leave, even though our bill was over $. This is my favorite place for sushi.  The staff are all welcoming and friendly.  The sushi is super fresh and delicious.  The best is to sit at the sushi bar and to give the sushi chef carte blanche to make anything he'd like (you can tell him what's off limits; for example, I don't like eel).  I've had the most beautiful, delicious pieces this way. It's ok but if I want to spend that much on sushi I'd rather go to Ebisu. The sushi was actaully good and priced well, but I have a beef with this place.  A glass of iced tea is $.  and the refills aren't free.  I can get a damn beer for $. . If their eel was better,  stars. All in all, top notch  just stay away from the eel. To assert a Western colonialist fetishistic tourist trendy Occidental rubberneck chump hayseed boorish cornfed Philistine interloping conquistadoric American redneck dabbler greenhorn tenderfoot opinion, I thought their sushi was pretty damn good.  And they offer chuu toro more often than other places.  Little expensive, but hey, I'm the White devil, so what do I care? Actually, I lied: the Native American part of me says the sake selection is pretty good too.  Or at least that's what the White devil part THINKS the Native American part said.  What the Native American part actually said is, 'Your White devil heritage took our Eel and only gave us a piece of moldy cucumber roll in trade, you assholes!'  He's pretty negative.  But I digress. Too expensive for mediocre sushi.  The edamame is no good, small and mushy.  Although definitely not the worst sushi I've ever had.  The sushi chefs are all extremely friendly. this is my neighborhood sushi place so I've no idea of what the food really tastes like any more. . . I love it because the folks here are fab and are the extension of my family. we land up eating here at least once a week. the clam miso soup is so good and the spicy tuna roll is the best in the city. However if you live in the cole valley area, leslie is the person to know. she   has been making sure we eat our fill at least once a week for close to  years now. she's the best! It's good reliable sushi joint.  Not as great as other places (ebisu, tsunami, hamano) but it's nice. All sushi is good sushi, so I am giving it four stars even though it's pretty generic and I can't think of anything that sets it apart from many dozens of other Japanese restaurants in town.  As with any place, some swear it is the very best fish they have ever had, others complain.  Roll of the dice, roll of the dice. This is an awesome sushi house. The quality is consistently fresh, top grade sushi.  Don't expect something trendy or hip though, as the setting is quaint, unpretentious and humble and the staff are friendly and energetic.  It is little known around the City so its rarely super busy, which makes it even better. I love this place. and it should get less crowded with all of these reviews from folks on Yelp. (yikes) Great sushi.  One of my favorite places to get it in the city.  I pick it up for work at least once a month.  When I call in the oder, they know it's me.  Super fresh fish. I stick with the basics here  sashimi or nigiri  shiro maguro, tai, suzuki, aji, sake. One caveat  this place is significantly higher priced than other comparable sushi joints. Fresh, well prepared sushi.  Always friendly service.  The Cole Street location seems to have better service than the Hyde Street location although parking in the area can be tough.  Weeknights are your best bet. Upside: yummy chicken teriyaki it's grilled, fragrant, and made of breast meat (no skin) Downside: The small sushi rolls are really small, ex. burdock root roll), and our server had a bit of Chinese restaurant attitude. Overall: I'd go back when my wallet permits, just to eat chix teriyaki and to check out the hot people who eat there. Definitely not the best sushi  I was not impressed.  I was served an entire eel on my dragon roll, it freaked me out a little bit.  The atmosphere isn't anything great either.  Basically, this would not be my first, second, third, fourth, and on and on. . . choice for sushi in the city. This is the first place that I ever ate sushi in  maybe? It's a great place, can be busy, but not always  it's tiny, not pretentious or showy, very clean. The fish is so super fresh, the nigiri pieces are large and flavorful.  I really enjoy it, each time I go. I was nice enough to give this place  visits to see if it would live up to the hype. . . and sadly, it doesn't.  It's good sushi. . . but nothing exceptional.  The unagi served on the dragon roll is GIGANTOR. . . may I have some roll with my dragon!  WHEW!  I like traditional japanese size rolls, which doesn't seem to be the style of Grandeho's. It's a little more expensive than many sushi restaurants in the city, but the fish is always very fresh, the pieces large and the service friendly.  We always forget about the size of the pieces and overorder.  Go on a weeknight and sit at the bar to avoid waiting. Yummy, Yummy sushi.  Always fresh and delicious.  Great atmosphere, friendly and you may get to see Benjamin Bratt. Casual dining but great sushi!!  It's worth the trip to Cole Valley."|4|88|4|Routine| Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities  [ date violation corrected: 1/15/2013 ] Moderate risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 1/15/2013 ] Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils  [ date violation corrected: 1/15/2013 ] Improper food storage  [ date violation corrected: 1/15/2013 ]
Aato Korean Fusion 0|3.5|Korean in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|29|0|3.2| Over all experiance was ok, food was good, place was clean, but you get owner/server combo that don't work so good, she start being moody after few questions we had etc. AATO Restaurant is a hidden gem in San Francisco. The food is top notch, the service is charming and kind, and the combined experience is a delight.  This Korean fusion restaurant really ranks with some of top end San Francisco eateries, but it's not as well known or located.  We found this place by accident because we couldn't get in  Boboquivari's Steak House (more commonly known as Bobo's) right across the street. What a fortune thing! While Bobo's is great, AATO is even better. The Korean steak dish (Galbi, the short ribs) is outstanding; the soup was great as was the salad. We didn't have room for dessert. If you are searching for a restaurant along the Lombard Street corridor and don't know where to eat, stop here.  You'll enjoy it. Really expensive. Small portions. Nice atmosphere. But smelled like dirty mop when we walked in. Food tasted wonderful BUT food was lukewarm. Dumplings were kind of cold in the middle. Owner was very nice but kind of odd. I live in Orange County where there's an abundance of great Korean restaurants, so this place was not what i expected. I'm used to more casual Korean restaurants that are super loud, but this one was more elegant different atmosphere. Food: my boyfriend and i shared the dumplings and he made the joke that they were Pot Stickers you could buy in bulk at the market, but they were still good. I had the salmon which was tasty, but wasn't really Korean in flavor. My boyfriend had the bibimbop and he said it tasted fine. Service: our server was very nice and patient considering we came in an hour before closing. Price: The food was good, but pretty overpriced considering the dumplings were $ but only came with five. Other: for some reason the menu we got differs from what is shown on Yelp. The starters were the same but there were less entrees, not sure if they changed the menu or have different menus depending on the time of the day. The menu we got had less Korean food as entrees. Overall it has a nice ambiance and good service, but most likely wouldn't visit again. The dishes are extremely overpriced. The portions are so so so small in comparison to every other Korean restaurant I've been to. Skimpy on the meat. Still hungry after a bill over $ for  person. :/|4|86|5|Routine Inspection| Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils Moderate risk vermin infestation Improper storage of equipment utensils or linens Improper or defective plumbing Inadequately cleaned or sanitized food contact surfaces
Aato Korean Fusion 1|3.5|Korean in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|29|1|4.0|" My husband just had a delightful dinner at Aato, a new restaurant on Lombard, near Van Ness.  This place is an undiscovered gem.  The food was so tasty!  It is a mix of Local Californian and Korean cuisine.  The ambiance is elegant and quiet and the service was attentive and friendly.   I had the spicy, sweet chicken wings which were so good I ordered another serving to take home for lunch tomorrow.  The chicken soup was total umami, with mushrooms, shredded chicken and sweet peppers in a clear broth and my Caesar salad was among the best I have had with a sprinkling of walnuts, grapes, pear bits and a light, savory dressing.  My husband had the salmon which he loved.  For dessert, we had a kind of Korean street food  pumpkin pancakes with rice syrup and nuts.  Yummy!  This place deserves to be very popular. I always love to go European restaurants due to the exotic flavor and its atmosphere.  Today I really enjoyed the full course at Aato.  I'd like to evaluate this place as a Europeanized Korean restaurant This upscale Korean restaurant is Korean version of Tommy Toy's restaurant.  If you miss the Tommy Toy's you may enjoy this place as a Resurrection of Tommy Toy's yet still keep the modest price.  The all organic natural flavor of the fermented seasoning truly taste the soul of Korean's authentic flavor.   Many Americans don't understand the benefit of fermented food.  The fermentation clean and detoxicated the human's internal system hence it may allow the prolong the longevity.  I was able to taste the soul of the slow food of fermentation and so does the owner woman Jennie's effort that  spills over everywhere of the restaurant.  As a talented former musician woman Jennie is really put lots of creative effort into the menu.  I really love the desert she is offering that all organic from the scratch and nothing is processed.  When I was having the lime pie that all hand made I almost cry of the fantastic taste that totally new to me. Certainly it's a wonderful place for the weekend lunch or dinner. I used to live above this place on Lombard and I feel obligated to warn everyone away. There is no one inside for a reason. . . I really don't understand at all the horrible reviews. Now this place is my favorite place and is actually one of the best restaurants in Bay Area. The pacific Korean menu was fantastic, and she changes her menu every now and then. Talking to the owner Jennie who is totally wonderful, she has told me Aato means the ""Gift. "" Even though I am Korean, I didn't know what it really meant. Shame on me. . . . . The reason why she named her restaurant ""Aato"" is because she wouldn't serve anything to her customers that she wouldn't feed her children. Important things are the enzymes she makes to pasteurize her food like kimchi and uses for the tastes which are totally slow cooking process takes up to   years minimum. She only uses natural and organically way to make these enzyme which are totally good for our body. Furthermore, she also informed me that she mostly uses organic and also she even grows some of her food. This is the original way the Korean ancestor have made their food for thousands of years ago, and this is only restaurant in CA or even in the US uses this way to cook the Korean food.  Furthermore, she doesn't use any Dashida(msg based) & MSG. No Korean restaurants in Bay Area, CA or even the USA do that. Name me one if you know any? I was so amazed how tasty their salad and Korean bbq i really really suggest to try their lemon kimchi and home made desert. Try their lamb. . . . Presentation was perfect and the taste was even better. The process of the food is totally authentic, and she spends a lot of time preparing her food. Unlike other ethnic cuisine, it really takes very very long time to make some foods. I am talking about years of preparation. . . . . Also try their organic/ none gmo tofu. Totally fantastic. I will go there again. . . and i really don't understand about the bad reviews here. . . . . Stop being ignorant. If you don't know what healthy and real foods are, then don't even bother. . . Food was great.  My wife had the BBQ short ribs, and I had the Scallops.  Presentation was wonderful, and the taste was unique.  Service was top notch."|4|89|2|Routine| Employee eating or smoking  [ date violation corrected: 11/1/2013 ] Unclean or unsanitary food contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 11/1/2013 ]
Aato Korean Fusion 2|3.5|Korean in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|29|2|2.5|" I know the owner Jennie and she's awesome.  The food from what I know seems to be more about quality than quantity, and the process or making the foods seem very interesting.  From growing her own organic vegetables and producing food enzymes, the food made here seem very healthy.  Food enzymes assist the body helping digestion and the boosts immune system.  Fermenting these food enzymes take a whole lot of time.  That sounds to me like a lot or work is put into the food.  If you're looking for taste,  I really love the BBQ chicken there.  I hear the menu is changing soon so lookout for new stuff! I'm a Korean American who has spent a considerable amount of time (+ years) living and working in Korea, who travelled the length and breadth of the country to eat authentic food at the source. I grew up in Koreatown LA, home of the largest Korean population outside of Korea. I'm also a (retired) certified Korean language instructor. They claim ""Aato"" means ""gift"" in Korean. The word for ""gift"" is sun mool, I'm not sure how Aato is supposed to be pronounced, but it is definitely not the word ""gift. "" I'm not sure that word means anything at all. Perhaps it is this misguided attempt to con people into a non existant word that also guides the food and prices. Portions were stingy, flavors were mediocre, and the food was unimpressive at best. It tasted as if an amateur Korean American cook with very narrow exposure and view to Korean cuisine decided to open a restaurant. Horrible representation of what Korean food can be. Please don't judge our food by this restaurant. Had a really bad experience here.  people, piss poor breakfast, and the total cost was $. . The place is attempting to be a high end restaurant, but the actual food and ambiance suggests it should be a low cost, quick place. I suggest spending your money elsewhere. Extremely over priced. Small Portions. Almost always empty. Do NOT eat here. Aato Fusion was next to our hotel.  The restaurant was empty, but we took a risk.  It was actually a huge risk because my Dad and I were traveling together, and he had never eaten Korean food before.  We decided to give it a shot, and I'm so glad that we did  the food was delicious and we both enjoyed our meal.  We shared an order of dumplings and Bi Bim Bob.  The food was very flavorful with bold flavors.  I would have preferred a bit more heat, but they had toned it down a bit for my Dad, at his request (kudos to them for that. )  Our waitress was very accomodating and personable.  I noticed that the restaurant also serves a brunch, I would like to try that on my next trip. For a place named after ""gift"", I did not receive any.  I can't figure out if this place tries too hard and fails at any attempt at fusion or doesn't understand how to do so.  The menu is mostly classic Korean dishes, such as bibimbap, japchae, galbi, seafood pancake, etc.  Although the haemool pajun looked good, it was soggy and lacked flavor even with the sauce and what seemed to be fresh ingredients with bad oysters.  However, the chef offers some twists with sweet potato latte, calamari olive oil pasta and sweet corn cakes in honey.  None of these variations had flavor or tempted me in looks.  The latte was bland.  I had a dead clam in my pasta using Asian noodles, drowned in oil oil with chewy, over cooked squid.  I didn't think anyone could s crew up dessert, but the sweet corn cakes were like mochi on a bed of honey and oats.  Perhaps I should try their brunch, which seems to get good reviews some of the time.  However, $ for  dishes and a dessert seemed twice what they were worth.  This place might try to confuse you with fine dining using a selection of three prefixe menus in a Western setting, but the food just isn't special enough to fit in. Service was slow, friendly and not so helpful.  The waitress doesn't seem to know the menu and what is good.  The ambiance and decor is pretentious with chandeliers and fine dining chairs, but it doesn't invite anyone in especially since they are hidden on Lombard even with neon lights.  Parking can be tough on the street, but you might as well go across the street for Bobo's great steaks to get valet parking."|4|82|4|Routine| Improper food storage  [ date violation corrected: 12/18/2012 ] Improper or defective plumbing  [ date violation corrected: 12/18/2012 ] Improper cooling methods  [ date violation corrected: 12/18/2012 ] Unclean or unsanitary food contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 12/18/2012 ]
Aato Korean Fusion 3|3.5|Korean in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|29|3|3.45454545455|" Made our new years eve amazing. Very good food made with careful attention and the freshest of ingredients. I had never had koren food and the waitress took the time to explain the dishes. The sea food pasta and fried dumpling were amazing. I am definetly going back next time I'm in Frisco. I just had to get up and dance. I danced near our table off and on for a total of about half the meal. What with the ritzy chairs and chandeliers, I know my actions may have come off as a tad obnoxious if not delinquent, but there was such good music playing that I don't see how patrons would be expected to stay still. On top of the tunes, the server and owner with whom we conversed were pretty friendly. The owner talked to us about the genesis of the restaurant and where she envisions it heading. She started getting omma on me, telling me how to stir & eat my food. I'm just glad she didn't grab the spoon and do it for me (I've had that  and more  happen). Yes but how was the actual meal? Well, they had a small but dexterous beverage selection featuring one Korean beer with the rest being European imports. The soju were common items, except for Omija, which I don't recall seeing at other restaurants. We likened its taste to a soju'ed up strawberry Calpis. Among our  banchan (side dishes) was taters. At other places, shredded potato is pretty much shredded potato; the stuff here was of the ""scattered, covered, and chunked"" caliber. That's right, y'all, I said crisp this up and serve it at a Waffle House, or a chicken 'n' waffles place for you chicken 'n' waffles folk. My friend got a crab pasta, which was cool because it included an actual half of a blue crab. I got albap (roe with vegetables over rice, usually in a hot stone bowl). Being a favorite of mine, I figured it would give me an immediate reference point for comparison with the albap I've had at restaurants and homes around the Bay. In that sense, maybe I'd put it in the middle of the pack. I respect the owner's focus on local & natural ingredient sourcing and whatnot, but there wasn't even much roe. It had maybe a tablespoon, in contrast to the all out  rows of different kinds of roe given elsewhere. Would I get this dish here again? Maybe. At the end of the dancing, talking, and eating came the bill. Now, before I say anything, how much do you think a bottle of soju,  beverages,  entrees, and a dessert would come to at a Korean restaurant?Seriously. Guess. Nope, you weren't close. It was way more than that, which is probably the only glaring reason why I don't foresee my rating increasing to  stars. Excluding the music and conversation, I could understand our experience costing that much for three or even four people. But there were two of us. It's not like this is one of those restaurants where the presence of a doorman and servers wearing three piece suits signals that you'll be paying like a boss. Yet you might anyway. I get that some of the price probably comes from the handpicked ingredients and preparation methods, but goodness gracious. Ceteris paribus, we're still going back at some point to try the Honey Butter Bread. . . and to dance. *Bottom line* Staff:  / . Food:   .  / . Price: omg / . Wow. My lady loves Korean food, so we decided to give this new neighborhood spot a try.  we've been to quite a few Korean spots in the city and around California, and I honestly can say that this one is by far the worst.  Summary: mediocre food at premium prices with crappy service. It's not fusion, it's confusion. Service.  Well, so we spent a bunch of time telling the server that we wanted a certain kind of soup.  She brings us something COMPLETELY different.  We don't have time to wait so we take what she gave us.  Of course, we end up paying for her mistake because the dish she brought us was twice the price than the dish that we wanted. Prices are WAY too high.  They are charging the same or higher prices as the authentic Korean spots, with tiny servings that don't make up in neither presentation or taste, presentation or originality.  You get the 'appetizers' which are also tiny. Save yourself the money and go elsewhere. I had the Bibimbap to go  it was a good size and VERY filling. The beef was very tender and yummy, the egg was perfectly cooked, and there were tons of veggies. I haven't seen a ton of people in the restaurant but I think it's because they are very new. I hope that there's enough traffic from tourists and locals because this dish is delicious! I will definitely be back. Very nice surprise.  My lady took me here for a special occasion, after we noticed it across from Bobo's.  We tried the Course No. , and it was delicious!  I love Korean food, but this was very unique for San Francisco.  The BBQ ribs were very tender, savory and a little sweet.  Yum!I loved the dessert (which is not normally a high point in Korean cuisine).  And the owner gave extras of everything, upon request (this is very Korean).  Loved it! The one thing I was really worried about when my bf and I decided to move from New York to SF wasn't earthquakes  it was the reported dearth of good Korean food in the cityTHANK GOD FOR AATO! Went in there yesterday and got the Galbi (Korean BBQ) Ssam Plate and it was so so so so good. The BBQ was delicious and they even have homegrown 'kkenyip', which is a sort of herb even the most legit places in K town in New York have a hard time getting their hands on. They also had 'yuja cha,' which is a kind of citrus tea that my mom always makes for me and that I love. Yummy yummy  I'll definitely be going back! I had such high hopes for this place especially since I have always felt this neighborhood had everything except for good Korean food. When I saw Korean Fusion on the banner, I thought of places like Namu and bulgogi tacos. When my group of  actually came, we were all hesitant just from looking at the menu outside. Although it says Korean Fusion, it did not seem like any fusion to me. It was Korean or it was Western food. The prices are very high. The food was just ok, but for the price, we were expecting a lot more. I think the restaurant can do well if it just serves authentic Korean food, or finds another focus such as a noodle shop or late night place. The service was good, and we had complimentary wine and dessert, but it did not make up for the $ to taste of food ratio. Since I live across the street and watched the construction of the place I was really looking forwad to checking it out when it finally opened.  I finally got the chance last night so I asked my friend to join me since we are both avid fans of Korean food. We were suprised to see that we were the ONLY people in the restaurant at pm on a Thursday but  since its a new place we let that slide.  Our first shock came when we saw the prices on the menu .  for a salad?!  As vegetarians we were also less than impressed by the available options.  Our delightful server who admitted to knowing little about Korean cuisine offered us a free glass of wine that they were giving for their grand opening I love free, and free wine is the holy grail my opinion!  Unfortunately you get what you pay (or don't pay for) and the wine was stale and unappealing.  I ordered the tofu salad with a side of Kimchi and my friend orderd the shrimp salad.  For around .  a salad we were expecting a lot more than the small plate we got!  My friend's shrimp salad had only  small shrimp!  The kimchi was incredibly fishy and we requested the server take it back.  Sorry Aato, we wont be back Best of luck! Very attentive staff.  Would have liked spicier mandoo, but the wait staff provided us with hot sauce upon request.  Strangely, the food was not very hot even though we were only one of two tables there.  I think perhaps the plates need to be heated before serving the food in order to maintain the heat of the food.  The spicy pork special was delicious.  The beef short ribs were fine, but rather bland.  The lemon mousse dessert was delicious. Stopped by for dinner yesterday since I live in the area. I was greeted right away and the owner came out and talked to me as well, everyone was quite nice. I wanted something to go, so the owner recommended dishes that would be suitable for takeout. I ordered the Bibimbap plate and it was delicious. The meat was high quality and very tasty, and all the ingredients were very fresh and bright. Looking over the menu, it seemed like they had a lot of great dishes, but my only critique would be that they seem to be a tad on the pricey side. However, i'll be back and if the service and food are consistent, it'll be worth it. I always appreciate new, family run businesses that try hard to make it, and this is one of those restaurants. They let me take the brunch menu, served Sat/Sun from am pm, so I thought I'd post it here since their site isn't up and running yet:Eggs on cocotte: Two eggs over shrimp, ham, cheese, & vegetables in cream sauce . . . .

I got a chance to try out their menu dishes and so far the food is DELICIOUS!The decor is very nice and the atmosphere definitely has a chill vibe to it.

Love this place!  Amazing interesting food.  Been there twice and both times have found the food exceptional.  And super friendly staff.  Hoping more folks learn about this place! I think this is what happens when you don't kiss food critics' butts or have a big PR budget. . . Wonderful food, totally under most people's radar.  Hidden gem for sure.  Check it out. . . The vibe can be mellow and like a neighborhoody restaurant, but the food is unique and perfectly executed like any of the top restaurants in town.  And, where else can you try elevated Sri Lankan and global cuisine with no pretension?  Nowhere!I do have to agree with others that sometimes the servers recommendations on cocktails aren't as good as you just choosing what you like. . . . We were led astray a few times but then self corrected w/ our next drinks.  :) Choosing this spot was a fortunate event. A true epicurean adventure, with innovative dishes either creatively prepared akin to the city's best Michelin rated chefs or with a simple rusticity showcasing an array of unique flavors. The Cauliflower With Lime Pickle Emulsion and baked mustard greens was in a word addictive. Check out the Traditional Egg Hopper. . . not going to be a spoiler on this one, suffice to say this chef has skills. Next up, Lamb & Pork Meatballs With Sri Lankan wow this is tasty Sauce. Now there's no way I'm getting out here without dessert: bring on the Caylon Tea Semifreddo With Almond Streusel. Won't give away the trade secret, but it's the best of both a creme brûlée and ice cream. Really wished I was drinking tonight, as I could have ordered any/all of the libations. Nothing guarantees a return visit like a list of intriguing aperitif cocktails. But here's what really pushed this into a five star experience: the effortless inclusion of vegetarian and gluten free dishes, without sacrificing an iota of the taste experience. And all this served by a charming, attentive staff. This said, I'll be downplaying this spot to friends so as to encourage their own discovery. My suggestion is to leave all expectations at the door, then walk in with an open mind and a curious palate. Isn't that what an adventure is all about? What a hidden gem! We live a few blocks away and so glad to find this place. The food is innovative, unique, and flavorful. We have been here twice, and both times, have been blown away (oftentimes, you go back a second time and realized you had ordered all the best dishes the first time around) and our favorite dishes are:Portuguese octopus: the iced heirloom tomato chutney is Amazing!Hokkaido scallops: the combo of parsnip purée, melted endive, and pear is excellent!Traditional egg hopper: blew me away!We will definitely go back, again and again! Reading the other reviews, I have surmised that there are right choices and wrong choices at . If you pay just a little bit of attention to what others have shared here, it's easy to make the right choices, and your dinner will be delicious. We started with cocktails. The waitress recommended two, and we promptly ordered them. This turned out to be a mistake. Now to be fair, we went to  directly after a self guided cocktail tour, so our perceptions may have been a bit off. I don't think so, though. I didn't finish mine. We were trepidatious about ordering the kale salad  it's not something that either of us ever liked before  but after seeing the other reviews, we knew we must at least try it. It was pretty darn good. Not amazing, but certainly more amazing than I ever thought kale could possibly be. We enjoyed every course.  However, one thing did puzzle us. We received our first dish, the kale salad, shortly after ordering. About  minutes later, the egg hopper came out.  minutes after that, we received scallops and cauliflower and the okra all at the same time. I have no idea why this came at the same time; they were cold before we were able to finish them.  When we looked at the bill, it appeared that the waitress had ordered them to arrive in this order. Am I missing something? When there are only two of us, I've never received more than two dishes at a time at a tapas restaurant before. But, and here's the best part, then came to goat stew. And oh how wonderful it was. Slightly spicy and all day sorry. I cannot recommend it highly enough definitely worth the price. We noticed that several of the tables around us did not appear to order enough food. Honestly, I do not believe that this was the restaurant's fault. The waitress very clearly said that at the beginning of the meal that the group should order around three dishes per person. Nonetheless, the table next to us decided to order  dishes for two people. When we set out to order, we mentioned that we were overwhelmed for the menu. ""Well, that's what I'm here for!"" said the waitress. But she then proceeded to recommend literally every dish on the menu. It was not helpful. We even asked her whether to get the goats stew or the pork, and see you couldn't even pick between the two. She hemmed and hawed and finally gave a weak advantage to the goat stew. I'm not sure what the pork tasted like, but anyone who wouldn't heartily recommend the goat stew can please never give me recommendations on food ever for the rest of my life. One thing that may be helpful is to know that the the menu is sorted in order from least filling to most filling. If you're hungry, skip to the bottom. All in all, the meal was extraordinarily delicious.  I would recommend  to everyone.  The only thing that stopped us from being a much better experience was the hesitation on the part of the waitress to commit to anything. There is an eight course fixed price menu. If you add everything up, this isn't nearly worth the price. And the dishes are scaled back. If you're thinking about this, just ordered  dishes you want. Came with a large group, and really enjoyed the service, food and atmosphere. All the dishes were spot on while some were verging on spectacular. The Okra and the cauliflower were particularly amazing! The location is very sleepy, which made parking very easy. Will definitely be back to try other dishes! I wanted to like this place; I really did.  Unfortunately, our experience the other week left us underwhelmed.  Overall, a .  star review for this place. My husband and I have been wanting to try out  since it first opened.  We are huge fans of  (which offers a similar tapas style dining experience), so  often made it to our ""short list"" of potential weekend restaurants locales; however, we just never made it over to check it out previously, as we rarely end up dining in SoMa during the weekend.  After finally deciding to try it out the other week, we left deeply disappointed.  Here are a few notes from our experience:AMBIANCE ( stars): The restaurant is charming, I'll give you that.  I also liked that it was so much quieter, almost ""European"" dining experience.  I think the ambiance provides a softer, more intimate atmosphere that contributed to this; but I think it could also be because the restaurant was quite dead (we had reservations at PM, and there were only   tables in addition to us that were occupied).  By the time we left (after PM), the place was buzzing a bit more; but still, under capacity.  You could definitely walk in and expect to be seated right away, even with a larger party. SERVICE ( stars):Service was great; the hostess was very kind and welcoming.  Our server was also very nice; eager to share recommendations and expand upon items we had questions on.  She also was attentive, and stopped by a reasonable amount of times to see if we needed assistance in any way. FOOD ( stars overall  average food trying to be ""foodie,"" over priced for quality and portion sizes):As a side note, we came here wanting to try the wings, meatballs, and steak dish that we had heard about; unfortunately, the wings and steak dishes were just removed from the menu to allow for other more seasonable items (we were told they might go back on shortly given the popularity of those dishes).  Atlantic halibut ""ceviche"", compressed cucumber, coconut milk, serrano chilies ($) * stars.  I liked the kick of heat that the serrano chilies added, as well as the idea of the flavors.  However, this dish just didn't leave  me ""wow"" ed.  Concept seemed similar to the ceviche I tried a few months back at  (which was amazing); but this one fell short in comparison (or even on its own, in my opinion). Hokkaido scallops, marcona almond puree, melted endive, apricot ($) *.  stars.  This dish was one of the better dishes.  The scallop was cooked nicely; however, the scallops were on the thin/small side, and the overall flavor just didn't leave me all that impressed.  Perhaps I'm judging to harshly, as scallops are my favorite and I order them frequently.  But these just don't compare to others I've had. Fried Yukon Gold potatoes, chile fenugreek vinegar ($) ** stars.  Nothing special to this dish; just average, fried potatoes.  Wish the outside were a bit more crisp, wish there was some additional flavor/spices.  Actually, while I'm wishing  I wish I hadn't ordered them (and by the way  $ is way overpriced for this particular dish of fried potatoes). Lamb and pork meatballs, Sri Lankan cinnamon, cilantro almond relish, Straus yogurt ($) * stars.  OK, so this dish was tasty  at least we ended on a good note.  The meatballs had great flavor, and the sauce paired nicely.  I would recommend trying these. Overall, we had a disappointing experience.  The lamb meatballs were good  it actually had us wondering what their other ""popular"" dishes would be like.  But the meatballs just aren't enough to interest me in coming back to this restaurant.  For the money spent and expectations we had going in, we felt seriously gypped.  I will not be back, nor will I be recommending this restaurant. This is the first review on Yelp I have ever written. This is the best meal I have had in years. Outstanding. Stellar.  I would give  Stars if I could. Go there. Now, and Fast! unreal. everyone should come here. everyone who is unafraid, everyone who knows good food, everyone who wants something different, everyone who want pure magic in their dishes. we ate through the whole menu. just go. bathrooms are ""napa"" resort quality: real nice touch. love fancy bathrooms. Lovely decor, good food. Not very busy. This is one of the best meals I've had in the city. I came in with a group of , so we were able to try several of the dishes. Our party had a vegetarian, as well as one person who was dairy free and another gluten free. Despite the varying needs, the waitress was very helpful and even brought dishes to us with the dairy portion on the side, without even being asked to do so, so that no one was left out of trying things. The flavors were really unique and interesting, but very complementary. A simple looking kale salad surprised us with its flavorful vinaigrette, the pumpkin seed crusted pork loin was cooked perfectly, the goat stew for two was in danger of being hoarded by one person because it was so tender and delicious. By the end of the meal, meat eaters and vegetarians were sated. We even forced ourselves to make room in order to try one of the incredible looking desserts (the Reisling poached apricots). One thing to note for groups: given the warehouse style tall ceilings, it can get a little noisy and make it hard to hear others at your table. There does appear to be a private room to once side that they will open up to accommodate more seating. Since that space has a lower ceiling, you could probably request being seated there for a larger group (or even rent out the whole room). Come here with no preconceived notions about what flavors should be used and how they should be used. Instead, come with an open mind, enjoy the space, the friendly staff and the delicious food. Bad service and not accommodating at all. I ordered the lamb and pork meatballs and was disappointed in the taste (very bland). However my waiter didn't offer to take the meal back and switch it for something else or take it off my bill. My new favorite place in the city. Easy to find parking (kind of a weird location though) and decor is nice. At pm, place was not too filled on a Saturday and the hostess tried to squeeze the three of us into a  person table. Requested a change of table, seeing as there are plenty of them available. She obliged, but was kind of weird. Anyhoo, after that little awkwardness, everything else went spectacularly well. Food is truly inventive, delightful to behold and delicious. Loved the soft shell crab. . . literally the most delicate I've ever tasted. Squid was good but the surprise is the iciness of the little sauce ball in the center that goes with it that you were not expecting. Meatball wasn't my favorite but my brother loved the pairing of pistachios and the sauce. The meat dish (forgot which one it was) was so tender; perfectly executed. Cauliflower tasted divine and egg hopper was original, however, wasn't that memorable, except how it looked.  Looking forward in going back again for sure! Quite possibly the best food I've ever had. Small portions, but perfect textures and tastes every time. The location is a bit out of the way and the place felt a little harsh with so much empty space, but it didn't detract from the wonderful menu. I came here last night on a very last minute decision with  of my co workers who were in town for a meeting.  I was feeling a bit hesitant because we were actually able to get an early dinner reservation on a Friday night when most of the other places I tried to secure were already booked. We arrived at  PM and the place was empty, save for one other party of .  Oh oh, red flag!  We were seated by a very nice hostess and presented with the menu.  It's a very simple menu with small plate selections, but the tasting menu caught our eye.  $ for the tasting menu with an optional $ beverage pairing.  We decided on this option with my co workers also selecting the beverage pairing. We were not disappointed and this was one of the most memorable meals I've had . . from the halibut ceviche amuse bouche all the way to the tasted almond mousse for dessert each dish was better than the last!  The beverage pours were generous  they didn't look like tastes at all.  My favorite dishes had to be the muligatawny soup and the egg nest dish (the hopper). What really made the experience for us was the guidance of Yuliya through each course and drink  she was truly gracious, very friendly, and took the time to explain each beverage she brought.  Timing was excellent  the drink came, followed by the dish and an explanation of the ingredients.  There was another server whose name I didn't catch, but she was also very knowledgeable and attentive. I would return here again in a heartbeat!  BTW, by the time we left, the restaurant was full (including at the bar), so definitely make a reservation! Super disappointed in this place. First they open at PM. Not a few minutes earlier. They didn't open their doors till :PM. There were only  tables including myself they whole time I was there. Staff was friendly, but super slow. Ordered everything off the menu besides dessert. It was about  items. I was not full and the only thing that was yummy was the cauliflower. Everything else was very blah. Don't waste your time here. Parking is easy because nothing else is around. If you really want to try the place, go in with SUPER low expectations, and then you may actually enjoy it more. The food flavors were pretty unique. However, unique does not always necessarily mean GOOD unique. Here is what we ordered and a review:Kale Salad  not bad. I'd try that. Halibut ceviche  interesting BUT the turmeric flavor was way too raw (trust me, I know my Indian spices; I cook serious Indian food). It was a bit overpowering. Tumeric is meant to be a spice used for cooking, not sprinkled at the end and had raw. MOREOVER  ceviche comes with CHIPS / nachos, or something that brings in the crunchy texture. That did NOT come with it. When we asked, the guy said, umm. . yeah, no chips. Peruvian Sri Lankan fusion tapas attempt. . . FAIL. Lamb & pork meatballs  umm, hello precooked, bland meatballs. The sauce it came with  which actually was pretty tasty  seemed like a separate entity. The trademark, south Asian (the place is apparently inspired by SriLankan food) prerequisite of cooking meat/chicken is MARINATION, so that the flavors seep in. Marination is like food prayer in our culinary culture. Here, it seemed like they just threw in the meatballs on top. And the meat itself seemed bland/processed; tasted like something that you would pull out of a freezer and throw in the oven. AND, when you give your server some very constructive feedback for a particular dish, any other place with some respect would either switch the dish or comp it from the bill. Here, nada. C'mon, really?Egg hopper  definitely an interesting, unique dish, but again it lacked texture variety. Everything was of a soggy texture. Hence, it didn't really hit the spot. To make it an all encompassing tasting experience, you need to play with a gallimaufry of food texture, especially for a dish like this. It tasted like neither here, nor there. Chocolate custard  pretty yummy. No complaints. But here's the part which makes it go from a ""Meh I've experienced better"" to a ""Methinks not"". I went back home and had major stomach issues. And I threw up. Good bye precooked, bland meatballs. Yup. Not fun on a Friday night. Cool spot in SOMA that doesn't get busy until : or :.  Service is very good: proficient, knowledgeable, appropriately attentive.  Food was excellent.  We followed the server's recommendation and she got everything spot on from the the kale salad to start to the traditional egg hopper (highly recommend getting this even if you have no idea what it is  I had none and it was the highlight of the meal) to the soft shelled crab.  All of her recommendations were outstanding.  The one dish I picked, the meatballs, were fine but not up to the same level.  Part of this may be a stylistic preference, as I like melt in your mouth meat balls vs. the very firm ones served at .  I will definitely be back to try some of the other dishes. Went early on a Saturday night (:).  Only ones in the restaurant for about st / hour.  We went with the chef tasting menu ( course).  At first, serving sizes made me think I was going to leave hungry, but by the end of the  courses, I was satisfied.  Decently priced ($ per person).  Having been to Sri Lanka, the flavors were very authentic (from what I can remember).  Of the dishes, the fried okra and soft shell crab was excellent.  Presentation was also very good.  My only complaint is that nothing really stood out, nothing was exceptional.  Overall service was good, but, again, not exceptional.  Maybe just a case of too high expectations. This place is amazing. Great food  interesting and new combinations of flavors and ingredients. Small plates so easy to share but also try a lot of different dishes. Great staff. Unique menu that delights and surprises!Try the hopper, meatballs, soft shell crab. The dessert menu is just as unique. If you want something different and delicious, check it out before it gets too busy. The hubby and I really enjoyed our dinner here! Each dish was really tasty. The Egg Hopper was amazing! I think we each could have had our own. ;) We also had the crab dish which was different than the one pictured on yelp, but I'm sure that's seasonal. We had the fried okra (me being from New Orleans I pretty much order okra everywhere I see it) It was fried perfectly and really tasty. Meatballs were really yummy.   It is definitely a pricey place. Each dish is pretty small but we had fun sharing everything and tasting a bunch of different dishes. Oh the smoked salmon was delish too! Good friends of ours wanted to take the husband and I to a nice meal for our birthdays!. Since we were late in the game it was very hard to get a reservation in establishments such as Gary Danko. Slightly disappointed but definitely not discouraged we researched yelp with an advanced case of avidity.  sounded interesting and they had a reservation. So with great trepidation we made the hike from the south bay into the big smoke. The location is definitely surprising as it appears to be fairly residential but as a plus parking is a plenty. The restaurant itself is industrial chic but surprisingly feels like you are having a meal at your friend's house (albeit  fancy shmancy friends :) ). We were greeted by the hostess (Yulia) who correctly pointed out that the communal table at the front of the restaurant would be secluded from the rest of the patrons. Right of the bat the service was impeccable. And the high standard of service was consistent throughout the night. Yulia who doubled as the sommelier was knowledgeable about the food, drinks and had a definite passion and enthusiasm for food. We had called earlier and informed them that we were vegetarian and they told us that they would be happy to put together a tasting menu for us. Two of us at the table decided to do a wine pairing with the meal. They have a good selection of cocktails and an overwhelming wine offering. As a side they don't have diet coke or any other kind of canned soda. In a nutshell, the food was exceptional. As my friend at the table mentioned after eating out for so many years and seeking out good restaurants . . it is becoming a rarity to discover new cuisines or be surprised by flavors, but course after course  did that! The pacing of the courses was perfect. . Goldilocks would approve. . not too fast that you can't enjoy the food or not too slow that you can't concentrate on the conversation as your mind is focusing on the arrival of the next plate of food. As for the tasting menu itself :  Compressed cucumber salad, tomato chutney ice     (Brut Rose)  Traditional Egg hopper    (Buzzerkeley)  Muligatawny soup   (Riesling)  Raw kale salad with toasted coconut meat, parmesan and garlic dressing   (Muscato)  Melted endive, almond puree, cilantro almond relish  (Vermouth)  Cauliflower , ime pickle emulsion, carrot puree   (Riesling)  Crispy Okra, cashew nut curry  (Cotes Du Rhone Blanc)  Eggplant lamprais, chickpea, cumin yoghurt  (Pinot Noir  Riesling poached apricot, coconut sorbet  Ceylon tea semi freddo, almond streusselEvery course was perfectly cooked and executed. The favors were interesting and yet delicious. My palette definitely could not anticipate what a dish would taste like just by looking at the plate of food and at the same time at the end of the course my tongue wanted to lick the plate :) The other aspect which was extremely enjoyable was that the pairing with each course wasn't limited to wine. . . for many of the courses the pairing of spirits created an extended finish and enhanced the flavors of the food. The portions were appropriate for a tasting menu as I was full after the meal (no taco bell on the way home!) and it was well priced. Given the number of courses and the quality of food I wouldn't have been surprised if they charged as more than the $ a head that they did charge!Definitely a great experience and in case you skipped the entire review, here is the byline:  Looking for a vegetarian tasting menu: Exceptional food, great service, good on the wallet. . GO!And yes we do have the best friends ever that know how to give amazing presents :) A great find, thank you Yelp!  I highly recommend the goat stew.  Everything we tried was very good.  We had: Soft shell crab with corn anglaise and homemade bacon Cauliflower with a spiced carrot puree Meatballs (lamb and pork) with cinnamon Goat stew with beet And a beautiful apricot dessert poached in riesling with a touch of greek yogurtHighly recommend!  Great food and the bill was not too bad (by SF standards, at least!). I've tried this place several times because it's the only thing close to Sri Lankan in SF. A single hopper for $? That's highway robbery. And about the only thing on the menu that at all resembles Sri Lankan food. The other dishes are tasty and somewhat interesting if you're not too hungry, but expensive even for a chic tapas bar type of restaurant. If you are intrigued by the ""Sri Lankan inspired"" angle, you might as well wait to try some actual Sri Lankan food, and if you're looking for a cool tapas bar with good ambiance, you can probably find a better one in a more interesting neighborhood. Great place to grab an upscale bite. Every dish is innovative in taste and delightful in presentation. Wish they could extend their business hour to a bit later. Great food, unique tastes, every dish that came out made me want to post it on instagram. The egg hopper is a must have. That being said, it is a solid $. Between the two of us, the bill came out to $ before alcohol. The prices on the menu are reasonable, but the serving sizes are bite sized. I left craving a cheeseburger. The service was wonderful! We picked this place due to the location being central for the  of us that were meeting. The menu was perfect for sharing, though a bit expensive. each dish was very good, minus the octopus. It had nice flavors, but it had a really weirdly gross iced tomato chutney, making it feel like we were eating partially frozen octopus. The four of us eating it all love octopus, and one of the group even owns a few restaurants and has never come across an octopus dish that was so unpleasing. It would have been great had the tomato chutney not been iced. Aside from that dish, everything else makes up for it and puts my rating at a . The egg hopper was so good that we ordered  extra. The scallops were perfectly cooked, though only  per order. The cauliflower was excellent as were the potatoes. Not being a meat eater, I didn't try the steak or pork, but it received rave reviews from the other  I was eating with. Ok. Where to start? I think if you're vegetarian, probably not a place to come. Let's start with the basics. When you boil potatoes, salt the water. Otherwise it's potatoes with flavoring on the outside and nothing but mealy potato on the inside. Mulligatawny soup? Use salt. Not just puréed lentils and nothing else. Overlooked vegetables? At least salt them so they don't taste as bland. In any case, okra wasn't bad. And apparently other dishes that were not vegetarian were better. I'm so very disappointed as I had much, much higher hopes for this place. And egg hopper for $? It was better than bland, so I suppose I won't complain. Came here for an event with the bay area oncology nurses society and we took over the small restaurant. The service was great, and they handled us with grace. The bar made us some really interesting aperitifs but the food was really the star. We had some apps, including kale salad and crispy potatoes. There was this amazing amazing soup that everyone raved about, you HAVE to get the soup. The meatballs and fish were done really well. I mean, everything was good, interesting flavors. But OMG THE SOUP. Can't wait to bring the boyfriend here! Great people, great service!Some good food, but would caution that dishes are on the smaller side, this is a 'tapas' style place, after all. Is a solid three dollar sign place $. I really liked the hoppers (appam), and the tastey chutneys along with it. The meatballs were really good, more than I expected from *meatballs*, though maybe a touch dry. Definitely more California Fusion than Sri Lankan food, but, its a nice place where you can get in on short noticeReally nice people, attentive staff and good service. Seriously amazing Sri Lankan tapas. Nice space with minimalist decor. I sat at the bar and received attentive service. Had  courses total. Highlight was definitely the egg hopper but the raw kale was also delicious. Odd hours, random location but delicious food. Highly recommended The food is beautifully San Franciscan  an interesting base (Sri Lankan), heavily modified with French technique and Japanese presentation, with a great combination of subtle and pungent flavors.  Among other things, the Mulligitawny soup, hopper, octopus, and eggplant dishes really stood out, as well as the banana fritters.  The architecture is a little cold/modernist but the noise level is tolerable, and the service was very warm and gracious.  Excellently selected wine list.  The price was a little higher than I would have thought: $ for  small plates,  desserts, and  glasses of wine, with tip and tax.  I would definitely go back. Hosted a birthday in the private room at the back of the restaurant (it has two sliding doors that shut).  Given our party size of , we opted for a prix fixe menu which included: house smoked salmon, mulligatawny soup, raw kale salad, choice of a main (lamb/pork meatballs, Norwegian cod or assorted brassicas) and Ceylon tea semifreddo.  Food and service were wonderful.  Special shout out to Yuliya (private event coordinator)!!  She was super responsive to my emails and phone calls before the party and was there the day of to help things go smoothly.  In sum, birthday girl had a great time so the night was a success! Had a really nice birthday dinner here for my girlfriend's th. Friendly and efficient service, even when it got busy. Excellent food. Dishes aren't that filling so expect to spend $ for two people. Ambiance is perfect for a date night. Arrived just before they lock the door at  PM. Graciously met, seated and served delicious Indian Ocean inspired cuisine. I simply adore this place. The staff get a  out of  from their friendliness, competence, and attention to detail. Raw kale salad  Delicious, and healthy!Hokkaido scallops  Tasty, fresh. Traditional egg hopper  Interesting dish. I loved the garnishes it comes with. I'd describe them as sweet and tangy, yet spicy. This is a very delicate dish. Bavette steak  Nice, lean yet tender cut of beef. Good flavor. I enjoyed this one, but I feel like it could have been better somehow. The hostess and wait staff were very friendly and informative. To be honest, I was a little worried when I got there and only one other table was filled at peak dinner hour, but my experience ended up being great, and I'll definitely come back again sometime. Amazing setup and service.  Had an okra curry and it blew me away.  Okra!  The service and food were so good I came out feeling renewed with a spring in my step. Wow. Everything about this place is excellent food, service, atmosphere. The food is very unique more fusion than Sri Lankan. I was a little hesitant at first but it was one of the best meals I've had in SF! We just got back from Sri Lanka and were excited to try this place to see how it stands up to the authentic stuff. The food is more fusion than Sri Lankan, though you can get delicious egg hoppers (their sauces are amazing!)  The food overall was good, as was service and ambiance. Definitely a good date night spot. Last minute planning rarely works out in San Francisco, but this was the exception to the rule. Our table of  ordered  of the  options on the menu and they were all really good.  The ceviche was so good we had . The area around the restaurant is a little desolate, but inside the tables were well spaced and the environment warm. Our waiter was attentive, but not to in your face.  He explained the menu answered a few questions and took care of bringing us the items in the order he and the chef felt would be best. The wine menu was not overwhelming, but had great options at reasonably price points that are often missing. We will definitely be back. Every now and then I come out of hiding to write a review when I find a new bar or restaurant that truly deserves the praise and recognition. Like most Yelp searches, I had picked  for its location (we were going somewhere nearby afterwards) and its first glance rating. We were pleasantly surprised to find this sophisticated restaurant in the middle of a neighbourhood that's taking its sweet time to come to maturity. Low lights and comfortable spacing between tables made for the perfect ambiance for an intimate dinner amongst close friends (and dates!). The food was phenomenal, to say the least. Generally when you go to a well known restaurant already populated by x readers you know what to expect (that is, the usual greatness of the SF foodie scene), but not having heard anything about  I was blown away. It was also an excellent introduction to Sri Lanken cuisine. Between the two of us, we shared the smoked halibut, portuguese octopus, traditional egg hopper, lamb and pork meatballs, crispy okra, and Ceylon tea semifreddo. While the main ingredient of each dish was cooked to perfection, it was the thoughtful yet playful garnishes that really made every bite exciting and delightful. Highlights of the meal were the traditional Jidori egg hopper with the different sambols (looks like Sri Lankans got gastronomy right from the very beginning!), the curiously good iced heirloom tomato chutney that accompanied the octopus, the crispy okra (think kale chips but better), and finally, the heavenly semifreddo that literally melted in my mouth. Service was great as well, we never found our glasses even half empty and our server thoughtfully helped us space our choices into three courses, plus dessert. We also got very thorough recommendations for wine (we wanted a medium bodied red good with seafood and ended up with the Stoller Pinot Noir )  I'm a sucker for a good wine and a good somm, so brownie points there!All in all, this was one of the best meals I've had in San Francisco. I'd put it up there with the likes of Quince and Benu. I'm definitely returning to try the rest of the menu. I really hope  starts landing on more radars because it is truly a hidden gem in this city. I came here on a Friday night and was able to be seated with my friends right away  without reservations! This is a feat generally impossible in the good restaurants of SF, but this restaurant is awesome!! I'm sure the next time I'm in SF I won't be so lucky, however.  has a bunch of different small plates that are great for sharing. All were pretty amazing  very flavorful with interesting textures and combinations. I highly recommend the Egg Hopper, kale salad, and meatballs. My favorite, however, was the Portuguese Octopus. Thinly sliced pieces of octopus with a tomato chutney and lime gelee  a strange assortment that works incredibly well. They also have a nice selection of cocktails and I especially recommend the   it's very refreshing! Dessert is also a must. We split the chocolate custard which was flavored with a bunch of spices including cardamom  heavenly. This place is shockingly good. According to their website, they were granted Bib Gourmand status by  Michelin Guide. We ordered the ""ceviche"" hallibut, raw kale salad, crispy okra, mulligatawny soup, assorted brassicas (roasted veggies), and lamb and pork meatballs. Everything was simply delicous, I have nothing negative or picky to say. (And I love to read negative Yelp reviews!) I didn't know what Sri Lankan cuisine was before, and I'm not sure I have a clear picture now. All I know is that it's freaking good food. I'll definitely be back. Please, please go visit this place so that it stays in business! I really enjoyed my meal.  I was pleasantly surprised by the tastes and presentation.  There dish constructions were so unique that I have never seen or tasted them before in my vast travels and food adventures.  We had the Octopus and Egg hopper that we fought over to finish. The Rabbit was perfectly executed.  We even decided on two desserts that were divine. They have a NA wine for those that don't drink but hope they add a NA Beer for my boyfriend.  The wine list by the glass satisfied my picky tastes in reds and dessert wines.  These are small tapas portions so not for those that want to stuff themselves but more for a tasting adventure. My girlfriend and I went here for Valentines day and we really enjoyed ourselves. I had their set  course meal, and they made an alternative vegetarian  course meal for my girlfriend. Both meals were excellent. The pacing was excellent, just enough time between meals to enjoy ourselves and not so fast that we would fill up quickly. The wait staff was courteous and attentive, but not overly so. As for the food, it was very well executed in my opinion. I thought they cooked the salmon and scallops to perfection and the lamb and veal meatballs were tasty as well. The soup I had was a little on the spicy side, but I am somewhat of a wuss when it comes to spice. Also, every dish they served had a unique and interesting sauce that complemented the main part of the dish quite well. Overall, one of the best meals I've had recently. This place is way overrated! The portion sizes were tiny and overly expensive. I'd have to spend $ to fill up here. I wasn't impressed with the food at all. The pork dish was the only satisfying dish out of the  we ordered. Thumbs down! what an oh so pleasant surprise! i made reservations solely based on the high reviews without really looking into the restaurant at all. when i realized it was Sri Lankan i wasn't sure if i was going to enjoy it because i feel like that kind of food requires a certain mood. though i can't say i've ever specifically had Sri Lankan before i imagined the spices used to be very bold. awesomely, the food was all delicious and not overpowering in flavor. between three we shared: halibut ""ceviche"" it seemed salt cured, with coconut milk and serrano chiles. maybe my favorite dish of the night. i loved this! poached octopus with iced heriloom tomato chutney. yum!! just enough bite without an excess amount of chew. egg hopper you just have to try this to get it. it's like a crepe with a baked egg and sambols to mix in. it tasted sort of familiar and homey yet very different too. a must for something new! sturgeon with crispy maitake mushroom and basmati rice cooked well and tasty. this dish probably had the least sort of ""pow!"" but it was still a great dish. lamb and pork meatballs with cinnamon, almond relish and yogurt. holy cow these were crazy delicious. just meaty enough with just enough gamy lambness. the almonds added another dimension to it.  seared bavette steak a nicely cooked and flavorful steak chocolate custard with toasted curry and coconut lace cookie. the sugar in the cookie was a bit too crystallized but otherwise it was a nice decadent end to a fine meal. the ambiance was nice. the service was paced well (though they did come by to refill our water a little too often. like, it's cool if my glass is only / full, guys. . . it's okay). the food delicious! i'm recommending this to anybody who wants to try something different yet still a nice dinner. Delightful little gem. Authentic Sri Lankan meets California cuisine served in minimalist modern decor. Beautiful platings, artful flavor combinations, and just a touch of molecular. Having worked at a cumulative  Michelin starred restaurants, this is serious Michelin  star potential here, especially if a tasting format were attempted. Service was good, needs a bit more confidence, but has potential. Shame it's such a secret about , every time I mention my experience to others in the industry, everybody's response is ""what? where is it? Yeah, I've never heard of it!"". Part of me wants to keep it a secret, but I also want them to stick around, so here goes nothing!Update : apparently they serve a tasting menu now. Can wait to go back! Valentine's Day with date, tasting menu only for this day. I walk past this place every day on my way to the parking garage from where I work, so I was a bit surprised to find it on OpenTable because they have virtually no signage and are one block from my work.  But there they are, so here we go:Walking in is awkward.  The prevailing winds blow the door into the building, which makes you look a fool as you make your entrance.  The hostess seemed to be startled to see me, or maybe she wasn't a hostess?  Not sure.  All I know is that my first interactions with staff were stilted and weird.  So were my date's, who got there about  minutes before I did.  So we're off to a rocky start. Happily that's where the rockiness ends.  Wait staff were really good.  We were on a tight schedule to keep a later reservation at Archimedes Banya (go!) and the courses kept pace with our readiness for them.  Highlights included lamb meatballs, sturgeon, smoked salmon that showed real finesse, and a chocolate mousse that made us happily late for a Valentine's day couples massage later that evening. The reason this place doesn't have a line out the door and a wait a month long is that the ambiance could be better and they are priced one star higher than they warrant.  Which isn't to say the ambiance is bad or they're a rip off, just that they certainly aren't investing in professional hosts and interior design and are happy to remain a second tier choice of diners who are able to plan ahead with their palates and dollars. Time will tell if this strategy pays off.  I like having them for neighbors and will be back if I can't get rezzies elsewhere. Slowest service I've ever experienced in the USA.  mins between courses.  Also there was a set  course meal and we didn't even get one of the courses.  Food good.  But bring snacks if you want to attempt this place. Got ripped off. Bad service, bad food, over priced. Do I need to say anymore. I give them  more monthsYou just don't need to eat here. I dropped  bucks and left hungry. Excellent Downton Abbey cocktail hour looking cocktails in stylish glassware to start off  also unusual ingredients and delicious which was great, not the same old drinks you get everywhere. Food  amazing flavours, no disappointments. We had ten dishes between four which was just right. Highlights were the egg dish (we ordered two so we had one per couple) which I could eat daily it was so great, the meatballs were so savoury and had a wonderful richness and the potatoes were sweet and spicy and more ish. Service  attentive, non invasive, knowledgeable and we weren't rushed. They also served any dairy elements on the side for me because I am lacto free and didn't make a fuss about it. They juat said they would take care of it and they did. I was hugely impressed. Thanks for a fantastic meal! If you are looking for a culinary adventure, this is the place to go! Yes the plates are small, but the taste of each food item is so incredible and intense that you don't need more. This is the type of food that you will take your time to savor and will make last as long as you can. It is also a great place to go with a small group of friends: everyone get a couple of plates and share with others. It is very social. The food experience will be the main topic of your conversations. The selection of drinks is pretty interesting as well. My favorite is the Lillet Blanc, a very sweet french white wine. Finally, kudos for the service, always perfect! . . They have about  items on their menu (not including dessert).  We ordered  of them among the four of us.  And no looking back. yelp. com/biz_photos/…yelp. com/biz_photos/…The hopper, or egg dish, was my absolute favorite.  It's such a new and unexpected way of cooking such a simple ingredient, and showcases the culinary skills of Chef Fernando. Just don't be the loud, obnoxious group that we tend to be, and you should do just fine there.  Apologies to the others whose dates we may have interrupted with our catch up sesh. Total damage for four: $ Yummy! We went here with friends and absolutely loved the food.  Everything was beautiful, inspired and had something to wow us with, that hasn't happened in a while.  The place is modern and out of the way, warm candlelight, and it was easy parking as a bonus.  It's very inviting on the inside even though it has that SOMA modern feel, but a bit cold inside, they really need some heaters, we were in winter clothes and if it was convenient I would have kept my coat on. The service was friendly and attentive but casual, they had some great wines on the list as well, we had  bottles, probably tried   dishes, they're not big so it's a great way to taste things. Some notable dishes were the ceviche, scallops, cauliflower,rabbit, sturgeon, and steak.  Everything was beautifully presented and executed, easy to tell there was real skill and passion in the chef. The dishes had great sauce, bright flavors and just delicious! I would totally come back here again on a date or with friends. Don't know what the hype is about.  Place was highlighted by one of the city's food bloggers.  Food was pretty ok. Nothing memorable or noteworthy.  Service was good.  Just another SF place for the so called foodie.  Best part is the easy parking! Innovative and delicious.  We loved the hoppers and the potatoes with maldive fish paste.  The restaurant is a bit cold temperature wise, though, and I wish the'd change their name to give a better sense of the cuisine. . Another numbered restaurant, one that reminded me of , where I had a delicious and unexpected meal. I expected the same at  and got lots of unexpected but very little delicious. The price was steep and I was unimpressed by the wines. For the price, I would not recommend. Note: they no longer have happy hour. Everything on the menu was delicious. We ate with a friend who's on a gluten and dairy free diet. Surprisingly we were able to order almost everything from the menu. They were also really accomodating and put sauces/dressing on the sides that contains gluten/dairy. The biggest complaint was that the portions are small and the room is chilly. Just order lots and dress warm and you will have a great time there. Fantastic food.  Have spent some time in Sri Lanka and the fusion of those traditional flavors with innovative dishes was terrific. Shared  small plates and every one was great.  Also an interesting (and reasonable) wine list.  Definitely worth a trip. Wow I was impressed.  It's such a nice quiet spot and the food was outstanding.  Great presentation and effort into each item and there wasn't a dish we didn't enjoy.  Oh yea and the desert, yes please :) I heard a lot a lot about the place, as the Sri Lankan French theme isn't very common. This is not in the best part of town, but the ambiance is decent. We ordered many dishes from the egg poppers to the okra, the kale salad, cauliflower and the Ceylon tea semifreddo. The kale salad was good given its kale and super healthy everything else average at best. Overall overpriced, over hyped and not worth a second visit. Who knew? We went last night. . . Sat night. . . and parking was a breeze. That part of town is pretty quiet at night. On this particular night they were having problems with their new OpenTable integration and they didn't have us on the reservation list. They sat us and we began. It was suggested that each diner order three tapas sized plates. There were two of us so let me do the math. . . six. We started with Sri Lankan vegetable pickle, black pepper, tamarind. Excellent. Carrots, cauliflower and other assorted vegetables, crisp and pungent. Great start. The best part is that the dishes just kept getting better and better. Next up was Browned cauliflower, sweet cumin, lime pickle emulsion. Quickly following was the Fried fingerling potatoes, chili fenugreek vinegar (without the Maldive fish). That was followed by the Mulligatawny soup, pickled black mustard seeds, ginger. The final two ""main"" plates were the Pumpkin seed crusted pork loin, butternut squash curry, braised spinach and finally the Rabbit lampreys, eggplant curry, toasted buckwheat, bacon wrapped loin. Each of these dishes are worthy of comment but the final two. . . the pork and the rabbit. . . were superb. This is a kitchen that really has game. The rabbit, in particular, I could have eaten all night. When you visit, and you really should, you must get this dish. The by the glass wine was OK. We each got a glass of the Cote du Rhone and it was serviceable. Next time we'll spend more time exploring the wine list. The one drawback. . . the place was too cold. The stone tables both look dirty once something hits them and also stay very cold to the touch. The room needs to turn up the thermostat just a bit. Otherwise, service was very good, the ambiance is just fine and parking is easy. Highly recommended. Recently visited this restaurant and I have to say the food is excellent. We shared most of the items on the menu (they are small plates and meant to be shared). All of the food was great and would definitely come back for the food. Good selection of beer and wine (no hard liqueur/cocktails). HOWEVER, couple things bothered me about the restaurant itself. . We were seated in the very back corner, which by pure location I don't really mind. But, there was this loud generator type of sound coming from the adjacent wall. It was pretty loud and drowned out a lot of our conversation. The noise completely disappears once you get out of the back wall area. It didn't bother me at first  but would have been nice if they asked if we wanted to move to another spot in the restaurant. . Super cold. This is SF, it's quite chilly. I think they should invest in a heater. It may have been my specific location but there was a distinct draft that could be felt. . Understand they are meant to be small shared plates  but I would say that the portions are on the smaller side. Should disclose that most of the small plates are good for two people but would need to order x for any more. Other than those things, the food and service was excellent. Location has plenty of street parking. You can order anything and be happy. We came for my GF's birthday and we all loved it, a lot. Our server suggested we order two items per person. . Halibut Ceviche  was the first thing to hit the table and when it arrived I thought we were in trouble.  The entire serving looked like maybe two tablespoons at the most. I took one little slice with some sauce and pow, was happy. This is something I'll have when we return. Try it, it's great. . Scallops  are almost always a good choice. Here they are an excellent choice. The serving again was small but so packed with flavor that honestly I wouldn't want it to be any larger. These were great. Everything about them was spot on. . Smoked Salmon. Holy cow. Get this. Just get this. . Cauliflower   This is the only thing that we ordered that one day, if I worked on it, may be able to reproduce but it wouldn't be easy. Not to say that I ever would but it was the only thing that we had all night that I could even recognize most of the spices and it was great. . Okra  Fried hard! I'm so glad we ordered this. Oh my gosh, yum! I don't know how to explain it but it wasn't anything like I'd had before. I love Japanese style and love southern style but this was excellent in it's own way. I'll have this again. . Egg Hopper  I think everybody gets this and so should you. Baked egg slightly hard and other things (sorry) that I couldn't recognize! Rather nice actually and I look forward to having this again. . Meatballs  Everything we ordered was made incredible by the delightful mixture of sauces but these were crazy good just from the quality of meat, what was added to the meat, and then the sauces on top was nothing short of perfection.  . Pork Butternut Curry. This was really, really good and I'm glad we ordered it. If you like the title, you'll love this dish. . Pound cake. YumTotal $ before tip and we were all full. Wow!My girlfriend loves it and she's right, it is amazing. This is now her third favorite restaurant in the city, under State Bird and Coqueta. It is one of the best flavor experiences going right now and the sauces are to die for. I really don't understand why there isn't a two week wait to get in. My wife and I celebrated a night out and picked this place because it was a different type of food than we had had before.  We enjoyed our experience.  The walls are pretty thin though and the door kept opening so we got a draft throughout our meal.  We each had a delicious glass of wine to start.  To eat, we had the pickled vegetables which all tasted really good, scallops, meatballs and rabbit.  Everything was great and we had dessert but I can't remember exactly what we had. this is a gem in the middle of nowhere.  there is not too much foot traffic in this area, so you would really have to make this a destination in order to try their sri lankan small plates.  they do not have a full liquor license, but there are some nice wines on the menu that pair well w/ the food. we tried the pickles, kale salad, smoked salmon, browned cauliflower, crispy okra, and the hopper.  sounds like a lot, but the portions are small, so you can eat all of it.  everything i tried was good, and the hopper w/ the sambals was definitely interesting and nothing i've tried before.  it's kind of like a coconut flavored crepe/dosa w/ a runny egg in the middle.  we had some room for dessert, so we got the spiced cake w/ coconut cream and persimmons.  it tasted like fall on a plate!  my husband also got a cappuccino and quite enjoyed it, so we asked what type of espresso they use, and what do you know, it's just mr. espresso!  what a pleasant surprise! Color me impressed. I'm rarely introduced to new cuisines and culinary influences these days, especially domestically, but Brian Fernando has come up with a unique confluence of fusion and I've never tasted anything like it before. The influence of his Sri Lankan father and French training has resulted in some really special and memorable food. The restaurant was a little bit chilly inside on fall evening in San Francisco, but hopefully they'll figure out how to warm up the room a bit. The decor was well done with a nicely designed bar as the centerpiece. They will be opening a private dining room in the back in the near future. We started off with a cocktail and glass of wine. All of the dishes are designed to share as is common at most restaurants these days. We started of with the raw kale salad and halibut ""ceviche"". I'm not a huge fan of raw kale as it can be quite bitter, but the vinaigrette was a perfect counter to any bitterness. The ceviche was tender and had a nice mix of sweet and spicy with the coconut and chiles. We then had the seared hokkaido scallops which were cooked perfectly with a sunchoke and pear puree with fried parsnips. This dish was one of my favorites. I liked the bowl dry. The browned cauliflower was crispy just the way I like it and the sweet cumin and lime pickle emulsion were a delicate sauce to dip it in. For our mains we shared the flavorful lamb and pork meatballs which had another unique buy tasty sauce. And finally the pumpkin seed crusted pork loin was cooked with a nice pinkness in the middle and a nice butternut squash curry that had autumn written all over it. I loved this place. The unique mix of flavors and ingredients at  was refreshing in a city full of New French/American/Italian/Californian Tapas menus. Nothing was overseasoned or overpowering. It was clear from the level of execution of each dish that Chef Brian thoughtfully prepared them with care. Yet again the people complaining about small portions for the price need to go eat at Cheesecake Factory. This is a high level of cooking that deserves all the accolades they're bound to receive. Can't wait to go back! This is my first Yelp review since relocating to San Francisco. Actually, it is my first review in years! I am torn about writing a review because I would prefer for  Bar and Kitchen to remain one of those neighborhood spots that have reliably good food that you can just pop into when you are hungry and be assured of a table at a decent dining hour. But that would be unfair. Everything is small plates, which I guess is the thing to do now. It bothers me sometimes but in the end, I get more variety so I suppose it's good when checking out a new place. We ordered the kale salad, cauliflower, ceviche, scallops, pork loin, meatballs, and ended with the semifreddo. Standouts for me were definitely the cauliflower, meatballs and semifreddo. By now, you know it is a Sri Lankan influenced restaurant and you definitely get those flavors, more apparent in some dishes than others. However, nothing was over seasoned and heavy, which I really appreciated. I even got to meet Chef Brian, who was super nice and told us that he does change up the menu quite frequently, so I am sure I will be back for more. My only complaint was that it was REALLY cold in there. I kept my jacket on for almost the entire meal. We had a perfectly lovely time at  on Saturday night.  The menu is creative and interesting and we were able to order a special bottle of wine from the thoughtful list.  The art is fantastic and we found that the space felt great to spend several hours.  We ordered the suggested four dishes for two people and found the portion size to be perfect; no room for dessert, next time I guess.  I particularly enjoyed the service and felt attended to without intruded upon.  I thought it was generous and smart that one of the servers asked us for feedback on our opinion of how the food was prepared.  She heard my critique with concern and non defensive attentiveness; impressive.  Loved the gift chocolate at the end of our meal, very unique flavors.  We will be back! This is a really good restaurant with innovative and very tasty food.  Despite some other reviews, I found the plates to be properly portioned and properly priced.  My only gripe came as I entered a restaurant that was empty save a few people at the common table.  With a reservation, I was offered the worst seat in the house.  A dark corner seat in the back of the place.  When I requested a better table I was told that the restaurant had a plan and the woman who seated with me would have to check.  She walked away, talked to no one, and gave me a better seat.  A bit later two young ladies entered and were seated in the corner.  Again, they were reseated.  When I left the restaurant the two ladies and those at the common table remained the only patrons.  Why do something like this?  It is overtly hostile to the patron and not in the interest of the restaurant, which should want people up front where passers by can see them.  Anyway, the food can be stunning. Raw kale salad with toasted coconut, black garlic citrus vinaigrette, and parmesan was very good.  The dressing made the plate by bringing all of the elements together. Seared Hokkaido scallops with sunchoke purée, melted endive and pear was a stunner.   Perfectly seared scallops accented by the endive with the sweetness of the pear bringing a surprise to the palate. Lamb and pork meatballs, came with cinnamon, cilantro almond relish, and yogurt. The contrast of the yogurt with the assertive relish was perfection.  The chef here has chops. Finally, pumpkin seed crusted pork loin, came with butternut squash curry, and both braised and flash fried spinach.  Haute cuisine inspired by Sri Lanka.  Or not.  I don't know.  I do know that the pork was perfectly moist, the curry a perfect accent, and the spinach a great foundation for great food. Try this restaurant; enjoy the food; ignore the way you may be greeted. New favorite classy/casual restaurant in San Francisco serving fresh, innovative cuisine. The food was superbly combined, executed, and fresh. Each dish had a special twist that excited the palette. The service was beyond impeccable.  From the greeting by the host, to the server, and service staff. The service was prompt, precise, and far from stuffy or overpowering that can be common in restaurants with ""good"" service. This is a must try for visitors and should be a frequent visit for residents. What a beautiful addition to the neighborhood!  A menu to set it apart in a city heavy on eclectic food options, with things for vegetarians too! The atmosphere is trendy but comfortable, and the staff was friendly and knowledgable. The small plates were great for sharing, which was perfect for trying more items on the menu. Reasonably priced with a good wine selection  made for a perfect dinner all around. We ate here on a Saturday night at pm for four. The place was empty with only a few customers coming in before we left at pm. It was hardly, strickly bluegrass night so hopefully it was only a result of people going to the concert. Atmosphere is attractive, open with light colors and lots of natural light. Seems like it would seat  or so people. It's in a pretty deserted area of SOMA. Menu is a mix of small and larger bites. But almost all servings seemed small for price. We tried over half the menu items and found them all palatable but few stood out. The fried dishes just tasted like good fried dishes as fried dishes are want to do. The pickled veggies was such a small serving of small vegetables, lightly pickled. They were good, but one of our group didn't even realize they were pickled.  The banana leaf dish was intriguing but one with unusual flavors and a kind of mushy texture that one of our group found inedible. The browned caulfilower was really lightly fried. The octopus was fine but didn't have much flavor. The fingerling potatoes were very tasty but most fingerling potatoes roasted are tasty. I think what was missing was much other flavors. The menu says they are served with all these cool flavorings like smoked lime gelee or pickled black mustard seeds, but I couldn't ever taste these. I would get a hint of lime but nothing stood out. The lamb meatballs were very flavorful and juicy but they served us three of them even though there were four in the group make them smaller or charge us a bit more for a fourth. They only serve beer and wine. They were out of several of the beers we ordered but the beers we were able to get were interesting. In general, the meal was fine but nothing stood out. Ambiance/Decor: /The place is small but clean. Decor is minimal and unobtrusive. There's a big 'family style' table which is probably best served for large parties near the entrance and perhaps ten other tables. Good bar seating as well. This place is well suited for romantic evenings. Kitchen: /Simply put, this is artisan food. Every dish which came out, and we had perhaps six dishes total, was wonderfully prepared with every flavor perfectly in tact. The highlight was probably the house smoked salmon which practically melted in the mouth. Also worth note is the pork loin which was perfectly cooked, tender and moist, but with a cripsy seared edge. The dishes are NOT large, especially not for the price. The pork dish was fairly sizeable given the others but, on the whole, this is a place to come to enjoy the flavors of the food rather than the quantity. Service: /Damn near perfect. Not much more to say here, and I work in the industry. All this said, it's expensive. And the plates are small. But like I mentioned earlier, you don't come here to fill up  that's what taquerias are for. You come here to enjoy delicately crafted food in a good environment with superb service. PLEASE LISTEN: This is not a Sri Lankan Restaurant! It is a beautifully INSPIRED Sri Lankan Restaurant. If you married a Sri Lankan (and want to impress him/her with your foodie knowledge) or are a Sri Lankan (and yearn for Mommy's home cooking or looking for an authentic meal) please understand that  is taking INFLUENCES from the CUISINE and infusing them into well thought out dishes. OK. . . with that aside. I was thoroughly impressed with the wide array of tastes We had   Crispy okra, desiccated coconut, cashew nut curry (Perfectly cooked) Fried fingerling potatoes, chile fenugreek vinegar, (a CLEAR highlight. . . no joke) Local halibut ""ceviche"", compressed cucumber, coconut milk, serrano chilies (there is a reason the word ceviche is in quotes. . . it is a stretch. . . ok but not great) Rabbit lamprais, eggplant curry, toasted buckwheat, mustard greens (good. . interesting. . . . nice mix of flavors and textures) Lamb and pork meatballs, Sri Lankan cinnamon, cilantro almond relish, Straus yogurt (beautiful sauce. . . great meatballs. . . . wish there was more!) Banana fritters, coconut nectar, yogurt, treacle (low point. . . tastes for us did not mesh well. . . )Service: superior, knowledgeable, friendly. . . . and appropriately goofy (she laughed at my jokes)Atmosphere: personal yest upscale. . . sitting at the bar looks like it would be fun.  A loud private party at front added to the active atmosphere. Thank you we will be back.  rocks!  It was not extremely crowded but was later at night.  Food was amazing though!  I like it better than .  We had the smoked salmon which was a house smoked thicker piece. The halibut ceviche was great too!  I also really enjoy the rabbit dish in banana leaf. Tried  for the firs time last night and it was a great experience.  The flavor combinations are unexpected and remarkable.  The food light and full unique flavors and the service was very good.  Most excellently almost their entire menu is gluten free!  I would love to see them add a vegan dish or two with some protein, perhaps a lentil or chickpea dish.  The dishes are also a little small for the prices, but the great taste definitely still makes it worth it. What is it with these new restaurants with just the address number as their sole identity? I just went to  on Polk and now here's . Whatever happened to great restaurant names like House of Prime Rib or Swan's Oyster Depot? Maybe the owners could have gone with something more creative like Ceylon Palace of Eats or Sri Lanka Yo Mama? But the sterile name does appear to fit the zen like, West Elm meets SoMa warehouse loft vibe the interior emits when you enter the portal (photo: bit. ly/jtXL). I had no idea they served Sri Lankan cuisine here, and frankly I had no idea what that meant. I know it's an island south of India, so I assumed there would be curry involved, but that would trivialize chef Brian Fernando's culinary creativity  into an unnecessary stereotype. There is definitely a European influence, and the Spanish tapas style presentation reflects that. Jamie W. and I came on a pure whim based on a blogger post he read. I was surprised he was willing to sacrifice his beloved Chipotle burrito bowl for one night, so I seized the moment and had us come here. It's on a strangely desolate corner in SoMa at th and Howard, and there was only one table occupied when we entered with just two people at the bar. Uh oh, we thought, but we gave it a go and was immediately drawn by the  plates on the ""Short Eats"" menu (photo: bit. ly/bCHK). The term ""Short Eats"" is actually a term they use for appetizers to go. However, something tells me they are probably not as immaculately presented as Fernando displays here. Based on the waitresses recommendation, we jointly ordered six dishes, and they were quite diverse and flavorful albeit small in portion. First up was the $ Raw Kale Salad with Toasted Coconut Meat, a slice of Parmesan and a Black Citrus Garlic Vinaigrette (photo: bit. ly/hPFu). It was refreshing with a nice bite and the saltiness of the Parmesan providing a nice contrast. Next was a true Sri Lankan specialty you won't find anywhere else in the city, the $ Traditional Hopper made with a Soft Cooked Jidori Egg (photo: bit. ly/qKj). It's an unusual bowl shaped creation made of fermented batter of rice flour, coconut milk and a dash of palm toddy with a perfectly cooked egg in the center. it was a deceptively simple dish sharpened by the addition of Sambols, a red chili paste on the side (photo: bit. ly/LUSM). Third in line was the $ Crispy Okra served with Dessicated Coconut in a Cashew Nut Curry, which was right up Jamie's Kentucky bluegrass roots and quite tasty to me, too (photo: bit. ly/fbLCe). The two comparatively main dishes came in a one two punch. The first was the inevitable $ Crispy Skin Pork Belly with Yellow Corn Mallum and Tarragon (photo: bit. ly/FhoOH). Inevitable because I hardly ever pass up a chance to eat pork belly, inevitable also because every restaurant in the city appears to feature some variation of it no matter what the cuisine. It was very good, just small, with the pork rind and corn kernels nice touches. The second plate was the $ Lamb and Pork Meatballs with Sri Lankan Cinnamon, Cilantro Almond Relish and Straus Yogurt (photo: bit. ly/uiXB). A little more sweet than savory as I expected, but quite an exotic twist on a comfort food standby. The $ desserts were an afterthought for us but nicely presented. The better of the two was the Banana Fritters with Coconut Nectar, Yogurt and Treacle (photo: bit. ly/aNweDg). That's because the fritters were crunchy bite size treats easy to devour. By the way, I never knew 'treacle' was an actual syrup since I've read the word more frequently used when the author finds something so sentimental that it's annoying. The Ceylon Tea Semifreddo with Almond Streusel, a house specialty, was too sweetly soupy for my taste (photo: bit. ly/dsnNI). Throughout the meal, I sipped on a refreshing $ Fever Tree 'Bitter Lemon' Soda (photo: bit. ly/aNwZwd). All in all, the dishes were primarily just north of bite size but on the upside, we tried a bigger variety of food than we would have expected. Most were solid and a few made me want to Sri Lanka yo mama. FOOD   stars. . . creative takes on an unfamiliar cuisine, small portionsAMBIANCE   stars. . . serene if a tad desolate due to the locationSERVICE  .  stars. . . attentive enough, not that warm except for the smiling host in frontTOTAL   stars. . . definitely worth a visit for a food style unavailable anywhere else in the city Awesome food and great service.

A great way to end the day, and you can't go wrong with the pricing of wine list! Cheers to a new favorite restaurant of mine. . . Just Awesome! Don't get me wrong, the food here is good, but for the price you pay, you could be eating someplace really good. Ok, that's out of the way so let me say what I really liked:Mulligitawny SoupBavette SteakHopperWhat I didn't like: The chair kept poking my butt. The price is a little high for what you get. My friend who had lived in Sri Lanka constantly pointing out how things weren't authentic.  But that's on my friend, not the restaurant. Went a couple weeks back to catch up with a girlfriend you'd think that people living in the same small x city would be able to see each other quite often.  Ha.  If only.  But when we DO meet, we do it with good food and alcohol.  Obvi. Anyway, I arrived way early, so I sat down and had a nice beer while waiting.  Yum, beer. The food was pretty good, but immensely expensive for what we got.  $ for nine small bites of cauliflower?  Yes, it was tasty, but not $/bite tasty.  The squab was excellent.  I would get it again.  SQUAWK!  Every time I think of squab, I think of a weird sound.  Like an alarmed rooster. . . . Anyway, it was tasty.  I fear for its longevity, though.  There were empty tables when we arrived and throughout our meal.  It's expensive for the food, and while I enjoyed the quality and taste of it, I feel like every dish could have been a couple buckeroos cheaper.  Just sayin'.  Think about it, oh  people! Maybe I just had too high of hopes for this restaurant, but I truly wanted to love this Sri Lankan French restaurant. My anticipation dwindled as I tasted the first few dishes: cutlets and hoppers. Both  are traditional Sri Lankan short eats, but at this restaurant they are overpriced and under flavored. Go here for great service and dessert, but don't waste your time or money on their main dishes. This is a nice space with lovely service. The food was good and interesting, but the serving sizes are really too small for the price points. Paying $ for a dish of cauliflower and getting  small pieces is just not reasonable, so we probably won't go back. trendy decor  outstanding food amazing service cool cocktail drinks with a good wine listWe were planning on going out right after some food and drinks at . It was perfect because we didn't want to have food coma before a night of drinking and dancing. I wouldn't recommend coming here with an empty stomach unless you are BALLIN' haha. It's more about the small bites and it makes you appreciate everything on the plate  like a piece of flower, a pea, and a small pickled onion. (you are literally sharing every small bite).  Ordered: ceviche  coconut milk with hamachi  non traditional ceviche with lime juice, more like carpaccio.  Mulligatawny Soup with chicken confit  a bit like curry, thick and creamy. Chicken confit tender and flavorful. Delicate! (staff's favorite) Traditional Sri Lankan hopper (street food)  coconut crepe with a soft cooked egg  it's not my favorite, it's cool to try it but I think it needs a pinch of salt or some seasoning.    Lamb & Pork Meatballs with green chick pea relish and strauss yogurt  decent portion and the flavors go so well together! tender and juicy! (highly recommended) Crispy skin pork belly on a bed of corn and bacon bites  DELICIOUS! The pork belly is so perfectly cooked, the meat just falls off as you put your fork through  the corn and bacon gives a sweetness to the saltiness of the pork. the skin was so crispy and nice! (highly recommended) $ Grilled bavette steak with coriander demi glaze and roasted cipollini onions AMAZEBALLS! The steak was so tender with a nice crisp on the outside! (highly recommended) $No hard liquor  beer and wine only. Cocktails are made with beers, some kind of higher alcohol beer. very refreshing!The portions are small  like it is said on the menu (small bites) but the flavors they use are amazing!  of us spent  including tip and tax I believe, it is more on the expensive side but once in awhile, it's cool to spoil yourself a lil. Come by for a drink and some amazing food! :)Enjoy! xoxo Two favorite hoppers. One of my favorite people ever: tablehopper. comOne of my favorite dishes ever: Traditional Sri Lankan hopper. Coconut milk crêpe topped with an organic soft cooked egg. Breakfast. Dinner. Street food. Amazing. Easily the highlight of a very enjoyable meal at the new . Other must haves from the extremely affable and engaging chef Brian Fernando's menu include: Delicate and delicious mulligatawny soup with a chicken confit centerpiece.  Exceptional browned cauliflower brilliantly accented by a lime pickle emulsion Incredible combination of sturgeon, curry and red basmati riceLess ""can't miss"" but still quite good include: Kale salad topped with coconut and parmesan (needed more of both) Banana fritter dessert was a bit subdued with neither the fruit nor greek yogurt confidently coming throughSeared steak and halibut didn't leave much of an impression. Thinking more about returning for the sold out house smoke salmon and skipped lamb/pork meatballs. Loved the unique addition of coconut and cinnamon in many of the dishes. Apparently a Sri Lankan tradition. It's a great one. Also loved the redesign of the space. Low and modern lighting creates a relaxed and inviting vibe, while the local art on the wall provides compelling visual flair. Can't say enough about the chef and his staff. So welcoming and clearly excited to share their interpretation of Sri Lankan cuisine. Read the Tablehopper. Eat the egg hopper. Coming from a south Asian background I was excited to go to this place. But unfortunately it was not only disappointing but insulting to Sri lankan cuisine. I tried most of the food since I was in a group of . ) Kale is not eaten in south Asian cuisine. Food was mediocre and over priced) sturgan is not eaten there either. It was not bad but over priced) Wouldn't find strawberry short cake anywhere in that region) Potatoes were mediocre and over priced) Ceviche is not applicable to this region either. Not good and over priced) Hoppers were ok but overpriced. ) The sqab, steak, salmon all were mediocre, over priced and did not provide any inspiration to srilankan cuisineI see the writing on the wall for this place. Either they will change the menu to California American fusion cuisine and bring down prices or it will go down in flames I had the pleasure of a dinner with friends at  last night.  What a special place!  The combination of flavors is exquisite.  So fresh and different.  While so many restaurants in SF are top notch, this one opens up a new category of flavors and dishes.  Put it on the ""must go"" list, for sure. Loved this place! The food was outstanding. Everything was excellent. The infusion of Sri Lankan flavors into California food was outstanding, and executed brilliantly. The service was great. The atmosphere was airy and bright and very comfortable. The music was awesome. Overall, it was a great experience. I hope they do well. It seems like a lot of the negative reviews are about authenticity and price. Listen, it's not cheap, but it's not outrageous. Prices are normal for this class of restaurant. And, it's not Sri Lankan. You all need to get your heads around that. It's Modern California Fusion that's influenced with Sri Lankan flavors and ideas. OK? Got it? Now: Relax, breathe, and enjoy it. I licked the plates clean from this place and picked every crumb and morsel that fell and dropped it into my mouth. Every little bite counts as the portion and price is not for the hungry and hearty. Delicious and innovative, beautiful plating. My group and I kept laughing hysterically the entire time because it was nothing we've ever experienced before. We had the ceviche coconut halibut, pork belly, potatoes, and hopper. All tasty and scrump, but you better believe we immediately went to Tommys Joynt right after! Nice space, decent people, very overpriced.  if you've never had Sri Lankan food before, I suppose this will impress you.  In the overall, I'd go again if others wanted to go, but wouldn't really give it a ""recommendation"" (hmm, owners, your hostess, fyi, was pleasant enough with us and very unkind to the people behind us) Maybe my expectation was too high. My boyfriend made a reservation but that day the bart was on strike. Sowe were late by m. Hostess was angry and snotty. I thought the restaurant is very popular because i have been seeing many endorsements in food magazines. She was like ""i don't care abt you guys. ""But we sat on the bar. We ordered Ceviche, lamb and pork meatball and crab cutlet. Taste was not even authentic. It was very expensive and portion was too small. I would not recommend this place to my friends. Absolutely fabulous restaurant.  I rarely give five stars, and for a relatively pricey restaurant, the bar for  stars is even higher.  I started the review and smiled as I clicked the fifth star  I only wish I could give it six.  This is one of my new favorite places in SF. Unique, Asian inspired tapas.  My friend and I came relatively hungry, but continued ordering long after we had filled up  just to try as much as we could.  Completely stuffed, we then enjoyed an amazing desert.  The wine was very reasonably priced and both of our reds were superb. Play by play below. Service was friendly and attentive, but not intrusive.  We showed up  minutes before closing and were the last ones there, without so much as a single disapproving look or rushed comment.  Together, we shared:  Local halibut ""ceviche,"" preserved cucumber, coconut milk, cilantro // $ // Delicious, though not filling and pricey  Traditional hopper, organic soft cooked egg, sambols // $ // Fantastic, a bit like a dosa bowl with sauces (sambols), something I've never had before  Braised sturgeon, black curry, crispy preserved maitake, red basmati rice // $ // Absolutely fantastic, a thick square of sturgeon with a nice curry spice  Seared pork belly, new onions, peas, dark spices // $ // Perhaps my favorite of the night, richly flavored pork belly  Seared bavette steak, coriander, demi glace, roasted cipollini onions // $ // Tied with the pork belly as a favorite, the steak was perfectly rare and the light bed of mashed potatoes matched perfectlyFor dessert we had the:  Ceylon tea semifreddo, streusel  // $ // A fluffy cross between flan, ice cream, and creme brulee, and just as delicious as all three combined.  No matter how full you are  you have to get this (and it's not filling, don't worry). For wines, we had:  Mary Elke Pinot // $ // Lighly peppery red wine, perfect for a wide variety of tapas, doesn't over power the fish and the pepper accents the steak  Paul Hobbs Malbec // $ // My friend's glass, a delicious Malbec, but I thought too strong for the fishTotal for the two of us with dessert and  glasses of wine was $+tip.  Not cheap, but well worth it for this fantastic meal. Mm good! I liked the food but the portions are small. I know it's small plates but after $ per person I was hungry later at home. It's more of a snack place than dinner I guess. The egg hopper was fun. I've never had one before. The crab cutlets were decent. The melon salad was  melon nickel to quarter sized buttons. It had a yummy spicy dressing on it but between the  of us it was a little ridiculous to share. Good but pricey for what it is. Don't go here for Sir Lankan food. go here for innovative, unique and very tasty dishes that happen to have some spices and dishes inspired by Sri Lankan cuisine. I couldn't figure the place out since it my work hood for a long time now. I was looking forward to a place to hang out on Fridays and nosh some grub. although you can do that this is really a nice night out place with incredible food great service and the same beautiful window laden restaurant that use to be SOMA Café and then Sage Café. Great beer and wine selection that compliments each dish. don't miss the signature dish, the Hopper or the outstanding Cauliflower or the kale salad or the pork belly or . . . . . I'm going to work my way through them all. Just wish they were open for lunch with a more lunch based menu. A very pedestrian name for an extremely unique and innovative culinary fusion restaurant. Fusion of Sri Lankan and French cuisine! I second that service and the servers are absolutely extraordinary. Probably the best service I have experienced in any restaurant. There was a level of courtesy, attention to detail, accommodating wait staff and genuine respect of the customer that I have not seen anywhere before. The food options were amazing, I already love Sri Lankan food, so I was already half way there. We ordered the Hoppers, Meat Balls, Cauliflower Crisps and Vegetable pickles. All dishes had an immaculate taste to it, except the Pickled Vegetables, they were beautifully presented as in the french tradition, but I found them to be way *too  acidic* way too *sour* as a *main small dish*. I could reason this to be a dish used like a traditional pickle sparingly used with some other main dish. But not as a dish to be had in by itself. Your palate will be overwhelmed. I am giving it a restrained four stars as a result of this one dish and my seeni sambol and coconut sambol were under flavored. Maybe this is what the chef desired, but then, if all the unique sri lankan spices, flavors and fragrances do not envelop your palate and punch you in your face in a good way, then what's the point?The drinks assortment was beyond awesome, a right sized bitter lemon soda from UK. So freaking cool!Extraordinary place, that needs it's name changed so it does not sound like a run of the mill pub food restaurant around the corner. Oh, BEAUTIFUL interior design of the place as well. Fantastic! I randomly had dinner here a month ago at the bar and loved it so much I decided to host a tasting dinner with  friends here last night! The chef created this amazing meal that was out of this world! Really flavorful, great textures, unexpected, and creative. In addition to the meal the service and staff were lovely and so helpful, really warm and welcoming! The chocolate/cinnamon dessert was out of this world! Great vegetarian options! I can't wait to go back and eat everything on the menu!! Wow don't miss it. . . . lovely restaurant with terrific, friendly service  delicious and atypical food. Have to have the cauliflower! Everything we ordered was outstanding and we really hope this restaurant stays around so we can go back regularly! Fantastic food and great servers! I ordered the halibut (/), mulligatawny soup (/), cauliflower (/) (by the way, we had well over enough cauliflower to assuage the fears of those who may have read previous reviews), meatballs (/ only because I don't like lamb), hopper (WOW / I have never had anything like this  AMAZING), pork belly (really good), potatoes (/) and the strawberry ginger dessert (another WOW /). And the owner Yuliya (I hope I spell her name right) was so sweet and gave me the most amazing red wine :)  We also had the Chardonnay which was excellent. This place is right in my neighborhood so I will definitely be back :) I have been here twice. The first time  out of  dishes were great!The second time  out of  dishes were great!Pricing was higher than average, but if you rent in SF you will know why. Will be my next regular spot! Came here for a pre party nosh. Great small plates and an extensive by the glass wine list. The bartender did not seem very familiar with the menu but she was helpful. Interesting flavors and a sleek but cozy interior. Way overpriced for the small plate offerings. If you dine at this restaurant expecting to have your appetite satiated, you will come away feeling disappointed.  At least that was the experience for three guests and me.  Although the hopper with egg dish was very tasty ($), there was only ONE hopper on the plate.  Two more plain hoppers were ordered.   When the check arrived, the charge for these two plain hoppers was $ each.  Outrageously high  by Sri Lankan and American standards.   The food is no doubt tasty, but be prepared to bring a fat wallet. Formerly Sage Cafe,  Bar and Kitchen on Howard is finally open! Since I live around the corner, I've been anxiously awaiting the opening of this new dining spot. The BF and I have been walking by for weeks/months, watching the decor change and even awkwardly knocking on the door once because we thought it was open to the public  alas, it was not. This past Friday on /, we finally decided to head on over to try this Sri Lankan cuisine. I called beforehand and the host answered, saying he could seat  right away. As a caveat, I had read the reviews prior to walking over so I came in knowing that it would be more of a Sri Lankan fusion, tapas style meal. No surprises there. Our server was nice, but perhaps a bit nervous when reviewing the menu. She recommended   dishes per person, but that seemed like a bit much. Luckily I had a good idea of what I wanted already so I launched right into ordering:) Mulligatawny Soup with Chicken Confit  creamy, smoky curry soup with a small piece of chicken confit in the middle. Nice, but wouldn't need to order this again) House Smoked Salmon with Coconut Forbidden Rice: If you love lox, this is the dish for you. I don't know how they smoked the salmon without compromising or modifying the original soft texture of it, but they did it so well. I tried to eat this dish as slow as possible, but it was almost difficult to do that bc it was so good! I'd only recommend that they offer a spoon with this dish instead of the huge fork given in order to scoop up the salmon and rice. ) Traditional Hopper with Soft Egg and Coconut/Onion Sambal: ""Think of it like a crepe with a soft egg inside"" is what the waitress told us, and how true it was! I only wish that this was a bit bigger because we shared it between  people. The sambal toppings added a nice crunchy/sweet flavor to the hopper. ) Lamb and Pork Meatballs with Green Chick Pea Relish + Straus Yogurt: The presentation on this dish was beautiful, and the green chick pea relish was so original. The meatballs tasted fresh and were still tender/juicy  not dried out like most meatballs tend to be. Additionally, there was a tomato sauce along with the relish, plus a dollop of straus yogurt which all complimented each other well. I do think there are some service issues they can iron out (servers not being fully confident with the menu yet  understandably so  and a bit awkward in general), but I'm most likely going to be back. Our waitress recommended   dishes per person, but we were quite full at the end of it after only ordering   plus any more and it would be super pricey. The owner was walking around the restaurant and was very hands on throughout the entire night, so I appreciated her presence (we used to see her working through the window with her son everyday, so we knew she was the owner) and general attentiveness to her customers. It would be awesome if they had a full bar as I hear they have a happy hour and I wouldn't mind just sitting down at the bar nibbling on a few dishes over drinks in the future! Am I back on a roll with new restaurants, or are they all happened to be good? I would not hesitate to give a  star to this place, but I'd say .  for their questionable background music. it might make me sound snobby, but I'm a classically trained cellist, and I thought the bgm was over the too enough for me to be bothered. anyways!starter sri lankan pickled vegetables ($) :: the dish came with different pickled vegetables. the vinegar tasted a bit different, and it also came with black pepper and galangal sauce which I found pretty exciting. local halibut 'ceviche' ($) :: basically sashimi with some sauce. the fish was very nicely prepared and the sauce was perfectly balanced with the fish. traditional hopper, frided eggs and sambols ($) :: wow! this was pure magic. we had no idead what a hopper was, and we were so glad we tried this dish. i can't even describe how good this dish was! a must have dish!entree roasted quail, toasted buckwheat, almond ($) :: I usually always get quail dishes wherever possible, and I made the right decision to order this dish! the buckwheat was really tasty as well. I wish the quail were a bit bigger. . well, isn't this always the case?pork & lamb meatball ($) :: when you become quiet after a bite of a dish. . you know the dish is worth the silence! we devoured and inhaled this dish. . it was generously portioned, and just perfectly cooked!dessert ceylon tea semifreddo ($) :: this dessert dish blew us away. . this was so really amazing. a must have dish!I will be looking forward to trying this place again after they change their menu in the future. . or sooner : P I really want to like this place.  Everyone working here was so pleasant, from the host that hung my jacket up for me to the fabulous server with her awesome frames and reptile heels.  I love the heavy pot my black tea came in and how quickly our orders came and how're servers were efficient at clearing and timing their questions about our needs.  But I can't like this place or recommend it. .  The food is tasty but things that were supposed to be hot we're not and frankly although they are labelled as small plates, they are very very very small.  See my picture of the  dollar plate of yummy browned cauliflower as an example (in all fairness I did eat ONE floret before I snapped the pic) .  This place is new but looks run down already. The caning on the woven seats is sharp and after poking me in the tush it snagged my dress.  The bar chairs look crazily distressed and not in a cool hipster way. I hope this place improves soon. Total food coma! Beautiful, beautiful space, gracious owners and staff, but that alone won't get my five stars. No way. The food was amazing, exotic, exciting and subtle, and most importantly  delicious! Between seven of us we tried so many things, not a single dish I wouldn't be excited to have again. Great wine list to boot! I'd write more, but I gotta go lay down! When we heard about a Sri Lankan restaurant opening in San Francisco, we couldn't wait.  My husband is Sri Lankan, and the cuisine is one of my favorites.  Typically, I think of it as a blend of indian meets thai with a powerful twist on flavor / spice profile.  Bar and Kitchen isn't exactly Sri Lankan cuisine  it's fusion with a Sri Lankan base.  We went as quickly as we could from the actual opening.  To start, parking was relatively easy  there were open metered spots up and down the street.  The restaurant itself is beautiful, very modern and cool.  Felt up to speed with a high quality restaurant in SF.  The menu  the dishes are more small plate style, and we ordered almost everything off the menu  well, everything we eat.  The standout dishes  hopper with the sambols, lamb meatballs, the crab cutlets, potatoes, and of course  the fired banana dessert  YUM!This place is way overpriced for what you would expect to pay for Sri Lankan food. . . hoppers at $!  I think we paid  cents each when we had them catered at our wedding event. In any case, I hope this place does well, the food is good. . . hopefully if the restaurant gets more business the prices could come to more reasonable levels.  I would have rated it , but the prices are just way too high and there aren't any entrees. . . just everything in small plates. Had reservations here at pm on a Saturday night and the place was empty.  Service was quick and friendly but then again it should be since we were the only people there.  We ordered the following: ) Sri Lankan vegetable pickle, black pepper, galangal; ) Local halibut ""ceviche,"" preserved cucumber, coconut milk, cilantro; ) House smoked salmon, coconut forbidden rice, creme fraiche, turmeric; ) Roasted quail, chai spice, toasted buckwheat, almonds; ) Seared bavette steak, coriander, demi glace, roasted cipollini onions; and ) Ceylon tea semifreddo.  Of all the dishes I really liked the house smoked salmon with the forbidden rice, all the other dishes were ok. Overall, portions are small, the food was alright, and prices are pretty expensive for the size.  The server recommended   dishes per person. it was meh, ok. I've never had Sri Lankan food, so I wont fuss too much about the flavor of their food,but in my opinion, their food + ambiance + service come down to  stars. Food:definitely small portion/tapas style, and that is ok, but nothing was spectacularly good and that's not a good sign especially because the restaurant is located where there's no foot traffic.  If the food is sub par, city peeps won't make an effort to come to you. .  So maybe they can change the plates to more comfort type of food instead of trying to be high end?  That way they attract the residents from South Beach/SOMA like us. Service:I'm assuming they just opened.  And probably for that reason, the staff were not too confident, and that showed.  I appreciated that they were all nice and helpful, but we were approached by three people asking the same question, and that comes across as unorganized.  Ambiance:I think they want to come across as modern, contemporary restaurant/bar.  I really like the bar area, but what I did not like was seeing a small kid (owner's son?) doing his homework in a corner table, and his grandma(?) helping out while sitting at the bar sipping wine looking like one of the guests but no, actually an affiliate and asking us if the music is too loud or not. . . I'm not anti children or grannies, but just saying that all those little things are so important when creating a nice ambiance for the guests.  I guess the food, which came across high end, contradicted with the vibe of the restaurant, which was downgraded by lack of training/confidence of the staff and presence of employee's fam members, who were not really working but trying to help out (you should either work % or sit and pretend like a guest % and observe :)I know this location is hard as the previous business didn't last too long.  I really want good restaurants that are somewhat near my house so hopefully they can make it work.  Whether I'd go back or not. . . is still uncertain. My pronunciation skills are just as good as my geography. And we all know, I don't know my east from west. Me: ""Can we try this new 'Siri' Lankan restaurant?""Mr. NSS: ""Siri. . . ? It's not your iPhone. . it's pronounced: s h r e e. ""Me: ( _ )'Siri' Lankan, 'Shree' Lankan or however my dyslexic ass pronounces it,  Bar & Kitchen is one of the BEST new restaurants I've been to. It's not often that I rave about newly opened restaurants especially during their soft opening stage where they have as many wrinkles as Joan Rivers to be ironed out. Being that I have a serious Yelp addiction, I've gone to many soft openings/grand openings and I have to say that  Bar & Kitchen is the BEST new restaurant in San Francisco I've been to since State Bird Provisions which opened last January. The first of its kind in SF,  serves Californian Tapas with Sri Lankan and French influences; menu: bit. ly/MzFcA (this is NOT a traditional Sri Lankan restaurant). Hailing from Chez Panisse and Le Papillon, Chef Brian Fernando's dishes were nothing short of spectacular. All the dishes were refined with complex flavors and textures. His creative menu and use of exotic ingredients pushes the envelope and the fact that it's VERY well executed makes the food  stars in my book. The two reasons why this is a  star review are because ) the prices are a tad high for the portion sizes and area, and ) service was green and could be more prompt.  F O O DAlthough the food is just Sri Lankan influenced, it would have been nice to get some introduction to the menu since Sri Lankan cuisine is foreign to many (most similar to Indian and Thai cuisine). For tapas, about   dishes per a person is sufficient. *Raw Kale Salad w/ Coconut Meat & Black Garlic Lime Vinaigrette ($): bit. ly/TMl*Mulligatawny Soup w/ Chicken Confit ($): bit. ly/aik*Crab Cutlets w/ Red Chili Saffron Turmeric Remoulade ($): bit. ly/tfekR*House Smoked Salmon w/ Coconut Forbidden Rice ($): bit. ly/tfhwU*Lamb & Pork Meatballs w/ Green Chick Pea Relish & Strauss Yogurt ($): bit. ly/XFrvRm*Grilled Bavette Steak w/ Coriander Demi Glaze & Roasted Cipollini Onions ($): bit. ly/Mzmi*Ceylon Tea Semifreddo ($): bit. ly/ZPkqIaFrom start to finish, every dish was impressive with prominent Asian flavors with a fine dining approach. My favorites were the Mulligatawny Soup, House Smoked Salmon, Lamb & Pork Meatballs, and Grilled Bavette Steak. The Mulligatawny Soup was like a creamy thick curry soup that was packed with robust flavors and spices. I didn't get a taste of the confit since the BF was sick and I didn't want to touch his cooties but he said the chicken confit was ""velvety smooth"" (Yes, I trained him well!). The House Smoked Salmon was flakey albeit a bit dry but the smoky essence was delightful. I loved the accompanying forbidden rice as it had coconutty and nutty nuances. The Lamb & Pork Meatballs were deliciously succulent but the mouth watering chick pea and tangy Strauss yogurt is what sent this dish off the charts. This is a MUST order.  Another must order dish is the Bavette Steak. It was perfectly cooked to a medium rare and was very soft and buttery. The coriander demi glaze gave a floral earthiness making it one awesome fusion dish. Skip the Kale Salad as it was too pricey for the portion and I felt like it was missing something; nuts perhaps? The Crab Cutlets were like crab croquettes but would be more enjoyable if they weren't more than $ a ball. Capping off our dinner was the Ceylon Tea Semifreddo. If you're a texture whore like me, you will LOVE this dessert. The light creamy semifredo had a subtle tea flavor similar to earl grey tea. The soft creaminess against the crunchy rock sugar fragments and buttery crumbles were absolutely divine. I'm still dreaming of this dessert as I type. S E R V I C EWe came in for happy hour ( pm   pm) before dinner service started at  pm. Getting a drink in hand took a while (bartender seemed busy doing misc things) and the Crystal Bronx aperitif I had was weak. Overall, the staff was nice but green and service could have been more timely considering we were one of only two tables for dinner. I hope they speed up service because wait times may be long otherwise during peak hours. A M B I A N C E / D E C O R Industrial sheek,  Bar & Kitchen has a communal table, bar seating, and a small dining area  seating about  : bit. ly/ZcWC. I loved the quirky painting(s): bit. ly/ZVfGC which gave the dining area a fun, funky style. P A R K I N GEasy metered parking.  After ironing out some minor kinks,  Kitchen & Bar seems very promising considering they have unique, refined, and well executed dishes. Kudos to Chef Fernando for impressing the hard to impress food snob. Now, if you can offer some Siri Lankan language class for my dyslexic ass, it will be all good in the [SoMa] hood. After spending a fun day with friends in San Francisco, we decided to to end it with dinner at a new restaurant opening.  Bar and Kitchen. The address doesn't say much, but the service,atmosphere,and food said it all. Really a wonderful new experience. Lovely decor, warm welcome, and inventive menu. Servers very informative( as many dishes new to me) The menu permitted, many different tastes. It was advertised as Sri Lankan, but offered much more. We were able to taste several different dishes, all very new,interesting and delicious. The chef seems to know what he is doing. Oh, that kale salad, what a unexpected wonderful surprise. The egg hopper, I loved it. Never knew that cauliflower could taste so good. Finished dinner with a banana fritter, the best. I can' t wait to get back there and enjoy the rest of the menu, and wine selections. Might even repeat some that I already tasted. First of all, don't call  a Sri Lankan restaurant! Certainly, the menu is rooted in that heritage and there are standout dishes prepared with tradition and respect to the motherland, but the food also draws inspiration from around the world, particularly Spain and France. Does that make it global cuisine? I'm not sure, but the tasteful truth is that the flavors sing in unison. Two standout dishes were the raw kale salad and the lamb and pork meatballs, but my absolute favorites were the hoppers, served with a Jidori egg and two tantalizing sambols to mix and enjoy; and the fried heirloom potatoes, a modern translation done right, with the tumeric and fenugreek really pushing those tastebudsI'm sad I did not get to try the coriander seared bavette steak, but the feeling I got was that  was a neighborhood spot, ripe for revisiting, if even just for a glass of wine after work. I was lucky enough to attend a soft opening, but with that some of the service and timing were off. For example, some of our party received those delicious hoppers first while others waited about  minutes, and the sambols came out with no explanation and by themselves. I thought the menu to be a romantic one, so hopefully the servers will pause to explain the dishes and what goes with what going forth. Again, I think these were just opening hiccups and I can't wait to go back to be forced to upgrade this review to  stars. Random thought:Fellow Sri Lankan M. I. A. should pop in here next time she's in town. youtube. com/watch?v=ewRj… This is a fantastic new restaurant featuring Sri Lankan cuisine. All of the plates I tried were full of flavor and delicious! They also have an extensive wine list to complement and pair with the menu. The items I had the pleasure of tasting were:Sri Lankan vegetable pickle, black pepper, galangal Raw kale salad, coconut meat, black garlic lime vinaigrette, parmesanTraditional hoppers, Jidori egg, assorted sambolsCrab cutlets, dill, red chili saffron remouladeBraised sturgeon, black curry, crispy maitake, red basmati riceI would highly recommend all of these dishes and will indeed be returning to try out the ones I missed! The prices are reasonable considering the SF location as well. The restaurant decor and atmosphere are also very appealing and give off a cozy charm and fun vibe. The staff were all polite and courteous during my visit and I felt we received top quality service. Congratulations to the owner and head chef Brian Fernando for opening such an amazing place! Being Sri Lankan and loving my mom's cooking, I was excited to receive an invitation to the soft opening of the new (but sadly, only) Sri Lankan cuisine restaurant in San Francisco. The experience was sublime and the food delicious BUT if you've ever had traditional Sri Lankan food (or my mom's cooking) do not go in expecting a deja vu meal. There are a few items like the egg hopper with coconut and onion sambals that are truly Sri Lankan, but the menu can be described as eclectic fusion with only an ever so slight Sri Lankan nod. We sampled the sturgeon curry, cauliflower, crab cutlets, and smoked salmon with ""forbidden"" rice. All were delicious but I'd be shocked if any of it were on a table when a Sri Lankan friend invited you for dinner. I was really hoping for some true SL chicken or egg curry, stringhoppers, paripu, or even some plain hoppers to wipe up the sauces and sambals but no such luck. Heat/spice levels are definitely set at ""don't upset the gringos"" level. And the portions were pretty small so the bill may have been a bit more shocking if it weren't for the % discount of the soft opening. But despite my disappointment of not getting what I consider a real Sri Lankan meal, Brian Fernando seems like a very talented chef and I look forward to seeing how this restaurant and its food evolves. But, please Brian, can we get a few more real Sri Lankan offerings on the menu and the option to go sweat on the forehead spicy? At least, before I bring my mom in :)"|1|90|4|Routine Inspection| Food safety certificate or food handler card not available Improper food storage Inadequate HACCP plan record keeping Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities

My wife and I enjoy garlic in our dishes but this was too much. Loved it in  and loved it in .  Still fine sauces and wonderful service. Small and peasant.  Highly recommend GUESS WHO JUST TURNED ?!I'm a big girl now! and my big butt needs feeding, and for my birthday, the boy decided to be a little reminiscent so we showed up here!The temperature, uncomfortably hot. Interesting enough, I was so flustered that I wanted to play footsie with the boytoy but contained myself. The vibe, cozy and intimate. The restroom's the most intimate part though, I was practically hugging myself in there. The food, satisfying. Just to be a little serious here: Seafood Pasta: very aromatic and flavorful sauce; a bit runny however; would have preferred a thicker sauce IF it was an entree but since it was an appetizer, the lighter sauce was very fitting; the shrimp and scallop (though small bite sizes) were very crispy and fresh none of that soggy wet mushy alien meatCream of Watercress: good. I say good and nothing else because cream of anything tastes the vaguely the same to me. . . i. e: cream of asparagus, cream of broccoli, cream of watercress. . . i've always believed that it's the rich buttery cream taste people liked. Caesar Salad: slightly too much dressing; I liked how the parmesan wasn't overpoweringly strongRack of Lamb: the boy liked, me thinks mehh. . I like my rack of lamb crusty on the outside and a very pink, almost red center; this was a little too saucy for me. Lobster Tail: DROOL. that butter. . . that garlic. . . that bed of sliced potatoes. . . makes you just want to savor the flavor in your mouth and not eat anything else after!Cheesecake: the boy likes more than mousse. Chocolate Mousse: i like more than cheesecake. its quite bitter but very very rich and very very dark. *wink wink* Come hungry, my friends. . . and leave the diet behind. This is my favorite spot to eat when I come to San Francisco. We always stop by here and my favorite to start with is the soups! All of them to this date have been delicious! The portions are generous. I think my favorite thing is the fact that is nested in a little corner of Nob hill and is a very small little restaurant. I love the intimacy and the cuteness of the restaurant. Not to mention that the service is always top notch. My husband had a business dinner here, and he asked me to tag along. A small corner restaurant surrounded by steep streets. Trust me, don't expect to find parking easily, but don't discourage yourselves to try this place as well. Anyways, inside the restaurant, there were only around  tables, and the kitchen was very visible from where we sat. The whole ambiance made me think it was a house turned restaurant type. It was cute. Everything that the chef cooked permeated every corner of the small room. It smelled so good. The downside was, the aroma clung on my hair and clothes. LOL. That's not really bad, was it? I ordered the Chef's Menu and it included a bowl of Mushroom Soup, Seafood Pasta, Caesar Salad, Filet Mignon, Bordeaux (wine), Le Ganache Au Chocolat for dessert and Capuccino. C'est si bon! Et c'etait gratuit. Merci pour le patron de mon mari. : ) See, eating in a French restaurant brings out my French. LOL No, seriously, it was that good. You should try it. We had a large family celebration last night at Rue Lepic and the food and service were simply outstanding. Every part of the five course meal was delicious and beautifully presented.  The place is definitely small but it nicely accommodated our large group of .  I highly recommend this restaurant and look forward to coming back soon! Thirteen of us had dinner there tonight, special occasion, and everything was terrific. Great food, great service, fun atmosphere, just a wonderful experience. What a gem. John F Wonderfully unpretentious and intimate restaurant.  Service was well paced for ordering and serving.  You didn't feel like you were waiting and you felt you could have conversation and catch up with friends. The food was delicious and presentation was beautiful.  Very flexible chef's selection menu that allows you to try any entree or dessert.  I enjoyed the sweetbreads even after the generous portions of pasta, soup and salad. Best cheesecake I have ever had  amazingly light and creamy  almost like a panna cotta.  Passionfruit mousse was my favorite but all the desserts were perfect. I have wanted to come here for awhile and was delighted it lived up to my expectations. Simply amazing the food that comes out of this wonderful small restaurant and the service is so warm and attentive.  My parents have been going here for at least  decades and has always beena favorite of theirs and is now a favorite of mine. French done just right!  Beautiful food in a quaint intimate setting near the top of Nob Hill. There are many wonderful neighborhood bistros. . . . . this one is just so special. The escargot are unique and special. . . . . the sauces are sublime. . . . . . the waitstaff warm and friendly . . . . . and the wine list priced oh so right. I can't wait to get back to SF and go to Rue Lepic I love SAUCED up french food and this place gave me just that. Went for the obvious choice of the prix fixed menu and loved each dish. Was pleasantly surprised at how much food it came with as many French places can be pretty stingy with their serving size. So big plus for that!The restaurant itself is pretty casual but it's small and cozy enough to make a great date night if needed. The wait staff and owner were also super nice which makes you like this place even more. Overall, a super cute restaurant that provides great food for a really good price. My husband and I wanted to go to a fancy smancy restaurant and found RL on Yelp and it looked fancy enough for us so we checked it out. We were the first to arrive at the restaurant a few minutes before it opened up and we were greeted with do you have a reservation? We stated that we did not, which didn't seem to be a problem and we were seated in the ""nicest"" part of restaurant according to the owner. My hubby had the rack of lamb that came with yellow rice and veggies + a glass of cabernet and I had the rosemary chicken that came with veggies and a touch of saucy mash potatoes. I'm seriously impressed by the amazing food and this just might be the best dinner I've ever had. The two things I would say that need improvements would be the restaurant itself. It's very outdated and the other would be the servers were stiff to the point where the service was impersonal and a tad pompous. I also noticed that my waiter's attire was outdated as well and unclean, which isn't a big deal but something that should be looked into. Overall my husband and I did enjoy our meal and will certainly be making our way back to RL sometime in the near future. Our total bill with tax + tip included was $ for  entrees and  glass of wine and we both thought it was well worth it. Great job Rue Lepic! Simply amazing. It's been  years since I last was there until this Sunday. The food hasn't changed a bit and it still superb in every way & worth every penny. I love support a chef who is truly passionate about her restaurant (and beautifully dressed too). She is so personable to visit every table asking about your meal and kindly held the door for us as we exited. This is the perfect, romantic date spot. It definitely reminds me of a European restaurant. Needless to say, you won't be disappointed with the meal, service, or ambiance. Food was good, but pacing felt like I was in Europe, where the waiters show up so infrequently and the food comes out so slowly so you just enjoy yourselves at the table. For me, it was definitely too slow, but the food was simple and tasty. Not much parking around. Small room, but quaint. We had dinner here on a Wednesday night.  Walked in around :pm, and the restaurant was somewhat empty.  We were able to get seated right away even though we didn't have reservations. The place is pretty small.  They only had one waiter working.  I'm not sure if it's like that  every night or just weeknights.  The service is decent. I ordered their caesar salad which was $. .  It was a tad small for what they charge. Our entrees each came with a small bowl of soup (cream of mushroom that day).  We got the boneless breast of duck with an orange sauce ($) and the grilled tenderloin of beef with a cognac peppercorn sauce ($).  I thought the steak was very good.  Just the right size.  The peppercorn sauce was very tasty, and there was lots of it (which I like).  It also came with some scalloped potatoes (or was it potatoes au gratin?).  The potatoes were good as well. We were pretty full, so we didn't have room for dessert. I don't know why, but I think this is one of the most romantic restaurants in the City.  It's small to the point of being cramped.  The food is above average, but not great (I had the duck and she had the veal. . . both good but not great).  Menu hasn't changed in years.  Open kitchen, so it's slightly smoky.  But there's something about sitting by the window with someone special and it feels so good and right.  There are definitely fancier places with nicer decor, but this place just feels right to me.  This is the one place where I want to take my time eating my meal. Definitely order the chef's menu, a very good deal for the quantity and quality.  The service is spot on. . . . friendly and attentive but not annoying and fake.  Street parking in the neighborhood is impossible to find, so take a cab.  Aftwards, walk up the hill to the Fairmount or Huntington and have a night cap in the bar. Just happened to pass this place by  and was surprise that it was located just a block form the grand hotels (Fairmont, Mark Hopkins, Huntington, etc). It was Wednesday night and the place was quite jammed (good sign?) We were lucky to score a table right away because the place was quite small. Only one waiter (owner?) that night. Two kinds of menu offered, prix fixe and a la carte. we decided to go with the prix fixe. we were not disappointed! The filet mignon was cooked to perfection, and my friend had a salmon dish which he said one of the best he ever tasted! The wine list is small but did not disappoint. The baguette was one of the best outside of Paris. Love the pasta ! (who care if it's not French? I ate one of the best spaghetti in Paris by the Opera!) Very entertaining to see the chef (Adela) at work  (The kitchen was open) and you can tell that she really love this job! Food was lovingly prepared. This place reminded of Parisian bistro without all the fake decorations. The mango custard dessert was the perfect finale of the evening. Good place to get authentic French cooking without the ridiculous price tag.

Rue Lepic 1|4.0|French in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|183|1|3.66666666667|" I like to think of Rue Lepic as accessible sophisticated French food. The restaurant is small and intimate, not intimidating like some French restaurants I've been too. The staff are very hospitable and eager to help recommend dishes, wines and pairings. The food is simply: Parfait. It's the right combination of flavor and texture without being too rich as some French food can be. The portions are just right. You'll walk out satisfied not needing a nap. This place is near my Aunt and Uncle's place so I go as often as I can. They're big fans too. I came here after a fantastic show of Book of Mormon with my family, and we were as hungry as ever. We had already made reservations & it was a Wednesday night, so it wasn't too busy but the ambiance was good. For a  person staff, the service and food were both excellent. I have only been to a couple other French restaurants, none super expensive, but I think it is the best one I have been to so far!The soup, creamed cauliflower, was DELISH! Great with the hot bread served to us. I order the Filet Mignon, liked the sauce although it was a little reminiscent of a bbq sauce flavor, but nonetheless fantastic. My mom ordered the Rosemary Chicken, boasting its flavor and tenderness. My sister ordered the veal, which seemed a little subpar compared to our meals, but had a great sauce. The duck ordered by my dad was tasty, but not as good as expected.  Carrot and beans were amazing sides, as well as the scalloped potatoes. We ordered a creme brulee and mango mousse for dessert. Both were good as usual, nothing horrible or extraordinary. Overall, the staff was extremely nice and did exceptionally well for only have one chef. Food was served at a perfect time, hot, and delicious. I would come back again to try the lamb or seafood pasta! Dined here for our  year wedding anniversary. When I walked in I wasn't sure. . It seemed like there was absolutely nothing French about it. I was WRONG. The chef has been trained well. The food was exquisite. It was also a really good deal for the prie fix meal. The only thing I wished for was a decent wine list or a full bar. Otherwise, I will for sure be back! Had dinner here, other than the starter, shrimp in a Pernod sauce, the rest if the food was barely edible. The duck was tough, no crispiness to it, drowned in a very strong overpowering orange sauce, and the accompanying 'rice' had a very weird aroma, reminiscent of dirt, yes people, dirt. It tasted very odd as well, and when I complained about it, the waiter tried to tell me it was the spices, he mentioned cumin and turmeric, two spices I am actually very fond of. He then said he would taste it, which he did, and agreed that yes, it was very bad, and would I like some potato dauphinoise instead. My friends Filet Mignon was also not good. We did have some pureed vegetable soup, which was very tasty. Even the coffee was weak as hell. All in all a bad, bad experience, and certainly not one I could recommend. No reductions either in the bill, and considering I had to send the rice back, that was disappointing. I rarely if ever eat at French bistros in CA. Our French in SB is Bouchon (not related to the Vegas one to my knowledge but it may be) is extremely expensive but worth it on a special occasion (Valentine's Day, anniversary, birthday). In New York, I go to Bistro Chat Noir, Mon Petit Cafe, Quatorze Bis (once). The Upper East Side boasts many excellent French restaurants, not the least of which is Sel y Poivre, an old neighborhood family owned bistro. It's extremely reasonable the bargain prix fixe of the Upper East side for dinner .  for entree, appetizer and dessert! But my CT friend who traveled to SF for business a lot at one time always ate here. Just at the bottom of Nob Hill, down from the Mark Hopkins on  Pine Street, it's teeny tiny with unusually beautiful and comfortable chairs and tables close together. I was absolutely astounded by the food and the prices, far lower than I expected for a place of this caliber. It's  years old and you don't survive in the cutthroat restaurant business if you aren't exceptional. It's owned by a charming older Asian couple and frequented by a combination of locals and well to do tourists. One man came in by himself and ordered a Caesar salad (the best I've ever had, utterly perfect dressing, plenty of shaved cheese and tons of anchovies for just  or  dollars), a glass of wine and a dessert. I was shocked by the size and we were lucky on a Friday night during our mini vacation to San Francisco for the Afghan Whigs show at the Fillmore (review of this legendary venue forthcoming) to get the last table for two at PM. My boyfriend had the filet with cognac peppercorn, a generous cut of meat with some potatoes underneath. It was exquisite and entrees come with a cup of soup. The soup of the day was cream of vegetable, just a hint of cream, with a wonderful flavor. I never send things back due to temperature but the soup was barely warm so they happily took it back and it returned quite hot. The coffee was terrific and strong (I'm wondering if they serve my favorite coffee Peerless since that's a SF based company) but if you demand scalding hot coffee say so when you order. J had the best cheesecake I've ever tasted, far lighter than a New York cheesecake like he had at Cafe Majestic the night before. The creme anglaise was so good I could have had a cup of all by itself. Best of all for a place of this caliber, there are plenty of  and  dollar wines by the glass. In New York, it's gotten insane.  used to be the most expensive wine by the glass and now it's barely above average at a nice restaurant. Hotel bars are notoriously pricey but at the Gramercy Hotel bar (admittedly great), wines start at  or  and to up to the low s. Same with the Peninsula. It was an extraordinary meal and with an entree, two soups, a salad, coffee , dessert and one glass of wine just  before tip? I can't wait to eat there again when I'm hungrierP. S. : The bathroom is TINY. When I say tiny, I don't mean  or  feet by  or  feet. I mean it's like an airplane bathroom, just a bit longer. It's no big thing but it is a bit of a shock. Went here when my aunt and uncle were in town.   Very small place but they were able to seat us within  minutes without a reservation.   The food was outstanding and the priceas reasonable.   Our waitperson wasn't very knowledgeable about which wines to pair with what dishes but it didn't ruin the experience.   Overall a great experience. This place is close to me  I should come here more often!  We came here on a night when the Giants were playing so it was probably a little quieter than usual.  We had a lovely meal of vegetable puree soup (soup or salad is included with your entree)  m!  Good taste and comforting.  I wanted the lobster tails, but they were out of this so for some reason we were all in the mood for salmon.  I tend to like my salmon more on the plain side because I enjoy the taste of salmon itself.  Rue Lepic's sauce was a little heavy for my taste, but it had good flavoring.  I sopped up the sauce with bread  m!  The waiter recommended a nice, buttery chardonnay to go with our salmon. Service was real nice and attentive, and the chef came by and checked on us, which is always a caring touch.  And yes, the restroom is super tiny, haha.  But it goes with the charm of Rue Lepic.  Definitely a neighborhood plus. The absolute worst ""French"" food I've ever had the displeasure of eating. This place is bad. Really *really* bad. Barely edible. If you've lost your sense of taste perhaps this would be a good restaurant choice. For everybody else, avoid! Hey, you  guy or girl or couple from out of town looking for a French place to eat.  Yes, I'm talking to you.  I'm here with you right now.  (I'm not talking to the locals because they already know what I'm about to tell you).  Got two words for you: ""don't bother. ""  I won't get too much into the details.  Just find somewhere else.  This place is not as good as the French place where you're from.  Not even close.  On any level.  Ah ah ah ah ah. . . Shh. . . (I'm putting my finger on your lips now to shut you up).  Just. . . (whispering) just don't go. I've only been here once but I can truly say it is one of my favorite restaurants in SF. The food is phenomenal. The ambiance is like an old school Parisian brasserie. Real nice. The service is also very good. I had the veal roast as part of my prix fix menu. A great experience! I have been going to this restaurant for years. And it drives me crazy to see some of these idiot people who put these reviews on here like they have never stepped foot in this place. I think they must be thinking of another place or they are just morons stirring things up just to be mean. The folks here at Rue Lepic are the best. And the food is wonderful. Love this place. For those who gave those bogus reviews, get a life! This was my birthday dinner and someone recommended Rue Lepic so I did research on this French restaurant.  The pictures, in retrospect, are deceiving, because they make the place look romantic which it is not.  Nothing romantic about being on top of the next table and the open kitchen smoke blowing all over the place.  I ordered the Chefs Menu. But being an escargot lover, I asked to replace the seafood pasta with escargot which our waiter was more than happy to do.  In fact, he recommended it.  But, I'm a purist with escargot and this one was plated with noodles, some crazy butter/tomato sauce and basically tasteless.  The salad was ordinary.  The lobster, while good, was not presented well.   Rather sloppy looking.  the dessert was forgetful.  I saw no French in the kitchen.  Basically your run of the mill hispanics but the lady had it down to a science.  I'm given it two starts because the host/waiter was very professional and has been there for decades.  However, one time was enough for me. A well meaning but mediocre restaurant. Maybe the tourists will keep it going. Since it's often hard to figure out which reviewers know their food and which don't, I'll say which SF French restaurants I do like: Chez Papa and Zazie. (No, I haven't tried any of the really expensive ones. ) Readers can decide whether my opinion is worth taking seriously. General point: Food was overspiced, in some cases wantonly so. Lentil soup: blended smooth, but had too much salt and pepper mixture left a harsh aftertaste in the back of the throat. Le Poulet avec Rosemary: again, overspiced. (The beans and carrots were cooked perfectly; small compensation. ) However, the poulet was a miracle of restraint compared to the Filet Mignon, which had been drowned in Worcestershire sauce. I think I outgrew this style of cooking in fourth grade. Maybe fifth. Had we not been in a rush to see our show, we would have sent it back.  The cut of meat was not particularly flavorful, either. At $, this was a huge disappointment. Bottom line: if you want mediocre food before taking in a show in the theater district, save your money and go to Lori's Diner. (Of course the service was pleasant, but I've never seen the point of giving and withholding stars based on service. ) With French food offered by Asian proprietors in a small, simple space one block down (south) from California St. and its swanky  hotels, Rue Lepic is easy to miss. But the food is consistently excellent and offered at a lower price point than comparable cuisine at places like La Folie. Check it out. If Spartan seating arrangements aren't a problem, you won't regret it. I was catching up with a friend who was staying at the Four Seasons on Market and we decided to head out for dinner instead of getting hotel food. Rue Lepic popped up on Yelp and had good reviews and we decided that it would be a enjoyable walk in beautiful SF evening weather. No seriously. . . I like it when it is a little nippy. This really was a nice walk and a bit of a workaround up those steep hills which is good because I really worked up an appetite. This is a tiny quaint little restaurant. Service was not that great though. Our waitress was surly and never cracked a smile the whole time we were there. The food was good. Let me just cut to the chase. The ganache was OMG GOOD. Heaven on earth! Let me back track now. The pasta was delish and the caesar salad was good. The pea soup was all right. Slightly disappointed with the filet mignon. The sauce was not that great. So overall it was a satisfying meal though at $ (including an avg. bottle of wine) including tip was a little pricey given the overall experience. BTW, I think this place has the smallest restroom I have ever seen. You literally have to walk sideways to use it. They might have actually converted a closet. No biggie and I thought it was cool. You know, something different. Based on the recommendations of the yelpers we checked out this restaurant. Great place and food!  Highly recommend it! I dined here recently as it was nearby to the meetings I had in the city and decided not to schlep elsewhere for dinner with a friend. I was happy with my choice for that reason alone as it was raining on the evening in question and neither of us felt much like venturing out. I was actually quite impressed with this place. The atmosphere itself isn't very inviting, I have to admit, and the tables are extra cozy. But the menu is straight up French bistro and the service is actually quite nice. The wine menu, as mentioned elsewhere, isn't massive but the bottles they do have are very reasonably priced. My dining companion and I both ordered the chef's menu. The seafood pasta starter was delicious and a nice little portion. The soup  a generically described ""vegetable cream"" the night I dined  was also a delicious little course, delicately flavored and a nice velvety texture. The salad course was the weakest; the Caesar salad featured flaccid and overdressed greens and haphazard chunks of parmesan. They need to rethink the salad course a bit; a bitter greens salad would be a more welcome component to the meal. Maybe some arugula or mache. The main course  in my case, a red snapper special  was delicious and well prepared. It was slightly over sauced which masked the flavor of the fish and the sauce itself was very similar to the seafood pasta (think lemon butter herb). But I will say it was very tasty and while wasn't much of a looker, the flavors were pretty much balanced and what you'd expect from French cuisine. The highlight of my meal was the dessert. I chose the passionfruit mousse and was utterly impressed. It was tangy and tart with a great sauce and a lingering, almost faintly perfume y aftertaste that is iconic of a nice passionfruit. A light and fantastic end to the meal. All in all if they'd address the salad course and maybe freshen up the decor slightly it'd be a big improvement. Barring that I'd still happily dine here again; it seems from the reviews here that the meals are consistent from visit to visit and so is the service. The husband/wife team are very charming folks. On a cold rainy SF night, this little gem hit the spot and for that it gets four stars! A very small and cozy restaurant that is worth a visit. First of all the wine list is not extensive but very good and prices are reasonable. The Monthuy's Pere et Fils champagne was very good. The salmon according to my better half was ""incredible. "" My chicken was not very tasty and we thought was bland. Perhaps something was left out in the preparation. The soup, Cream of Watercress, was fabulous. I would return for a second visit in the future. Is it wrong to have dreams about seafood pasta? If so, I don't give a damn. That stuff is good. I licked the plate with their perfect baguette. We were in the city celebrating my friend's th birthday. So we partook of the chef's menu. I began with the seafood pasta. I am going back with my hubby just for that alone. Then the soup special was butternut squash. Dude. One of my favorite squashes. I ordered the scallop dish. It came with perfectly cooked asparagus, carrots and I kid you not, butter masquerading as potatoes. I love them. Scallops, veggies, butter. . . love. To cap of the evening I picked the passion fruit mousse. Yes. YES. YES!That is all. Okay, a little more. At the end they provided a bit of nougat and dark chocolate to put you over the top. The restaurant is in gorgeous Nob Hill. Just a short walk from the fabulous Huntington Hotel. It is a tiny restaurant, so make sure you make a reservation. If you go, even if you don't need to use the secret restroom. Go. It's so tiny. Bon appetit!Cheers!ps. Don't wear skinny jeans. You will have to unbutton them before the evening is through. I brought my mum here on her visit to SF and it was Mother's Day. Perfect setting in this small cosy restaurant tucked away in the heart of Nob Hill. It was her day and I wanted to give her the most personal one to one time, both with mother and daughter. We started of with the house mushroom soup which was fabulicious and I decided to have the duck. Fantastic  one word! Soft, tender and tasty. We paired it with a nice glass of sparkling wine. We had the one of the best time together in this quiet setting. I should bring my hubby here too!.  stars! .  stars.  It's a lovely, cute place, not surrounded by a lot of other establishments in the immediate vicinity.  For this, I liked it more at the get go.  The ambiance inside is very charming; quiet, but not too quiet because since there are maybe  tables in the restaurant, the background noise is the consistent hum of conversation from other patrons. I ordered the escargots (which was strangely served over spaghetti, but I really enjoyed it), the filet mignon (which was very flavorful, which it was just a little more tender like most filet mignons), and the creme brulee for dessert, which was excellent.  The temperature of the cream itself was very chilled and refreshing, and the glaze on top was perfect.  One of the better creme brulees I've had!I've lately been on a French food kick, and Rue Lepic did not disappoint!"|3|84|3|Routine| Permit license or inspection report not posted  [ date violation corrected: 11/5/2013 ] High risk vermin infestation  [ date violation corrected: 11/5/2013 ] Contaminated or adulterated food  [ date violation corrected: 11/5/2013 ]
Rue Lepic 2|4.0|French in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|183|2|4.01680672269|" Service:  starsFood:  starsFor those that don't want to read all this, I highly recommend the seafood pasta and the passion fruit mousse. I came here Christmas Eve for a romantic dinner date. We had reservations at PM, but didn't get seated a little after our reservation, It's understandable with the restaurant so packed. We were seated within two feet of the table next to us. Very cramped. It was dim inside the restaurant and we could hear the conversations going about us. I didn't expect it to be so loud inside. It was a little hard to flag down our server, and we noticed that the couple near us also had a hard time flagging down the same server. We ordered from the $ Chef's Menu. We were served with bread and butter to nibble on before our courses arrived. The Seafood Pasta was delicious. I always forget to tell the waiters to lighten the salt in my food, since I like foods with less salt. In the end, the pasta was absolutely delicious. They didn't skimp on the shrimp or the scallops in the pasta. There was plenty to go around. I originally thought the portion was small, but I learned later that all the dishes would fill me up. The soup of the day was spinach soup. Though I am not a big fan of spinach because of the after taste, the soup was surprisingly creamy and tasty. Next was the Caesar Salad. I'm not a fan of salads so I'm going to have to skip that part because I'm biased. The entree I chose was the special. It was big scallops with potato au gratin with some greens. By the time the entree came, I was so full. It was a mistake to eat the bread and butter and the salad. Except for the little grit, the scallops would have been wonderful. The sauce for the scallops was very similar to the the seafood pasta sauce. The potatoes were also very flavorful. The dessert was my favorite though. I got the passion fruit mousse with strawberry and kiwi puree (red and green for Christmas). The server got my order wrong, and gave me the creme brulee instead. But when it got to his attention, he quickly got me the dessert I ordered. The mousse was light and airy. Just tart enough, with a mild sweetness to it. When putting some of the puree with the mousse it was the perfect combination. I'll definitely be coming back when I want to splurge on some good food. Great dinner. I had the duck the first time time and had the sweetbreads this last time. One of our friends (male in gender) had the pork loin and it wasn't a large enough portion for him. Charming and cozy.  Wine is moderately priced. The California wines were limited; brush up on your French wines. Nice small restaurant!  Came here on a Thursday night and there was plenty of street parking at :. The bread was tasty and the salad was just ok, nothing special. I got the duck which was good while my friend got the rack of lamb which was also delicious (I usually can't stand the gamy taste of it). Portions were generous that you will leave with a full tummy. The highlight was probably the seafood pasta however, it was cooked very well. When I was there on a Thursday night at around , there were maybe  other tables occupied. Within  minutes, the restaurant was empty except me and my friend so the ambiance was !@#$ing great but I can see how it can get noisy if the restaurant had a full house. TLDR: This is a very safe restaurant so to speak, everything was well done but not mind blowing. Not sure if I would come here again though with so many other restaurants in the city. What an odd little place. This French restaurant is owned and run by a very nice Korean family. The strangest thing is that when you close your eyes and inhale, it actually smells like an Asian restaurant. The food was dynamite, but it was difficult to enjoy with the lack of ventilation in the joint. The place is constantly engulfed in greasy smoke and after you leave, your clothes will reak. This was a peculiar place but we still enjoyed ourselves and had a good laugh about the situation. I really like this place.  The food is consistently good and the staff are always nice to me and my guests.  It's not a  star restaurant, but it's not meant to be and doesn't charge like one.  I've been eating here for  years now. I had a very nice business dinner at this tiny restaurant. There are only about  tables very close together. You almost have to go across someone's lap to get to the restroom. The wine list is short and okay but nothing special. The shrimp salad was just okay  the shrimp were a little bland. However, the main courses were delicious. The sauces were fabulous. I had the duck breast and it was to die for. The desserts were also wonderful. I wouldn't go here for a romantic dinner as it is so close and a little noisy. Great food and service there! So ignore all the other reviews. Rely on me because I know San Francisco and I know my stuff . TRUST ME. I stay on Nob Hill on a regular basis.     had dinner at Rue Lepic and it was outstanding.  Warm/hot sourdough roll, outstanding French wines by the glass, prompt service, mom and pop type operation with  tables.  Simple menu with several seafood choices; I had a rack of lamb which was excellent.  This is not Gary Danko or Michael Mina, just a neighborhood place which is really, really good and a solid option if you want a great restaurant with a short walk from Nob Hill.  Will be going back and looking forward to return trip!  Also outstanding in the immediate neighborhood is The Big  at the Huntington Hotel and Nob Hill Cafe. Amazing food, amazing service in a cozy ""bistro""setting!  We'll definitely return. I ate here recently after passing by for years as a local. Overall food was good, service very good. Ordered the lower priced prix fixe and we were stuffed by meals's end. Fresh, crisp outside & soft inside bread with very cold butter. Seafood pasta  don't order the prix fixe if you don't like seafood. Very hot (in temperature) and nice flavor with actual seafood in it like shrimps & what I think were baby scallops. Caesar salad w/generous shavings of parmesan cheese. Pretty good. I ordered extra dressing on the side after reading reviews that it was too dry, but it didn't really need more since it had plenty of parmesan cheese to flavor it. No visible pieces of anchovy, to my dismay, as I love it in my caesar salads. Soup of the day  cream of cauliflower. Not my favorite veggie due to lack of much flavor, but it was nice in soup form. Picked the duck a l'orange entree and was slightly disappointed. I think a couple of outer slices were maybe a little overcooked as I found them chewy. Came with seasoned rice, asparagus, and carrots. Tasted my dining partner's choice of the rack of lamb & think I liked that dish better. Live & learn. Dessert was a super dense almost fudge like chocolate mousse with some sort of creme w/kiwi & berry sauce, which helped balance the sweetness. Pretty darn good, not complaining. So the food overall was good & I might go again in the future, trying other entrees or ordering a la carte. Very good service, water glass always filled, dirty plates taken away, etc. Small place so the table are very close to one another. Don't eat here if you prefer to have a private conversation. We liked it but then stopped liking it. Maybe just a few times were enough. It did not become one of our regular faves. More for special occasions, a bit too fussy for regular dining. I travel to San Francisco twice a year and I make it a point to have dinner at Rue Lepic, its fabulous! I agree with the review that said, "" don't pay attention to someone who said it is expensive. . . . "" They are just cheap! Believe me, it fabulous, and not expensive! Go eat and enjoy! This restaurant never fails.  Very cozy and friendly restaurant serving excellent French food with excellent sauce.  We find that their Menu is excellent and a good bargain.  Wonderful seafood pasta as appetizer, and great soup, salad, and lobster tail with very tasty sauce.  We have eaten in this restaurant at least  times now, and we are impressed with the consistently excellent food and good service, as well as excellent wine. cesar salad  $. escargot pasta  $. orange roughy (special)  $. chardonnay  $. ticket came to $ for one, $ with tipsalad was not very good; little dressing, not much flavorescargot pasta was excellent with wonderful saucebread was excellent and essential for cleaning up the saucesorange roughy was a little overcooked and thus too fishy, but the sauce was excellent as was the substrate of potatoesService was truly excellent, with great attention to personal service and detail. Like so many SF restaurants, a mixed bag and quite expensive. I would go back, though. We dropped in with a friend last night and snagged a table that was available because someone didn't show up for a reservation. I had the beef tenderloin in pepper sauce with string beans. My partner and our friend had the salmon filet. The service was prompt and efficient. The beef was cooked medium rare, as requested, and was of a good quality. I asked for the pepper sauce on the side, and it was on top of the beef. I don't know whether this was by accident or because the chef doesn't believe in making that kind of alteration. I'd only made the request because I'm on a very low carb diet and figured the sauce had flour in it. The dish was delicious, carbs be damned. The salmon was reportedly quite good as well. The atmosphere was quiet in a relaxing way. I would definitely return. Super cute little place in Nob Hill.  Ambiance is very French I definitely got the feeling that I could be in a small French cafe just outside Paris.  Or maybe that was just the  glasses of wine I had.  Their wine list is not great so if you have a bottle to bring, corkage is only $. For $. , you can get the prix fix which comes with seafood pasta (lots of seafood, nice garlic flavor to wake up your tastebuds), soup, salad, entree, and dessert.  I had the veal and it wasn't spectacular, but solid.  There is only one chef (an Asian lady) who was working by herself on a busy Saturday night and she definitely had her game face on, but at the end of the night was opening the door as guests left and smiling. Great place to bring a date or some sophisticated friends for great food and conversation. Had Mothers Day dinner here last night and what a treat!! PLEASE disregard any reviews that say its too expensive  . Its a French restaurant in Nob Hill . You get what you pay for which is quality and amazing food . Those people are cheap skates and shouldn't complain when you know how expensive food in SF is, go somewhere else then or read the menu and decide if its in your budget. I feel better now, onto the meal. I had the chef menu $ and includes Seafood Pasta  to die for, I wish i could just order this as an entréeSoup of the day  we had cream of pea which was soo tasty House salad or Caesar  both very good, I would go with the caesar next time Entrée from the menu  I choose the chicken which was succulent, SO flavorful and a good portion. The boyfriend had the duck which too was great Dessert  Crème brûlée This is a GREAT choice for special dinners or events! Two people can easily share the chef menu with the other getting just an entrée. Service was very attentive and informative  I can't wait to go again! : ) Great food, great service, and what an awesome location. Love the big window view onto Mason / Pine. Simple menu and reasonable prices for what you get. Had the duck a l'orange which was fantastic. Good place for a date or a small group dinner. Adorable. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and attentive. From fresh warm bread, to creamy corn soup, to a decadent serving of tender salmon  every course of our meal was presented beautifully and served with love. The passionfruit mousse was the highlight of my meal. Dreamy, fluffy, and packed with flavor. My mom and I dove into that thing with fervent bites, and in a matter of seconds, the plate was barren. For a cozy, charming, and lovely dinner  prepared with care  Rue Lepic is your spot. Trust. Simple non French ambiance but good food and wine. Reasonably priced, well made. Don't make it a romantic spot, but do go here. i love rue lepic. everytime i come here, we're treated like family. think we've tried just about everything on the menu, and have never had a bad meal. we followed ken and arintha from white rock cafe in san jose, and although we sorely miss the proximity of white rock and their back door bbq plates, having rue lepic further up in sf is definitely good for the waist line. :)my favorites: seafood pasta, soup of the day, sweetbreads, rack of lamb, creme brulee, peach sorbet, berries with creme anglaise, passion fruit mousse, whatever wine pairings ken serves up. . . What a find! And just a block from our hotel. We were seated at a lovely  corner table for  in the window. The prefix dinner is the best deal in the city so much food, each course better than the previous pasta dish was full of seafood in a lite sauce over angel hair, cream of vegetable soup,caesar salad. We chose the veal and lamb entrees both were excellent. So much food we took home half our entrees and the superb creme brûlée desserts Excellent food, excellent service, and good value for the money. Good choice for traditional French cuisine.  The room is quite modest, but the service is good, and the food is very good.  I recommend the ris de veau.  Good value.  We've returned several times.  Good pinot noir by the glass.  A nice cauliflower soup on a recent visit. I am so shocked by the  star reviews for this restaurant. There was nothing and I mean nothing good about this place. We were unable to get a reservation for any decent restaurant on short notice, so we decided to try this place. The restaurant is small, you are practically on top of the tables next to you and feel as if you are dining with them. It was very uncomfortable as the couple seated next to us were listening to our conversation the whole evening. There is one waiter and one chef. You may ask yourself how is this possible? It isn't. The waiter gave terrible service. Dinner took almost  hours, we ordered the tasting menu and had to request dessert and the check multiple times and ate dessert with our coats on rushing to get to our show. Which we missed the opening act (the show was a block away). The server absolutely ignores any attempt you make to get his attention, we had to get up and walk over to him multiple times. The busboy was the only redeeming factor as he was pleasant and kept our water glasses full. As I mentioned we ordered the tasting menu. I chose the lobster tail option, my bf ordered the filet with a peppercorn sauce. The meal starts with a french bread roll, clearly not house made. First course was a seafood angel hair pasta. I can not tell you how awful this particular dish was. First of all, the dishes are clearly plated before service and warmed in the microwave for service. The plating is a disaster, a mound of overcooked pasta, with an excessively garlicky sauce slapped on top with mushy seafood bits scattered around. This was truly cafeteria style. It came to the table with literally tons of steam emitting from the pasta. There is no doubt it was microwaved. I found the dish to be inedible. The amount of garlic in it was not acceptable. My bf ate it, only because he was hungry. The waiter did not bother to ask if there was an issue with the plate even though it was clear I had barely touched it. The second course was a cauliflower soup. One word SALT. The soup also came out piping, steaming hot, it was also microwaved. Third course was caesar salad. This was unremarkable save for the fact the dressing was store bought. It isn't hard to make caesar dressing and is unforgivable to serve a generic sysco dressing at a supposedly higher end French restaurant. Next was the entree. My lobster tail was disgusting to look at. It was certainly not fresh, it's appearance was that of rubber or plastic. Dare I say it also could have been microwaved? I knew immediately I could not eat it. My bf was sweet enough to switch with me. He said it was bad. There was some sort of pureed something under both of our entrees (to refresh my new dish was a filet) I suppose it was a potato. One thing I should mention also is that the veg side is boiled carrots, al a old folks home or cafeteria style!! It's truly banal, truly bland, truly unmentionable. The filet was fine, but combined with the rest of the courses, not worth the price. Lastly, dessert. I had an unremarkable creme brulee and my bf had a fruit tart which came recommended by the waiter, but I suspect because it was several days old and they were looking to unload it. This place was a MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. I can't express enough how cafeteria this place was. From the terrible service, the awful plating, the microwaved dishes and the frozen seafood. . all of it was bad. Don't go here. Please. Probably one of the worst meals i've ever had. The food was just bad, everything tasted salty. I ordered salmon and ended up eating the potatoes it came with. the cauliflower soup was so watery, even the garden salad tasted bad, the dressing was awful.  Honestly, the bread and dessert two things that were ok to eat, but nothing special. A charming little place. . . so cozy. . . perfect for a date or catching up with friends.  Hubby's b day, figuring out what and where to eat. . . been wanting to try this place so we called.  They can accommodate us so we took a cab in anticipation of drinking some wine. . . and it was a cold wet night.  I love the French doors they use as part of their decorations.  The waiter was very friendly and helpful and we were sat at the window corner table. What we had:Chef menu  $.   it is a steal.  It comes with seafood pasta (so flavorful), soup of day (cream of mushroom  creamy with a nice texture and flavor), garden or caesar salad (garden salad with a light dressing), choice of entrée from menu (roasted rack of lamb with a garlic and fresh mint beurre rouge)  hubby said it was bone licking good, and dessert (chocolate mousse w/ creme anglaise served w/ strawberry and kiwi sauce) extra special with a candle. escargots $.    escargots sauteed in garlic butter, parsley and tomato sauce  what's not to love, delicious!fish of day  bass in lemon caper sauce with potato gratin, asparagus  $  generous portion, flaky meat, yummybottle of French red $  great valueWill definitely return. . . Great little French place that has some amazing sauces to adorn their entrees. We had the  course chefs menu and never looked back. I had the veal in a mushroom sauce and my fiancee had the duck, both amazing, but her sauce was better. The Creme Brulee was the perfect ending to an amazing meal. I finally went after  years of living across the street (haha). The escargot in tomato cream pasta was amazing. Everything else was pretty good, but nothing to write home to ma about. =) I would definitely go back for the escargot. I could have just had the escargot. The soup was amazing too. I wonder if I could just order both to go. This small restaurant has a cozy French atmosphere, and a menu that matches: small and very traditional. If that's your thing, the execution is good, and you'll love it. If it's not your thing. . . you'll be bored.  The courses  salad, soup, entree  are textbook French and well prepared. The soup (included with the entree) varies from day to day; we had cream of watercress, good but not extraordinary. The entrees are all variations on the same theme: protein over potatoes covered in sauce, vegetables on the side. The sauces are tasty and the meat is cooked very nicely but. . . it's not my thing.  I was bored. Having said that, I did like the Pernod shrimp salad, which had a nice contrast of cooked and raw ingredients, and was far and away the most creative item on the menu. The wine list has both depth and variety and we were very happy with the Bordeaux we ordered.  Service was indifferent, though, and not much of a help navigating the wine list. The menu is not vegetarian friendly at all, and neither is the approach to food; parties with vegetarians would be better off looking elsewhere. We parked in a garage near Sutter and hiked, as in, hiked up three streets with a severe deg incline to get to rue Lepic in Union Square in the Nob Hill area. The tiny French restaurant has about  tables and was kind of humid. I think the ventilation could use some modification, or else they could put up some kind of a partition between the kitchen and the restaurant per se. We had reservations for  pm; one of our party arrived on time (we were about  min late) so we were seated immediately. We ordered filet mignon au poivre vert, mackerel, and magret de canard l'orange (duck). All entrees came with rice or potatoes au gratin and a green vegetable, as well as a bowl of pureed corn soup. My filet was overcooked but had a decent taste, and there wasn't much duck, but our two friends enjoyed their meal. The star was the escargots sautéed in garlic butter, parsley, and tomato sauce and served on angel hair pasta. The escargots were already removed from the shells. Excellent. The rolls were crisp and warm, and I am told the butter was fantastic (I don't eat butter). The meal was paced well and we weren't rushed, and the waiter was pleasant. We opted not to partake of dessert. Would probably not return. Good service, odd wine list, food good bit not good enough to go back. We were looking for a pre show reasonably priced restaurant in the Nob Hill area and Hubby made a good pick. It's a  long blk (down and up a steep hill) from the Masonic Auditorium, but well worth the hike to dine here. They have a  course prix fixe dinner menu (see Manabu M. 's ROTD /) which is about $ for  courses, and about $ for lobster in the  course meal. We raved about the shrimp pasta appetizer, it was followed by the Caesar salad which was over spiced with pepper (no anchovies). Had we known it was peppered, we would've refused more pepper when the waiter offered. The corn soup was bland and watery. For entrees, we had a rack of lamb (good), duck (better than the lamb), fillet Mignon (good) and I really liked my sea bass, cooked just right in butter sauce with a delish scalloped potatoes, tender green beans with carrot wedges. Dessert included a tiny creme brulee' (good), berry tart (I didn't like this one) and peach sorbet which BFF also ordered. The sorbet was wonderfully refreshing and filled inside a hollowed out REAL frozen peach which I took several bites of. Our bottle of French pinot noir was fruity and delicious, $. We've tried several restaurants in the area before a show and this one is my favorite. You should make reservations before or by :PM to ensure a leisurely  hrs. to enjoy the meal before you make the hike up the hill to the Masonic. Our waiter was attentive but very busy as he's the only waiter in the entire dining room which holds probably a max of  guests.  A large portrait of the owner hangs on the wall next to the tiny unisex bathroom.  The bathroom is very small.  I think a  lb person would feel very claustrophobic in there as I was feeling sandwiched in as well.  I understand from the waiter that the restaurant has been there about  yrs.  That should tell you something about the food. This is a classic french restaurant that is all about the sauces. Our table had four different main courses (chicken, lamb, beef, and salmon) all with different sauces. I have recently been diagnosed with gluten intolerance so I was a little concerned about the sauces, but our waiter said there was no wheat in the sauce for the chicken, but in fact would be happy to make my chicken with a lemon butter sauce instead if I wanted. They were very accommodating The cream of mushroom soup was great and thickened with potatoes. Dessert included a number of sorbets, and mousses with passion fruit and kiwi. This is a very small place maybe  tables. They have not spent a fortune dressing the place up to look WOW, but it was nice and clean. Just real good food. There is no bar, but a good wine list. It is just a few blocks from Union Square so if your staying around there it is much better than most of the places there. They had a great prix fixe menu, but we didn't try it this night. Being so small reservations would be recommended. We are a regulars and come here for any special occasion.  We love the  course meal with lobster.  It is a great value for the price.  All the courses are delicious from the soup to the fruit dessert.  The waiter is always so nice to us.  I would recommend going here! Great food, and great service.  I've been here twice, and am looking forward to coming back again.  Before coming here, I had never before had sweetbreads or escargot.  After having tried them here, I am afraid to try them elsewhere because they were fantastic, and I don't want to be disillusioned from my newly discovered love for both of these foods.  I absolutely recommend giving this place a try.  One thing of note that speaks volumes about their service and how much they care for their customers: A vegan friend of mine who came here with me sat down, and immediately discovered that virtually everything on the menu is not vegan friendly.  However, when she asked the waiter about vegetarian or vegan options, the server immediately said that they would happily prepare a special vegetarian pasta for her.  To her great joy, the pasta was fantastic.  If only every restaurant was as customer friendly! not worth the money AT ALL.  So so average.  Just like this review. Rue Lepic is one of San Francisco's true classical neighborhood restaurants that has retained it's original personality and style and not in need to conform to any of the latest fads. I was happy to revisit after many years. Each dish is prepared with traditional sensibility yet the robustness and just the right flavor to offer your tummy content.  You won't just get a dab of something, and the flavor will always take precedence over artistic presentation. Food needs to look appealing, and there is no lack of that here, but there is no need to go abstract here. Make sure to make reservations if you are a prime time diner. Parties of more than five definitely might require more room that Rue can provide, as this is a more intimate establishment. Keep the kids home if their palettes aren't well developed or know proper etiquette. Your dining experience (and the others within close proximity) will appreciate your thoughtfulness. Am surprised Rue Lepic does not have more reviews. . . this is another small venue restaurant tucked away on a corner street. The Chefs menue is superb, and be prepared to be very satisfied with the food, service, and small restaurant feel. Definitely make reservations before coming here. My family and I came here a few months ago for my graduation and it was an amazing experience. The service was excellent, the food was divine, and the atmosphere definitely was great. Their prix fixe menu is a great deal and will definitely leave you satisfied. I decided that my first review will be on Rue Lepic. . . That's just how amazing this place is for me. First off, a little bit about myself. . . . I'm a bargain hunter foodie and my goal in life is to find the best restaurants without hurting my wallet. So back to my review. Rue Lepic has a five () course prix fixe menu that is less than $. The five () course meal comprises of THE seafood pasta, salad, soup, main entrée, and dessert  I don't normally eat seafood but I made an exception with the seafood pasta because it is truly amazing. The salad is basic, the soup is puréed so you can't really distinguish what it is you're having only that you know it taste good, the main entrée allows you to select from a variety of options (I always go for the Filet Mignon, which is always a good choice) and the dessert. . . oh the desserts. . . can't really pick the best one because they are all so good. The restaurant has a very comfortable appeal to it. It's not like other French restaurants where you feel obligated to dress up  don't get me wrong, you have to dress nicely, no shorts and flip flops, to eat at Rue Lepic because IT IS fine dining just without having to file for bankruptcy after dinner.  The service is wonderful and I love how they wait for everyone in your party to finish eating before serving the next dish. The staff is very friendly and you can keep asking for warm bread. . . I like the bread. :)The only down side for me is parking. Parking SUCKS! I remember one time that my parents and I waited an hour and a half just for parking. I'm not a patient woman but that night, I was THE most patient person in the world. Rue Lepic to me is two () thumbs and two () big toes up. Like I said, you don't have to pay a lot to get good food and service. :)  Happy eating! Like WHOA!What an amazing neighborhood gem. We stumbled upon this little tiny French influenced, Japanese owned restaurant. There's only  chef and she's the bomb. You can watch her cook right from your table. L O V E everything on their menu. . . great wine selection and just amazing, amazing deliciously sauced good hearty French food. I'm drooling as I'm picturing my last meal there. I'm not a local in SF by all means, but every time I'm in town I always stop by. Call ahead to make reservations, they get packed! We usually walk home afterwards cause all that heavy sauces and food just sits in our belly enough to hybernate for the rest of the month. Everything here is excellent. One of the best dining experiences I have ever had.  Venue is small.  Make reservations and be prepared to be totally satisfied. Smell sauces and wines. Relax over five courses. . . Discussion is art Talking about food quality per dollar here, with reasonable ambiance,. Superb classic French cuisine at a non inflated price. Chef's menu is a real bargain, with appetizer, soup, salad, entree, & dessert for $. Quality wine by the glass also. My family ate here and we thought it was delicious. We had the five course meal. We had the duck, lamb, steak, and veal. The lamb was the best in my opinion. The passion fruit sorbet was a bit overpowering. Two words, SIMPLY AMAZING. . I've been watching how much I eat lately but when I started eating I couldn't stop.  I know the chef so she kept sednig me food.  I ordered a filet mignon and a glass of the house pinot and wow!  I was served a seafood pasta first and than a cream of asparagus and cauliflower soup.  The bread was hot the service was excellent, I didn't want to leave and I can't believe it but I even finished the brownie taste of the chocolate gelato over a white cream.  Definitely recommend it to anyone!  Compliments to the beautiful chef! muah Great restaurant!I wasn't a great fan of French restaurants, but after going to this place I've become a fan. I've been there several times now. My gf took me there for my birthday a few years back and we both loved it so we go there about once every other month. We try something new on the menu each time, and it's always been great. I think the menu changed a little since we first went there, but it's great. The owner is really nice as well. It's a Japanese woman who studied in France. The waiter got our order wrong once and she took it off the bill and gave us free desert. While visiting San Francisco on business, I had the pleasure of eating here. The host (waiter, owner, manager?) insisted in the corn soup was the best soup in the city and he might be right. The only negative was the caesar salad, which wasn't as green as I'd like and didn't seem overly fresh. The sauteed salmon was absolutely terrific. As others have said, the place is very small and intimate, which lends itself to a very nice dining experience. Highly recommended! I really wanted to like this place but the service left me feeling unenthusiastic. We ordered the escargot and it was very good and the sauce was delicious. My husband had the red snapper which was okay and I had the duck breast. The duck itself was good but the orange sauce was way too sweet and I didn't finish my entree. Overall, the food was good but the service was lacking. The woman who greeted us didn't even want to greet us and our server was border line nice. It was unexpected at such a cute little French restaurant. If you want to be technical, I give this restaurant .  stars. The bf and I booked this restaurant for our  year anniversary dinner. The restaurant itself is small, with   tables and romantic lighting. I was instantly attracted to the prix fixe menu it's a fantastic deal! Not only is it on their menu regularly, you get  courses for only $. ! I am not a big person but I pack a big appetite. I met my match with this meal! Complimentary bread and butter: crispy outside, soft interior and fantastic taste! We of course asked for more! st course: seafood pasta that smells DIVINE! It included angel hair pasta with bits of shrimp and baby scallops and fresh cilantro. It was REALLY REALLY good and I would have been very happy if it was my main course. nd course: soup. I learned it was a mixed vegetable soup. It was creamy, at the perfect temperature and scrumptious! rd course: cesear salad. Classic and came with yummy croutons (probably made from the same bread we were served)th course: HOLD UP! I must divulge something about the entree. Usually when restaurants offer a prix fixe menu, they limit what entrees you can choose. Not here! You get to pick ANYTHING off the menu. They definitely get a star for that! I ordered the duck breast with orange sauce with a side of rice, asparagus and carrots and my bf ordered the grilled tenderloin with peppercorn sauce with a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus. Both were YUMMY! th course: dessert! Same thing here with the entrees you can pick whatever you want! The table next to us ordered the fresh peach sorbet (really impressive looking but it would have been too cold for me). I opted for the chocolate mousse with creme anglais with strawberry and kiwi sauce. DELICIOUS! The chocolate was creamy and rich and the fruit sauce went so well with it.  Afterwards, we paid the bill and left. A woman who I'm presuming is the owner, graciously opened the door for us, thanked us and told us she appreciated us coming. How sweet is that?! We left with big smiles and full tummies. I definitely want to go back (I've already mentally picked my entree. . . I was eyeing the veal and the passion fruit mousse). This is a cute restaurant, nicely located in Nob Hill area of SF.  We did not have a reservation, but were lucky enough to nab a table on Friday night after waiting  minutes or so. We (party of four) were seated at a table close to the kitchen, against a wine rack that had to be accessed twice during our meal.  That meant leaning into/over the table while the bottle of wine was found by the server/host and pulled from the rack.  Two of our party could not get in and out without both of the other members of the party getting up and stepping away from the table.  We were inches from other diners and could hear their conversations word for word when we were not speaking to each other.  The restaurant is quite dark (with nice touches of candles on tables and around the restaurant), so reading the menu (for me) was a bit tricky.  The restroom was clean and nicely decorated.  The service was really slow.  After reading the rave reviews about the service, I think it might have been a fluke for us.  It appeared that the manager/owner/host was also serving, so perhaps one or more of his servers did not show up that night?  Not sure, but we weren't in a hurry.  I think tables could have turned a little more quickly if service was a bit more attentive. We were there for  / to almost  hours, and there were tables still occupied with people who had come before us. At least we weren't rushed.  Our server (or host/manager?) seemed a bit irritated with us when we asked questions about the menu, but then showed us a bit of humor later on in the dinner.  Our water glasses were always filled by the bus person, and warm, crusty rolls were offered. Between the four of us, we ordered two filet mignons with green peppercorn sauce and the seafood special, a halibut in a lemon butter sauce.  The entrees came with soup.  We were first told it was cream of vegetable soup, then told it was split pea when it arrived.  It was definitely a green, creamy soup with a delightful flavor and was light  I'm pretty sure it was a mix of vegetables versus split pea.  We all loved it.  My husband ordered a green salad which was okay.  The filets were covered in a nice, velvety sauce (perfectly peppery) and cooked to order, but the meat was somewhat tough and fatty  very unusual for a filet mignon.  My husband and I split oneof the filets, and the server brought the plate out and put it between us.  Huh?  I used my bread plate for my portion of the meal.  My daughter's halibut was fishier than any halibut we've ever tasted, although the sauce was very nice  light, flavorful and rich.  The accompanying vegetables were well cooked and flavorful.  The highlight of the meal was dessert.  We shared berries in creme anglaise, a special dessert  a sort of fruit tart, and the peach sorbet in the frozen peach.  They were all yummy and refreshing. We picked a bordeaux wine in which, about halfway in to our first glass, we all were disappointed.  That was our mistake.  Overall, we had a nice time, but I wouldn't say this is one of the best french restaurants we've enjoyed.  It really felt cramped  not like a cute bistro or European cafe.  It felt like they were packing as many tables as they could manage into the restaurant, so it was awkward and uncomfortable.  Perhaps tables near the window had more space.  The food seemed inconsistent and the service was lukewarm at best. We'll try it again sometime.  It's worth a second try. RUN, DO NOT WALK , TO THIS RESTAURANT!!Totally charming, romantic little gem! The service is perfect.  The wine list is well thought out.  The food is awesome!  We had a party of  so we sampled almost all the main courses and everyone was enraptured to the point of ordering extra bread to wipe their plates clean.  The Fish Special of the Day is always great.  The Sweetbreads are some of the best in the City and I love the Filet Mignon in Cognac Sauce.  Portions are generous and the sauces. . . . did I mention the sauces? How can such a tiny kitchen put out so many different sauces?  Each one is utterly delicious.  In France they say ""Le sauce est tout!"" and it's certainly true here! Classic Bistro Cooking at its best! Situated close to the Grace Cathedral, Fairmont Hotel, Mark Hopkins Hotel is Rue Lepic.  The outside of the restaurant is very unassuming but once you walk in, a wonderful dining experience awaits you.  We have been going here for years and highly recommend the  course pre fix menu.  For a very reasonable price, you get a salad (choice of house greens/caesar), seafood angel hair pasta (delicious!), soup of the day, main course (we really like the lobster and the filet mignon, and than end with a dessert (can't go wrong with their fresh fruit with grand marnier sauce sauce). The staff is always so friendly and cordial.  The restaurant is a small so would recommend making reservations.  Parking in Nob Hill can be a pain but there are a couple parking garages located a block away on California and Taylor.  When you go into the restroom, you will understand how small the place is. Overall a great dining experience.  Already looking forward to the next time we go. Gf and I went there to celebrate our anniversary and had a great time, an amazing service and a cozy ambiance. We went for the prefix  course menu  highly recommended. Given that is small, you feel the service is more dedicated and you can see the people in the kitchen from your table working on your food. As others reviewers mention, if you are not comfortable with the food smell, you most likely won't enjoy it. Great food, nice ambiance, a good bottle of wine and the lady was ready to hold on to me for another year!. Rue Lepic is hands down a solid four star dining experience.  Their wonderfully pleasant chef  consistently serves delicious cuisine with a smile, its matched by the charming and attentive wait staff of this small restaurant.  Patrons tend to be older than average for a San Francisco restaurant and if you enjoy a quiet composed dining atmosphere, give it a try.  bon appetite I went there with my friends since one of them had been there before and liked their food. we got  course dinner and everything was great!  i got a seafood dish of the day, which was scallop.  it was amazing!  i am planning to take my mom there while she is here. although their food was great, my only complaint is that the place was cold. . .   and don't be surprised how small their bathroom is. After yet another great meal tonight, I am compelled to let everyone know of a secret I've kept for years  Rue Lepic.  It's a girlfriend tradition  drinks at Top of the Mark, followed by dinner at Rue Lepic, for many years now.  As a former resident of Paris, I crave this little place: it's ordinary meets extraordinary, and not pretentious at all. There's a neighborhood y feeling of welcome when you come in, and you're seated alongside neighboring tables in a convivial but intimate atmosphere. You're likely to see the Brown twins or other local ""celebs"" eating in, or just passing by and waving. Every meal comes with soup (how civilized!), and their silky soups du jour  winter vegetable, or cream of watercress, or  the like  are always SO memorable. Then there is your entree  served not CA cuisine style, but French style, with a plate of meat, starch and vegetables. (This is not apparent when you peruse the menu, so be sure to understand that ""duck l'orange"" is not just duck, but includes veggies, starch and, of course, the soup. )  Personally, I recommend choosing from the regular menu as opposed to the multi course Prix Fixe menu, but this is just because I prefer fewer courses and no dessert. In all the years I've been coming here, I've never been disappointed with a dish. The service has also been % consistent, and I believe we've always been served by the same man, who is attentive but demure with a dry humor. This is THE place for a romantic two some, or a very enjoyable dinner with a best friend or a couple of good friends. It's not the place for big groups or boisterous diners. Trust me, I've lived here for years, and this is one of the only places I go back to, time and again. It's the kind of place where you just want to be a regular  whether that's once a month, or once in while, or every time you're nearby. No doubt we will soon be eavesdropping alongside one another some enchanted evening. . . the gf is just crazy about this place. it does have that cozy, french feel to it with a nice focus on the food without being horrendously over priced. i wouldn't go here for the spectacular dinner with amazing ambiance in the one of a kind dress.  not really.  the view is corner of Mason/Pine traffic going by.  street level.  i think i could see the fire hydrant from my table.  the food was neither neuvo cuisine, inventive, never seen this before type of stuff.  but for what it was, it was quite good.  the food was standard french flare dishes.  duck orange, seafood pasta, a nice bisque and a lovely peach sorbet served in a frozen peach.  tops all of it without being blown away by it's creativity.  so don't come here for the extra mile creativity and beauty.  come here for very well executed standard french cuisine. i mean, where else can you get a  course chef's menu that's so well done for $.  it was very , very nice.  without being over priced.  good stuff! wine list was affordable as well.  the owner obviously has a target market where he wants people to be able to afford to come here often and i see no reason why not. .  stars : )When we're on a binge, we. are. on. a. BINGE!! And this particular binge of ours just happens to be sweetbreads. The organs of an animal you never would think of eating, I've only tasted sweetbreads with darker, stronger sauces. So, when we saw that Rue Lepic offered sweetbreads in a white wine sauce, we were sold!Rue Lepic is quaint and small  very small. As in, elbow to elbow, hear what the people next to you are saying small. The bathroom seems like a converted closet (though pretty clean!). Decor is definitely a little dated. Not a great place for groups, either. The service was nice and pleasant, but when it gets crowded and busy, it's a bit all over the place. They gave us the wrong entrees and I touched it with my fork but they took it away and served it to the right couple. Oops. The menu is very limited, to a handful of appetizers, entrees and desserts, each. They also have  separate  course meals you can choose from. This was probably the best choice if you want the most for your money BUT we opted to skip it because we wanted to try their appetizers. We had: Smoked Salmon Carpaccio: I saw them take the smoked salmon bag from the fridge. It was the same bag of smoked salmon you can get at any grocery store. Not going to lie, this sorta broke my heart :( When it came out, it was on top of a salad with an aioli sauce. Good dish, but I can literally go buy it at the store.  Flambeed Prawns Salad: Bf loved it; he finished the entire thing AND used the bread to soak up the sauce.  Roasted Veal: Good. I liked it but Bf thought it was just okay.  Sauteed Sweetbreads: I think I prefer a darker sauce but this was pretty good. Sweetbreads were soft and had a light, delicate flavor. Came with rice, which I didn't care for. I think one thing that was disappointing was that my dish and my bf's dish were pretty similar. The sauces were similar, the tastes were somewhat similar, the plating was similar. You know the phrase ""you eat with your eyes first?"". If that's true, Rue Lepic is serving some cafeteria style food, seriously! Plating was truly nothing special and the sides were not great  string beans, carrots, jasmine rice?! I'm not  yet!I think my favorite part of the meal, besides the sweetbreads itself, was the bread and the free soup. The bread was soo good! Super soft and warm. And the vegetable soup was a puree of potatoes (I LOVE POTATOES) and others. Very creamy and delicious. Prices are decent but I thought portions were small  I refuse to count those pointless sides! Agree with other reviews that this is the best french restaurant in town.  Their SAUMON FUME AVEC DES CAPRES ET DE L' AIOLI  is pretty good and it's a decent pricing too.  Love their seafood paste.  Plus dont' forget to get a MOUSSE AUX FRUITS DE LA PASSION AVEC for dessert.  Cozy environment and great for party. As a young adult, my parents would take me to Rue Lepic for special occasions. Having moved away during college and military years, I was not able to return until recently. I/we were not disappointed. We called on the same day for a reservation and asked for a late seating at/about  pm: no problem. The party ahead of us for our table was just leaving and the table was being cleared. This is a cozy, street corner property with windows facing on all points. We lucked out, our table was farthest from the entrance (so we had no foot traffic nor influence from the night time air. We were immediately greeted by our waiter and offered a wine list, water and bread roles. The menu is simple and traditionally complete for a boutique french meal. We passed on a salad option for a first course and selected escargots. Not a mistake at all: we were very impressed. My partner then ordered chicken and I selected beef entre (per the online menu for the property). The property also offers a ""Chef's"" pre fix opportunity if this is your thing. We were delighted with the service and the portions  we just kept things simple as we had had a late lunch and wanted to enjoy eachothers' company and the activity within the dining room and on the street. The only DOWNside: people at tables nearby were vocal enough to be a distraction. But such is the potential in tight quarters and/or an intimate dining location. Nonetheless, we did not care to hear about others' kids, their dogs, their frustrations. Otherwise, I would give Rue Lepic and HIGH . Couples ( persons) or groups (up to  or ) will be well treated at Rue Lepic.  Things have not changed since I was much younger. Bon appetit. This is the best french restaurant EVER! My family and I been coming here for almost  years now. Whenever we are craving for french food, we will come here. I always order the  course menu, which is worth it. The seafood pasta is SO GOOD! Thinking about it is making me drool. Soup is also very good as well. By the time I get my entree, Im actually already quite full. I actually would love to have seconds or thirds on the seafood pasta. And dessert, their peach sorbet is soo unique. I love how they put the sorbet inside the peach itself. Creme brulee is yummy too. Restaurant is small, but cozy. I just introduced this restaurant to my bf for his birthday dinner, and he LOVES it. We will be coming here a lot more. Rue Lepic you stole my heart last night and dazzled my taste buds.  Quaint, cozy, and warm; non touristy.  You can tell that the majority of their business on a Saturday night are loyal Rue Lepic customers.  Crowd is definitely mature.  Decor is 's dated but who really cares if your company is stimulating.  Service was very good and attentive.  You will not leave hungry if you order the Chef's  course menu.  I challenge you skeptical yelpers to find a better value at a nice French Restaurant. Started with the Escargot w/Angel Hair Pasta.  Sauce was delicious, the Escargot were so tender and probably the best Escargot I've ever had.  A must have at Rue LepicSeafood pasta was very good, Soup was a vegetable puree  creamy but light.  I ordered the Veal w/truffle and mushroom sauce, wife had the boneless duck breast with orange sauce and mother in law had Roasted rack of lamb with a garlic and fresh mintbeurre rouge.  The veal was the tender and the truffle/mushroom sauce was rich but not overly heavy.  The duck was good, not amazing, but good.  The lamb was interesting, I don't usually like a sweet sauce with lamb but this one worked.  For dessert we ordered the Chocolate Mousse, Passion Fruit Mousse, and Creme Brulee.  Going back I'd order three Chocolate Mousse's  decadent, rich, and mouth watering delicious.  The Kiwi Strawberry sauce complimented the rich chocolate and the texture of the moose was dense and silky at the same time. When it comes to fine French dining you don't just eat at a Restaurant, you experience it.  Rue Lepic's experience exceeded my expectations. I'm a fan of this place because the entire staff waves at me as I walk past. . . every. . . day.  I'm a bigger fan of this place because the soup of the day is always fantastic, I've tried almost all of the entrees on the menu and have yet to leave hungry or dissatisfied.  This is a great little gem in our neighborhood. We were in San Francisco for our th anniversary and wanted to celebrate it with a special meal. Rue Lepic did not disappoint. The place is small to be sure, but the food and service were top notch. I had the rack of lamb that was fabulous and my partner had the sweetbreads, also right on. The caesar salad and the grilled prawn salad were delicious. The soup that came with each meal was one of the best I have ever had. Smooth and slightly peppery, I could have eaten a huge bowl and been perfectly happy. We had a lovely wine and desert was great.  The service was spot on, which is not easy in such a small venue, but they were a well oiled team that took care of every need. Next trip to San Francisco, Rue Lepic is a definite!! If you're looking for a pretense free dining experience that emphasizes food and service over fashion, Rue Lepic is for you. If you need a restaurant to validate who you are as a person, keep looking. One of my favorite restaurants and a place I hit every time we travel to San Francisco. The chef's tasting menu is one of the best values in town and the bistro atmosphere is great, After reading the good reviews on Yelp I had quite some expectations when we went to dinner with three friends. The place is small (the bathroom is tiny  you better get undressed before you enter it) and looks ok from the outside. The inside is colder and ""cheaper"" than I thought. The chairs were very plastic and the cutlery looked very cheap.  A place called ""Rue Lepic"" should offer more atmosphere than this. We ordered a bottle of a  Pinot Noir but the waiter brought a   without mentioning it. After asking he said this is the only one he has. Hmm. I like traditions, but tasting a wine which has a plastic cork does not make sense at all. The food was ok, we had filet mignon (very tiny), lamb racks and duck breast. The funny thing was that all plates looked very much the same. The same side dishes and every meat had the same sauce which buried the taste with multiple herbs carrying a garlicky intensity. We definitely expected more / better taste. The Crème brûlée tasted more like a good vanilla pudding and the sugar crust could have been crispier. We expected an evening full of french cuisine but got down home meals. My fiance and I went to Rue Lepic for a romantic dinner this past Tuesday. He is french and we live across the street so we decided to give it to a try. And wow  YUM! I got the  course meal with the Lobster tail. I enjoyed every bit of it. As everyone said, the seafood pasta is a nice starter. The caesar salad was good. The soup of the day was something like creamed corn/leek. Was very nice. My fiance got the filet mignon cooked rare and he said it was perfect. For dessert I had the creme brulee with strawberries. It was actually just ok. I enjoyed it but the cream coulda been smoother and the berries were not very sweet. My fiance had the chocolate ganache with the kiwi and raspberry sauce. The ganache was very rich but the sauces helped to mellow it out. The raspberry sauce was delicious. We also shared a bottle of white wine. It was about $. All in all, very very nice. We'll definitely come back. We were in SF for our honeymoon and my husband google'd and took me to Rue Lepic. I wanted a hip and great restaurant and that was NOT IT!I was really disappointed! A very old place, old decoration, mirrors on the back walls. I took my camera there to take some nice pictures and I didn't take the camera out of my purse. : (Yeah, the food was good, but not the best in town like some people said! I had better french food on my wedding day!It was just OK! I didn't like to have the kitchen so close and open to our table. . .  We love french food, but we didn't like the atmosphere or the service! Since my husband and I grew up in the s and s, when one dressed nicely for dinner, (ahem, suit and tie for those  who don't track on such things)  and since we continue to dress nicely when we visit San Francisco because that makes our experience all the more memorable,  that was how we honored our evening together at Rue Lepic and I am pleased to say there were other couples in our age range  that evening who also did the place the courtesy of looking nice for what turned out to be a wonderful, delicious pleasant meal. We both ordered the salmon in dill sauce and it was mouth watering, the salmon was as fresh as it could be. Garden salad dressing was light and tasty with just the right amount of salt in the dressing. The puree of pea soup and hot fresh roll and sweet butter complimented the meal which was served in just the right proportion. We skipped dessert this time around because we'd already had a large lunch that day. We will definitely come back. The place was tiny but tidy, the only suggestions I would made is that the decor looks a tad tired and instead of polyester lace cafe curtains I would make them out of fine starched cotton with narrow lace edging. Tablecloths, chairs, etc all crisp, clean and comfortable. I thought the owner/hostess was darling. She resembles my adopted adult daughter who is Vietnamese/Black. Service was relaxed and timely and we felt we were served and attended to in just the right amount, no hovering, just attentive. Two salads, two entrees and one glass of pinot noir plus tax and tip came to $.  I don't know where else in The City one can get a deal like that.   We were reluctant to leave but the place was filing up, and it is definitely a popular spot. Very good. Recommended by a friend. Smoked salmon was excellent. Seafood pasta was excellent, garlic y and very good, The soup was a pea+vegetable affair, very rich and tasty. The fillet Mignon was very very good, with a nice side of potatoes, and the red snapper special was excellent and garlicky. I was so happy with the food I ordered the saffron seared scallops EXTRA after all the food, and that was really trend setting good. I sopped up all the sauce in the nice warm dinner roll they serve. We had the creme brulee, very good, and the bloody superior  ""LA GANACHE AU CHOCOLAT NAPPEE D'UNE CREME. "" Retarded good, like a truffle with creme anglais and kiwi and strawberry preserve sauce, ridiculously tasty. Wine: Beaucanon estate Napa valley Cabernet Franc , on a recommendation by the waiter. Extremely good, nothing to complain about at all. Prices good. Bathroom is small but clean, establishment was small but well managed, doesn't feel cramped. For a super special treat, some traveling choir sang some classical music , they were a  top, with about   singers, and they gave a sitting performance which was really a super finish to a great meal. Nice. Wow. . I've been looking for a restaurant like this. I got the  course chef's menu. It included seafood pasta ( which was perfect), salad, garden soup ( interesting tasting also very food) and i got the filet Mignon ( cooked perfectly with just enough flavor). Portions are very decent and so is the price! The chef's menu also includes dessert of your choice. Great deal for couples! The waiter was very helpful telling us the special of the day and recommending us the filet mignon for the entree. I def recommend this restaurants to everyone. . I will be back!  PS: Yes they also have take out! They package it very well! Enjoy a nice glass of wine while your waiting! Wow this place is a  man show.   chef,  server, and  dishwasher.  Service was great and the timing for the course meal was impeccable.  This chef has it down pat.  Atmosphere is like dining at mom's where you see mom (the chef) preparing your meal.  The seafood pasta was good but there is only  piece of shrimp and the broth she uses makes I guess.  The soup of the day was an asparagus leek which was also good.  I had the garden and my hubby had the caesar salad which was also good.  For my entree, I ordered the fish of the day which was a red snapper.  It was delish and I must say the best part of the meal.  My hubby ordered the rack of lamb which was also very good but a little overpowered by the cherry wine sauce.  We both agreed the entrees were the highlight of the meal which is supposed to be the case in a good restaurant.  The dessert was alright, nothing spectacular.  Definitely not a bad meal for $.  for a  course meal.  It's good but not spectacular. This has to be one of the best deals in SF.  For  bucks you get a hearty  course meal: soup of the day, seafood pasta, main course, and dessert.  We had the sweetbreads and duck for our mains, and they came with veggies and rice which nicely offset the heavier seafood pasta, a dish I desperately want to recreate at home.  The service was excellent and the folks here are all smiles.  Rue Lepic is a real gem. Rue Lepic RULES!  This place has become my new favorite French restaurant in S. F.  OK, just because it kinda has a feel of an Asian restaurant especially with the decor and the Asian waiter.  But hey, the place is comfortable, even if you sit at the corner table and watch cars barreling down the hill and the waiter is charming in his own way.  The food is incredible and the Chef's menu for about  bucks is the definite thing to do!  The Chef's menu comes with a very tasty Seafood Pasta, then you get a choice of soup or salad, entree and dessert!  Everything was excellent!  We had the Rack of Lamb which was incredible and the desserts like the Chocolate Mousse and the Creme' Brulee were delicate and not too sweet. . . perfect!  A couple of words of advice, first don't wear your ""Sunday Best"" because the kitchen is part of the dining room, so your clothes will bring the smells of the restaurant back home with you and as I saw in another Yelpster's comment, the restroom IS incredibly small!  Narrow to be exact!  But that is not keeping me from making plans to come back again and again, there are nice hotels nearby with nice spacious water closets. I really like this place! Even I went there only ones, I really look forward to go back! Very elegant and fragile, but in the same time very friendly place. The owner  Japanese woman is very interesting person. And the food is good too! Nestled atop Pine St  a quaint restaurant with great eats and an incredibly small restroom behind the coat rack. You can order the prix fix meal which comes along with soup, salad, main entree and dessert. yummy food! wait are friendly too :) i made reservations for this restaurant for my birthday. . . we had about  people. so when i first called I wasn't sure about the head count so I gave them an estimate of   which I thought was a pretty good approximation but whoever it was that I talked to on the phone wanted a credit card to guarantee the reservation which I thought was a little weird, but she told me  to call back when I had a better head count. SO . . . having such a big party your bound to have laggers so I called ahead of time to change the reservation from : to :pm. When we walk in half the party was already there but as I sit down the table behind us made very rude comments about us coming a little late which made no sense to me. The food was excellent. As for the service. . . there was an older asian women who I assumed was the owner, she was a fluttering butterfly to every table. . . EXCEPT ours. This made me feel like we were unwelcome. The waitstaff was friendly. all in all it was an ok bday. not the best but I've definitely had a better experience! RUE LEPIC was fantastic on Xmas eve '. Cold & rainy outside with the pink neon. Just like Paris in the late 's. Warm & basic on the inside. Forever there ""Vincent"" is always superb at his job. New staff ""Eddie"" is excellent. ""Adella"" in the kitchen is in command. In it's own French style, nothing is done wrong. Being there on a cold rainy Christmas night is as good as it gets in S. F. My wife and I ate at Rue Lepic on a weekday night during the holiday season.  I was surprised that the restaurant was almost full when we got there at :pm, and hoped that meant that the Yelp reviews I had read were true.  I am very happy to report that they are.  Rue Lepic is a great little restaurant offering wonderfully prepared dishes (you can watch the chef actually prepare your meal) at very reasonable prices.  Service was attentive, and although the wine list was a little sparse, I am glad I resisted the temptation to bring my own bottle (corkage is $) and order one from their wine list.  It was a nice little pinot with a unique label.  It sort of matched the personality of this place.  The decor is a little different, but the place is very clean with good food and service.  Some of the dishes were outstanding in fact.  Our soup was wonderful (butternut squash) and the dessert, an incredibly rich chocolate mousse with strawberry and kiwi sauces, was awesome. Please please try their pasta salad!  It will take you to heaven and back! : ) Okay, so being part Asian, I just have to point out that the flavors here Asian influenced. . .  But OMG everything is delish. . .  And where can get a full  course dinner for way under $?  The food is amazing.  If you can, order the lobster tail. . . .  It's so yummy and big!  The seafood pasta to start off is awesome. . .  The deserts, especially the seasonal fruit cup is so sweet and perfect. . .  Everyone I've taken has absolutely loved it!  The flavors and menus don't change though, so maybe not the place to go every couple of weeks, but when you go every couple of months, it's a great treat!  And yes, expect to stay there for at least   hours. . . the best thing about this place was the rolls.  but make it last cause you're only going to get .  The place is very small which I always like, but the food and the service was feh.  the woman who is the chef is the only one doing any cooking so if you get a few tables in, everything backs up. It took way too long between our soup (that the waiter didn't even describe and I'm not sure I can say for sure what it was), and and our entree.  The waiter kept telling her about our order, which gets written in a lined notebook, but she didn't prepare them for quite some time.   I ordered the shrimp with pernod flambe as the appetizer.  It was overly sauced and runny.  Very garlicky as well, which didn't really work. And given the open kitchen, I would have seen flambeeing, but trust me there was no flambe.  My husband had a salad as well which was basic and inoffensive.  He had the duck for his entree which was overcooked and oversauced again.  I had the special which was scallops prepared in an absolutely unidentifiable and much too abundant sauce.  The scallops were inedible in places.  Could not even chew it.  The waiter never asked how things were, and given that there were  scallops served and  / uneaten you'd think he would have asked how things were.  And finally, when refilling the water for the table next to us it was evident that there was mold or mildew on the bottom of the plastic water pitcher.  That grossed me out completely.  I wanted to like this place as we had been there  years ago or so, and I used to go by it every day commuting to and from work, but it was a big miss.  We will not go back.  I'd give it .  stars if I could. This place is really close to where my boyfriend lives.  We just decided to try it one day.  The decor was nothing special.  I did find it interesting that it was owned by an old Japanese lady.  I don't remember too much about the main courses, but I had linguine pasta with an es cargo sauce  as an appetizer and it was delicious!  I was kinda sad about why they didn't make it a main dish?!  I really recommend it. went here with a pretty large group for dinner. it's a small, quaint place, looks very mom and pop. i had looked at the menu online before i got there, and it looked pretty good. most of us ended up opting for the chef's menu. they have one version where you get lobster as your entree for $, but i did the one where you get to pick your entree for $. it's actually a great deal, cause you also get a seafood pasta starter, soup of the day, salad (green or caesar), entree and choice of dessert. dinner started off great with a warm and toasted bread roll. then the pasta came and it was quite delicious with a light but creamy tomato sauce, i coulnd't resist dipping my bread in it! the soup that day was cauliflower soup, which was also quite tasty, but i was already starting to get full! the caesar salad was a little heavily dressed and i would've liked there to be more garlic in the dressing, but really quite a standard caeser. tthen i got the veal with truffle and mushroom sauce. it was a bit of a disappointment. drowning in the sauce you really couldn't taste the veal. my bf had the lobster tail, which seemed to be in the same sauce, but probably wasn't. and it was clearly frozen, as the texture was very mushy. i tried a friend's salmon, which had a tasty yogurt dill sauce, but again, so heavily sauced you could only taste that and not the salmon. ended my meal with the chocolate mouse, which was good but SO rich. just had a couple of bites and i was set for the night. service was pretty good, one person for the whole place, but it's pretty small. the hosts of our dinner are pretty regular and he knew them, so he threw in some extra salads and soups for people who didn't get the chef's meal, so that was nice. nice neighborhood place, and the food was ok, but just so heavily sauced!  i think i just don't like heavy cream sauces anymore, it's just too rich for me nowadays. but if i happened to be nearby, i would maybe pop in and see if i could just get that seafood pasta, or order something with the sauce on the side. . . Went to this quaint little place this July th week end upon the recommendation of a friend and totally loved it. Where else can you find a wonderful  course French meal for less than $ in San Francisco? The service was fantastic. The food was excellent! Our first course was a seafood pasta which was prepared simply but was so good. Next comes the cream of cauliflower soup that was so clean tasting. . I can probably do without the third course which was a choice of a green or a caesar salad  (was this included to cater to the ""white"" folks? I don't know!). I had their sweetbreads in a white sauce which was very, very good and my friends had steak au poivre. For dessert, I had a very rich Laganache chocolate. My friend had a peach sorbet served in a hollowed out real peach fruit and the passion fruit mousse that my other friend had was also mouth watering!! A very pleasant experience to say the least. . . We will be back! Really enjoyed dinner here.  Good food, attentive service, not too loud for conversation.  The soup of the day was leek and asparagus and it was perfectly seasoned.  I ordered the chicken and my husband had the duck with orange sauce.  That dish being on the menu was half the reason we chose this place for dinner.  Both were very good and the total including a bottle of wine, one dessert, and tip came to $ which is fairly reasonable. We took the cable car here, but there are several parking garages in the area.  A great place for dinner before a recital at Grace Cathedral or anytime you're in the mood for a a very good romantic meal at a neighborhood restaurant. Rue Lepic is reminiscent of dinner at grandma's except the food's ten times more delectable and you're given a fat bill at the end. I was in heaven with every spoonful of pasta, soup, entree, and dessert. I sampled  pieces of my party's prix fixe courses and found the salmon and passion mousse cake most outstanding. Staff was extremely friendly without hovering over our table every  minutes. You really can't go wrong here whether it's a casual dinner or a special occassion. Extra sixth star for quaint and intimate ambiance. Rue Lepic, je t'aime. We love this very small cafe.  Excellent food and service.  We always come around opening time for dinner and are seated immediately.  The all inclusive Chef's Menu is just fine as it offers a wide variety of entrees, and the waiter and staff are very friendly. I usually order the lamb but my wife and friends have tried everything and enjoyed all the choices on the menu. We come down from Sacramento to dine here about four times a year and the staff always seem to remember us.  One evening the place was so busy that the cook was helping the lone waiter serve up and the atmosphere was just great!Parking can be tough but if you drive down to Sutter or Bush or just cruise around the block you will find a space.  Just give it some extra time. This restaurant rocks. Every entree comes with a soup or salad. That day it was a simple veggie soup so so tasty. I wanted to lick out the bowl! Then I had sweetbreads and again, full of flavor. Service is very old school in the best possible way. Formal without being snooty. The perfect sort of place for a date/special occasion. Plus where else can you get superior french cuisine prepared by an asian staff and owner?! Very Unfortunate Experience. I called and made a reservation for three for this past Saturday night. My DH and I had a good friend in from out of town and we were looking for a place within walking distance of Union Square that had a neighborhood bistro feel. When we arrived there were a few tables filled, the hum of quiet conversation filling the air. We perused the menu and wine list, waiting patiently for someone to come by. Our water glasses were unceremoniously plunked down on the table, and then we were left to our own devices. My husband tried to get the attention of our server who pointedly blew by and ignored him, instead busying himself with opening wine for a table which had been seated after us. I was beginning to think we had forgotten to switch off the Klingon Cloaking Device before coming in! At that point, with almost  minutes invested in this, we bailed. Immediately the two servers on the floor stopped and watched as we put our coats back on, shocked (shocked!) that we would even think of leaving. Our out of town guest answered their silent stares by stating the obvious  that waiting the amount of time we did with only having the water glasses being brought to us (and may I say the time lag was such that I even got a refill!)was rude. It was just as obvious to the kitchen staff what had happened, and while they were apologetic the damage was done. This place had done nothing to make us feel welcome, including being bustled to our table by a host/server who clearly gave us the impression that we were an inconvenience. I can forgive an off night for the kitchen if the service is good and the staff is pleasant. But when the service and staff are already two strikes, odds for the third strike are too high. The fish was pretty amazing! Set on the corner of Pine and Mason, Rue Lepic has curb appeal with large inviting windows and a quaint sign trimmed in pink neon.  Quaint also describes the interior. While there are white table cloths, which I read as upscale, the restaurant is casual.  The space is a bit dated (with s pastel pink) no fancy chairs or veneers, just an open kitchen (that, candidly, looks like it's from a diner).  That said (and I don't think being dated is bad), the food is good and you know it's fresh when you see the chef start up your order.  The soup du jour is included and always good.  Today it was a pea/broccoli puree.  I recommend the escargot to start.  They're not over done and rubbery and they're not drowned in garlic and butter.  The filet mignon is a good main, but you should know they sauce the meat, which could be considered a sin by some.  The sweet breads are also good.  The preparation doesn't include (the typical?) pressing before final preparation.  As a result, the sweet breads have a fresher mouth feel.  Regulars as well as newcomers are treated with care.  In the past couple of years, I've been a half dozen times and there's a smile and easy service for everyone.  There seems to be only one waiter.  He does try to get around, but when it's busy expect slower service and instead enjoy the street view. Simply AMAZING! Small, romantic, and quaint. No frills, no scene. Just REAL GOOD FOOD. My girlfriend and I went here for our NYE dinner since we opted to not spend $ just to get into a club/venue. We decided to go to a nice place and spend that money on food instead. Best $ dollars of my life. Walking into the place felt ""Asian"". Don't ask me to explain that but if you are Asian, then you know what I'm talking about. The owner was this cute little Japanese lady.  She definitely made it very homey and comfortable. Very friendly staff. The woman chef was amazing! She was situated to where you could see her cook the food rather in the back of the place. So you can see for yourself that she prepares everything in the best way.  We had a  course prix fixed meal.  courses for $ plus champagne! What a deal! Everything was amazing. I was full by the rd course (I wore a skin tight dress which did not let my stomach expand whatsoever). I chose the lobster tail rather than the filet. They must have had alot of really big lobster tails (I heard the waiter mentioning it), but the thing was as big as a quart milk carton. Freaking huge! The champagne was amazing and they did not skimp on it. The dessert was the best part. We had the creme brulee and the fruit cup (dunno what it was called). The fruits were all so sweet and fresh. It was drizzled with some sort of sauce. Mm. The creme brulee was orgasmic. I seriously thought about stripping out of my black dress and eating the entire supply.  All in all, I loved my experience here. I will definately come back for their usual  course for $ish. It's worth the money and the walk up the damn hill. Best way to ring in the new year, with your face in some good food! I dined here for the third time in six years and this place has not changed. Well maybe the prices have gone up a bit but the charm of this seemingly out of place French bistro does attract an ""older"" crowd used to the same and dare I say. . . mundane. The only highlight was the seafood noodles, soup and salad. The entree of scallops was overdone and not very tasty. I sort of wanted to ask to have it redone however my friend did not want me to make a fuzz. The dessert ended the night on so so dining experience. Eater beware as we spent two hours there. I love this place.  I recently went with my  year old grandmother. She lived close by  years ago and she and my grandfather used to go often. She said it has not changed a bit.  Cute, intimate and a very french restaurant. Regarding the length of the meal:  ITS A FRENCH BISTRO. . . IT'S NOT INTENDED TO BE A QUICK MEAL.  Don't go there if you want quick.  Isn't that a given? Jeez!It was pretty classic french bistro food. Good. Consistent. Nice wines by the glass.  We split the smoked salmon appetizer.  Very clean tasting. Cream of Mushroom soup came with the meal. Yum! I had lamb I am a lover of lamb and thought they did a great job with it.  We shared the Passion Fruit Mousse for dessert to die for.  I love anything with Passion Fruit and it was really spot on.  My grandmother actually lives in Hawaii now and she agreed that it was really good.  And she gets passion fruit anything anytime she wants.  Very good date place as well, I'm assuming because it was cute and intimate. A very close friend of  mine introduced me to Rue Lepic  years ago and I fell in love with the place ever since.  Although I agree with Ben's comment on the time you spent with this place (min  mins), I can still recall my first French cuisine at the Ritz (I didn't know that the raspberry sherbet was to cleanse your pallet and thought that the lunch was over when it was just the beginning foe another  courses, sigh).   My experience with Ritz took over  hours, so the  minutes at Rue Lepic was not even a nuance.  Every time I had a special occasion to celebrate, I come to Rue Lepic because I know that everyone will have a blast.    PS.  Try their set menu, the price you paid are well worth it.  Also, they have a great collection of French red wine.  We are almost always pleasantly surprised with the selection our waiter picked for us.  :) I went to Rue Lepic on a Thursday. There was no wait what so ever. My date and I ordered the Chef special, lobster and fish of the day (Sea Bass). The food came out quickly and was cooked just rite. The first dish was a seafood mix with cream sauce, served over angel pasta. It was quite good. The cucumber soup was creamy, but excellent. The Cesar salad was a little bit tangy from the lemon dressing. The main dish was not overcooked and the rosemary sauce for the lobster complimented the dish well. Desert was the best part. I highly recommend the passion fruit mousse. Service was quick, ambiance was quaint and cozy. Definitely take a cab here if you live in the city. Great value and great service. Not a bad place if you have a lot of time.  I don't think any group I've been in has gotten out of here in less than  minutes.  Now, that's not always a bad thing, but it's not necessarily a good thing.  I typically have the duck, which is very good, but duck is hard to screw up if you buy good quality meat and don't fark around with it too much.  The desserts are actually really good, and probably one of the reasons my lunches here take awhile  everyone wants dessert.  Later, as I'm sleeping underneath my desk (I mean, carefully analyzing relevant precedent), I recall why I try not to have dessert with lunch. . . I really like this restaurant despite/for all its flaws.  I always get the fixed price menu when I go to Rue Lepic.  It's a small restaurant with great food and great service (they always remember me and my wife).  It's hard to get parking, it's not cheap, and the bathroom is sized for pygmies.  It actually reminds me of Europe, and in my opinion, it's a very romantic restaurant with a lot of character. I've driven past this cute looking place for years, but a show at the Masonic finally gave me the excuse to try it out, and I think it's a great choice for the neighborhood.  The atmosphere was pleasant and relaxed, from the server to the chef to the other diners.  The food was quite good  duck for me and salmon for my date, both cooked very well and served piping hot.  The multicourse menus looked good and were reasonably priced, but since we were a little pressed for time, they will have to wait.  The waiter was great, very helpful in making suggestions for our meals and wine to go with it; and he seemed genuinely interested in making all the guests feel comfortable and content. All in all, a great neighborhood bistro.  Not worth driving for miles for, but if you're in the neighborhood and in the mood for French bistro food, you'll probably enjoy it. I have been scoping out this restaurant for the past nine months that I have lived in Nob Hill.  The outside menu looks appetizing but still the small atmosphere was undecipherable at a glance.  I was pleased with the overall experience when I took my mom there when she was visiting from out of town.  I LOVE escargot and it is usually a rarity to find.  I also LOVE LOVE LOVE Italian food, so I couldn't have been more satisfied with my appetizer selection of escargot, which was served in a tomato garlic sauce with pasta!!  It tasted delicious and it was the ultimate delight dipping the freshly baked out of the oven bread in my sauce.  Our dinner selections of salmon and duck were good.  They were not over the top tasty as was my appetizer, but good.  The small atmosphere was romantic and a great place to catch up with my mom for her first night visiting me in the city. OK. . . I'm a little bias regarding this restaurant. I ABSOLUTELY love this restaurant and used to eat ther almost every other night, since I lived a block from there. First, this is no fancy place, it's a small quaint little french bistro, seats about ppl.  There's no fancy decoration, but there is a life size potrait of the owner.  I'm not sure of the spelling of her name, but it's something like, Mischiko. She's japanese.  Mischiko studied in Europe and came back to SF to open Rue Lepic.  She buys the meats and produce fresh daily. I always get the fixed chef's menu ($. / person).  With this pricing, you get a seafood pasta appetizer, soup of the day, salad, a full size main entree and the piece de resistance. . . . DESSERT!  I highly recommend LES ESCARGOTS A LA PROVENCALE  (if you are into snails, which I am), it has the best sauce, LE FILET DE SAUMON SAUTE A L'ANETH (salmon) or LE CARRE D'AGNEAU ROTI (Lamb) for the main entree and then dessert: LES FRUITS DESAISON SUR UN LIT DE CREME ANGLAISE! It's so Yummi!This is a GREAT french restaurant at an AMAZING price. Bon Appetit! Okay, I know the reviews are mixed on this place, and it's sort of small and can be a little stuffy and it's sort of expensive, but let me just say (and this is not a phrase I throw around) BEST meal of my life. Seriously. I live across the street from this restaurant, and it's all I can do not to eat every meal there. How can I not give it  stars?! If you can afford one great meal, go here and give it a try. It's cozy, romantic, and to be honest, I would eat that food in an alley sitting on a crate if I had to. Rue Lepic is small enough that if you aren't specifically looking for it, you'll probably pass it. . . Walking or driving.  But once you find it, you'll never forget it.  The food is incredible, rivaling that of much more formal, exclusive restaurants.  The veal is incredible, and fetal, and everything it should be. The fact that there are only   tables in the whole restaurant makes one want to whisper across the table because you know that if you speak at your normal speaking voice, everyone will hear you.  After a couple glasses of wine, you begin to make nice with the neighbors though. One of the few restaurants on Nob Hill not overrun with tourists.  Given that it's situated in a primarily residential area of Nob Hill (down the hill from the Fairmont & the Intercontinental), Rue Lepic remains a quaint neighborhood secret.  The cuisine is french asian fusion combining many of the creamy sauces and rich textures found in french food with asian spices.  The portions are definitely french (read: small) though the meals are generally multicoursed, allowing you to have room to try everything.  Parking is awful in this neighborhood  far too many hotels and residences, and the walk up the hill from public transportation is not for the faint of heart.  Though the cable car does run relatively close by if you're determined. The prices are not cheap by any stretch of the imagination with the many of the prix fixe running from $  per person.  The service is fantastic and the servers are quite knowledgable about food/wine pairings.  Be sure to make reservations as the restaurant only holds about  people (and that may be a generous estimate).  They are open  days a week from : :PM.  The best dining experiences will generally be Monday and Tuesday evenings. This is such a cute little restaurant. Unfortunately the food is not as delightful as the convenient location from my apartment or the appearance of the restaurant itself. First off, there are pretty much NO vegetarian options on the menu. I asked the waiter and he said they could put together a veggie plate, which was very nice. . . But, how could there not be a single option on the menu? I guess I could have checked before the boy and I sat down, but I just assumed. . . anyways. . The food was decent. Boy had some kind of fish dish  maybe it was prawns  I don't remember, but he said it was 'not bad'. All in all, I hoped for more, but given a second chance, maybe it could redeem itself. We shall see. Grade: C+I agree with a few of the other reviewers who commended the restaurant for the attentive service. But then again, there are only a handful of tables at the restaurant, and there was only one other occupied table in the whole place, so our waiter didn't have much to do but pay attention to us anyway. I also agree with a couple of other posts that you don't get what you pay for it definitely wasn't worth the pretty penny that I spent for dinner. I had the duck with orange sauce and my friend had the filet mignon. Both were average at best. We shared the creme brulee for dessert, but it wasn't anything special. Though the rest of my meal was mediocre, the saving grace was the escargot served with angel hair pasta and a de licious cream sauce. I'd give that dish alone  stars. I've only been to  other French restaurants in the city (Chou Chou and Clementine) and I would highly recommend both of those places over Rue Lepic. We were hoping for a cute little bistro close to our apartment  a neighborhood place we could call our own.  This place is not it.  And we ended up spending way more money than the food was even remotely worth.  For the record, it became a verb in our household: To be Lepeeked is to have approached something with hope and optimism only to be sorely disappointed, and in the end, to actually feel cheated; synonymous with ""jipped"". My in laws just had dinner here with a friend and raved about it. . . This tiny cozy restaurant is such a hidden gem  busy kitchen, friendly service (always comes with a smile and good recommendations), warm fuzzy ambience that you can hear next table's whispers, and the food is delicious. Great little bistro on Nob Hill. The atmosphere is a tiny bit lacking, but the food makes up for it by a mile. Their rolls start it off right by being perfectly crisp on the outside and warm and soft inside. Their entrees are well proportioned and delicious. And their desserts are divine. The chocolate mousse nearly stopped my heart. Highly recommended and I will be visiting again! this is a wonderful hidden gem in nob hill.  i am sorry a few reviewers complained about the heavy sauce on some of the entrees but come on people!  this is traditional french cuisine and let's review the three main ingredients in french cooking: butter, cream, and salt.  this isn't fluffy trendy nouvelle french/california cuisine.  their prix fixe is a great deal and if you are picky about your sauce, ask for your salad/entree to be lightly dressed or served with the sauce on the side. When  you want good reasonably priced french fare without stressing whether it will meet expectations or whether you need to take out a second mortgage. Not for  special occasions. Cute little neighborhood french bistro in Nob Hill. Once you get past the fact that the place is owned by a Japanese lady, the waiter is Chinese, and there is only one cook in the open kitchen, you are in for a great meal. The food is not on the creative side but it is solid french fare. Most opt for the $   course prixe fix that includes a seafood pasta, a salad, a choice of entree, and a dessert. I must say each dish was perfectly cooked and richly flavored. The service was friendly and efficient, and the decor was basic. Just note that they have a limited wine selection. Kudos for the one chef/cook that cooks it all for the entire restaurant! Nish and Kristen's reviews summarize my internal debate about reviewing this place. It is not haute cuisine, but their French bistro food is very good.  There wine selection is limited, but the service was attentive. Until I have evidence to the contrary, they get the benefit of the doubt and four stars. The jury is still out on Rue Lepic in my book.  The seafood pasta was tasty, the soup was divine, the salad was overdressed and the lobster was buried under an avalanche of salt, breadcrumbs and sauce.  The rolls are in a category of their own. . . freshly baked, perfect enough to eat without butter.  If I go again, I'll have the starters and another basket of rolls, please. An intimate yet very neighborly French bistro tucked away in Nob Hill, a block down the hill from The Fairmont and Mark Hopkins Hotels. Everyone in the restaurant  staff and other patrons  were all very happy to be there  and that reflected well on the overall dining experience. They have a couple of dinner menu options so you can go a la carte, or try one of their   course menus. Anytime they have lobster or rack of lamb on the menu, I'd order that."|3|96|2|Routine| Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 2/6/2013 ] Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 2/6/2013 ]
Al Masri 0|3.0|Middle Eastern in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|161|0|2.925|" i love this place!! Dancers and waiters are friendly and work hard. Food is good! vegetable mu'SAh is insanely good! Good vegetarian options!. Always bring friends and family!. We used a Groupon coupon to go to the only Egyptian restaurant in Northern California. Ambience was very nice  paintings of old Egypt and blue covered walls. was cozy. But the food was rather uninspiring and not spiced  bland would be the word. AT least my chicken dish was. Overpriced entrees  $  $ considering what you get. And slow, slow service  we waited  minutes. Would rather go to Arabian  Nights in the MIssion District. Excellent service! Always top notch quality in bellydance shows! Specially when there's a live band, intimate and charming!! Definitely worth checking out. It's a jewel in the outer Richmond neighborhood. This place defies expectations. With its questionable reviews and location,  it started off on shot in the dark adventure.  We found ourselves in Alexandria.  The food tastes of exotic Nile deltas.  Mediterranean dishes that are familiar get transformed by a deft application of a strong cultural culinary tradition.  The samplers had me eagerly awaiting the tamarind main course and the baklava deserved its own hieroglyphic.  An Ibis gorging itself on cake and really strong coffee. Then,  there was the dancer. Valentina literally mesmerized me. She moved with the skill and grace of  every silver screen depiction.  For a moment,  I was in  North Africa and feeling like I was high on  hashish.  Next time,  I'm wearing a fez. We went last Friday evening. The place was not that busy since we came early. The food was great all the lovely spices and extremely fresh. The belly dancer Dana was very entertaining. The service was great. We will defiantly be back!! Excellent food within two blocks from my place, very accommodating and friendly service. We ordered the combination appetizers (little bit of everything with something extra) and grilled lamb. The imported cheese was delicious. Nice selection of beer and wine, added entertainment is the belly dancer. All together quite satisfying experience, will definitely repeat again. I would recommend this place to any food lover. Ambiance is the only thing this place has going for itself.  The food is overpriced and not that good.  Not going back. Our party of two arrived, it seems, a little early, at PM.  Yes, it was a week night, but during the entire  hours we were there, we were the only patrons in the place.  We enjoyed the belly dance entertainment, but it was a little awkward since we were the only audience.  Food was ok, but dinning room felt a little dated and worn. That one shining star goes out to the musicians at Al Masri.  With a portion of said star's light shining on the authentically uber kitch decor.  The other four stars that died out light years ago are for the food, the service, the dancing, and the price. My visit there was a test of endurance.  My friends had arrived around ish and had had to wait about  minutes for the buffet to be served.  By the time I got there, around ish, most of the food was gone, especially the vegetarian stuff.  So I served myself some lukewarm white rice, salad and moussaka, and asked if there would be more vegetarian dishes later. The bartender said there ""it's coming"".  So, patiently, I waited.  And waited. And waited. I checked the buffet table a few times to see if the food was there yet.  Nope.  So I asked again.  Nope.  ""It's coming"".  That's what he said. By then, the music was about to start and I didn't want to be walking in front of the musicians to keep checking the table, so I asked the waitress to tell me when the food was served so that I could go help myself without walking in fr. . . and I was about to finish my explanation but she waved me off and muttered ok.  Like whatevah. About  minutes later she brings me this gorgeous "" cake of moussaka that I hadn't ordered.  I inform her of this and she takes it back, looking pissed.  I'm going to interrupt myself here and write a little letter: Dear Al Masri, Being a vegetarian doesn't mean we eat copious amounts of vegetables and salad.  We need carbs, fats, proteins, a variety of flavors, and if it's late at night, a tomato eggplant dish is a little hard on the digestion.  If the buffet says, ""All you can enjoy,"" your customers, even the vegetarians, who are paying the same as the omnivores (what you call ""carnivores"" on your website) to enjoy, also need substantial food.  Please take this into account when planning your menu. Thank You, MeOk, I'm back.  So I go to the bartender and try to clarify.  He practically yells at me about having sent my order back  you know, the one that I DIDN'T ORDER because he had said that more buffet food was on its way?  My ears turned bright red.  Really dude?  Did you just raise your voice at me for asking what you meant when you said the buffet food was on its way?  But yeah, about an hour after he'd first said the food was coming, around the time the pissy waitress was clearing our plates and the other lady was doling out single servings of baklava (very yummy, BTW), ONE vegetarian dish came out.  Finally, I ate more salad and a some spinach pastry. At that time, the dancers also emerged.  The majority were wiggly and some jiggly and having great fun. . . at the customer's (literal) expense.  Student recital, with some notably more skilled dancers emerging around :.  I sat there thinking, ""Did I really just drive out to the boonies of SF to wait for lukewarm food, get flack from pissy servers, and pay $ to watch a bunch of slightly coordinated women (and one that might've been a man) trying to embrace their femininity by publicly shakin' it up?""  Why yes, I did.  I felt duped.  But I smiled politely because those dancers are wonderful people and their feelings matter.  I don't want them to go home feeling like crap. On that note, Al Masri customers are also, by and large, great people whose feelings matter, and who shouldn't go home feeling like crap.  So another letter: Dear Al Masri, If you want to send your customers home happy so that they will write nice reviews and return to your restaurant, I suggest the following: ) Calculate how many reservations you have and make enough food well beforehand for buffet sized portions.  Keep food hot by having a staff member close the lids of the food and keeping a little sterno underneath the serving dishes.  But keep the salad cold, and dry the lettuce well so that the salad stays crisp. Refill food dishes often until dancing begins and/or baklava is served, not after. Also, remember that omnivores also eat vegetarian food, but vegetarians don't eat meaty foods, so keep plenty of vegetable dishes on hand for everyone. ) Be courteous to the customers. That means listening to what they're asking for without interrupting/ignoring them, and NOT raising your voice at them.  Kinda basic, but apparently still needs mentioning. ) Screen dancers who want to perform there.  Less is more, as long as it's better.  We're ok with students as long as they're upper intermediate and above.  If you're going to have beginners, don't subject paying customers to the experiment. ) Keep those musicians!  And the experienced dancers!If you can iron out those areas of opportunity, $ might not be too much to charge.     Thanks for your attention, and I look forward to seeing more positive reviews than this one in the near future! We have been here lots in the past and loved it, but the past  times we have come have been a complete disaster.  Last night was the last straw.  After calling in advance for a table for , we arrived on time to find not ONE seat left in the entire restaurant.  The waitress told us to sit tight while she tried to find room.  After waiting  minutes with no updates on our reservation, it seems like we were forgotten.  My guests ended up leaving, I stayed for the belly dance show.  When they came back they were asked if they wanted seats.  My husband explained that he was just there to pick up one of the dancers, and would not be staying.  The waitress walked to the back where I happened to be standing, and her and the owner proceeded to talk about what terrible people my husband and friend must be because they didn't want to be seated, and instead were taking advantage of a ""free show"".  Apparently they did not recognize the fact that we would have loved to all sit and enjoy a meal (paid at full price) but could not because our reservations had not been kept.  The real kicker to this?  This is the SECOND TIME IN A ROW! that we have called ahead to reserve seats, and we have had to have people leave after driving an hour to be there because there were none available.  My advice, call ahead and make sure the place is completely empty to make sure that you can actually be seated somewhere! I don't get all the negative reviews.  I was a little concerned when I walked in on a Friday night and the restaurant was empty, but we were hungry and wanted to give it a try. We had prompt, friendly, service.  The food was delicious, especially the Egyptian falafel and the moussaka.  The chef/owner came out to check on us and we were offered a % discount on our next meal.   The only drawback for me (and why I give this place  stars) was maybe the food was priced a little high.  But on the other hand, it definitely had a home cooked quality. If you want a casual, tasty meal in the Outer Richmond, you should definitely give this place a try! Went here for dinner on a Sunday after I saw a special on Groupon. I was really surprised that there was a Egyptian restaurant in San Francisco so we decided to try it out. The service was good and so was the food a little on the bland side  for me though . I had the fish and my partner had lamb kabobs. The chef  came out to talk to us to make sure everything was good and and Offered us free dessert. It was  when we got there and left at  and we were the only ones dining. They had a lot they had a bellydancing performance that we really really enjoyed. And the place is decorated beautifully vary detailed even the bathroom. Will be back for the Ambiance for sure. Eh, it's the only restaurant that serves Egyptian food in the Bay Area, so that is why we went there.  Very over priced  even with a groupon, and not great options for food.  But the service was excellent. I hate the fact that they have a belly dancer all the time.  It is not nice. Possibly the worst restaurant I've ever been to. The service was HORRIBLE. My friends and I waited for two hours before we got our food, from the time we put our name on the list to be seated to the time the food arrived. I could see they were busy, but not to the point where it merited that long of a wait. And no apologies or anything. Inexcusable. Once we did get service, our waitress was completely clueless about the menu. Given that it was my first time at an Egyptian restaurant, I had questions about the dishes on the menu and she couldn't answer even the basic ones. Also, if you keep a halal diet, don't trust this place. The menu indicates that some of their items are made with halal meat while others aren't. But when I asked the waitress to confirm, she couldn't verify and flip flopped on her answer even. The food itself wasn't bad but nothing to rave about. Finally, they had a belly dancer and entertainment show, which was lame and too close to our table to enjoy. I've seen much, much better. The whole experience was pathetic and leaving with each person having paid $ (no alcohol AND we used a Groupon deal _ ) further left a sour taste in our mouths. About the only thing this place has going for it is the Egyptian themed bathrooms, but that's it. Alone tonight. This is amazing: youtube. com/watch?v=urF…This was awkward: All by myself watching a belly dancer perform. Wasn't my fault. Expired Groupon that needed to be used. Turns out I was the only one in the entire world in the mood for Outer Richmond Egyptian. Or at least in San Francisco. Fortunately that meant attentive and friendly service. Plus some really good hummus made with tahina. Couldn't quit the toasted pita bread on the site. Loved the grilled fish with caramelized onions, pinenuts and garlic sauce too. Okra and rice pilaf on the side. Did not love the unexpected $ surcharge for salmon. Close to four stars for the meal if the price hadn't been so high. Hummus was fair at $. Seafood was expensive at $. Of course you can't really put a price on an Egyptian theme that extends to the toilet seat lids. And personal belly dancing performances. Turns out I wasn't alone after all. I love the Moussaka here!  It came out perfectly with not just eggplant and veggies but taro.  The hummus is very moist and tasty, reminded me of the fresh hummus I had in Israel.  There was belly dancing and live music, the belly dancer changed her outfits  times with props.  I'd definitely come back again and try other dishes. Once again, the one star is for the enthusiastic belly dancer.  On a Saturday night, between : and pm, we were the only table in the place.  Yes, we had the soon to expire Groupon, so we made the trek to the Outer Richmond.  Not a big trek, since we live in the Inner Richmond, but too far for the mediocre food and really high prices.  I can't believe that they think that people will pay so much for so little.  If you want really good, well priced middle eastern food, go to Troya on Clement or Fillmore.  Sorry Al Masri, but we'll not be back. Excellent Basbousa! Just. . . don't go here. Especially for Sunday dinner (which is all I have tried), and especially if you are a vegetarian. The  star is for the belly dancer (nice friendly woman), the interesting, if kitschy, decor and the dessert item which was not bad. I went here with a few friends for the usual reason cited in other reviews  someone had bought a Groupon which was expiring so we figured we should use it. The hummus was dry and almost had a stale flavor. The veggie special was terrible (mousaka and falafel  the only thing common with other mousaka I have had is that this had eggplant and some kind of tomato sauce). It seemed that the chicken entrees in the buffet were OK per my friends who tried that.  It didn't matter that the place was empty and we were seated right away  the food is really bad (at least for Sunday buffet). We asked whether the vegetarians could order from the full menu since the buffet had nothing for them, but were told there was only  thing they could order (the above mentioned mousaka + falafel) ""to make it easier for the chef"". I came home hungry and still paid $ per person + tax + tip. Yikes. Generally when you have to work for your dinner it means you ordered from the ""F**king Side"" of the menu so you have your Hoe Bag in the trunk of the car for later but not when you come to Al Masri! Working for your dinner takes on a whole new meaning at this place! My friends worked at this joint. They danced, they busted tables, the added up their own checks. I mean WORKED!I was part of a fine group of folks celebrating a friend's birthday dinner and we had our plans in order well before we got there. My fat ass was starving as I hadn't eaten all day to save room for my Ultimate Egyptian Grubdown. We arrived at : and didn't see food until well after  pm. All of our guests arrived within a reasonable amount of time but when the belly dancer came to our table and asked if all of our party was here so she could start the show I knew shit was about to get REAL! Really? Imma need you to get to wiggling and giggling and not worry about my folks. Stick a pin in that cuz we coming back to her ass. The waitress auntie I really don't wanna do this shit but I'm the only one here person took our orders, damn near refused to bring our starving asses bread and water as we waited and was a hot mess from the beginning. She ""politely"" told us what food and beverages they didn't have because they had a large party the night before. Costco was open. It's cool just bring us something! She didn't! She had a rough night on her hands and it showed because we sat there so long with plates, bowls and glasses piled on our tables that we started passing them down to the end of the table to make room for our entrees. My friend's mommie and the belly dancer became the table busters! WTF? To add insult to injury when the night was thru Auntie actually added % to our total and I was amazed she even did that with her slow ass because it took her forever to figure out our totals.  My friend said she must have been using an abacus. The smokey smell of food burning from the kitchen made our eyes water and that was a good thing as we watched the pasty white ""belly dancer"" do ONE DAMN MOVE over and over and over again, the smoke kinda shielded our eyes from the real site of her. It was actually kinda mysterious. Well kinda. She wanted everyone to join in but I told her just do you Boo Boo cuz if I get up I'm taking all your tips. I believe she and the Auntie waitress were a comedy act because in the middle of her second dance Auntie walked over and turned her music off. HILARIOUS!Around  pm our table was full of wonderful food, glorious food and it wasn't half bad. I loved the family style sizes of entrees and because of the extreme delay Chef tossed us a few bowls of delicious lentil soup and extra appetizer platters which were tasty. Now, I don't know if it was because of the hunger or the good company but I would go back for the food. I won't go back for the service or the show. Save your time and money and find somewhere else to go! When you have to help the waitress and perform belly dancing routines your food should be free! IJSPS. PARKING SUCKS! The entertainment was delightful with an array of belly dancers and live music! I really enjoyed it!But the food was really not desirable, left in steamers so the texture of the food was quite distorted. Went on a Sunday for the buffet. Food is OK, not as exotic as i thought. Small selection for a buffet. The buffet area is also very awkward and small if there are other people in the restaurant. Belly dancer performed and you feel obligated to tip since there were so few people. As other reviews have shown, this place can be an amazingly good time, or less than that. My experiences here have been primarily good, and when it hasn't been perfect, it's been because factors out of anyone's control. I've brought friends here, and tell them NOT to expect the typical restaurant experience. This place is a whole other reality. It's a little on the spendy side for such a little place all the way out in the avenues, but the portions are huge enough to take home and have for lunch the next day. The menu changes often, but if you can get it, there's a dish that is a piece of filet mignon, wrapped around feta cheese and spices that is beyond compare! Also try the falafel, made with fava beans for a super creamy texture. As far as the dancers go, yeah, maybe one or two are past their ""sell by"" date, but they are all *very* talented. If you appreciate ethnic dancing, you'll be entertained. If you want T&A, go to Hooters. Insider's tip they do take out! The only Egyptian restaurant in the Bay Area.  Great food, amazing dessert menu, good prices, bellydancing, and great service.  I'm definitely coming here again. Ok food, tacky decor (like someone was trying to decorate a room Egyptian style from a dollar store), ok service (though the manager had a bit of a 'tude), & the dancers were alright. We had a reservation but when we walked in, there was no checking the book, just a ""help yourself, sit down anywhere!"". Although the restaurant never filled up, I really don't like it when we take the time to make a reservation but it just doesn't mean a thing when we walk in. On the Sunday night buffet:Note  They have a really awkward set up. None of the lids have a little hole for where the serving spoon can go. So you either put the serving spoon entirely in the container, where (as it's all metal without any plastic handle) it gets really hot & ends up falling entirely in the food, or you put it awkward on the table (there was no spoon rest). Also several of the dishes were one in front of the other under a single lid  you can open the front half of the lid, but then you awkwardly reach under the back half to get the second dish. I felt especially bad as my friend is pescetarian & I was afraid of accidentally dropping something from a meat dish onto a veggie or seafood dish! This was definitely not a veggie friendly setup. Veggie plate  HOWEVER (continuing from above) when my friend asked about veggie options, the chef immediately said she should've mentioned this (she had, on the phone). The chef said she meant when my friend came in (a little bit of attitude there). Pretty soon a veggie platter came out  it was really delicious! A plate with a giant slice of eggplant topped with tomato sauce  underneath was sweet potato, peppers, & other veggies. This was surrounded by rice & crispy fried onions. Rice  pretty good, with pieces of vermicelli noodles. Rice grains not very sticky. Shrimp  had a very strange, bitter taste. It was overcooked to the point that it was just mushy, no crunch at all. Fish  also overcooked (I recognize the texture  likely frozen & thawed), Plus it was sitting in a lot of water & became completely soaked through & mushy. Chicken  There were legs with a green pest like sauce & breasts with different sauce. While the meat was very tender & moist, it was all very flavorless. Mussels  decent but like the shrimp had a slightly bitter aftertaste. Didn't exactly taste fresh, also likely thawed. Beef/eggplant  I LOVED this dish! It was absolutely delicious. Soft eggplant in a tangy tomato sauce & ground beef for added texture. Wonderful. Lentils  good texture, but lacking in flavor. Phyllo dough/beef  the phyllo was little dry & crispy so didn't stick together well in squares & didn't cut apart easily once on your plate. The container with this dish became a big mess of random phyllo & ground beef. Dessert  bread soaked in (I think) rose water with pistachio crumbles on top. Good flavors, but the bread was pretty hard & dry, even though it was soaked through! It seemed soaked more in something oily or greasy. I've had a homemade version of this & know that the bread can have a much softer & cake like texture. This was like stale corn bread. On the service:Besides the slight attitude from the chef above, we also got a bit of a 'tude from the manager. We'd gotten a Groupon that expired back in June  I'd called in June trying to reserve a spot before it expired & when I mentioned that, the manager basically waved it aside & said that there were so many people trying to use the Groupon that they were going to ignore the expiration date. Great! I double checked by asking  so I can use the Groupon after it expires? Yes, was the solid answer. Ok, so it took us a good  months to use the Groupon, but they said there was no expiration date. Once there, we mentioned the Groupon, & the manager sat down with me & explained that there's apparently some sort of ""code phrase"" she uses when she allows customers to use Groupons after they expire. Otherwise, apparently, how would she know whether I actually called the restaurant & talked to her? What if I called this other restaurant that has a Groupon & sounds really similar to Al Masri? Of course, not that she doubts my word or anything, but she's managing a restaurant in a struggling economy & barely staying open. Etc, etc, etc. She was just a little pushy & rude  maybe when I talked to her in June she just meant we'd be able to use the original purchase amount but not the discount after the expiration, but that was NOT clear to me at all. She really could have been much nicer about it. On the dancers:Not exactly professional dancers like I imagined. These women were all students (though many who'd been studying for ,  years) of this one teacher, likely doing this as a side hobby outside of their full time jobs. While I give them (many of them much older!) TOTAL props for being confident & sexy at any age & having beautiful hand made dresses, it was kind of like watching a recital. We stayed for about  dancers, had eaten our fill, So, I am clearly not not going to this restaurant. It was definitely weird. We left before the belly dancing show that looked like it might have been good. We ate at the buffet. I was clearly let down and the options were limited and not worth the advertised price. There were some items posted that were not available to be ordered even though we were told they would be. Seating was very limited. :(  November, Friday:Low and behold the day I decide on the whim of a moment's notice to drive all the way out to the Outer Richmond for takeout. The anger I feel at the loss of my appetite has been exceeded only by my grief. The Kushari was completely bland and inedible, three different kinds of starches: lentils, pasta, rice. a few caramelized onions and a side of hot sauce for  bucks! What a jip. I am in mourning. My friends and I  have always enjoyed the food, atmosphere and decor at this  restaurant.  We'd had the buffet dinners many times but this was one occasion we decided to go on a Saturday night and order straight from the menu.    Well, it was a absolute feast of Egyptian style food that you simply cannot get at any other restaurant in S. F. !  Rack of lamb seasoned in garlic and butter was perfection; salads and huge appetizer sampler platter we shared was scrumptious.   Even the falafel was special, nice and fluffy inside and seasoned just right.  There are also lots of seafood and vegetarian choices as well and Chef Sausan prepares every single one with the same attention to detail and presentation.   The waitstaff was friendly and attentive and the Egyptian murals, chairs and statues add a charming accent to dining room as do the belly dancers who are skilled and elegant performers.  Do yourself a favor and go and have a feast fit for a Pharoah! Constructive criticism: The belly dancer was legit. But since everyone else has written that in their reviews. . . . enough said. The food was whatever. The rice was good, and it was in the shape of a pyramid. I can make good rice and put it in a pyramid shape at home. However, the chicken was cooked perfectly. I can definitely not do that at home. The reason this scored two stars was. . . . . . dun, dun, DUN: The service. All we wanted was some wine. That's it! It was a Friday night, and I had just rushed to this double date after work. SOME ALCOHOL, please. We ordered a bottle, and the server forgot. We waited something like thirty minutes to remind her. Our bad, yeah, but c'mon. It's a Friday night. It's not crowded. Get a girl some drank. So I have to start by saying that visiting Al Masri was kind of an odd experience.  Not bad, just not typical of my dining experiences in San Francisco.  For one thing, the place was nearly deserted on a Saturday night, which is atypical.  We were worried that they were going to give away our table because we arrived super late due to traffic.  But most of the tables were free when we got there. We were seated right away, and the waitress explained the specials.  The mint tea they use for the iced tea is great!  We started with the hummus and the fried eggplant salad.  The eggplant salad was to die for and I will be back just to get more of that.  The hummus was just okay, I thought.  I like it a little smoother in consistency.  They serve it with fried pita, which is okay, I guess, but a little greasy.  One of the pieces they gave us was badly burnt, but once we pointed it out, they brought us some new pieces.  It still shouldn't have left the kitchen, though. For mains, I ordered the cilantro chicken and BF got the tomato garlic chicken. The cilantro chicken was pretty good, if you like cilantro.  I would have liked some extra texture on the skin, but it was well cooked, and fell off the bone.  It was served with rice pilaf that was a little overcooked, but had a good flavor, and a tomato based okra dish that wasn't anything special.  BF liked his dish, but I thought it was a little bland.  For dessert, they only had baklava, so we passed.  I like baklava, but can get that almost anywhere. We received very attentive service, but at another table, they never received their starters, which is a little strange.  I really like the music and the cheesy Egyptian decor; you really do feel like you've gotten away to the Middle East.  The dancers are talented, if a little past their prime.  The highlight of the night was the overall atmosphere and the fried eggplant salad, which was really remarkable.  If not for that salad and the fun experience, I probably would not go back. My husband treated me to a dinner at Al Masri through an offer he saw on Groupon.  We had previously strolled past this restaurant in the past during the day and had made a promise that we would eventually have dinner there. I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into Al Masri.  It was warmly lit and gave the feeling of a little nightclub in Cairo.  Although a few people have referred to them as kitsch, I really loved the little gold statuettes of goddesses, figurines of Horus and Set, papyrus scrolls on the walls, replica chairs found in King Tut's tomb, the street sign for Mohammed Ali Street, which is an entertainment district in Cairo.  Fun.  They appeared to have a full bar, although beer was the only alcohol offered on the menu. Our servers were low key, but had gentle, soft spoken personalities.  Astonishingly, we were the only other couple in the restaurant on a Friday night.  The only reason we could think of was because of how difficult it can be to find parking in the residential neighborhood.  Difficult, but not impossible.  That might be a deterrent. Their menu is relatively small, but nice.  They offer three different dishes, each, of lamb, chicken and fish, respectively.  We ordered the appetizer plate for two, which I thought was so delicious, and it was artfully presented.  I had Cornish game hen stuffed with wheat and currents.  The flavor and moist texture of the chicken was amazing.  My husband had lamb kebabs and really enjoyed them.  Each plate was served with a garnished rice dish formed into the shape of a pyramid, along with a small bowl of okra stew.  All very good. The belly dancer the evening we were at Al Masri was delightful and danced in the authentic, Classic Egyptian style, without veils or finger cymbals.  The music is classic Egyptian, as well.  I could have stayed there all night.  We plan to go again in the future. The price seemed a little expensive.  I imagine it's been tough going for this restaurant, and they need to pay their bills.   Still, it could be a deterrent, even if you use Groupon. Finally, I just wanted to mention that the single star reviewers of this restaurant seem to have an angry personal vendetta toward this establishment and I can't understand why.  It's a good thing I didn't read their reviews on Yelp before going to dinner. I love this place ,, the lamb was cooked really good, overall the food was really good. The service was great. Parking is not the best but overall I would come back I have been an avid yelp reader, but suddenly felt highly encouraged to start writing reviews.  Of course, Al Masri will be one of my first reviews since I had an unforgettable dining experience here. Came here with a party of  sometime back in April .  We had a voucher and were so excited to try a different cuisine.  We were seated immediately when we arrived.  Place was dark, cozy, and calm with a touch of ""Aladdin"" feel.   At that time, the place was half filled.  Hostess/server (same person, and one and only) was nice.  With a big group, we decided to do family style and ordered many dishes: orders of Maza for  (appetizer)Baba Ghannuug (eggplant appetizer)Riasch Mashwiya (rack of lamb)Musa ah (Vegetarian eggplant dish)Samak Mashwi (grilled fish)Long story short, the food took f o r e v e r to come.  Each dish was served one at a time with more than  minutes apart.  When the food came, I literally just had a bite of each dish because I wasn't fond of the taste.  Maybe it was the spice that made the dish so inedible.  Again, this is my first time trying Egyptian food, I wasn't sure what to expect.  On top of the slow service, they had a student belly dancer perform for about  minutes and it wasn't the most fun and entertaining to watch. They stopped all servicing during the performance (which makes sense), BUT our dinner was   hours long  I felt miserable. . . . and drained. Long Review :  I hate to give bad reviews, and I guess these people are trying but wow! I bought a groupon for this place without reading the reviews first. My husband visited on a Saturday. The servers wear mu mus that look like they decorated them themselves with glitter paint pens. Its like they are wearing faded nightgowns. It is weird.  And the decor is nightmarishly tacky. Its like every cheap Egyptian cliche was born in their dining room. They were friendly enough, but not good at their jobs. Like everyone has said. . . It takes FOREVER to get anything. We waited  minutes for bottled beers. The eggplant dip appetizer was actually really good. Everything else was over seasoned, and saturated in oil. I'm no skinny minnie who won't eat any fat. I love butter and oil, but this was so much that it turned my stomach almost immediately. My husband and I stayed positive as the belly dancer was sweet and the servers seemed like they were trying. By the end we were even chatting with everyone. Then the server brings the check and asks us to tip on the full bill and not the groupon amount. . . . . Obviously I was going to do that, but as a long time server I cannot stomach someone telling me what to tip them. . . especially when the service was awful. Rude! Short Review: My husband and I still laugh about how this was the worst restaurant we have ever been to, and we have both lived in third world countries. . . Quaint little restaurant with a cozy feel to it. The food was OK, the service was good, and the dancing were entertaining although the dancers were most likely students of the dance rather than accomplished.  Only in San Francisco will you see a belly dancer with bight dyed pink/red hair with black highlights!!The staff was very friendly and attentive.  Prices were about average. This is a nice place to eat, relax, and enjoy the entertainment. This place is a JOKE!  I really hate writing bad reviews. . . but this place honestly deserves one. Came here for my Aunt's th Birthday and thought we would have a night of celebration, laughter, good food, entertainment and memories.  We did make memories. . . ones that we  would like to not remember.  The ambiance of the place was nice, and the Egyptian decor added a nice touch to the theme. . but that was probably the only thing likable. We had a party of  so most of our party sat at a long table, while a couple of us sat at a neighboring one next to the main table.  Immediately after being seated we were given pita and hummus for appetizers. They actually didn't give us enough for our entire party, and getting some more just seemed to take forever. Our party opted for their $ dinner which included the appetizer, our buffet dinner, entertainment and dessert. Dinner was supposed to be served up at pm, but it was a little late. . . and totally not worth waiting for.  When dinner was finally served, only about half the restaurant was able get their food while the rest waited for the buffet to be refilled.  My cousin, who had originally set up the reservation did some research, checked the menu online and even confirmed with one of the ladies that worked at the restaurant that we would have a pretty vast array of foods to choose from.  If you take a look at their menu, they have so many dishes that sound wonderful. . . so why were we ONLY served, Chicken, rice, salad and fish for the buffet?   items!  A four item buffet. . . is that even a buffet? unheard of.  I know we should have taken one look at the buffet and made a U turn to leave. . . but after waiting for what seemed an hour to eat, the party was starving and we knew it would be difficult to get a reservation elsewhere for a party as big as ours.  Next was the entertainment.  Entertaining is the wrong word to describe what we witnessed.  I would post pix up of our belly dancers, but that would just be mean.  I don't even have the heart to describe what they considered entertainment.  I'll just put it this way. . . it was almost impossible to keep the meager buffet dinner down.  When you hear belly dancers, you imagine (Google images  'belly dancers'). What we saw was more of a freak show.  More than watching our entertainment for the night, I found the expressions held on other customers' faces a lot more amusing. The party wasn't thrilled with the food or the entertainment and decided to hit the road before the show was even over. I felt bad that my aunt had hopes to have an enjoyable th birthday, but instead brought in the year at this place. I say, save your $ + tip & tax and go elsewhere. . . ANYWHERE but here. I also must add, this place needs some pest control. The abundance of insects and moths flying around the entrance is a hazard. Cute little place.  Nice service.   It was a birthday celebration with  in our party.  Only one person was happy with their food (lamb kabobs).  The rest of the party were disappointed .  We were there on a night where it was amateur night for the belly dancer and she truly was an amateur.  Unfortunately, that was not the place or day to have a celebration.  Probably a fun place to hang out but just not for a special occasion.  Sorry. This is one of those times that different aspects of the experience were pretty much polar opposites. Everything took FOREVER. We weren't served bread and za'atar for over  minutes, until I'd asked twice for it. There were two women serving the dining room, only one of whom actually took orders. However, they were absent altogether from the room for lengthy periods (and the music had gone off, too), and many of the diners seemed to be a bit confused/annoyed. The food, however, was delicious especially the baked salmon with raisins, almonds and caramelized onions. Then again, paying our check took FOREVER. If you're super patient and want good Egyptian food, go here. Took some out of town visiting family here for some fun. While the atmosphere is fun, their service has a LOT to be desired.  The woman that sat us was gruff and very impolite, sort of throwing the menus at us. Then when it came time to order, a very ditzy woman came out to talk to us about the menu.  We had to ask her to come back  times before she actually came back and took the order for appetizers then another  times to get her to come back and take our dinner order.  The appetizers had arrived and were eaten before we had our dinner order taken.  Then once we got dinner, the food was just OK overall.  Getting and paying the check was just as much of a hassle as getting the orders taken.  Not much more to say than the staff needs to actually pay attention to their tables, their own manners and think through how a table of people would typically like to eat. Had the pleasure of accompaning my wife to this restaurant, where she was one of the performers, she is a belly dancer, and had their excellent buffett, There was so many things, including fish, chicken (several kinds) salad of fresh vegetables with what appear to be a light olive oil vinagrette, vegetable dishes with eggplant. Everything was great, and for being a specialty restaurant in San Francisco, the price wass also very decent. I recommend this place. Oh, I almost forgot, try the hot chili sauce, good stuff. And the service was great, including the house dancer, she made it fun."|2|96|2|Routine Inspection| Unclean nonfood contact surfaces Wiping cloths not clean or properly stored or inadequate sanitizer  [ date violation corrected: 7/10/2014 ]
Al Masri 1|3.0|Middle Eastern in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|161|1|3.12173913043|" nothing impressed me about this place at all. the food wasn't memorable and the belly dancing performance didn't make the experience any better. the decor is too busy and the service is slow and inattentive. if you live in the area and you don't want to go to any of the other joints close by give it a try if you dare, but don't say i didn't warn you. prices are high for what you get and you will not leave satisfied. I've lived here in San Francisco for over  years and I didn't know about this restaurant until a real good friend of mine suggested that we dine here with his Groupon.  He and I were so impressed and we both enjoyed the food so much.  The rating I see is pretty low, but I rate it to the max since I really like Egyptian food and this is the only Egyptian restaurant here in northern California and in San Francisco.  I've been here twice now and I really loved the appetizers, food and the belly dance entertainment.  Both times the food and service were excellent.  The servers are friendly, too. The nd time I brought one of my visiting GF's from Hawaii (she's a native San Franciscan like me) and another SF native, too.  We all loved the food.  The food I really want to emphasize are:  Baba Ghannuug (eggplant puree with tahina, garlic, lemon juice, drizzled with extra virgin oil),  Salatet Betingen (fried eggplant, parsley, tomato, scallions, house dressing), Salatet Sabanekh (fresh spinach, caramelized onions, pine nuts, garlic, house dressing) for the salads, Gambari Mashwi  Grilled prawns with a butter garlic sauce; Kebab Harouf  Grilled lamb with a butter garlic sauce; Baraber Mahshia  Baked Cornish game hen stuffed with rice, onions, raisins, roasted almonds, pine nuts; Kebab Harouf  Grilled lamb with a butter garlic sauce; and Musa'ah  Layered eggplant with taro root fries, zucchini, tomato, bell pepper (this was my favorite).  For dessert, we tried their version of Baklava. I would love to bring my family there.  Can't wait to go there again! The food was good/okay but the overall experience was terrible. The belly dancers were alright. The venalition was BAD. It was so smokey in there. N the food took freakin forever. The taste of food is probably good, but it's not my preference so I can't judge or compare this place because it's not a food that WOWed me but I know the taste is not bad at all. Man, I hope I'm making sense. I just don't like the fact that it's so smokey and the wait for food was long. My friends were there at , they ordered at :. I rolled in at : and guess what, the freakin appetizer that we order was still not there. we waited another  mins in order to get food. Ugh, for me being impatient but the turnover time is just too long for me. The Kusari and hot sauce that came with it brought me back to the time when I was an exchange student in Egypt.  If there is any loss of authenticity, it would be the absence of another condiment: vinegar infused with lemon juice.  Good, decent food overall.  However, if you just want to have a quiet meal with your spouse, don't go there. I recently had to go out to San Francisco on business. My Client owns many restaurants in California but asked me to meet him and his two Partners for dinner. We have known each other for years and had met while traveling in Europe. We both enjoy all types of different foods from around the world and he felt that the Al Masri Egyptian Restaurant would be the perfect spot. For me going out to eat is an escape from the stress of having a business and a growing family. Our culture here in the United States has programmed us that we are supposed to eat fast and be out in an hour. That is to stressful and I do not like one course right after another. In the case of Al Masri you also have the entertainment to relax and enjoy. I have traveled around the world twice and traditional food that would be served in ones home is always my favorite. Al Masri delivered on all of my needs and more. We were seated and immediately I felt like I was in Egypt and all of the stress in my head was gone. We talked for a few minutes and our starters arrived. The  Imported Egyptian beef pastrami was amazing. The Yogurt cheese and garlic served with sliced cucumber was a great combination that was refreshing but not overpowering. Our last item the Egyptian fried ""felafel"" that was such an unique item we all enjoyed. I ordered my favorite food, the Grilled rack of lamb with a butter garlic sauce. The temperature was perfect.  In the big box chain steak houses I have paid twice what Al Masri charged and did not have the distinct flavor profile and tenderness. Some people want the cookie cutter chain restaurant feel and frozen food experience. If your looking for an authentic Egyptian traditional look and feel without the cost of flying half way around the world you can find it at Al Masri. Great food, great value and a chance to leave the fast pace world we live in for a few hours. This is now a must have experience whenever I am in town. Located in a quiet neighborhood.  Definitely a great date spot.  Too bad it wasn't the night for the belly dancer.  That would have been nice to watch.  I got to try Egyptian food, which I had been wanting to, so I was happy to check this out. Very Egyptian in decor.  Friendly servers. Clean.  Yes, there is a wait altho their were only  tables they were serving on that particular night.  Imagine when the place gets busy. . . I wanted to try out most of what was on the appetizers so I suggested Maza for .  Great selection.  The eggplant had an interesting flavor and spicy kick.  I pretty much enjoyed all the selection. For our entree we decided to share the baked cornish game hen.  The portion was huge.  It was stuff with wheat that night instead of rice.  Our server came to ask if that was okay and it was actually better that if it would have been rice.  The dish had a side of rice and okra soup.  Not a fan of okra so my friend happily finished the small bowl.  Overall, I made a good choice on this item. Good experience. . . maybe because of the company I had?  But the food was okay and I won't mind coming back. I have NO idea why the ratings for this restaurant are so low, and the note about the ambiance being touristy  really? I totally disagree. When you walk in, there's a wide open seating area with great decor and energy. There's a private seating area in an upper level that overlooks the restaurant (which I STILL want to reserve for my birthday one day!), and the food was fantastic. What got me the most though was that the service was genuine and extremely friendly  I can't remember if it was the owner or the manager who sat us and saw us through the meal, but I remember his great advice about the coffee and dessert  both of which were the best I'd had in ANY restaurant. I'm obviously hoping to go there again soon and bring a crowd because that place offers such a great experience. Oh yeah, and there's belly dancing ;P we got a groupon for this place. The service was very European, by this I mean, SLOW. Once you adjusted to that, the food was excellent, each thing we ordered was better than the last, and it was all superb. The belly dancing came on and that was wonderful too. Go here as the event of the night, when you are ready to relax. And check your bill and restate your order and have her say it back, the lady who takes orders gets a bit mixed up. Unfortunately, I have to rename this place Al Misery. I bought a coupon without Yelping the place. My mistake. I couldn't resist as I love Egyptian themes and wanted to try the food. When we got out there (and it's WAY out there, unless you live out there but we live in the Mission), the facade was cute and colorful with, you know, Anubis and some other god painted on the doors. We walk in and it's loud and there's a belly dancer performing for about  people. That's great! Didn't expect that. My boyfriend wasn't so keen on putting the dollar in her ""bra strap"", however. The decor was pretty cool, but the best was the ancient egyptian hieroglyphed toilet seat! They have every single Egyptian tschotchke ever made in that restaurant. They even have a reproduction of Tut's chair. The staff was a sight. What an interesting bunch. Straight out of a movie. Anyway, the waitress tells us first thing ""We have a buffet tonight. "" and I say, ""Well, we're vegan. "" and she says ""Oh. "" and goes to get menus. She comes back and says ""We do have some salad in the buffet. . . . "" and we say we'll consider. We decide on two $  items on the menu and receive pita with hummous. The food comes and they are both large dishes. We thought they were alright, but didn't have much spice. Even the hummous was a little bland. The eggplant seemed like it just had tomato sauce and salt and the pasta, rice, lentil dish was interesting but lacked a little oomph as well, spice wise. We asked for olives because olives rock this kind of food. So we get the check and see that we were charged $ each instead of the $ each and I ask why. The waitress tells me THEN that it's ""BUFFET NIGHT"" and it's a fixed price of $ each. Well, we didn't know that, especially by how she presented the buffet to us in the beginning. So the owner, I guess, showed up and we had to argue with her about the bill which TOTALLY ruined the whole thing. I would have rated this restaurant  stars and deemed it worthy to go if I wanted somewhere unusual to go with a small group of friends, for a birthday or something ONLY if someone had a car! But we will never go there again because the owner wouldn't give us the original price without ARGUING about it and then adding on the pita, hummous (which we didn't ask for) and the olives. The menu with the $ menu items is easily changed for the special ""buffet night"" as it's only a paper menu. Give people the buffet menu on Sundays and you won't have this problem! I see that others have complained about the expensive buffet night. Who charges $ for a BUFFET anyway?! It was a long camel ride, my friends, and we don't like the old ""bait and switch"" approach to ordering and paying.  They can keep their knick knacks and belly dancers. We are used to the BEST food, so cheap, friendly, free pita, olives, side dishes, etc right when you sit down at Old Jerusalem in our own hood, which I'll ululate, I mean Yelp next. I can't wait to read the LONG reply that Sausan will surely post refuting everything! I think the idea of having a nice show and a meal is great. I went with my girl on a last minute groupon deal for our anniversary. I give the folks there an ""A"" for effort. I found the server very attentive and the atmosphere was really nice. (I do love a place that wants you to enjoy the atmosphere. ) The chef is the owner, and she seemed to really love what she does  which does account for something in this world. I would call the cuisine we had  ""Egyptian inspired"" but not authentic. I can't say I would recommend the buffet, as there was only about  items, and none were veggie (they will however make veggie for you if you ask. )   If you are a foodie  you will not be impressed with the buffet, so I would skip it (as sadly, we most likely will. ) I might call Sunday's a ""fixed menu"" night instead of buffet. We ate the buffet / veggie dishes and felt a little a queasy afterwards. I then ate the leftovers, and yet again felt queasy. (I suppose I am a candidate for the Darwin awards for having done that! ;)  $/person is just too much to experience that again. It might be worth a try some other night, though. All in all, it's a really nice atmosphere and the chef and the dancers all have a BUNCH of heart and seem really kind. They just need to work at the recipes a little, maybe bolster the buffet a bit more than rice, salad, and a few other items. To anyone tempted into writing another cruel review about the dancers (the reviewers in question mostly my fellow MEN mind you): Get a life! You can review without being mean spirited. I challenge YOU to get up in front of a bunch of strangers with your Buddah beer bellies and express yourself, instead of opening your mouth to spew your boring brain and bad attitude. If you are frustrated because you didn't get any, take it out in the Tenderloin, NOT on the dancers. Do you know that they read these posts, you neanderthals? *breath*IN SHORT: Go for the atmosphere, hummus, glass of wine, and enjoy some friendly dancers. Skip the buffet  I wanted to like it, really. . . alas. Price doesn't justify terrible service. Perhaps their service is top notch by egyptian standards, doesn't cut it for SF. Rude waiters, we agreed to pay corkage fee, but they still gave us hard time for bringing in our drinks. Food was just OK, lamb was barely warm. Humus was good  but how hard is it screw up that? Over all  not worth it! Thanks, Al Masri!  You did a great job with our party of , which led to a most enjoyable evening for all. If you can't handle reservations in your restaurant then don't make them. Groupon or not Groupon. . It shouldn't matter. If you choose to advertise your business on a marketing website, you should be a responsible business owner and uphold your ad to the fullest. What keeps Groupon users from using their Groupon in your particular restaurant  until the last minute are the terrifying reviews that make them regret ever purchasing them. As a consumer you give business the benefit of the doubt. In your establishment, there Is nothing but the truth about what a disaster it truly is. This place was a waste of my life. Hands down the worst restaurant I've ever been to. Mind blowingly horrible service, if you can call it that, and bland crappy food. And now my clothes smell like grease. If you decide to go even after reading my review, I'll laugh and say I told you so. Actually, I won't laugh, because I'll be so pissed that you went. This place is an authentic Egyptian tourist trap. Dishes are outrageously overpriced ($ and up). The food is bad. The service is bad. The decor (plastic plants and all) is tacky. The restaurant was filled with smoke. EVERYONE here was dinning because of a groupon. Wow, where to begin.  Do you want to dine in a smokey, windowless box with tasteless, oil drenched food?  Or be subjected to abysmal service by apathetic waitresses and the worst belly dancers you've ever seen? Then come on in!Seriously, this place is awful.  On a whim I bought a Groupon for this place, excited to see a Middle Eastern spot near my hood.  My girlfriend and I walked in during the middle of a belly dance ""performance""  it felt more like an outtake from ""Borat"" (at least that would have been entertaining!).  The servers were clueless and inattentive, and it took forever to flag one down to place an order.  We remained optimistic  after all, sometimes the atmosphere and service sucks but the food is redeeming.  Not so at Al Masri!  The food was actually the worst part (and that's saying a lot).  Here's what we found: The falafels were tasteless, dry hockey pucks.  And when I say tasteless, I mean, they didn't even put salt in it.  And I hate overly salty food.  The salads were also tasteless and drenched in oil. . . are you getting the theme here?  I begrudgingly asked for salt and pepper (didn't help much).  Moussaka was. . . you guessed it. . . tasteless and drenched in oil!  It was clearly made from tomato paste out of a can.  No spice whatsoever.  Bleh. In summary. . . stay away.  There are way better Middle Eastern spots in the city. Okay, real talk. . This place needs a whole entire renovation, starting with its staff and most importantly the chef! Okay peoples, to be honest and quite frank about things; this place is very unforgiving. I genuinely never think negative analytically, hence why this is my first YELP post leads me to tell you why I have a YELP account is because of this restaurant! I wouldnt even call it a restaurant, it would get brownie points if all they did were sell hookah which they arent even involved in and its an egyptian theme! Heres the breakdown YelpERS'I go up in there cleanly minded and not too sure on what to think of the place. I usually have an open mind considering its a new place in my book. I pay $ for a BUFFETT which is meant for dinner. I seriously made the biggest mistake in my life, I felt as we were in a second world country eating! Rice, Chicken thighs, Some beef skewers, and very little to none salad. All of the above were either undercooked or had some sort of very potent seasoning which in results of my SMALL dinner,made my stomach turn almost immediately! I had paid for this food which was worth way less than $. I honestly wouldnt have had minded, considering the place needed renovating. What extremely KILLED the night after all these negatives. . . OLD FAT WRINKLY STRETCHMARKED CELLULITE BELLY DANCERS!!I mean lord have mercy, she was  foot with a belly looking as if she was pregnant which she wasnt! People, please renovate. . Fix your music, Fix the bellydancers, Fix the staff, and most of all FIX YOUR FOOD. The next time I go fulfilling my curiousity with foreign food im not familiar with, I DEFINITLY will research A LOT more. I dined and danced at Al Masri last night and had a fabulous experience.  The buffet last night was authentic Egyptian cuisine, which consisted of very moist chicken, rice with a few noodles, a couple of other dishes and a wonderful green salad.  The food was extremely fresh and tasty.  Forgot to include the complimentary pita bread, olive oil and dipping spices to the Koshari!  The service was excellent.  The staff are very warm and accommodating.  The owner is also warm and engaging. If you are looking for some wonderful bellydance and good food, I would highly recommend this restaurant! I was really excited to try Egyptian food, but i was pretty disappointed. We found this place off of the Groupon Ap, and my boyfriend and i figured we'd give it a shoot. The place is beautiful inside and the belly dancer was very energetic. However, that was the best part. The lady that took our order reeked on some sort of body odor. Then, they forgot my boyfriends meal. I was pretty upset since we waited about an hour just to get our one dish. We didn't even get to use the Groupon, since ""we didn't spend enough"". We left hungry and disappointed. We will never go back. I must say I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THESE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ARE ALL ABOUT. Yes, the location is  ""out of the way"" to quote a recent reviewer, but so are many restaurants in the area, therefore that's BEYOND ridiculous! I guess you will never enjoy the awesome restaurants the Berkeley has to offer, for example. The service is kind and hospitable. They were prompt, friendly and engaging. There were the floor manager and another gentleman. Both, well mannered, responsive, attentive. Food may take a bit longer than most restaurants, but if you realize about it, it's FRESH FOOD people!  More so, it's authentic! Everything is absolutely delicious! from the pita bread, olive oil and dipping spices to the Koshari! *YUM!* I simply cannot wait to go back!Oh! Valentina! how could I not mention her! gorgeous smile, and her hips kept us all hypnotized the entire time. Playful, gracious, definitely entertaining. I must repeat, if you want fast food, go to McDonald's.  This s not a place to go in a rush, it's a whole experience. Casual, relaxed, amenable and entertaining. This was definitely a one star experience save for the belly dancer who was very enthusiastic and charming Location  way, way out there! Too far given the food (below) Food  AWFUL! AWFUL! AWFUL!  This one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had in SF. Went here as a result of a Groupon ( another reason one should never buy Groupons for untried restaurants). Ordered baba ghanoush as an appetizer which was a red flag because it came with stale pita bread. Really! The one thing a Middle Eastern restaurant should get right and they miss that one. Ordered the lamb rack, lamb meatballs with cheese and sole ( sister wanted salmon but it cost $ extra). The lamb rack came with  measly pieces and terrible okra as a side dish. The meatballs were heartier but completely tasteless. Special mention how crappy the sides are  they come in condiment bowls stewed in some awful broth). Service  only one server but given that there were  tables in the house, it was appropriate. Glasses of water were not refilled but a glass of tea was quickly refilled ( and charged for). Food took  minutes from ordering. Entertainment  Valentina, the resident belly dancer, dances every  hour at the half hour mark. She is enthusiastic, charming, dances well and engages the crowd. She was the only redeeming feature of this restaurant. My partner and I purchased the recently offered Groupon for Al Masri and made a reservation for dinner with some hesitation, given the number of mixed and negative reviews on Yelp.  That being said, I can honestly say that I haven't a clue as to why these negative reviews were given; our experience was completely positive.  Service was cordial and attentive; the food was, from appetizers to dessert, uniformly well prepared, generously portioned, and beautifully presented.  Some reviewers complained about issues with the bill, unfounded charges, etc.  (one reviewer criticizes the restaurant for offering dessert and then complaining that they were charged for it.  For God's sake: the price of desserts is plainly listed on the menu. )  None of these complaints were pertinent in our experience at Al Masri tonight.  I'd encourage readers to ignore the routine carping that appears on Yelp from reviewers who seem ridiculously entitled and to try Al Masri.  It's great! This is the same shady business that defaulted on its contract with ""Entertainment. "" Once the "" entrees for "" deals brought them enough business, they decided to stop accepting the coupons about half way through the year and simply began turning people away at the door. Now, surprise, they need help again and are using Group On's services. Folks, I have not yet eaten here. My  people party was politely turned away, even though they would have cashed in via  complete meals plus tips, with only a single entree discount.  Still, old habits die hard.  Please don't be surprised if you get turned away at the door like I did. I wish yelp let one do half stars, then I would give them  / stars.  I went with  because I do not want people to be put off by this restaurant.  I read the reviews on yelp and worried about going here to use my voucher ($ for $ worth of food).  I wanted to share our experience to put others at ease.  Of course every night is different, but we had a nice experience.  To be honest, the service is a tad slow, but I noticed the server tell each table, ""I will be right with you"" or ""thank you for waiting"".  It was as if they read the reviews, and were conscious of folks feeling service was slow.  The appetizers were  stars, we loved the babganoush, but preferred not to have deep fried pita for dipping, this is a personal preference only.  We both ordered different fish dishes, with the sole.  They were both cooked perfectly.  The rice and okra that came with it was lovely.  We did not have dessert so cannot comment on that.  If you are in the area, and want to try here, do so, you may really enjoy it!  also, when the check came, the server went over the bill with me and explained everything clearly.  Gratuity was NOT added, and we tipped accordingly (% on the original price before voucher).  Yes, there was a tip envelope included for the belly dancer, but we didn't find that offensive, the lady is trying to make a living like the rest of us. I recently had food catered from Al Masri restaurant for my mother's th birthday bash a couple weekends ago.  The food was AMAZINGLY authentic and the quantity was more than we expected with plenty of left overs.  I'm pleased with the quality and quantity, thank you Chef Suasan! Al Masri is positively charming, Not a white tablecloth experience with airs, which apparently is what some of these review writin' losers expect? Srsly, I don't understand their beefs. The decor is Egypto kitch, and they have belly dancers every night. If you've been to La Mediteranee and the like, you're sort of familiar with many of the food options, like the appetizer assortment platter that  of us shared, but I assure you at Al Masri the standards taste way fresher, lighter and just perfect. The musa'ah, which we shared for an entree (layered eggplant with taro root fries, zucchini & tomato, was seriously one of the best things I have ever eaten. Period. End of story. Got a TownHog coupon for this place. Ambiance: When you walk inside, it is like you are sitting in an outdoor courtyard in Egypt.  The place is meticulously decorated in Egyptian theme. Service:Only  female waiters.  They were very nice and attentive.  We ordered a bottle of wine and they would come and refill them for us.  They also kept the water glass full.  I notice on some tables without wine, had the water vessel on the table for self serving. Food/Drinks. :When we ordered our food, they asked us twice whether we wanted an appetizer because our entrees would take a while to come out (it took  minutes).  We declined the appetizer, but they give you these slices of pita like bread plus olive oil & spices to dip.  We ordered a bottle of wine, thinking that like most places, a glass of wine = half a glass.  But surprisingly we saw on the other tables that they actually pour a full glass (note that the glass is not large either).  Btw, their house wine is Yellowtail. Our two entrees arrived lukewarm.  () $ Gambari Mashwi  Grilled prawns with a butter garlic sauce, with 'Ul 'As  Taro Root, Swiss chard  both the prawns and side was good with a pyramid shaped pile of rice pilaf. () $ Lahma Mahshiya  Stuffed tenderloin with cheese and parsley, and toppedwith a garlic, onion, nutmeg, lemon sauce, with Mulu'khia  Jute plant  Do not order this entree.  The presentation was basically beef balls with cheese in the middle and too much cheese.  The side of Jute plant tasted like super slimy spinach.  It also came with with a pyramid shaped pile of rice pilaf. Cleanliness:The table had a dark decorative table cloth, but it was had bread crumbs and little pieces of rice here and there.  One of the forks had a piece of veggie stuck on it.  Maybe because the place is dark and they can't see this too well?  Nevertheless not acceptable.  Bathrooms upstairs were decorated very nicely and clean. Entertainment. I guess every evening they have dancers come out to perform.  For this evening, a dancer came out to dance in the middle of restaurant for about minutes or so and in the process corralled a couple of customers to go up.  What cheapen the entire experience for us was that towards the end she was making her way around the table for tips!!  That means you're not better than a stripper.  I felt for a moment I was at a strip joint.  Very tasteless.  Oh btw, when they give you the bill, there another little envelope soliciting tips for the dancer again.  Other Notes:) Towards the end of the meal, the restaurant was just covered with smoke.  I don't know what the kitchen was cooking up or whether their ventilation system suddenly broke down. ) Don't think it is worth it to celebrate a birthday here because of the hefty per head cake fee.  Website says $.  per head.  The menu says $.  per head. The bad reviews posted here seem to refer to another restaurant. Our experience was totally positive. The food was delicious and the service perfect. The waitress was very nice. We arrived at .  p. m. and everyone else was leaving, but they did a special belly dance show only for us. The restaurant is small but very cute, with its middle eastern style furniture. I do not have nothing to complain! So, the food here, at least the Masa'ah, was pretty good.  The belly dancer that came out eventually was also very good and nice to watch while I ate my food.  I can respect that the owner of this business is passionate about Egyptian culture, and I've heard that when this restaurant hosts big events, it's quite fun.  However, our service was HORRIBLE.  It was a slow, quiet night at the restaurant, but it took us at least  minutes after sitting down to even get menus and water.  It took forever for us to be able to order, to get our food, to get our check, and we had to ask several times to order and to get our check.  During out waits, we also had the pleasure of seeing the lone waitress go around to different tables and apologize for screwing up their bills.  Again, I could understand a longer wait  and mistakes if it had been busy, but there were only  tables, including our,  occupied at a time.   Our waitress than tried to insist that we were obligated to pay her a % tip because we used a groupon (amazon's version actually) which is a flatout falsehood.  % tips are for good service, lady, and that's not what you provided.  I recommend that the owner and chef really replace her waitress if she can't shape up fast, given the damage being done to her business. Note: I contacted AmazonLocal and LivingSocial in regards to unethical tip policy, and they refunded my money and are investigating. If you were forced to pay a % tip ""because it's in the fine print"", contact the company (Groupon included). I would need to be paid to go back to Al Masri. All told, it took over  minutes to go in and out, which might not seem bad, except that the restaurant was deserted and my dining partner and I had studied the menu online and knew exactly what we wanted. Thankfully I didn't have time sensitive plans that night, but really I have better things to do with my time than sit in a restaurant full of decor so tacky I thought I was in the Luxor casino. Our time was divided as follows: minutes waiting for menus minutes waiting for our order to be taken minutes waiting for food minutes eating and watching belly dancing minutes waiting for the bill minutes waiting for our food to be boxedFor those of you keeping track at home, % of our time was spent doing something that was NOT waiting. And % of our time was spent waiting for various things. At the start, there were three other tables occupied. I didn't realize it at first, but each of those tables had been finished for a while, and was simply waiting on the bill. In each of those cases, the bill had to be recalculated, I'm assuming because of mathematical difficulties. By the time I got my water and order taken, one other table was occupied. Only one employee was waiting on customers, which shouldn't have been a problem but somehow was. The food itself was fine. Unimpressive, but fine. My impression is that Egyptian food is identical to Greek and other Middle Eastern foods. It may not be, but based on the menu and my order, I can only assume this is the case. The food was a bit pricey, especially considering the outrageously slow service. The belly dancing was fine, although the creepy old guys at the next table sneaking leering glances while their wives pretended not to notice was a bit off putting. My main problem came with the bill. My AmazonLocal/LivingSocial certificate was counted correctly, but a % tip was added. I tend to tip generously, but not when service is that catastrophically slow. As suggested by every deal website ever, I tip based on the full amount, not just the excess beyond the certificate. Thankfully I saw other folks' Yelp! reviews and knew this might be coming. I asked the server, and she mumbled something about being part of the coupon. I asked for clarification, as I regularly use deal certificates, and nowhere in them or the menu was anything about a mandatory tip mentioned. She then claimed it was part of the fine print. During my  minutes at the restaurant, I had plenty of time to read and re read this particular certificate. Nowhere on AmazonLocal, or LivingSocial, or the certificate itself, did it say anything of the sort. Rather than cause a scene, I paid the amount stated. I verified later, and as evidenced by the refund and investigation by both companies, the woman lied to me. Even more absurdly, the woman said that the mandatory tip was necessary because the workers make minimum wage. That, I should point out, is not my fault, but management's. I assume that she must be management, as I can't imagine such a slow, surly server being any type of employee, at least not for long. Certainly food service employees depend upon tips, and I tend to tip generously. But lying to my face and extorting additional money is not the way to go. If the restaurant doesn't want to abide by deal sites' certificates, they probably shouldn't sign up for them.  stars because my seasoned grilled tilapia was actually very tasty. Minus  stars because $ for an appetizer,  entrees, and  beers is ridiculous for Outer Richmond. Not to mention how incredibly slow and dishonest our waitress was. The husband and I were there with  other couples and we were the the only people in the entire place. Everything seemed to be going ok during the actual dinner itself. The belly dancer even performed twice while we there. Probably because we were there a total of .  hours, that's how slow service was. It was when the checks finally came that things started to go awry. First, I noticed that they initially charged us  the full $ for our appetizer (all  couples wanted the same sampler appetizer; it was $ for  people, but only an extra $ for every extra person. . .  people = $). I looked at the other couples' checks and they did the same thing on their checks too. However, we noticed that the $ appetizers were eventually scratched out and each couple was charged $.  (total of $) for the appetizers. Okay, thanks for correcting the mistake, but why did you guys try to cheat us in the first place? Secondly, we noticed that we were all charged for dessert when no one ordered dessert. The waitress had come out  minutes prior with a tray of tiny little cakes and said, ""Here's some dessert for you all! Who'd like some?"" Thinking it was free, some of us took a plate. So when we got the bill, imagine our surprise and disgust when we see that we are charged $ per dessert. And these things were tiny. About  inch wide,  inches long, .  inch thick and cold. How tacky is that to offer food and not tell you that it's not free? The final straw was that it took half an hour for our already very slow waitress  to recalculate our  bills and all she had to do was take away the dessert charges. I don't know how the other couples feel since we were all in such a hurry to get home after spending so much time there, but the husband and I will not be returning. i never order chikken at a restaurant, but this place is the exception. the Firakh Fe Alforn is so dericious!  i can't get enough of their baked chikken. nom nom nom it's a small little place, I went here with a friend on Friday night, there's a belly dancer performing here. . the food was good, I ordered a Rack of lamb, it was really good, especially the rice. . love it, however, it took a long time for us to wait for the food. My family and I headed out here during their buffet experience. The amount of variety, or lack of variety surprised all  of us. There were only  things offered during the buffet. There were Baked or broiled Chicken Leg Quarters did not have any flavor. They had a slightly salty and game smell. And these were in a very watery substance, not sauce. Boiled fish, which tasted really salty. Lamb or beef kabobs in a red sauce. These were really loose and had no grill taste, making me think that they were baked. Rice (looked like something out of a box) and salad with some sort of an oil dressing. The other issue was they there were very slow to refill the items. After the customersgot their items, it took over  minutes for the empty trays to get refilled. They also served hummus and pita. But there wasn't anything authentic about this either. This buffet, at $/person was not worth it. They also added the tip to the bill. About %. And this for service almost non existance. All the staff ever did was refill the water. The food had no Egyptian traditional flavors. This seriously looked like cafeteria food. When I had called in to make this reservation, the owner, told me that there would be Egyptian flavors on the menu. But this wasn't what we had expected. The ""entertainment"" was about as bad as the food. This was a really bad experience. The food, entertainment and location all accumulated to a bad evening and wasted money. Five stars:+ Delicious, authentic Egyptian cuisine+ Tasteful, varied selection of excellent dancers+ Dancers perform EVERY night the restaurant is open, so every dinner is dinner + show+ Unique, Egyptian theme decor with a cozy feel+ Delightful owner and chef (Sausan)+ Given that this restaurant is absolutely one of a kind, and also is a Bay area middle eastern dance institution, it gets five stars because it is incomparable. Helpful notes:Street parking generally available within a few blocks' distance.  Reservations recommended because the restaurant is small in size. Room for improvement:Service quality can vary, depending on the server and her workload  No free refills on soft drinks or tea.  (OK in Egypt, less than OK in the USA. )Responses to some unusually negative reviews:There have been some managerial and staff changes in the past few years, so some reviews may no longer apply.  With respect to Groupon and tipping issues, please note that any gift certificates for restaurant use, including those from Groupon, mandate that () one tips on the original total, not the discounted total  and often require that () the tip must be % or greater (in the case of Restaurant. com certificates), regardless of party size. The dinner was good, the service was fine, and then the bill came. The server showed me a bill with the total, subtracted my groupon, then had a ""suggested tip of %. "" Well, apparently it was not only suggested, but required, because as i gave her my credit card, she billed me for the total (minus the groupon), and then the % suggested tip amount, without asking me. I have been to a lot of restaurants in my life BUT NEVER has anything like this ever happened. What a classless, dishonest , and low life thing to do. First of all, dont suggest to me a tip, i am an adult capable of figuring out percentages on my own. But on top of that, adding a % suggested tip without my permission? Wife and I went to celebrate wedding anniversary.  Food was not very good, I has a rack of lamb and received individual very well done lamb chops, vegetable was mushy, and the rice not very tasty. The belly dancing was not traditional and the dancer was not very good. Over all the experience was NOT good. We will not return. Judging from the mixed reviews of this place, it seems like there are two chefs or perhaps there are two restaurants that are identical but switch between universes. I was hesitant to eat here but a friend was belly dancing that night and so joined the party of pals who were going to cheer her on. First of all, the service was annoying. The older waitress was irritated at such a big party (um. . . shouldn't she have been grateful that there were so many customers?) and was flustered and couldn't seem to get anything right. Several people in our party had to wait for nearly  minutes for a drink. Not mixed cocktails, but beer and wine. Also, a couple of people in our party were told to wait outside for nearly half an hour to be seated even though there were more than two spots at our table. Then they waited half an hour for their food. The food was mediocre. The hummus was okay. The falafel y things were okay. The chicken was okay, and the rice was bland. The wine was pretty bad. Overpriced for what I had. The decor was definitely Egyptian themed  kind of like one of those love motels with theme rooms  even the toilet seats had Egyptian motifs! It was fun, verging on a little tacky, but then I'm more about the less is more decorating esthetic. HOWEVER, I enjoyed the belly dancing. Not just because my pal was dancing, but it's kind of fun to watch. If you don't like belly dancing, loud music, or just general revelry, this is *not* the place for you (it kind of reminds me of Greek themed restaurants where everyone gets drunk and smashes plates on the floors and dance in circles). No doubt the owner will probably post a counter review  remember, it is my First Amendment right to voice an opinion, by the way  but try it if you are interested. . . it definitely appeals to some people and not to others. I am in the latter group. Okay. . . wow. . . where do I start. . . . I blame Groupon because their deal is the reason I came here tonight,Now food is good. . . not gonna lie. . however not that good where its worth the pathetic service and arrogance I got tonight. Unless you are the Dali lama and have that kind of patience stay AWAY!. we had reservations and took  mins for them to take our order.  mins to get a bottled beer. . .  mins to get our food. . . and  mins to get our check. . . I'm not exaggerating either! OMG. . . really if you can't handle the rush then why did you agree to hook up with Groupon! No apology for the wait and at the end they slap on automatic gratuity! WTF really. . . I did not pay it. . . the main server is this beast of a woman. . . she didn't care at all. . . the belly dancer was fat. . . and the food is the only saving grace but still not worth it!DAMN YOU GROUPON DAMN YOU ! My girl friend took me here for my birthday on a saturday night. I got the lamb: delicious, and served with a pyramid shaped pile of delicious rice. She got the chicken, which was also very tasty. As an Egyptian, I can tell you their tea selection is authentic. In fact, the menu seemed to be a near comprehensive collection of most of the Egyptian dishes I knew (and some I didn't know about). The wine selection, while far larger than it would be in Egypt, was a bit sparse for SF. The decor in the restaurant was comically Egypto Tourist, with pharaonic and ottoman art mixed tastefully (tastelessly?) on the walls. At the end of the meal, even though we were the only two diners, the evening show started: a professional (hot) belly dancer! And she was good at it, too. Her show lasted maybe   minutes, hard to tell. I really enjoyed it. Incidentally I'm told the owner of the restaurant also offers belly dance classes. Conclusion: Authentic Egyptian food and tea, with belly dancing. Great for a celebration. There needs to be an option for no stars on Yelp. The food at Al Masri is nearly inedible. The prices are insanely out of control for the schlock they serve. The service is laughable. My big question is this, how can such a poor excuse for a restaurant continue to exist in San Francisco. It's such a disservice to any unsuspecting clientele. DO NOT TRY THIS RESTAURANT. You will leave feeling like you've been ripped off and served who knows what. Al misery, right on, nice name for this place.  I am not used to getting such incredibly bad service! This woman must have been the owner or the owner's family, I cannot think of any other reason she could possibly keep her job. We walked in at : on Sunday night; there were THREE diners there at one table. Do you have a reservation? WTF!?!? Half of the restaurant was reserved for the "" dancers"". She magically found room for us in to one of the  empty tables. Her attitude the whole time was ""Sigh I must wait on you"". I will get my tip, so I do not have to provide good service. She was borderline rude, and freaking clueless, and slow. There was a woman who kept our water glasses full, and a very tall kind gentleman who helped our waitress, as well. The food was OK; the baba ghannug was NOT the best I have had, but smoky.  My date's Fuul Midimas was SCALDING hot, after  minutes of cooling and much stirring, still uncomfortably hot, it was OK, but NOT worth the interminable wait to be able to eat it. The owner says it comes off the stove at that temperature, I doubt it highly, it came out of the MICROWAVE at that temperature, and the cook screwed up. I sincerely doubt the Department of Public Health demands it be served hot enough to burn your mouth. My Gambari Mashwi was good, a dozen prawns and a mountain of mushy rice, and a spicy sweet pea dish for $. . The dancers were good, had nice stage presence, all two of them. The bill finally came after asking not one, not two, but THREE times. During the  minute wait for the check the party of three left, one diner was being served dinner, and three dancers drinkers in the whole place. Not the brightest time to make a diner wait, with the place virtually empty, and a staff of three servers. I always tip generously; I usually get good or excellent service. This time I was willing to leave only  %, I wanted to send a message. She actually added the tip for herself!! On the menu it says % will be added to parties of , another place it says parties of !! However were a party of TWO! She added it in, and ran it on the credit card without my consent. I usually leave CASH, which most servers prefer, but I understand why she added it without our consent, she knew she ignored us, and given super sub par service!  We were not about to contest it, we did not want to deal with her anymore  get me out of here! Never again! Now we understand why the place was empty. Mediocre food, horrible service when the place has  other patrons! There is always yelp. I came here with some friends to see the belly dancing and to try some new food. I was not disappointed! I have a beef dish (Egyptian meatballs or kebab style) with cucumbers and yogurt plus a dessert with rose water and nuts on it. It was interesting and very good. The belly dancer was cool, and sat down and talked to us before her shift started. We didn't even know she worked there, until she said: I have to change now, because my shift starts! It's a nice area out in there in the Richmond. It's quiet and close to to the beach. I came here to see a belly dancing show performed by students and their teachers.  The food was served buffet style and was announced at each step.  I believe this place is only open for dinner. The atmosphere is detailed.  I'm not sure how authentic it is being as I have never been to Egypt.  The owner announced that it is the only egyptian restaurant in Northern California which seems unlikely but who knows!  She isn't totally egyptian herself and claims to have some egyptian heritage ""back there somewhere""  She definitely did a good job decorating with ancient Egyptian theme.  It is very colorful and clean.  The bathrooms are a work of art!  Huge individual rest rooms with a lot of space and decorations that fit the theme.  There is a really adorable stage area for the belly dancers with a curtain.  Totally cute.  I really enjoyed the show. I wouldn't exactly come here for the food.  The rice (a roni) was rather mushy and the chicken was over boiled.  Good experience, over priced, only worth it if you are going with a large group. Seating is quite cozy so get ready to make some new friends! I ate at Al Masri a few weeks ago, and it serves AMAZING food!  Also, the waitress, Marisa, provided great service and answered questions I had about the menu.  In addition, I also saw not one, but two, belly dancing shows!  The performer was entertaining and even had a few of us dancing with her.  I highly recommend Al Masri! As an Egyptian American I can say this is truly amazing food!  This place not only provides a fantastic dinner but also great intertainment with an authentic belly dancer.  Our waitress was so friendly and made sure we were well taken care of.  ""A hidden jewel in san francisco"". This place is a few blocks from our apartment and my boyfriend and I have been dying to try it out. . .  We are so happy that we did!!We got there and it was quiet. . which can sometimes be a  sign for concern but we are glad we stuck it out.  We got the Maza for two (I have a food allergy so our dish was a bit different than most), the chicken with cilantro and onion and the duck.  We were very satisfied with our meals.  Also, our waitress was amazing and super friendly. . My boyfriend and I wound up dancing up on the floor with the belly dancer and two other customers for a song or two  it was awesome!  All in all, the food was good, the service was good, the location is good and the entertainment was good. .  what else do you want in a Saturday night out? im an Egyptian guy . I can tell you that this is the worst food ever, its nothing like the Egyptian food , the falafel was over kooked and the kufta was BAD BAD BAD i cant tell you how much , and above all that the discusting Kuffta dish cost you $i advice you as an Egyptian to never get close to this resturant , its a descrase for all the arabic food in world and especially Egyptian food . I had to go to this restaurant as I have Egyptian friends who always entice me with their food. Wow the ambiance is amazing. I feel like I can get away from the rest of the world and enter a different world. Bellydancer who is gracious and lovely adding to the delicious food. My Egyptian friend said she would go again and again and could taste the love in the food here. I want to have gatherings here as these places are far and few these days. They treated us so well. Thank you Al Masri for making the world more interesting,delicious and delightful. Belly dancer heaven. Good exotic food, good service, good prices and good dancers. . . not to mention feeling like I'm in Egypt. Love, love, love. I join other reviewers who came away from this restaurant very disappointed. There's no belly dancing performance and cozy atmosphere that can compensate for the mediocre quality of the food served, which didn't taste that ethnic at all to me (I come from a Mediterranean country after all). For what I had from the paltry buffet $ would have been enough. I would say, cafeteria level. The rice was overcooked, the chicken bland, the fish mushy, the falafel had an unpleasant texture, the salad pathetic, and the baklava certainly not that fresh. I really wonder how people can go back to this dump. Try El Mansour a few blocks up just for comparison  a whole different world. I will never go back, nor recommend it to anyone, no matter what the pretentious chef can retort! LOVE THIS PLACE! Never had Egyptian food before, but wanted to treat the Hubby out for his bday. The decor was great & the atmosphere was awesome! Not busy (we went in the evening during the weekday), we were actually the only couple there after this other couple left midway when we were seated. The food is INCREDIBLE & customer service was attentive! Since we were the only ones there, we had a private belly dancer perform for us (which was a treat for the Hubby ;p) Although, it is a drive for us to get here, it is well worth it! I WOULD RECOMMEND this place to anyone who wants to discover something new! I enjoyed it, hopefully you will too=D! The atmosphere and belly dancing was really great.  I was excited by the dishes on their menu and already started thinking about who I'd like to bring the next time. . . . that is until our food actually arrived. The $ Maza for  appetizer assortment was accompanied by store bought pita bread and Kirkland brand olive oil from Costco (as declared by the chef herself). The (canned) dolmas were tough, and not tender.  Bottom line nothing particularly stood out as memorable/tasty/ ""Egyptian"" to me. As for the main courses the Taggen Firakh (Chicken dish) was OK. The lamb Kufta was almost inedible. Something about the texture and seasoning was really un appetizing to both of us at the table. Finally, the Baklava ""made daily on the premises"" was definitely not crispy/ crunchy like it should be. . . If the prices were cut in /, I would consider coming back just for the ambiance alone. But sadly, the food was really that bad. Minus stars for the crazy + argumentative comments from Chef Sausan below. If you read some of her responses to other yelpers, she seems quite defensive and adamant that Al Masari is not willing to improve. I can't help it but. . . It is quite laughable/unfortunate that Sausan boldly claims the she is the ""most accomplished Egyptian chef in North America"", and  Al Masri is ""the most reviewed restaurant in Northern California"" on her belly dancing school page biography (Michael Mina doesn't exist!). Beware of this woman. *Revised from my original post (in response to the chef's comments respectively). Our private half day event birthday party was perfect ! The atmosphere was small but cozy  for our group of . The lesson(a nice little work out), history, food and belly dancer were all wonderful ! The interior (and exterior) decor was decorated with no stone unturned which gave a wonderful abiance. I loved the Royal Egyptian Cheetah glass table in the bathroom!! I definately learned more about egyptian culture ! The price may have been a pricey, but well worth it due to the effort that was put in to make our party a fabulous experience ! After all, it did feel like I was in another countryI will definately come back and bring my mom on a night where the belly dancers perform. What a treasure of a place !Thank you all ! I was visiting a friend in SF. We parked right in front to Al Masri not intending to go inside but to cross the street to go to another restaurant. I looked at their doors, which were so colorful and said to my friend, Oh Lets take a look at the menu. We looked at each other and said, lets try this place. The waitstaff and owner were very nice to both of us. As it turns out we all had mutual friend in the Belly Dancing world and musical world. We ordered some small plates and salads, a number of different items which  were all very good. !! The decor is delightful Interesting with lively colors and furniture pieces. Even though it was a slow night for them being Christmas Eve Eve the Belly Dancer gave us a wonderful show. Since i used to Belly Dance i was encouraged to join in, which of course i did. Hopa. . what fun. Great food , Great atmosphere close to The Great highway! Pure joy!  Al Masri is exquisite! From the warm welcomes of the smiling, friendly staff . . . to the luscious, abundant, creatively served ethnic dishes . . . to the brilliant décor honoring the richness of Egypt's cultural and historical heritage . . . to the superb, meticulous service . . . to the fun of the gorgeous, talented dancers who entertain you with smiles and who obviously love expressing the ecstasy of the beautiful style of Egyptian dance called Raqs Baladi . . . Al Masri is unique in all San Francisco, a City famed for exotic dining experiences.  This woman owned business is elegance  poetry in motion  truly a labor of love.  My husband & I had another fabulous dinner @ Al Masri last night, and we realized how much we have always loved this place!  I loved the Samak Mashwi, perfectly cooked salmon gloriously seasoned with tomatoes and onions and dill and coriander leaves (a. k. a. cilantro), while my husband loved the rack of lamb.  The maza plate is terrific, too.      Delightedly yelping to the world how highly and enthusiastically I recommend Al Masri! I am Egyptian.  We take our food seriously. This was a joke. My jaw dropped at the prices.  You know how you push bad things to the back of your memory? The foole (beans) was so pricey I don't remember how much it was.  Come to find out from a person I worked with that had formerly worked at this restaurant, they used CANNED. . . . CANNED beans. Tamaya (egyptian version of falafel, made with fava beans instead of chick peas for a less gritty texture) was ok, again not worth the $, ever. SO disappointed!  I expected a casual, reasonable costing meal. . . it was a mess! I met someone who actually worked at this restaraunt. . . they told me some of the food was canned! :( Please don't go! cute place! i had no clue what egyptian food is, so i can't really compare it to anything else. the place is very nice. . its painted to look like a outdoor patio. and they have this cute set up in the front where the dancers come out of.  i believe it is family owned, and all the staff are very friendly. the food is OK. . . i ordered one of the chicken dishes and it wasn't anything that special. the portions were huge tho! i would not suggest the okra side dish most entrees come with. its a weird mix of flavors tomato sauce and okra. . . not a good mix. the cool thing about this place are the dancers. i was expecting belly dancing ( like the ones you see on TV), and although one chick actually did do it most of the dancing is not actually belly dancing. the dancers are entertaining tho. i just ate there. I spent $. for nothing. i was so stoked about trying egyptian food, but then after going I was so disappointed. like someone popped my balloon and dropped my ice cream. the food was oily. the rice does look like rice a roni but the plate was $ each. the server gave us the wrong order after we waited like  minutes to order and for our food to come. we didnt get any refill on our water. I ordered the seasoned grilled fish which was not at all seasoned. my friend ordered the rack of lamb and got the kebabs . I tried them. they were whatever, ok but not worth $. my friend just wanted to get the heck out of there. the belly dancers were uncomfortable to watch. some dude went up to her  and put dollar bills on her skirt. gross. not while im eating please. never again. peace! The food is very delicious and the atmosphere is nice, but it is too pricey. I understand that most of the ingredients are ethnic and cannot be found in many places, but it is still pricey. They keep bragging about how important to make reservations. I went ahead and made a reservation. When I got there, the hostess asked us, "" Do you have a reservation ? "" I proudly said "" Yes "". When we went inside, I expected to see a large crowd, but guess what? There was only one table that was busy. The rest of the place was EMPTY. The owner told us that in the weekends it gets packed and cant find a place to sit, I wana try that and see. Other than that the food is great :D Sheesh, where do I begin?! I KNEW the second I walked in what I was in for. It SCREAMED to be on Gordon Ramsay's ""Kitchen Nightmares. "" Let me get to the point. We waited  minutes to order. . . there were only  other tables in the restaurant. After looking at the menu, nothing looked appetizing. . . especially at $ a plate. . . I decided on an eggplant salad. . . which was actually DELICIOUS!  That was the only good thing served the entire night. The pita and ""olive oil"" starter was actually pita and vegetable oil! YUCK!It took us another  minutes to get our food. We got rice a roni sculpted into a pyramind and over cooked peas and carrots, amongst other things. I wanted to like this place. . . I can't believe it's had so many good ratings. . . I wouldn't have given it such a bad rating if their food hadn't been so expensive! If they wanna serve garbage, at least serve it for cheap! This place has the capacity to really hype itself up, and I was pretty stoked about it. Although the buffet was REALLY overpriced for the quality and the choices. I was here with family, and had a wonderful time with them listening to good music, seeing dancers, drinking beer but felt bad that the quality of the food was not up to par. I'd be down to try it again but definitely not on a buffet night. I agree with Regina. . PLZ stay away from this place. We made a reservation a month in advance, we were told over the phone that a group of musician were coming from Egypt last Sunday of each month, so we thought it worth the wait and made our reservation. We were so excited about the experience, but that excitement went away as soon as we walked in to that place the last Sunday of Feb. The place was empty and the group of musicians meant only  people. The place was decorated very well, I have to say. We drove one and half hour from South San Jose to get there, so on a Sunday night we had no choice but to stay and see what to awaits us. I saw the chafing dishes(buffet style) which was not appealing at all,    Boiled chicken(yalk), boiled ground beef(yalk), fried fish. . rice and salad, all below average. We are from middle east ourselves and we know middle eastern food, I don't know what to call this food. Since we were payinng $ per person, we wanted to have a fun, what else we could do, we were laughing at our misery and how much excited we were until then, so whole time we were laughing as if we were enjoying the music, but it was the laughter with sadness that in my whole life I have never  been so disappointed in a restaurant the way were that night. We only lasted   min, could not watch  a + belly dancer for much longer. I never forget  my sister 's teary eyes since she was blaming herself for taking us there, that night. Talk about stepping into another world! I walked into this place expecting very little and had my expectations obliterated! From the outside it seems like a cute little space that serves something that resembles Egyptian cuisine but taste nothing like it. . . Once inside I was amazed at how well they used the space and made it appear much larger than it actually was. . . ornately decorated in regional Egyptian fare. . . The lovely hostess took me to a small table were I sat for just a few minutes before the waitress came to take my order. Not having a clue as what to order I asked for some help. . . without hesitation she gave me a couple of great recommendations. . . While waiting for my order i noticed the one hostess who brought me to my table had a little more make up than the other hostess, but I figured it was a personal choice and thought nothing else of it. . . With in no time the appetizer arrived. . . TA'MIYA: Egyptian falafel. . . ground spiced fava bean cakes, fried and served with tahina sauce. The flavors enveloped my tongue with an experience from a country I've never known, but would love to travel to some day. I have to say it did take quite some time for the main entree to arrive but believe you me it was well worth the wait! LAHMA MAHSHIYA: Sliced tenderloin stuffed with Egyptian feta cheese, white cheese, and parsley, topped with a garlic, onion, nutmeg, lemon juice sauce. . . see. . . see. . . what'd I tell ya. . . worth the wait huh! Now as I was enjoying this fabulous meal the lights started to dim and I'm thinking. . . OK did they not pay their electric bill. . . Not at all. . . the hostess with all the make up came out in the most stunning authentic belly dancer dress and put on one of the most amazing shows. . . come to find out this dancer has been in competitions around the world and just happened to be in the area and a friend of the family. . . all I can say is WOW! So if anyone's feeling adventurist and willing to try something new. . . you gotta try this place. . . it's so worth it! But go on the weekend that's when the surprise dancers come in! first i have to say that i really wanted to like this place. i'd been meaning to eat there for a while and when the opportunity arose i was pretty excited. we walk in and the decor is cheezy in a good way. because it's THE ONLY egyptian restaurant in the bay area, they stepped up their game and made it as egyptian as possible. it had tons of reds, blues, and gold, sphynx heads everywhere, live music from a two man band and supposedly a belly dance show to come. but there was only one other couple eating and it was awkward as hell. when the music stopped it was dead quiet and so uncomfortable. the owner, chef, musicians and two belly dancers were in the room just hanging out and kind of paying attention to our every move. i hate empty restaurants. it makes me feel so weird. boasting being the only egyptian restaurant in the bay area, you'd think they'd want to represent by making the best egyptian food. or maybe i have it wrong and their food is actually authentic. i mean i guess Egypt has never been known for food so to expect anything great would be asking too much.  either way, the food here was bland and everything was overcooked. i came here in hopes of trying the game hen, but found myself forced to partake in a buffet style dinner for $! there was rice, lamb, fish, chicken, carrots/peas, and salad. t. h. i. r. t. y. . . . d. o. l. l. a. r. s. ?? a. r. e. . . y. ou. . . . k. i. d. d. i. ng. . . . m. e. ? everything was below average. we finished our food rather quickly (because we didn't really like it) and asked for the check. upon request of the check a woman exclaimed ""but we are just about to start the show!"" so we decided to stay a bit out of pity. i didn't need two belly dancers focusing on the four patrons there. after ten minutes they still hadn't come out so we asked for the check again. this time the owner said ""please stay. we are just about to start the show. i don't want to change your plans but it's a very good show. "" and i almost. . . ALMOST stayed again just out of pity. poor things, making all this bland food and putting on a show for all of two tables (which soon would be one, and i'm sure they were staying out of pity too). i seriously felt bad leaving but didn't feel like i should spend my time paying someone $ for food i didn't like and watching their show just to appease them. ugh i feel SO bad when restaurants just don't get it. i don't know how this restaurant stays open at all. i really honestly feel bad for them. My review seems to be inline with the others  it was ok!They seemed nice, but asked who made our reservations more than a couple of times. Why would it matter, because it was not hopping with people. The food was decent, but the music played during the belly dancer's routine was way too loud! and again it was not busy in there so I would have rather liked to eat the food with some music at a reasonable level of volume. They definitely tried to be nice, so I am sure there seems to be some communication confusion going on about the repeated asking of the reservations. It was not malicious, just really annoying! Room for improvement for sure. Overall it did have an advantage for not being so busy  it was kind of relaxing to be in a place that felt a little more laid back, but please turn the volume down on the music we are not deaf :) We had gone to Egypt in March and have been yearning for some koshari since then. Let me just say this place fails on all levels. Service: Awful. They kept asking if we had a reservation even though the place was empty. The owner/executive chef/belly dance studio manager switched bottles of wine on us. The waitress, though really nice, was extremely slow even though there were only four tables occupied in the place. Decor: It looks like they bought the kitschiest crap at a museum and then threw it all in a room. ""Entertainment"": I'll admit, some people may enjoy belly dancing at dinner but I don't. The music was too loud and I was too hungry to be bothered with watching someone who was trained by the executive chef/owner. Food: Terrible. Whoever said their koshari is like eating street food in Egypt has clearly lost their mind. Real koshari has the same ingredients, but is cheap and delicious (~$ US for a meal), while theirs tastes terrible and has no mixing of unique textures from each ingredient. The Kebab Farakh was also terrible (though very tender). Don't go here. Do yourself a favor and just fix yourself some Easy Mac, lentils, rice, and throw in pasta sauce . . . that's what they do and have the gaul to charge $. Egyptian restaurant in the middle of outer Richmond? Sure, why not. The ambiance here was a little cheesy for me and the music a lot too loud. Service was a little slow. Surprising, since there were only six other people in the restaurant. But I think the owner / manager was too busy hanging out with family. Anyways, food was good. I ordered the chicken while my food mate got the khabab. The entrees were very tasty (rice was fluffy and full of flavor), but the sides. . . were. . . interesting. The pièce de résistance, of course, was the nightly belly dancer. The dancer was very skillful and tried to involve the restaurant patrons. I think if the restaurant had a lot more people, it would be fun. But with such a limited audience. . . just awkward. And did I forget to mention, the music was way to loud! A friend and I went there last night because I was fasting and wanted kushari (my favorite Egyptian food).  Frankly, I'm suprised at the mixed reviews.  The kushari was amazing, pretty much like street food in Cairo. The salads were good too. If you are used to American ""Mediterranean"" food don't go in expecting more of the same and you won't be disappointed.  It's yummy and it wasn't that expensive for a real restaurant and not a falafel cart (see above American Med comment).  I suppose it all depends what you are used to, it's not a $ bowl of pho, but if you've never had Egyptian it's worth a visit. The waiter was very attentive to our table (alright so we were the only people in the restaurant).  The owner was friendly, but not overbearing considering there weren't other customers.  The waiter asked us if we were interested in the bellydance show that they provide every night Thurs Sun I think he said.  We were and the dancer was adorable.  Again, if you are expecting a strip show, you will be disappointed.  These are belly dancers, not strippers, so don't complain if they don't look like whores.  Fayrouz should off some good moves and read the music well.  Speaking of music, the whole time there was great Arab music, including Hakim who I'm a huge fan of. The decorations were so perfectly Egyptian, a little tacky, but that's what makes it authentic! Blue and gold everywhere, not classy for an American, but we both loved it. I am an Egyptian! The food at this restaurant is good to give an idea what kind of food we serve in our cuisine. It is not authentic though! It is cooked as to cater to the American palate. It is too expensive! If I want to give people a taste of Egypt, I just invite them over to our place and cook them something better. As for the belly dancers well, they can go see that in many places nowadays. The owner is a very nice man (if he is still the owner) and almost too friendly. My sister was very eager to see and experience belly dancing entertainment and craving for egyptian cuisine. . . Since I recently researched on  belly dancing lesson, has lead me to this place and surprised it is in balboa st. and I have always passed that way but never really paid attention to it. . . It was timely to be able to suggest something to my sister and the whole family to entertain dad,(who is visiting from the Philippines), mom and the kids. . . Food is alright, service is slow, it is an experienced, the place is average and the entertainment  is fine. . . the place can get smokey but i enjoyed because the place is children friendly  and the manager really tried his best to be nice.  My favorite is the bread dip in mixed herbs( something very different and yummy!) Behind the somewhat exotic and green face of this restaurant lies an ocean of rudeness and dishonesty. My advise is: don't fall for the sex appeal and look elsewhere. My review on this place is very mixed. My huband and I had our first date here /. Food was very good, restaurant was packed and the dancing was good. We went in , food not so good but still enjoyable. Back for our aniversary in  new chef had just arrived from Egypt that day, GREAT food excellent dancing crowed restaurant. Now / back again for aniversary and could not be more disappointed. Although the new menu was organic (big +) the food was bland and very very expensive. We were the only people in there for a good hour on a Saturday night. The dancer was ok, at least she showed up. I hope this restaurant can get it together. I have too many fond memories here to wish it closed but I am afraid if something doesn't drastically change that is where it is headed staff  are very friendly and I think it is a family owned business.  starsFood  very average. Not worth the money. Buffet style; needs a bit of a kick  .  starsLive Belly dancer  wonderful person  starsThe boring video on Egyptian dancing  .  stars  I felt like I was at school and had to watch this thing for a assignment that is due shortly. We spent almost  bucks for only  people. . . and the food wasn't really that good!I've tried the shrimp dinner and we also had the appetizer platter, which was not bad. (loved the Hummus)The belly dancer never showed up either, BO!I will not go here again! Food was overpriced and not worth the money.  When I went the food for a meal of two was over $, when it tasted like $.  There was no belly dancer, but I'm told there now is from the management.  I give it  stars for the interesting interior and. . . well that's it.  Since I was there  years ago, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt about the belly dancing.  But from the looks of other reviews here, the prices have stayed the same. Just when I thought my neighborhood couldn't get any better. . . I discover this gem just down the street from my house. My roommate and I have been meaning to go to this place forever now. Having been living in the Rich for years, somehow we just never got around to it. . . til tonight. We get to Al Masri and Daniel the manager seated us right away. It was a quiet Sunday night so we basically had the place to ourselves. Daniel brought us a complimentary sampling of the hummus Babah Ganush (positive I butchered the spelling of that).  I ordered a glass of wine, and my roommate who is taking a month off booze on a bet told Daniel he'd have a water and explained the bet. Daniel came over to the table a few minutes later with a homemade non alcoholic wine type drink for sober roomie and we were much impressed. I ordered the stuffed cornish game hen, stuffed with rice raisins onions and pine nuts. A. M. A. Z. I. N. G. And just when we looked at each other and said we were making this our new hot spot, the belly bancer came out and gave us a private show. . . and this girl was smokin hot. I mean, it's a Sunday night, the place is dead quiet, and they treated us like royalty. Also very impressive was the fact that chef, the dancer, and the manager all sat down with us individually and shot the s*&% with us. Very refreshing. After the dancer did her second dance (complete with costume change), Daniel brought us out a complimentary dessert of Baklavah. It was incredible, flakey yet sticky on the inside. Im tellin ya, if you're looking for a menu that you'll be drooling over and a staff that treats you like family, this is the place. And when you get there, ask Daniel about the secret menu. Loves it. Let me clarify:  I am giving this restaurant four out of five stars on the Bizarre Scale because this was slightly less than the most bizarre dining experience possible.  I can't believe this meal happened. We walked in and nodded appreciatively to each other, as if to say ""ooh, classy joint! Damn classy!""  The colors on the walls  were vibrant, there was a golden chair in a spotlight, and a simplified map of egypt rotated  degrees counterclockwise to allow the Nile to run along a horizontal wall.  The map included ""Temple of Ramses II"" in two different places.  At the beginning of our culinary tour of Egypt, our waiter was dressed perfectly normally in slacks and a well pressed shirt.  Imagine our surprise when, ten minutes after we got there, he comes at us in a NOVELTY PHARAOH COSTUME!!  He never acknowledged the change.  But he did talk to us about the ers quarterback woes at length from inside his headdress. When the belly dancer came on, we were treated to a full  minute routine full of awkward eye contact and avoiding looking at her boobies.  During this time, there was no restaurant service until Glaucia, a graduate of the affiliate belly dancing academy, finished dancing.  Then she came on for a repeat performance at the end of the meal, when we were the only ones left in the restaurant.  Whoo!  I still can't believe he was wearing that costume!  On a separate note, the rice tasted like it had been microwaved in a pouch.  Weird, right?  But he did bring us complementary hummus and babaganouj so that was classy of him.  Damn classy. As other reviews stated the restaurant was empty on a Saturday night! Our party was excited about belly dancing and tasty food so we ignored this miniature detail. In return we received wonderful and personable service from waiter who also provided us with some funny stories. As for the food, the yogurt appetizer was very tasty as was our bottle of wine ($ bottle that cost us $. ) We also received a gift from the kitchen for being the first patrons in the restaurant which was some tasty falafel. Very tasty! However, the entrees were rather expensive and when we received the food all the portions were rather small. One of the members of my party asked for the meat to be cooked rare and when it arrived it was well done, a $ piece of beef not cooked correctly. And as if that wasnt discouraging enough I ordered lamb which I was rather excited about but it turned out to be super chewy. A total bummer. I also got the chicken tenders which were delightful, and melted in my mouth. The belly dancing was delightful! Very engaging and she even brought my girlfriend up to dance with her (a miniature lesson. )Following dinner I ordered a cup of coffee and was told by the waiter that owner would read my grinds after I was done. All excited I downed my coffee and she came over. She then proceeded to tell me ""what she saw"" in the future. Staring at the coffee grinds in my cup she stated that she saw me with a little boy in a baseball uniform  was sitting on a bench! My reaction was ""What is this lady talking about!"" The worst part was she kept going on with this crazy idea which came somewhere out of left field (wah wah wah) and acted as if this wasnt even remotely odd. Following the grind reading I asked her when this was going to happen, she looked at the grinds and said  month! Here is the kicker. . . I dont coach baseball? End of story! We had a wonderful meal and overall great experience here tonight.  It was our  yr old daughter's birthday and we were looking for more of an experience than just a meal.  We were not disappointed.   First, the food was outstanding.  We ordered the grilled fish (moist and flavorful), the chicken kebab (very flavorful), the rack of lamb (melt in your mouth tender and tasty) and the beef tenderloin stuffed with feta and herbs (perfectly cooked and delicious).  The prices are moderate and the amount of food is substantial.  Now for the service.  There was only one other table of customers when we arrived on a Sunday at : so it was as though we had our own personal attendant.  Our server, Daniel, was very attentive and a lot of fun.  He told the girls stories about Egyptian mythical characters and was extremely knowledgeable about Egyptian history and food.  To make our daughter's birthday more festive, he changed into a King Tut costume midway through the meal . . . no kidding!  At :, the belly dancing began, and although this was the dancer's debut appearance, she was excellent.   Very pretty, poised, and talented.   The evening ended with a complementary birthday dessert, with Happy Birthday spelled out in chocolate hieroglyphics.  All in all, a great time and delicious food. if it wasn't so far from where i live, i'd be a regular. the (vegetarian) food is excellent, the specialty drinks are memorable and the dancing/show is simply amazing! the owner is super friendly. definitely worth checking out. I have been wanting to try Egyptian food for a few years now and was excited to hear about Al Masri.  The Tamiya appetizer was probably the best part of the meal as the rest of the food was disappointing.  The Al Masri rice was either Rice A Roni or instant Lipton Rice and Noodle as I had made that before from an instant package.  The beefsteak which costs $ was fatty and had pieces of cartilage or tendons in there that were inedible. I'm giving two stars as the food was tasty, but the atmosphere and the price weighed down my rating.  The decor and the price of the meal were more like those of restaurants in theme casinos (the Luxor comes to mind).  Also, the ventilation was poor.  You leave the restaurant smelling like cooked meat, similar to some Korean bbq places. Also, there's the belly dancing.  It went on too long.  There were two dancers, and both danced to two songs.  Unless the dancers are mesmerizing (and they weren't), this interlude to your meal should not extend that long!  They also seemed to still be learning the dance. When my boyfriend and I entered Al Masri on a Saturday night at : and the place was empty we should have taken that as a sign and turned right around. From the beginning, our waiter was a cocky little punk and proceeded to become more of a dick as the evening progressed. We ordered falafel ($) for an appetizer the size of the dish was laughable, but the sauce was pretty good. Then our waiter came over to our table and told us that we needed to order right away for some reason or another, so we ordered the Fuul Midammas ($ fava bean dish) to share. It came out almost instantly, the portion was tiny, and it was very mediocre. I've had fuul many times, it's one of my favorite dishes, and this one was one of the worst I've ever had. We decided not to order anything else. We were just about to ask for the check when. . . . all of a sudden. . . . the lights came on and they announced over the speaker that the belly dancing show was about to start. A belly dancing show for who? We were the only two in the entire place! We were officially trapped in hell. . I don't want to dis the belly dancer but she was as old as my mom and it was painful to watch her. It was one of the most awkward experiences of my life. My boyfriend wasn't even able to look her in the face it was awful. After the show we asked for the check, paid it, tipped the dancer, and got out of there right away. We headed to the nearest corner store, bought a bottle of wine and a pack of cigarettes. We had both quit for the New Year, but damn, after that experience we needed those cigs!There's no WAY you could get me to go back there. . . EVER. **On a side note, there's a Chinese restaurant across the street, I don't know the name, the sign is coming apart, it's says ""A Restaurant"". Anyway, we witnessed a couple of cooks carrying boxes of  food inside when one of the boxes broke and a load of frozen chops of some kind spilled out on the sidewalk. The cooks looked around, quickly packed the meat back up into the box and brought it into the restaurant. What happened to the meat afterwards, I don't know, I would just say ""eat there at your own risk"". Sketchy. After watching an episode of Tony Bourdain where he goes to an Egyptian restaurant in Queens, I looked into Yelp to see if there was one in SF.  Al Masri came up and I decided to book based on the relatively good reviews from Yelpers. Al Masri is located on a dark residential street in the Richmond. It was not promising when my boyfriend and I walked in and there was only one other table filled at :PM on a Saturday night. It wasn't because of the neighborhood because the Chinese restaurant across the street was doing rocking business.  It was because of the food and the high prices. There was nothing on the menu that seemed authentically Egyptian  just the normal shish kebabs and lamb that you can get in any Mediterranean/Middle Eastern restaurant in the city.  The food was unremarkable.  The worst things there were the dry, preservative laden pita bread.  This is the same week old  pita bread you buy at Safeway for god's sakes.   The bill came to about $ for two people w/o wine.  Afterwards my boyfriend and I remarked that we could have had an excellent meal of mezes at Kokkari's for the same price.  We were suckas. There are two foods that make me generally cringe  lamb and eggplant. Usually the texture and taste don't appeal to me and I will actually choose to go hungry rather than eat either of these dishes.  So when I went here with a group and saw that we were served both lamb and eggplant I wasn't happy. However, because I was especially poor that week and the meal was being paid for by my boyfriend's employer, I decided to suck it up and eat them anyway. You know what? Both the eggplant and the lamb kebab dishes were DELICIOUS. I actually had seconds of both, an unprecedented move for me. I also enjoyed the falafel. Not too much of a fan of the salmon dish that we were served, but everything else was good. I found it to be a fun place to go with a large group. My only complaint was with the service which was very nice, but consistently forgot to bring out drink orders, pita, etc. I know we were a big group and a little overwhelming, but I had to ask for my wine  times before I finally went up to the bar and got it myself.  I'm not going to hold it against them though  I would actually come back here and possibly even order the lamb or eggplant. I just celebrated my birthday at this restaurant  my favorite in town mainly for the bellydance show!  The food is exquiste too, the service is very sweet  always,  and I have been coming to this restaurant for years now, and have always enjoyed a spectacular show, wonderful service and food!  Always!    So I recommend just for the bellydancing alone!     The night usually is a leisurely type,  so I like that, I know when I go for dinner there I know to make a night of it. . . . . plan a few hours, not be rushed, enjoy the company I am with,  the atmosphere, and spend a little (in meaning bring a few extra $), and  watch a bellydancer nearly at arms touch  which is truely special!  So I highly recommend!   Its a lovely evening really.  ~Najma White This is THE WORST restaurant I have ever visited.   I've visited several Egypitan restaurants before and this establishment is in a class in itself the worst class in the restaurant industry.  I was so excited to go, but am horrified at how awful a restaurant experience can go. The ambiance is the only thing going for it.  My $ lamb kabob plate came out  hour and  minutes later, but it was COLD, OVER COOKED, and DRY, and the accompanying rice was equally cold and the pickles tasted awful.  The hummus was $.  and tasted store bought. . . the pita bread was stale.   The mint tea was bitter.   The portions were extra small. The BELLY DANCING was a TOTAL JOKE.  The waitress doubled as the belly dancer and she was not only out of shape (which in itself could be fine), but her moves were repetitious and mundane.  The service was HORRIBLE. . . the waiter increased my total check by $ instead of decreasing it by that amount!  When I called him on it, he said he was having a very bad day and that he doesn't care.  The waiter did not even offer so little as an apology. My date and I missed our movie and we left hungry.  I also noticed other people complaining about the food and sending their dishes back.  I overheard dishes being overcooked or too cold, and one patron even got in a fight with another waiter.  DO NOT EAT HERE.  It's OVERPRICED and the food, service and belly dancing is a TOTAL JOKE.  It's an ABSOLUTE EMBARRASSMENT.  Not sure how the the YELP reviews here could lean so favorably to this joke.  The owners think they can get away with such poor food and poor service while charging exorbitant prices.  Go here ONLY if you want to ruin your day. For starters, let's clarify something about the guy who thinks he got Italian Sambuca when he asked for Egyptian booze. This very drink is one of the things that impressed me about the place. If I remember correctly, it is called zabib (much different from Hindi zabib!) and it's a proprietary drink  the owner's family makes in back in Egypt. Sit down and talk to the guy for a minute. . . he's friendly and he's a fountain of information. He'll be glad to tell you anything you'd like to know. He even offered to hook me up with a small distribution order of this liquor (which is stronger than Sambuca AND higher proof, by the way). What a guy!P. S. the Greeks make a version of this, too (ouzo!). Egypt is part of the Mediterranean, too. . . Also, you might find this to be a detail, but I will stand by the superiority of Egyptian feta to Greek feta any day. I was really quite amazed. The relish platter also included tomatoes, fresh olives, hummus (made with fava beans instead of garbanzo) and Egyptian baba ganoush (it's smoked  delicious!). I would have been impressed with that alone, but then came the Egyptian falafel, chicken kebab, lamb and duck. Maybe this was the liquor talking, but I could swear we had an amazing grilled shrimp kebab, too. I have not had a meal even close to this kick ass since visiting this restaurant. OK, maybe close, but this was one of the single greatest dining experiences of my life. Everything was juicy and cooked to perfection. (UPDATE  I have now had better, but that place had a Michelin star, to be fair. )The selection of signature cocktails played a wide range, and the three fruit based ones I tried were all incredible, too. Balanced, inventive, not too cloying. I believe the Orange Blossom was my favorite. We were also lucky enough to witness the dancer. And yes, the decor is a bit cheezy, but the place itself makes up for that. I love the layout. . . the upstairs lounge on the balcony is a nice touch, as is the tall ceiling that is open all the way to the floor seating. It made for a nice show, and a relaxing time afterward. The plush couches and mirrored walls make the upstairs feel a bit like you've stumbled into a club lounge. The only thing I can't speak about is the bill. I was here on an employee appreciation trip (best evar!), so I didn't have to pay. However, I was around when my boss got the bill. . . and despite getting some food on the house, I believe it was about $ for a party of  people. Granted, we did it up like CRAZY. And we're a pretty rowdy crew, so the tab included a TON of drinks. I think we may have gotten a full bottle of that anisette, too. Anyhow, this is not the palce to go for cheap eats. But it IS the place to go for the best damn meal you've ever had in your life. A group of us had dinner here last night and we really enjoyed ourselves.  We had the tasting menu, which is basically the Chef's choice.  We gorged ourselves on wonderful food.  Appetizers consisted of authentic Egyptian falafel (which are made from green peas, not garbanzo beans), feta cheese, pita bread, hummus, and what I can only call by its arabic name ""basterma"" which is a type of cured meat.  Sort of like prosciutto but with paprika and other spices.  So delicious!  Then our feast came.  We had fish, cornish game hen, duck, lamb, beef and veggie shishkebab, rice, lentils, and salad.  There was plenty of feta, olives and warm pita bread all throughout the meal.  To top it all off we had baklava for dessert which was made with rose water.   The belly dancer was a lot of fun, she was really enjoying herself and that made it even more fun to watch.  The location is a bit far for me to travel to often, but I will definitely be going back. The food was excellent, but way OVERPRICED!  We went there for our friends birthday, made reservations (a joke, the punchline will follow) and entered the Richmond's version of Cairo.  As experienced by other Yelpers we asked for an Egyptian drink (when in Rome) and received something clearly not Egyptian.  We were lucky enough to score Sambuca (Italy). . .  The belly dancing was a bit awkward being that there were a total of five people in the restaurant (reservation?).  I smiled as long as I could but it was like watching something being given in a mandatory college speech class (feel the pain).  Anyway, the dancer was good but the bill for the four of us was around $. . . Expensive and disappointing evening. First time and I will not be back. This place is a rip off. The decor is great and that's about it but I would suggest going to a museum if you want to see great Egyptian art. Food is extremely average and overpriced. Portions are on the small side at that! One appetizer $ had about  olives and three very small pieces of cheese on a tiny plate. Asked for their Egyptian beer as some noted on this site and was given a STELLA from Belgium! When I told the waitress that the beer was from Belgium she insisted it was from Egypt! Hilarious. I have been to other Egyptian restaurants in other cities (with belly dancers) and had a great time but this was a very poor experience. I was very excited to go to this restaurant and am so disappointed. My dish (veggie and extremely simple) arrived just as my other three freinds were FINISHING theirs ( lamb shanks) about   minutes later. Wobbly chairs, wobbly tables, music volume up and down. Belly dancing not very impressive either. Would not recommend to anyone.  Al Masri should be called Al Misery. The appology from the waitress is most appreciated!, however, waitstaff should be knowledgeable about the food and drinks they serve. I could kick myself repeatedly for not finding this place sooner.  The menu has changed formats over the past few years, but the owner and has family take great pride in this place.  They do not have the largest dining room, but I have *never* been rushed out of this place no matter how busy they have been.  Plan for at least a  / hour experience with the courses and entertainment.  The dancers are wonderful, and the owner/chef Hatem is one of the best hosts I have ever known.  I trek here yearly when I visit the city.  I really miss being able to walk down the street and visit. almasrirestaurant. comA gorgeous dining experience.  We too have been passing the place and thinking that we might go there one day.  We didn't make any particular effort.  Then, we had a friend visit from Texas and another friend from the Bay Area wanting to eat there before going to a concert at the Independent.  (What a contrast!)We didn't stay for the belly dancers because we had to be at the Independent, but next time. . . Everyone in our party was impressed by the great food.  We had theRiasch Mashwiya (rack of lamb grilled and with butter garlic sauce)Lahma Mahshiya ( filet mignon stuffed with feta and cheese and with a onion garlic nutmeg topping)Kabab ""Om Tarkek"" ( we had a combo of both lamb and filet mignon kababs!)Everyone was impressed by the rice, which came pyramid shape.  Since we were all Thirteen Elevator fans, that was special. The wait people were friendly and explained all the dishes for us and the traditions.  I felt like I walked into a place that I had been a regular of for a long time, because they treated us so well. It was a fun experience. I cannot speak for the belly dancing, as it was a on a Sunday evening and there was none, but the food itself was terrific. My friend had a chicken kebab/skewer type dish and I ordered this eggplant casserole. The chicken was a tad dry, but rather well done. The eggplant casserole was very, very well done and its sauce was satisfying. The sauce was tart, yet sweet tomato based sauce. The only minus point is that there were french fries in lieu of actual potatoes in the casserole. Oh yes, they serve rice in the shape of pyramids. I drive by here often but never tried this place. The front door just gives me the creeps. . . it reminds me of an Indiana Jones trap where if you go in, you'll never come out. I'd stay away if I were you guys. I've lived in the neighborhood and kept walking past this gem thinking, ""one of these days i'll go in for dinner"".  FINALLY I went in for my birthday with some friends and I'll never pass this place up again.  The coowner/chef Hatem welcomed us with open arms and chatted us up with info on the restaurant and the dancers and all things under the sun.  He's a strong promoter for the restaurant and the dancers, but can you blame him?  He's absolutely right!We had the Tamiya (delicious, nutty, great texture), hummus (always yummy), and garlic yogurt (this was outstanding) for appetizers.  We pretty much almost filled ourselves silly with just the starters.  My friend had the swordfish (I had a taste but now I have to go back so I can get my own, it was so yummy) and I had the feta stuffed filet mignon on a bed of, I think, mashed tarot root which was all that was tender and scrumptious. Ryan provided great service and made the best pomegranate martini and key lime martinis!  The zabeeb was incredibly strong but had a fantastic flavor. The restaurant's exterior isn't the only great looking part either.  The interior decor is all very Egyptian and the murals on the walls are well done.  Very clean and comfortable.  We went on a Thursday so there were no performances but we'll be sure to go again when there will be.  For that crass reviewer that waved around $ bills, the ladies give a performance, not a crude lap dance.  The restaurant provides envelopes with your check for any gratuities for the dancers.  Thanks to everyone at Al Masri for making my birthday such a happy experience this year. Whoa!That was my reaction after finally getting into the front door of this place. I live just down the street and finally had dinner here one night. Excellent interior design, great food, drinks, excellent staff. . . and belly dancers. . . in the Outer Richmond?! Definitely more than I was ever expecting and definitely a diamond in the rough (yes, I hate that phrase too but it fits). Along with the Balboa, Simple Pleasures, Ocean Beach, Sutro Park and the Baths. . . . the Outer Richmond is the best kept secret of San Francisco. I can't tell you how much a fabulous time I had at Al Masri. . . it was such an amazing, delicious, and educational experience.  After talking to Samar and Hatem during dinner, I had such a better appreciation for the experience and respect for the culture.  It was nothing that I had expected. . . the hummus was the best I've ever had I'll tell you that. . . it's not thin or generic like the ones I've tried.  The hummus I tried last night tasted so fresh and more fluffy? creamy? I'm not sure how to describe it.  I had the filet mignon and my friend had the pacific sole. . . we loved it!  You can tell (taste) that the meals were prepared with fine, quality ingredients.  Samar and Hatem, who were very knowledgeable and proud of their culture,  shared with us so much interesting information and history related to the food and the difference between their food and imitations of Egyptian food.   The decor was beautiful. . . it adds to the whole experience.  This place is no joke. . . come here if you're open minded and willing to experience something new and to be educated. Oh and if you order Arabic coffee. . . have Samar tell you your fortune! OK, I am about to gush about this place, but for good reason. My hubby and I went to check this place out when we were scouting for a place to have our local wedding reception (we were married overseas and wanted to have a fun celebration back here in SF). We loved the atmosphere, the food was wonderful, the owner was very welcoming and personable, and the bellydancing was awesome. Based on this, we had our reception at Al Masri. Again, everything went fabulously, thanks to the hard work and dedication of everyone at the restaurant. How can you go wrong with a dancer for your dinnertime entertainment?  We headed there around : Sat night, which was perfect timing.  We were seated, had time to place our order, and received our cocktails just as they started the show. The dancer, Samar, was terrific and put on a great show, and later on came around and talked to people at all the tables.  Our food was good as well  I wasn't able to try the rabbit as they were out, but our waiter suggested the squab, which came with a great wheatberry pilaf type of accompaniment.  The bf's swordfish was also very tender. I liked their falafel app more than the basterma (cured beef), which was a little too salty for me personally.  Dessert was amazing, though  it's orange blossom custard in between shredded phyllo dough.  So yummy, and even though I was afraid it'd be heavy, it actually was very light and refreshing. After the meal, we had to wait quite a while for our cab to show up (next time we'll know better and drive!) and the owner and his cousin were extremely gracious and hung out with us while we were waiting. We'll be back to check out the Sun night jazz bands  apparently they only start doing this in the spring, so you may want to check on their schedule. My ex and I used to have the following conversation all the time:Me ""Where do you want to go for dinner tonight""Him ""How 'bout Egyptian, let's go get some Egyptian food""Now, he was just being a brat, trying to think of something random and hard to find, being the kind of woman I am I finally called his bluff and said ""fine, I'm going find an Egyptian restaurant and you're going to buy me dinner there"".  A quick google search later I found Al Masri and made a reservation.  I really didn't know what to expect, but it turned out to be great!  The dancer is a lot of fun, the food was great and the staff was really friendly.  I took one star off because I think it's a little pricey for what it is, but I'll definately go back. This place might be a  star, but I'm not sure  I'll be going back to check :)The owner was extraordinarily friendly, talkative, and informative.  The food was quite good in general.  The standout was this egyptian vegetable called mulukhai or something  it was awesome!  The meat (rabbit) was a little bland, though.  Some really interesting things, though  I can't wait to try more things on the menu. This place is GREAT! The belly dancing show and the ornateness of this well appointed restaurant.   The food is amazing and not to be missed! Most of theim time, folks don't want to come out to the Richmond because well, it's like the dead zone.  With that said, there are some places out there that are quite good if you want a more low key crowd than you'd find in many other areas of the city.  As far as Al Masri, it is worth the trip.  Very tasty dishes and friendly staff.  What more could you ask for in a restaurant?  Give it a shot, after all, when is the last time you had eqyptian food (and no, it is NOT the same as mediterranean food). Al Masri is a visually comforting restaurant and the only Egyptian in the city. To start off, I had a  am in Cairo cocktail, nectarine and mango with rum. For appetizers we had grilled eggplants with cucumbers, I really recommend this one!  Next time I'll settle for the hummus. Another dish that I recommend is Kufta mashwiya, it's lamb sausages served with a rice pyramid. And for dessert I suggest trying this thinly sliced phyllo dough with an orange custard blossom, light and satisfying without making me feel like a pig. Desserts aren't listed on the menu though. Oh, and there is belly dancing too, and if you want to leave the dancer a gratuity, you receive an envelope for that at the end of the meal. This isn't supposed to be a strip club experience, so waving around dollar bills is just rude. Anyway, I had a very good experience here, very friendly service. Went there with a group of  people and got toally hosed on the pricing. Total rip off. Their special drink was a pina colada, and it was a tall glass of pina colada mix. When I told him that there was no rum in there, he replied ""Really, I'll fix that"", and filled it up with Rum, so it was disgusting. Dancer came on and she wouldn't except our $ bills, I guess she was rich or something. All in all very disappointing from start to finish. You need to respect the customers if you want to gain our respect. I have discovered a jewel of a place, and I'm not just saying that because a certain special somebody now works there. I was truly impressed by the whole experience. You know like when you go to a restaurant and find yourself daydreaming about it the next day at work? This restaurant has that effect on you. I came with my younger sis and since I don't really see the point of owning a car in the city, we took muni (a one hour trip, by the way). We stepped outside and were met by some fierce fog, and the moment we set foot in the restaurant it was like we were transported to another world. I was so busy admiring the lanterns which are amazing by the way, and the art that I didn't even bother looking at the menu. You just start to feel as if maybe you are in Egypt. Between the two of us we ordered: Soup of the day, perfect for warming up. The soup was a combination of watercress, potatoes, and lime. Really good! basterma, a cured spicy beef salatet betingen, fried eggplant over a salad of cilantro. Also very good. entrees (I recommend either one): kufta mashwiya: lamb patties served with sauce and rice lahma mashiya: filet mignon stuffed with feta cheese & served w/rice So I went crazy and ordered two drinks, one that was a mix of henessy and creme de cacao, and fresh nutmeg, and the other was an anise flavored liquor (wow!! that perked me up). We also had this great dessert I forget the name, it was kind of like a custard with orange blossom water. The food overall was great. So the damage with  appetizers,  entrees,  cocktails, and two desserts came to about $ per person. I recommend going with a group of four or more since the prix fixed is about $ pp. The service was really great, casual, and unpretentious. But I have to say the highlights were the live Egyptian jazz band (a special event for the night) and Samar the Egyptian dancer.  I lack the right words to describe it, but her dancing was amazing. I also loved the bathroom, it was really something special. More art, gold colored trim, and the mirrors were generously sized. Oh and on a table you will find a platter with a selection of lotions, and scents. The restaurant has an intoxicating effect on you that just kind of lingers long after your visit. This is the kind of place you go to relax and get lost. If you come here and expect the food to be served within minutes, then this isn't your type of restaurant. Everything here is slower paced, so you really get to unwind and enjoy. It's all about the experience, as well as the food. . . . we drove up at :PM  in our car on a cold Saturday night for our PM reservation. . . we were about to jump out of the car and have  of us run in as the  boys parked the car, but the gentleman outside waved us in and said ""that's ok, we will park your car out back. "" Cool!! As Judith F says, don't let the painted entrance doors scare you away: the experience itself is quite amazing! For a group of  or less everyone has their choice of a , , or  course meal. . . For  or more, you'll have to come to a consensus ($ for  courses, $ for , $ for  mix and match) We got to sit at the corner table (right next to the cat/cobra sculpture) and all four of us squeezed into the booth in an 'L' shape.  Our table started off with Pomegranate martinis (made with fresh pomegranate juice) and daiquiris, both freshly made by our friendly and knowledgable server. There was a bit of a time lag to get our drinks b/c of the timing with the dancing (""Service may be limited during the entertainment"") but otherwise, the meal went pretty smoothly. The server memorized our entire order and though I had full confidence she remembered everything, she came out with  appetizers we hadn't ordered. . . but we got to eat them anyway, YUM, so it all turned out fine! The garlic yoghurt spread was a favorite, and their appetizer falafel was crispy and perfectly sized (not those huge softball sized falafel you typically see) and served with a yogurt dipping sauce. The pita was served toasty warm and they gave us  baskets for our table since we were  couples sitting adjacent to each other. (So no fighting over pita!) The top of the menu clearly states ""Please let us know of any dietary restrictions"" and we failed to mention the pine nut allergy situation (our bad) and the dessert, a warm bread pudding with raisins. . . HAD PINE NUTS in them. Thankfully ig was noticed within a bite so we were spared a trip to the ER this time. (thanks to Pizetta, who messed up our pizza order a few months ago read review. . . )The dancing was amazing, the ambience and space is really cozy and comfortable the staff do a great job of making it a 'fun' evening!! You are asked to leave a gratuity if you like for the dancer in the 'entertainment envelope' included with the bill, but we did not get one, so we had to ask them for it. . . Thanks again, fellow yelpers, for your honest comments on this place it really made for a fun night out with friends from out of town! OH and I almost forgot to mention if you are lucky you can have your 'fortune read' by one of the waitresses there, who will read your 'coffee cup' should you choose to partake of their fantastic turkish coffee. You'll be up for a few hours after an ounce of it, but it's flavored just so (cardamom I think) and sweetened, it's hard to resist!  Her interpretation  of our cups was eerily accurate. . . . . . . Dont be fooled by the poorly done Egyptian art covering the outside of this place. Inside its much nicer! I went there for my anniversary and Im glad I did. I had their (baked?) Tilapia and man oh man was it good! The Food is great, the atmosphere is nice, Service was OK, and well there's bellydancing. You cant go wrong. Great overall dining experience.  Over the years, I must have driven or walked past this place a dozen of times.  Once you step inside, you aren't in the foggy part of the Richmond anymore.  The layout is well designed to reflect the Egyptian theme.  The owner\waitress\belly dancer, Gabriella was really great to our party of .  She made recommendations for us st timers to get an true experience of Egyptian cuisine.  It is similar to Mediterranean food with slight differences and names.  Prices are fairly reasonable, set in   course menus.  Wine servings by the glass are generous.  Her sister, Samar really put on a great belly dancing show.  I would recommend going on a Thursday when they say it isn't too crowded. Food recommendations: * TA'MIYA Egyptian falafel. . . ground spiced fava bean cakes, fried and served with tahina (sesame seed sauce) * LAHMA MAHSHIYA Tenderized filet mignon, stuffed with Egyptian feta cheese, fresh dill and black pepper, dressed with a sauted garlic sauce * MUSA'AH A casserole of eggplant, fresh house cut potatoes, green and red bell peppers, in a tomato, yellow onion, garlic and cumin sauce * ARNAB MATBUKH Fresh fryer rabbit stewed in yellow onion, ginger, whole cloves, and Mistika (gum Arabica), served seared A nice little place out in the avenues, say hi to Joe behind the bar and tell him Roman sent you. Hit or miss, bellydancing is fun! The reviews are all over the map, but gauging from the lower responses vs other reviews I think the positive ratings are more on target. The staff is as cool as you are, and the food is better if you ask for their favorites. The staff will bring out some extra yummies when you're nice. The small plates are a standout. It's definitely an order a lot and dip into everything kind of place. I was with Egyptian friends the last couple of times and just ate whatever was in front of me. Their version of Ouzo creeps up on you and you'll be showin' ya belly in no time. The appetizer's were very good, however, the entree's were mediocre at best (except the filet mignon, served rare it was delicious. ) I recommend you go here for the atmosphere, but not the food.  The belly dancer was entertaining, but I would say go to Aziza on Geary Street.  The service was really bad.  We asked for water  times.  I ordered a drink that never came, finally gave up and left.  The charge for the drink (that did not come) showed up on  my credit card  days after the original charge came through.  The service is really questionable. . . . . Nice people, but very disorganized. Outter Richmond isn't necessarily known for much more than the fog, so I was shocked to find this gem!  Went for a friend's th birthday party.  Not only was the food fantasatic, but the service and entertainment (belly dancer) was outstanding.  I will definitely go back and recommend this restaurant to all!"|2|92|3|Routine| Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities  [ date violation corrected: 6/13/2012 ] Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 6/13/2012 ] Inadequate ventilation or lighting  [ date violation corrected: 6/13/2012 ]
Daffodil 1|3.0|Asian Fusion in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|50|1|2.0| I was a little disappointed to say the least. I made reservations at Daffodil for these reasons: . They are located in Union Sq . my friends from Australia were staying nearby . It had deceptively good reviews on Open Table . It was a , pt reservation on Open Table. My biggest compaint is the whole time we were there, not one other table was sat (there may have been one woman eating at the bar, and a few people who looked like guests from the hotel stopped by for drinks). Also, the decor is nice and upscale looking, but the lights were so bright, there was no ambiance at all. The food was a little on the pricey side, but t was good. American choices with a fancy twist. Anyways, I was embarrassed to have taken my Austrailian tourist friends here, because they expected me to know some cool places in SF and trust me, this did not look cool.

Daffodil 2|3.0|Asian Fusion in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|50|2|2.97959183673|" Charming, well lit interior. . . not sure what kind of food to expect just going off the menu.  For appetizer, I ordered the spinach salad with roasted beets, smoked mozzarella, and roasted tomato vinaigrette.  Big mistake.  A big massive pile of baby spinach leaves straight out of the supermarket pack.  The beets were not roasted (they tasted like the ones you get in the cafeteria).  The smoked mozzarella tasted like small cubes of cheddar cheese.  And the roasted tomato vinaigrette tasted like dressing from a bottle.  The entree was a big bump up.  I ordered the salmon with roasted fennel, brussel sprouts, bacon, and smoked tomato sauce.  The salmon was just the way I like it.  And the bacon with fennel and brussel sprouts was a perfect pairing.  The sauce was also a good element, and together. . . we had a good turnaround. Cue the dessert.  A supposedly delicious granny smith apple cobbler.  CLOYINGLY sweet.  And it didn't seem right. . . almost like baked apples with some cookie crumble sprinkled on top.  I couldn't finish.  It was that sweet. Forgot to write a review on this place. This place was just a few buildings over from my friends apartment. We went here a few times and the menu changes, the times we were there we had shared a meatloaf and a starter. Its very odd, but most times this place is empty but thats okay. Its nice and quiet so you don't have to yell when talking. We basically had  to  service. Go if you like quiet place and food good. Food was ok.  Ambiance was super quiet and stuffy.  I don't think I'd go back, but only because there are too many other restaurants to explore in the City. Great service,  well prepared and presented food.  With so many choices for restaurants in San Francisco and near the hotel, I found this a convenient alternative.  Not a wide choice of entrees, but I enjoyed the short ribs and a spinach salad.  The dessert was great, a fruit cobbler.  The night I was there it was quiet, and I had a great conversation with the staff about San Francisco.   That made it special. Update: The hotel had announced in June, that they'd close the restaurant on //, to renovate the place. But apparently they simply replaced the management and staff. Don't know about any renovation plans. *While it's true that this expensive hotel restaurant cannot compare to newcomer Sons & Daughters restaurant, just a block away. The real reason for its demise was poor and unreliable service. I had avoided writing this review for a long time. The kitchen is very slow but food was usually decent and well presented. For example, the mache and beet salad s media. px. yelpcdn. com… was simple and delicious. The short rib over buttercream mashed potatoes and veggies (half order entree) s media. px. yelpcdn. com… was very popular. Although I think the menu had more variety and was a better value long ago, before executive chef J. Wheeless took over. Menu prices match local pricey high end restaurants, but service left a lot to be desired. I never understood why they always hired inexperienced waiters that get overwhelmed and disappeared for long periods of time. Often not familiar with the menu, can't remember a drink order, made multiple mistakes on my bill, and once I was overcharged after I had already signed the receipt. I came here with two of my friends and had the most amazing meal! We had arranged for a  course taster menu, and were surprised at every turn! The creativity and perfect flavor combinations the chef uses makes it obvious that he is very skilled and knowledgeable in his job. Everything was perfect from the service, to the lighting, to the amazingly delicious food! What a turn around from a few years ago! Decent room service steak frite. Chef went a little overboard with the garlic salt. I came here for Dine About Town. The ambiance was so bad that the food could not save it, even though the food and service were both equally solid. Daffodil is in the lobby of the Orchard Hotel, and since there was no music, we listened to the conversations of the four other occupied tables and someone taking room service orders. Really, the lighting is awful, and it feels exactly like a crappy hotel restaurant that you would only end up in if you had food poisoning and just wanted some soup. But, there is no way I would ever recommend someone dropping $ on dinner at this restaurant. To quote David F ""Well, not horrible but not phenomenal either"". Went here on a Tuesday evening. We were the only guests at the restaurant! There was no music, it was really quiet and uneventful. The food: We went here for Dine About Town. The appetizer was decent: beer battered calimari but it was definitely nothing out of the ordinary and I had to ask for another sauce as the buttery sauce it came with was too rich. The main wasn't impressive either. The risotto was very rustic looking and didn't have much going for it. The steak had no ""spark"" aside from the blue cheese, and the fish dish was definitely overcooked and the brine was not a good move (I would have gone for a nice creamy sauce)The dessert was some type of custard with a syrup. It came in a martini glass and I swear it was half filled with strawberry syrup! As I didn't eat most of the first two dishes, I indulged in this and well lets just say my dentist isn't going to be very happy now. Service was minimal. First, the good: The food was excellent. Both their caprese salad and the mache salad were unbelievably GOOD. I had great risotto as an entree and the chicken pot pie bite I had was awesome. Once again, THE FOOD IS REALLY GOOD. Probably better than most places in Union. Alas, Three Stars, gentle reader, because the ambiance of this restaurant is akin to eating in SFO. It, in no way, feels like anything except a low budget hotel lobby with very bright lights. We joked that the service was so slow because our server was also the bell hop and janitor. Also, review your bill before paying. We were one of three tables filled in an empty  table restaurant on a Tuesday. Not busy. The server charged us for drinks he never brought us, brought us orders meant for other tables,  brought the soup out last, and told us there was a  minute wait for a cheese plate  weird since cheese requires only slicing. In this case it was a $ desert platter with mache from the salad, crumbled blue cheese and feta from the salad, one sliced apple and strawberry. So weird. The point of this review? To hope the management reads this and gives their chef a raise. . . Oh. . . and maybe installs dimmer switches on their lights. I don't really need to see the pores on my server's face while he is serving me someone else's food and then charging me for it. We were going to be in the neighborhood, I had a coupon, so we decided to check it out.    We got there just before opening and the bartender was sort of helpful in seating us, but then left us alone for  minutes without getting our drink order.  That and the price/portion ratio cost the last star.  Otherwise it was a great meal.  We started with the beer battered calamari.  It is served with a jalapeno fraiche and is wonderful.  Would definitely order that again.  Complemented it with a half bottle of Ventana Chardonnay.  Excellent wine and reasonably priced. We then shared the Risotto as an appetizer.  That was probably my favorite dish of the night.  My wife had the Red Wine Braised Short Ribs for her main course and loved them.  I had the Chicken Pot Pie, primarily because I've never ordered it in a restaurant.  It was very good.  We complemented our main dishes with a bottle of Ventana Rubystone, which we knew we liked and was one of their least expensive bottles.  Our server was great.  She didn't bug us, but was always around if we needed her.  They were not busy, so we just enjoyed the meal and took our time.  All things considered, we will definitely come back. Daffodil was a pretty great experience.  My expectations were low. . . reading the reviews here. . . it seemed a gamble taking a business client here for dinner, but I had a groupon in my hand and needed a place that was in Union Square serving local and organic foods. I was impressed. . .  it fit the bill exactly as I needed.  The server we had was pretty nervous to be frank. . . he didn't want to interrupt us, seemed like he wasn't comfortable talking, but he was very knowledgeable when it came local and organic foods. . . even offered us some gluten free items. . . really?  cool! Salad starter = YUM! Built my own burger  loved it. . . Onion rings rocked!  no, it wasn't busy  but was perfect for us to have a serious discussion. . .  worked out very well. Best cocktail ever: The Ginger Refresher. Spinach Salad with shaved fennel was very tasty as was the Caprese Salad with fresh strawberries and sliced peaches. An excellent pan seared sea bass and melt in your mouth short ribs with mashed potatoes. Homemade sorbets and Peach Gallette for dessert. Waiter was friendly and personable but a little uncertain about the wine list. . Gavin, the bartender, was top notch and the inventor of the above mentioned cocktail. We will most definitely be going back. Horrible. Honestly, probably the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. I'm not going to waste time going into details, but read the bad reviews below, then roll it into one evening and that basically describes our meal. Menu confusion, SLOW service, entire entrees were forgotten,  the waiter claimed he had to lie to the chef to honor the menu they'd promised us when we made reservations. . . I could go on and on. The best part? We were the ONLY party in the place on a Saturday night! We seriously considered simply leaving when we could not find anyone to give the bill to. We should have  they definitely did not deserve the % gratuity they tacked on. There are so many good places to eat in the city  do yourself a favor and avoid this. Chef Jeremiah Wheeless  who the hell do you think you are?  Our waiter claimed you were responsible for our menu confusion, poor service, and entrees coming out in  minute gaps, and late or completely missing desserts.  Seriously, consider a new profession if you are unable to accommodate less than  customers at a time. Avoid Daffodil at all costs. Unknowingly, I had been walking by this place up to four times a day for three months. It took a gift certificate to motivate my patronage. Daffodil has a mission that is very important when it comes to serving food to the public, however it is priced as any hotel restaurant is.  Too expensive unless you get reimbursed for business reasons. Very good food.  All of the food was very fresh and the preparation of the dishes were great. Risotto was a bit oily, but very flavorful. Pork Sandwich was cooked very well served with larger than necessary onion rings  still edible.  The French Fried Green Beans were the highlight of the evening.  Both the sangria and martini were very good. Overall the food was very good ( stars),With the lowly response from the servers and bartender/host, the service was almost comedy worthy; the waiter seemed so overwhelmed in a not even quarter full restaurant.  For that reason they get two stars, that coupled with the price for the meal having been $ without the gift certificate. (tip included)Eat there if you have a certificate, or are on business. And after reading all of these reviews, I think its time to fire someone. . . . . and it's not the cook. so. . . . a few years back me and the lady went here for V day. Daffy was having a prix fixe and we got there just at the time of our reservation. We ended up waiting  mnutes, but the maitre d was cool about it and gave us some comped bubbly to sip on while we sat in the lobby. when we did finally get a table we got the worst waiter in the world. My girlfran used to raise ducks, and always had a soft spot for water fowl. It turned out that there was foie gras on the prix fixe. this might have been my fault for not noticing that and skipping this place entirely, but they may have also just added it to the menu last minute (I'm not sure which it is since it's been a couple years. ) Since that could have been my fault for not noticing, I won't hold it against them. HOWEVER, I specifically told the waiter not to give her the foie gras, I even told him why. I even said it twice. Of course. . . what did he do? he gave her the foie gras. To make matters worse, the main course was quail. It was almost completely uncooked, and I'm pretty sure that was what the chef was aiming for. Eating raw bird is a little disgusting unless you're a cat but to make matters worse it was served in a red sauce that I'm pretty sure was just the quail's blood mixed with sugar. Disgusting!Not for nothing, but after that experience we both decided to become vegetarians. My girlfriend and I live a block from this place and were walking by and saw an advertisment for a free app with two drinks so we decided to give it a try.  WOW!  Amazing drinks and fantastic food.  Dj the bartender and Jerimiah the executive chef are one of a kind.  Gf and I had the sorbet, pizza with chorizo, some Anchor steam beef stew washed down with some cucumber gin gimlets. We are definitely going to spread the word and become regulars!  See you guys soon. Adam and Sara The reason we chose this place was the focus on organic ingredients, but on a recent Saturday morning we should have gone elsewhere.  Although the place was nearly empty, the service was agonizingly slow.   minutes til we were greeted with water, another  until our order was taken and coffee arrived (by the way, waiter had no clue what an Americano was).  Food wasn't bad, we both had omlettes and they were light and fluffy.  What ruined it for me was the waiter had a cold and was constantly sniffling and wiping his nose with the sleeve of his jacket.  This on top of the slow service did it in for me.  Would not return with so many other great options. First time eating at an organic restaurant that sources most of their ingredients locally.  I'm surprised, there aren't more SF restaurants like this!  Just imagine Whole Foods having a californian fusion restaurant sourced with grass fed goodness!Anyhow, had dinner here on a Friday dinner.  Had a full rack of the braised short ribs.  It wasn't mind altering at all, I'd say it was average.  What I found more entertaining was our server.  He looked like he had just smoked some medicinal grade cannabis.  His facial expression, body language and the way words rolled off his tongue all pointed to the fact that he may and will have the munchies soon.  You was very nice, but sorta just said 'everything is good, everything is fresh. . . I think you'll like it. ""  Uh. . . I asked for your personal recommendation sir.  In a nutshell, come here and try it.  But I wouldn't say go make reservations (we did and the server looked at us like no one has made reservations since )! My sense is that the chef would be better featured in a more upscale restaurant.  The food was better than the ambiance and the service.  The ambiance is similar to many better chain hotel restaurants  not downscale, but nothing imaginative.  Our waiter seemed new and unsure of when to pour wine.  It's a close location to Union Square, which is handy, but I wouldn't race back for another meal.  Valet parking is hugely expensive:  $.  Better to park at Sutter Stockton or Union Square garage. came here last week for a wonderful dining experience. the waiters were attentive and friendly, never had a water poured for me so many times. i ordered the pot pie and it was delicious. ill be back again. I was pretty excited to check out Daffodil, especially after reading about their organic and fresh menu. A restaurant's website can be misleading, and now I see the bad reviews here! So we gathered a group of  on a Saturday night.  It was very quiet and very dead for a weekend night (not a good sign of a good restaurant). We brought our own bottles of wine, and needless to say, during the entire dinner my husband got up to refill everyone's glass often.  It was disappointing, especially considering how slow they  were, AND they charged us % gratuity automatically for service that was less than decent.  Our waiter had to be reminded to bring things that were already asked for.  I came knowing that I wanted the chicken pot pie and the red and gold beet salad and guess what. . they were out of both!!  They took quite a long time to serve us. We ordered the beer battered calamari, french fried green beans, pulled pork and a half order of ribs.  I must say, they know how to tempura their food, but that is all they know how to do.  The ribs were so so, my pulled pork was just a lump of pulled pork.  Hardly any BBQ sauce in it, no bread on the side.  The coleslaw was without any flavor, but the beer battered onion rings were superb.  Again, they know how to tempura.  Then as we are finishing up, something on our table attracted some gnats that would not go away, and that for me was the final straw ladies and gents.  I will not come here again and would not recommend it.  Simple things could have been taken care of, but it was not a priority for the staff. Considering again that the place was extremely slow for a Saturday night in SF, it made perfect sense why as we left Daffodil. We had a party of six for the Dine About Town dinner at Daffodil. When we arrived, the maitre d' was no where to be found. After standing around for  mins, one of the waiters finally took notice of our group and came over to ask whether we would like to be seated. There were only  other parties there so I can't even give them the excuse that it was a busy night so therefore service was slow. ORDERINGWaiter # handed us the Dine About Town menu. Each entree had  items, on the DAT website it said we can select from a variety of items on their menu.  We all happily made our selections and was ready to place the order. Waiter # came around and started snatching away all the DAT menus. He didn't tell us in advance but just started taking the menus. We looked on with confusion as the menus flew out of our hands!Waiter # told us sternly that chef just decided they are no longer serving the DAT menu because they don't have some of the items. One of us asked, are all the items on your regular menu still available?  Yes.  Ok, all the DAT items ARE OFF THE REGULAR MENU, so if all regular menu items were available, why isn't the DAT menu available?  This definitely put a bad taste in my mouth as I put my head down and went back to square one to decide on what I wanted. STRIKE ONE. When the food arrived waiter # served it to the wrong people. It was like musical chairs with our food. STRIKE TWO. FOODAPPETIZER AND MAINI had the Beets Salad and Arctic Char . My hubby had the Lentil Stew and Chicken Pot Pie. Beets Salad   slices of yellow and red beets along with a healthy portion of greens. For the portion it's way overpriced at $ a plate. It was well made and fresh. Arctic Char  Tasted like salmon. Generous portion. Nicely flavored.  The japanese turnip and couscous sides were very good, generously flavored with butter. Lentil Stew  Very well seasoned. Mixed with mushroom, veggies, and very tender beef chunks. It was very lumpy and thick with little liquid. Small portion. We both liked this. Chicken Pot Pie  Sodium overdoes. It was definitely on the salty side. Portion size moderate. The crust was flaky. Nice healthy chunks of chicken breast meat. DESSERTBy the time dinner was over we were too full for dessert. This was probably a good thing because, yes, they ran out  ouf of the  items on the menu. Or rather they substituted that it might as well have been another dessert. ATMOSPHERE/SERVICEThe restaurant is small and quiet. It was definitely nice to not have to shout over one another to have a conversation. Everything was clean and the decor was your usual hotel restaurant style. Kind of bland. The staff never came by to check on us and towards the end they left us with  bottles of water to pour ourselves. Waiter # was unattentive and rude. Overall we though the food was pretty decent for the price. Service was nothing to write home except on YELP. I gave it two stars mainly because of the poor service. I really didn't have high expectations going into Daffodil (after reading all the previous reviews here), but I was glad I was able to finally make some judgement of my own here. Classic and clean decor.  A yellow daffodil set on each table.  We ordered the cheddar and swiss gruyere mac and cheese (was a bit bland for me), the chicken pot pie (yummy) and the red wine braised short ribs (quite tender).  I thought the food was just average to me (still pretty good), but the bf thought it was above that.  He loved every single dish that came out. The service was wonderful.  Our waiter was attentive and was super friendly and personable with us.  Quite empty still (even on a Sat evening), but we'd definitely want to try this place again.  The prices are definitely a bit on the high side, but it's really not as bad as some of the reviews here are saying.  Daffodil  you're alright in my book!  I'll be back. Ugh, we really must have gone here on an off night.  Actually had a reservation at Roots, at the neighboring hotel, but a nice guy called us and told us they had to shut down for the evening because of a grease fire, but they would send us over to ""their sister hotel"" Orchard and the restaurant there, Daffodil. Maybe they're used to being very empty judging from the other reviews, so when the place was HALF full because of the combined bookings from Roots and Daffodil, all hell seemed to break loose. The pizza of the day appetizer, which sounded really fancy  ""Salumante and tomato, takes  mins to prepare""  looked and tasted like a frozen DiGiorno's pepperoni single serve.  Last time I checked, you can microwave one of those puppies in  mins or so. Green bean sides in garlic batter tasted like nothing.  How does ANYONE screw up garlic butter? I'd eat my  year old well worn Havaianas if they were sauteed in garlic butter. Main course took .  hours to arrive, at which point our server  about the only positive aspect of the whole experience  apologized profusely and gave us % off.  Ribs were very dry. Give me Chinese pepper salt ribs any time.  We were so put off we walked out without dessert, and if you know my wife, you'll know that this never happens. These are actually sentences spoken by our waiter:) ""You guys are awesome"" ) ""No worries boss"") ""Sure thing honey""If only the meal was as good as his inappropriateness. I mean, it's not like it was bad, you just expect more from a boutique hotel. The menu had so much promise but it just didn't live up to once it was in front of us. The decor can be compared to a Holiday Inn in one of those fly over states  nothing to see. A bit drab, sorta matching the meal. A solid two stars because it wasn't like it was horrible it just didn't live up to what it should have been. Mediocrity, thy name is Daffodil. We had plenty of things to be thankful for on Thanksgiving eve, but our meal at this place was not one of them. The pumpkin soup was bland and covered in pepper to mask its dull flavor. The main course of oven roasted herbed Cornish hen lacked herbs and was served with a rather strange tasting apple stuffing. And the chefs were completely inflexible when it came to dessert  I don't eat fruit and fruit was the only option. They had nothing else available and refused to be creative and whip something up, so dinner sadly ended without even a cookie to sweeten it. This place only gets two stars for the rockstar waiter who was the only staffer manning the floor. He was apologetic about dessert and graciously took our wine off the bill. But all in all  $ a head for this ""feast"" really was a scam. Next year we're going back to our old faithfuls instead of experimenting. I am truly disappointed and should have heeded the negative reviews on Yelp, which I did read before coming. But hey, I wanted to give the place a chance. Not the brightest idea. Oh, and if you're looking for ambiance, this place lacks sorely in that department too. This place can't close soon enough for me.  And anyone who writes a review over three stars has got to be either severely mentally impaired, stoned or paid.   Look at  star reviews critically WHY does this restaurant have so many bad reviews?  Why?  Because they ARE BAD. Friends from out of town made reservations otherwise, after seeing the reviews here we never would have gone.  I was completely dreading it because SF has so MANY excellent  places to eat why waste time on bad places?  Anyhow, like it  was mentioned  below, he was told the pm was full only  was available, and lo and behold we got there and there were NO PEOPLE.  WTF?  However, we quickly used our bat senses and figured out WHY there were no patrons What made this such an awesome experience was that they said they had a limited menu  that night because they were short staffed.  Then, they handed us a LUNCH menu!  LOL.  I would give it  stars if I could because when he made the reservations they should have told him then!  (However, I was secretly SO glad they had no food we left). I don't write many reviews but since this was my worst restaurant experience in many years I decided to write one.  Overall it was a horrible dining experience. Absolutely terrible.  I felt sorry for the server. He had absolutely no clue about anything. He couldn't answer simple questions about the menu, brought the wrong drinks, and made us wait  minutes to get them.  The food was greasy and sucked.  Until they change things, this place should be avoided at ALL costs. The date loved it.  Me, not so much. The ambiance is. . . interesting.  Very much a hotel restaurant.  There was a live jazz trio which was really cool.  But the lighting is a little too bright, the carpet a little too old. . . The food, in my opinion, sucked.  We shared the crispy green beans.  Nothing terrible but just average.  He had the shortribs which were amazing.  It seems like it's literally the only thing that is good on the menu.  My fish, a sorry thin little fillet, was supposed to be seared, LOL.  It was pan sauteed, greasy as hell, and nothing to write home about.  And certainly not worth $.  The peach sauce was a thin, insipid smear on the plate. . . Dessert was likewise pathetic.  We had the blueberry bread pudding.  Very dry, overly sweet.  I ordered a glass of the bourbon milk from another dessert. . . The entire dessert that came with the bourbon milk was $.  But we were charged $ for just the milk. . . . okay. Our waiter was very sweet, but clueless.  He comped our wine because we got it after I was done with my entree.  But he seemed to be totally baffled as to orders, etiquette, everything.  But still a very likeable guy because of his cluelessness. . . . WOW. . . this place is completely dead. . . absolutely no one in the restaurant, granted it was a Tuesday at pm. . . but geeze, it feels weird to be the only people eating at the restaurant.  It's nicely decorated and has a large private room.  The only  reasons why I chose this restaurant was )  points on open table, and ) restaurant. com gift certificate. The prices of the food are actually very affordable given it is a hotel restaurant.  Flat Iron steak = $, short ribs: half  =$, full = $.  I got the short ribs since it is a house favorite and everyone else on yelp was raving about it.  When I got it though, it was kind of dry and didn't have much flavor.  The meat was tender, and fell off the bone, but DRY.  DIsappointing.  I was more interested in eating the steak!  The steak was cooked PERFECTLY to a medium rare, had a good flavor, and was actually a big fatty steak! As in, it was huge! Steak for $, floats my boat! =P  We also got the white peach cobbler with a creme biscuit or something on top with house made honey ice cream.  The dessert was unique and tasty, but I'm just not a big fan of cobblers.  Our waiter was cool, around our age, so he was pretty 'lax with us, cracking jokes and what not.  Service was good, i mean. . . how can it not when you're the only people in the restaurant? =POverall, I would come back here again just because I have the restaurant. com gift certificate.  Our meal without the dessert would have been $. . . . but the cobbler itself was $ (!). . . still, pretty good price for a pretty good meal. Oh, forgot to mention that the bread sucked.  It was cold and not quite the freshest. This restaurant is located in a hotel, and it is definitely a ""hotel restaurant. "" It is not fine dining, but not bad. Just don't expect it to be fine dining and you won't be let down. The service was good, but the restaurant completely lacked enthusiasm and vibe. I had the flat iron steak and it was pretty good. My husband ordered the chicken pot pie and it was not so good. Not even real chicken pot pie. They just put some bread over a chicken soup dish and called it pot pie. The wine was good, but overall everything was just OK. Hmm I had to mull this one over a lot. As someone who was staying at The Orchard Hotel (which I'm a huge fan of) I decided to try their own restaurant on the first night I arrived in town since I was too tired to go out hunting for local places.  My initial impression of the restaurant was that the decor was pleasant and things were clean and upscale. The bar was a reasonable size as well. The food itself was fine and the ingredients seemed to be of good quality but the portion sizes were severely lacking. It was the only time during my trip I had to order a third dish to feel satisfied and I'm a very skinny guy. Either the prices need to come down a bit or the portions need to go up a bit. What killed the restaurant for me was the awful service. Overly casual and uninterested waiter and bartender who needed to be flagged down since they never actually asked if I wanted or needed anything. Food delivered without silverware, condiments missing with the appropriate dishes, glass never refilled, etc. There were  people in the restaurant eating that's it four. Where the ""waiter"" was most of the time I have no idea. I should have known I was going to be in for it when I first set foot in the restaurant and my request for ""A table for one please"" was met with ""Uh, why don't you just sit at the bar. "" Um, Ok. Did I walk into a fine restaurant or an Irish Pub? In summary the food is fine and the desserts appear quite good. The pastry chef apparently has his act together. However, the service is unacceptable, the prices a bit high and the portions a bit small. Can't see going here again unless I hear they've made radical changes. This is a borderline  stars and I really should be awarding two, but the salad was superb and the general quality of ingredients was solid here. Three star food at four star prices gets two stars.  Everything was ok, but not great.  Artichoke dip was rather bland.  Dinner bread was poort.  Short ribs were not bad.  Pizza was just normal. No problem with the service. I have to be honest. . . The only reason I booked a reservation here was because they are offering , dining points on Open Table, the prices were reasonable and it was the type of food I was craving for the night. Well. . . I guess I should have looked into this place more before I booked. Oh well. We live and we learn right? So our reservations are for pm. Based on the Open Table results, there was only a table at :pm and pm. Then a later one at :pm. So I figured this place would be packed and when I realized that we would be running late, I called the restaurant to let them know that we'd be there about   minutes late. No problem said the hostess. We arrive and as we walk into the hotel, I notice a dining room to the left. But something isn't right. . . It's COMPLETELY empty. It's :pm on a Friday night and the entire room was empty, except for the jazz trio that was taking a break and the restaurant staff. I asked the uniformed guy if this was in fact the restaurant and not just a lounge and he assured me that I was in the restaurant. My first instinct was to leave. Eugy said let's just stay. Right to the food. We ordered a caesar salad to share and what came out was two big chunks of romaine slices still connected to the stem. Strange. The dressing was weird. Edible, but weird. Even thought I ate the entire salad, I ate it mostly because I was hungry and less because it tasted good. For my entree I had the Berkshire pork chop with apple rice and romanesco. The pork chop was cooked perfectly, but it just lacked overall flavor. The apple rice was interesting, but actually overpowered the taste of the pork chop. Aside from us, the other couple came in. So in total, there were only  customers in the entire restaurant. So what happened next was unbelievable. Eugy ordered the petrale sole, but what came out was the steak and potatoes. . . How that happened, I have no idea. It's not like the place was busy or the server was overloaded. And petrale sole doesn't sound anything like steak. At least she was nice enough to comp a round of drinks for us. And the sole came out pretty quick and Eugy actually loved it. For dessert we had the pecan tart with cinnamon cream. It was REALLY REALLY GOOD. But overall, this place just wasn't satisfying. I wouldn't waste my money here again. Great food.  It's Wed night, and the place was empty.  I was a little leery walking in, since I was literally the only person in the place, but stuck it out due to decent reviews (and the steep ass hill up Powell St).  I was very happy I did.  I had the short ribs, which fell right off the bone.  To be more accurate, I was able to lightly pull on the bone and extract it from my meat.  Outstanding short ribs!  I also had carrot and coconut soup, which was very good.  It was empty, but service was still great.  Since it's reasonably priced (especially for SF), I will definitely be returning. Good food.  Servers were very nice, but the service is awful.  The kitchen must be around the corner and down two blocks, judging on how long it takes to get anything as simple as a glass of water (after  requests).  The check had to go back  times before it was accurate. No spoon with the coffee.  Caf when I asked for decaf, knife taken away & not replaced.  Etc. Etc.  Also, we were there Valentines and they had a very young, very talented, and very LOUD violinist, so conversation was impossible.  WHY DO RESTAURANTS THINK LOUD IS GOOD?Please, Daffodil, get your service act together and I'll gladly go back & give you more stars. We tried Daffodil this past weekend with a group of friends, hoping to avoid the holiday mayhem down below in Union Square.  We're very glad we did so.  It's not often that locals choose a hotel restaurant, but the reviews on Yelp and CS caught our attention.  Is Daffodil really that empty with decent food?  And is the service as mediocre as people say it is. Well, yes.  The dishes are very solid and the prices are something you'd expect in this area of town.  However, the service and business is very surprising.  The wait staff is on the young side (as are we), but it was surprising to see how green (no pun intended) they were.  We originally thought our water boy was our waiter (he asked us if we had any questions) and so we asked him about the pizza.  It was like watching a deer in headlights.  Aww, c'mon now. However, since we knew the service was questionable going into this place, we let it slide.  The real waitress was perfectly fine.  We had the watercress salad and ahi tuna appetizers.  Both very good.  The watercress did seem a bit strong  there wasn't anything to balance out the overpowering watercress flavor.  The ahi tuna was a safe dish that hit the mark.  Very good. For entrees, we had the lamb ragout and short ribs.  The lamb ragout was prepared really well  not too gamey and the fettuccine noodles were fine.  The short ribs were probably the best dish.  The meat just slipped right off the bone. In sum, a great meal if you want dine away from the standard Union Square eateries.  We hope they get more reviews on here to give a more well rounded perspective.  One last note: this place skews on the older side (+ years old). We arrived here from marin after having opentable reservations. Not at all crowded for a wednesday night.  I ordered an entree while my friend and me sipped on some of the best sparkling wine we have ever had. The food was delicious and the service definitely unrushed. The palce had a very calming tone to it, with a lot of wood accents. Among many other hotel restaurants where one can go try, this place definitely deserves a visit. On a Saturday night, and arriving at dinner prime time of PM, we entered this now hotel owned (previously Vignette) that is both pleasing to the eyes, and deprived of customers. As we arrived early, and was awaiting friends to join us, I expected to wait at the bar. We were directed to our table instead. The bar had a good handful of people, but I found it disturbing to be ushered into a deserted, yet nicely decorated dining room.  In reading the other reviews here, this seems to be a commonly noted issue.  The restaurant seems to be trying to fill their restaurant earlier by way of OpenTable points, but I would have to say try harder  its not working yet. On to the food. We started with the Manila Clams, and the PEI Mussels. Both were great, and I would give the nod to the clams. Brussel Sprouts with Persimmon. WTF!? I ate this hated vegetable and loved it!Flank steak. Flavorful. Little more rare than I wanted, but it was still good. By the end of the meal, I noticed that the dining room was full. I guess they get a late crowd here. In the end, I was satisfied with the meal, and experience. The wait staff was attentive, the food delicious, and the environment was pleasing. Like the concept of organic/local food paired w/wine. Online, wine suggestions were paired with entrees, but this wasn't so at the restaurant. One wine I had was good, the other wasn't fresh. Food was very good and dessert was inspired, although the service could benefit from more training on the food/wine. Always reluctant to give a perfect rating on the first time out, but it was surprisingly tremendous and I feel they deserve it. I'll definitely go back again and hope that they are repeat offenders of deliciousness. To put this out there, I am in NO way affiliated with these folks  we just found them on OpenTable. com and honestly, they were in the neighborhood where we wanted to be and their menu looked good. After my experience there, I just want to sing their praises!They're in kind of a wacky residential area between Union Sq and Nob Hill, but there are also a number of hotels there (they're actually IN the Orchard Garden Hotel, one of SF's great ""green"" hotels), but I can't imagine that visiting clientele would want to dine in their hotel rather than go out. Well, listen up, visitors: you're in great hands at Daffodil. We were a party of two and ordered the following:APPETIZER: Halibut Ceviche (perfect combo of hirame sashimi and spice, citrus and tang)MAINS: . ) Scallops with Morels, Fava Beans and Summer Squash in Pluot Sauce. (scallops were truly perfectly cooked  pretty much seared  and i had to mop up the sauce with the bread, it was so tremendous). ) Ragout of Braised Lamb over Fettucini (went very well with our cocktail, was not heavy at all, and again, needed to mop up the sauce). Needless to say, they didn't have to clean the dishes that much when we were done. Their motto is ""Organic, Delicious, Artful,"" and they live up to it. We were just looking for a casual dinner and between the service (Krystal was super attentive and extremely friendly, great with her advice on dishes and personable), the bar (Curtis made us a tremendous cocktail with Domaine de Canton Ginger Liqueur, Bookers Bourbon and lime juice, and it was his first attempt at using Canton!) and the food (see above), we were both pretty blown away. Can't wait to go back and recommend it to friends. I don't know why I'm so excited about it, but everything was terrific and I just want to make sure more people know about it! i brought a girlfriend (and by girlfriend i mean woman friend) here for valentine's day during our singledom (just this past v day, actually). yeah, even though i'm sarcastic, blunt and sound bitchy sometimes, i'm actually pretty nice and like to do things for the people i care for. . . . thank you very much!it was pretty new at that point and there were maybe three other tables that were seated. considering the lack of customers we weren't sure what to expect. but to our surprise, the food was really good. i can't remember everything that we had but the braised short ribs were SO good. since it was the big V day they didn't offer any desserts except a heart shaped chocolate cake meant to be shared between two. we got that and it kinda sucked but the other stuff made up for it. i returned another day for the Dine About Town thing and got the same entree. but the corn chowder with bacon was also more than satisfying. First things first, San Francisco Twins [en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Sa… sighting! I was baffled, to say the least. I had never seen them before nor had I heard of them. So it appears that for most of my life, I've been living in a box! The fact that the year they won second place as ""Best Local Character"" [], I was away for school, MIGHT be a reason why I didn't have any idea who they were. They weren't dining inside Daffodil, but they were trekking up the hill along Powell St. between Sutter and Bush. Their steps were in sync, and they wore identical outfits  hats and purses too. While I am quite certain that my experience at Daffodil last night couldn't possibly be mirrored unless you also have the hook ups OR you have $ tattooed on your forehead, I am going ahead and writing my biased review. You're the reader. You know what you're getting into. Daffodil is located in the Orchard Hotel, one of San Francisco's ""greenest"" hotels. So essentially, it's a hotel dining room. The furniture has a flower print that looks like it hasn't been changed in a very long time. Meh. It is sister restaurants with Roots at the Orchard Garden Hotel several blocks away, which from what I heard, is a little busier. Okay, on to the food. Ingredients are fresh and local. We were served a tasting menu, so a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Starters [in order of appearance]:  Pizza of the Day [mushrooms and bacon, crisp, chesy] Soup of the Day [corn chowder with potatoes, bacon, corn] Mache Salad  Endive  Chive Blossom  Strawberry Vinaigrette [fresh strawberries were a nice touch]Mains:  Scallops  Morels  Fava Beans  White Corn  Pluot Sauce Arctic Char  Butter Bean  Fennel  Spring Onion  Peas  Mache Vinaigrette Red Wine Braised Short Ribs  Potato Puree  Miniature SquashDessert PlatterIt was a  course meal that left the three of us stuffed and struck with food coma, and it was fantastic. Everyone working was super nice. Daffodil is not very large or busy. It offers the perfect setting for a private party [they cater!], an intimate date, or maybe just a  course [or fewer!] meal to catch up with old friends. Nestled somewhere between ""A OK"" and ""Yay! I'm a fan,"" but closer to ""Yay! I'm a fan. "" Never eaten here but stopped by their bar for  drinks.  I was at a magazine launch party @ Cantina.  Took a friend  minutes to get one drink.  When I arrived we booked it over here.  There was no one at the bar (which was nice considering the place we came from).  The bartender was extremely friendly, struck up conversation with my friend and I, and to boot they had Family Guy on TV.  How much better could this place be?  The drinks were pretty good too!  Their menu looks very interesting so I would love to go back to try this place out for dinner. I went there last Sunday for my st birthday. We were staying in a hotel down the street and googled local restaurants. It was fairly slow when we arrived, we ended up being the last party to leave. The menu was difficult to read [I blame the font] but the choices sounded delicious. Each item seemed basic, but with a twist. The food was amazing. Our waiter was funny and sweet. My birthday dessert was by far the BEST part. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience. :) For reasons I can't quite explain, I like this video. . . youtube. com/watch?v=FyNj…. . . it's a rap version of William Wordsworth's ""I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud"", though it's better known as ""The Daffodils"". I wouldn't bet the farm, but I think that's a dancing squirrel. So what does that have to do with Daffodil the restaurant? Not a hell of a lot except the single daffodil in the bud vase at each table of this place. . . . this very empty place as Jamie W. and I were the only ones dining in the restaurant portion for most of the hour plus we were there. The bar was hopping with what I assume to be some awfully loud patrons of the adjoining Orchard Hotel. Even though we were there for the Dine Around Town deal, it appears others have concluded it' may not be worth the trek off the beaten track to get to this place at Bush and Powell. But the quiet, as the other reviewers have alluded, is somewhat unnerving because you actually spend most of the evening wondering if they are going to make it to the next payroll for their staff. It's a nice albeit generic space, dimly lit and not terribly memorable. The waitress was great, very open and helpful without being intrusive. I imagine she had to have been quite bored, but I credit her for keeping a very positive attitude throughout our meal. Ah, the meal. Well, for the $ D. A. T. deal, we were given the choice of a hearty looking butter bean soup and an arugula salad with pear slices and goat cheese. Neither bowled us over nor were they offensive. I'd identify my salad as hotel banquet quality. Interestingly, the D. A. T. Web site promised a duck prosciutto with frisee and an organic egg as the appetizer, but it was nowhere to be found. Better was the Braised Short Ribs with pickled parsnips and baby carrots, all on top of a mere dollop of a potato puree. The meat was tasty though the red wine reduction sauce was a bit too dominant for my taste. It was served on the oddest dish I've ever seen. . . it looked like a ceiling lamp fixture  the square, smoked glass kind you see in condominium rentals  and the fork and knife would scrape most gratingly on the rough surface. My dessert was a mini apple cobbler with a little scoop of vanilla ice cream and droplets of caramel sauce. Looks , Taste . I really wish I could state that I had something mind blowingly wonderful here, something that would make bounding up the hill on Powell a pleasure with gleeful culinary anticipation. . . but I can't in good conscience. If you want quiet and a decent meal you can get pretty much at any upscale hotel, this is the place to go. For oft, when on my couch I lieIn vacant or in pensive mood,They flash upon that inward eyeWhich is the bliss of solitude;And then my heart with pleasure fills,And dances with the daffodils.

I'm actually hopeful the owners figure out a more distinctive identity for this place (they've been open only since September ) so the climb up Powell is worth it for this SoMa ite I just came back from dinner at Daffodil.  I didn't feel like cooking, it's raining and this place is a block away from home, and they're participating in Dine About Town.  Seemed like  pretty good reasons to check it out.  This place was alright, and because it's so close to my apartment I'll probably be back, but I was unimpressed.  I'd give it .  stars, rounded up to  because the servers were pretty nice. The D. A. T. menu is quite different from the one on the D. A. T. site, although I guess you can't expect them to have the same stuff every day.  First course was choice between soup or an arugula blue cheese asian pear salad.  Main course was between petrale sole and short ribs.  Dessert was between pecan crusted chocolate tart and whiskey caramel ice cream. I started with the soup  I think the soup they brought me was actually different from what's listed, but I would need to see the D. A. T. menu again to be sure.  It had fava beans, some spinach, and little chunks of butternut squash.  It was ok, nothing special.  Then for the second course, they were out of the braised short ribs and were substituting the pork loin (they wouldn't do the steak for me, even though it's only $ more than the pork).  The pork loin was very tasty, although it wasn't a huge portion.  The side salad it comes with, consisting of celery root and apple compote, was interesting but could use some work.  For dessert, I went with the ice cream, which was a bad choice.  You know how sometimes you leave ice cream out too long, or don't get it home in time, and a lot of it melts but you put it in the freezer anyways and forget that it happened until the next time you pull it out and it has that gross texture and altered taste?  That's how this ice cream was.  The flavors seemed like it had been good ice cream before, but I couldn't eat this shit.  I was really disappointed.  I didn't bring it up with the wait staff because I didn't care much about dessert tonight and I came right before closing time so I didn't want to keep the servers there longer than necessary. Oh, and to drink I just had sparkling water.  They don't have S. Pellegrino, instead they have Saratoga brand water, which comes in bottles that were I think  oz, and cost $ each.  That definitely annoyed me.  I can't comment on the wine list because I didn't look (and because I don't know shit about wine), but they do recommend pairings on the menu, which is cool. All in all this place is ok.  The decor is not bad for a hotel restaurant, and the service was pretty good.  That pork loin was great, so there is at least potential for a really good meal here, but they need to get some consistency in their menu.  The portions are small, even on the ""large plates"", so after the D. A. T.  course meal I'm still hungry and have been debating whether or not to indulge in a frozen pizza. If you walk past the crush of touristy Union square, up Powell to Bush, you will find a very quiet restaurant in the Orchard Hotel in Nob Hill. Definitely a bit off the beaten path, we came to find a completely empty restaurant. I'm always a bit worried when there are no customers at all but this place hasn't been open that long and we were told by our server that they just had a party of twenty five before we showed up. With that party of twenty five there were a series of hors d'oeuvres that we got sample while looking over the menu. First was an eggplant,caviar, and baby arugula spread while the second being olives and goat cheese both on mini toasts. Very tasty bites to start and that eased our worries about what to expect. After picking up a glass of the wonderful Rioja we decided on the following: Panzanella/wilted spinach salad Butternut squash ""hash"" with bacon Seared dayboat scallops with grilled endive Fingerling potatoes with fleur de sel Grilled lamb chops  Short ribs with whipped potatoes and wine reductionThe restaurant focuses on small plates and this was shared across the two of us. We were pleasantly surprised that this seemingly random spread of dishes were all very tasty. The only pick I thought wasn't extraordinary were the potatoes, which reminded me too much of something I make on my own. The hash won as the most surprisingly tasty, with the contrast of bacon and squash being an excellent combination. Our server Sean was a super fun and friendly guy and since we were by ourselves there was no other focus except for us and setting the room up for breakfast service the next day. The space is somewhat typical hotel restaurant and with the location right by the lobby we were at one point inundated with a bunch of loud tourists looking for drinks. It's a little bit out there and there's no hard focus on what they serve but if you're looking for variety, solid execution, and fairly reasonable prices, this place is definitely worth checking out. .  stars."|3|90|4|Routine| Food safety certificate or food handler card not available  [ date violation corrected: 7/2/2013 ] Improper food storage  [ date violation corrected: 7/2/2013 ] Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 7/2/2013 ] Inadequately cleaned or sanitized food contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 7/2/2013 ]
L’Olivier French Restaurant 0|3.5|French in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|105|0|3.57142857143|" On top of the food being complete rubbish, what's up with all the Russians and Ukrainans taking over the place? Went there for dinner, and not being Russian or Ukranian, these other customers were so rude. It was like how dare I get in the way of their walking path? Have told all my foodie friends never to come here. . . and they haven't. I had my birthday party at Restaurant last night. Many thanks to Zina and staff for making it so special. We had a separate room with the fireplace. Very cosyThe food: lots of food, yummy and beautiful presentation. The birthday cake presentation was very special and nicely done on the dance floor, followed by  a song and dance. The chocolate muss cake was amazingThe staff: The staff was extremely nice, friendly and accommodative. They even offered help with unloading and loading the car. All leftovers nicely packed and bagged to be taken homeLife music and dance floor: such a rear treat. The music was just little too loud, but all my friends and family enjoyed dancing and listening to all the singers. Zina, thank you very much for making my birthday so special Thank you L'Olivier Restaurant, its management and the team!You have done an absolutely fantastic job at our Gurnick Academy th Year Anniversary Ceremony! Not only was the food delicious (nothing was left on the To Go Table, as most, if not all guests asked for ""To GO"" boxes) the presentations (yes, in plural) of the food in all areas of the hall was just spectacular. Your team was elegant, professional and punctual. The Cocktail Hour Reception with Cured Salmon Carving Station with assorted French bread and butter along with the Shawerma Table and the various gourmet finger food assortments, along with the unbelievably beautiful Champagne Fountain with berries of all sorts was just phenomenal. Guests came up to our event planner more than multiple times and asked about your mushroom risotto and the locations of your restaurant. We wanted to thank you, as our event wouldn't be the success it was without your professional and epicurean involvement!We will soon post pictures of the event to showcase as images will tell even more! What a disappointmentI've worked in San Francisco for almost  years now, and so far my restaurant experience has been primarily Asian cuisines, Italian, and Seafood.  I was very excited to finally explore what appeared to be an upscale French restaurant in the Financial district for a business lunch.   All my prior experience with French restaurants have been either in Manhattan or in Paris, so it's possibly my standards are too high. This place was a joke, and looking back I can see why the establishment had % of their tables open during the lunch hour. Decor:  Not remotely French. The decor was nice, but it reminded me of the sort of ambience you'd find in the large restaurant of a Catskills resort. In the s. Food:I had the prix fixe menu ( which the waiter mispronounced) so options were limited but I ordered the cream of broccoli soup and Mahi Mahi. The soup was lukewarm and complete free from any hint of taste or flavor. The Mahi Mahi was sorely disappointing.  Such a fish should be served seared for one thing, but this steak was sauteed in butter to the point of tasting like chicken, and the outer layer of the fish was nearly rubbery from the excessive butter + overcooking. I will never ever go here again and I would be shocked if they stay in business. I visit San Francisco few times a year for business, and this time I decided to try European food. I stopped for early lunch at this restaurant. There were few people at that time. I ordered famous French Onion soup. It was marvelous! Then I have New York Steak. It was too large for me, so I decided to get half of the dish to go. All in all, it was a good experience. I highly suggest L'Olivier to everyone! We were here celebrating Uncle Gregory's th birthday last Friday evening.  We had a private room right off the left hand side after the main entrance. The room was very spacious.  One side was the long dinner table which sat approximately  people.  The other was used for the dance floor.  We had live entertainment.  The food was traditional Russian style cuisine that we ordered.  Plenty of food for us and tons of left overs to take home for a second round.  I really enjoyed the Braised Rack of Lamb.  Excellent services and friendly staff. The decor was well design and it felt like you were in Italy. Very romantic. There is no parking lot, so you will need to park on the street (if you can find a space) or what I did was park a few blocks away at a parking lot for $ flat fee after : pm. Quite possibly the worst food I have ever paid money for. Came here on Christmas due to someone's advice that their holiday menu is good.  I believe that must have been a joke or extreme sarcasm as their food was barely edible. First they did not have the steak. . First course was a soup that they referred to it as a bisque.  I compare it to a canned soup mixed with  pint of heavy cream that was served lukewarm. . I had a pate and prosciutto.  That came with a side ""salad"" that was a bunch of dry pre packed vegetables from a bag.  No dressing, nothing.  The pate and prosciutto was inferior to what I get from a supermarket.  Gf had a smoked salmon dish.  It smelled bad and was clearly not fresh.  I am not sure where they got it from but it had been clearly stored for a long time before serving. .  ""Main"" course, I had a rack of lamb because their original dish was also gone.  I forget what it was.  The lamb was actually solid, unfortunately it was garnished with some steamed veggies that were bland and pretty close to disgusting. GF had a sole or something because the steak was sold out or something.  It was extremely greasy but at least tasted okay.  Interestingly it came served w/ the same nasty steamed vegetables.  I guess they just throw shlop of it on every dish. .  Dessert was some random sweets that looked and tasted like supermarket dollar bin specials.  I dont even remember what it was.  Took one bite and had enough of this place. Besides the horrible food, all their dishes have scratches and are faded.  They gave me a plastic handle knife to cut my lamb.  Their silverware was old and faded and looked utterly cheap.  Im not one to complain about this kind of thing but when I'm paying $+ a head after tax and tip. . . i dont really expect to be getting Walmart silverware. I honestly can say I never had such a horrible experience.  I prefer to go to Jack In a Box.  It is tastier than this place. We were here  weeks ago for family event super happy with their services and their amazing menu. Everything was fresh and well design. They just had remodeling done looks pretty cool. . . . Love it ! To be honest we came here solely because it was open on Christmas day. It has been our custom to go into SF for an early dinner and then just wander around but this year our usual restaurant was not open so we searched and found L'Olivier. For the day they offered a prix fixe four course menu for $ plus an % gratuity and the inevitable tax. Our first question was whether we could eat four courses. We started out with roast pumpkin bisque, the only soup offered and it was the weakest link. It was not bad just not at all memorable. For an appetizer I had the salmon trio, salmon, cured (smoked?) salmon and salmon roe. It was a generous portion and very tasty. Judit had the terrine of duck pate and prosciutto. She enjoyed it though I thought the pate to be a bit bland. For an entree I chose the baked sea bass over  ratatouille and potatoes fondant. Delicious. Judit had lamb wellington and liked it well. Judit had the poached pear for dessert and I wish  did too. Delicious and light and a perfect complement to the food. My traditional yule log was ok but not terrific. Before we arrived I assumed that I would suffer some sticker shock when I saw the wine list but all  wines by the glass. for that night anyway, were $. We had to choose blind as neither of us knew any of them and we were not disappointed. Service was good. Overall  better than I expected and a solid four stars. I love the special and comfortable ambiance of this perfectly sized restaurant for a quiet nice out. Pretty and comforting, not pompous.   It's location on a dead street, next to safeway in the embarcadero center, sets the stage for an intimate dinner.  The duck and side dishes were extraordinary.  I had the seafood and though it was cooked to perfection, the bollabaise broth was too fishy and salty.  I pick French restaurants based on whether they have the bullobaise on the menu. . Comfy place. Don't understand why not always busy. I went here for dinner with two of girlfriends. We greeted at the door by the hostess and sat in the main room next to the window. It was decorated very elegant and a lively environment. We ordered the onion soup with bread. We ordered the NY steak, my friend  chicken and the seafood plate. The food was magnificent. We also ordered the chocolate mousse. The food and dessert were amazing and I can't wait to go back. Great food and great service.  I highly recommend this place to enjoy! :) I decided on this place for my birthday dinner. I thought it would be fun to dance to live music. I have been here before and the food was very very average. However, this time I was so impressed. Apparently they hired a new chef. We Ordered al a cart off the menu and each dish was perfect. I had such a great time, really didn't want to leave after spending .  hours in there. I will definitely be back On the evening of //, I had a light dinner at L'Oliver. Within about three hours, I suspected that I had food poisoning. By the time I reached home, it was a severe case of food poisoning. I attribute it to the French Onion Soup which had a heavy layer of cheese although it could also come from the handling. After seeing the doctor, I contacted the manager Tatiana, who seemed less than interested. This was really a disappointment as I have had dinners in this restaurant for more than twenty years. Because of her lack of  concern, I later was able to contact Leo Fudym, owner. He also demonstrated a lack of concern and stated that nine other people had French Onion Soup that night and that no one else had become ill. It seemed unreal for him to know exactly how many people had soup that evening after I told him the date. This restaurant changed ownership a couple or so years ago; since then, the food and the service have been in decline. This is my first statement on Yelp and is based on a highly unsatisfactory response from the owner and manager."|4|98|1|Routine Inspection| Other low risk violation
L’Olivier French Restaurant 1|3.5|French in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|105|1|4.0|" I had my wedding at L'Olivier recently and am very happy that i chose this restaurant for my wedding reception. The food was great, there was so much to eat and everything was very tasty. Zina was very helpful and really made this day special for us. I would highly recommend L'olivier to anyone who is looking for a venue for their reception or big birthday party. A friend of ours recommended L'Olivier for our get together with longtime friends. We have never been there and were really impressed how good the food and wine selection was. The waiter recommended a french wine to us for only $ per bottle. It was one of the best red wines I ever had. The food and service was outstanding too. It was also not so noisy, so we could talk to each other. We will definitely go back on our next visit. I had a big party for my mother's birthday at this restaurant. Amazing food, attentive staff, great music and very positive atmosphere. It is French/European, food is always fresh and tastes great. I would typically come in for lunch and enjoy the French menu, and sometimes I go in for the big Russian parties. Very fun on the weekends with live music and dancing! Recc! I had never heard of L'Olivier and was introduced when I came to the restaurant for a work lunch with a large group. Our group was seated in a cute separate room with a long banquet table to which you could still see inside the main part of the restaurant. I opted for the prix fixe menu which was a pretty good deal. I ordered: Appetizer: I can't recall the name of the dish but it had polenta and goat cheese. It was good but I thought it could have had more different textures.  Entree  Cassoulet De Toulouse: This dish was hearty with the beans and meat but very flavorful.  Dessert  Creme Brulee: A very thin creme brulee but it was perfectly sweet. Overall, food was good, service was courteous, and my water glass was always full. I write very few  star reviews. I always hope my experience was just unusually bad. This place is off the scale awful  the noise level is ear bleeding and the food is rubber chicken quality. Never again. I came here for a Russian Jewish wedding on a Saturday night. By their name, I thought it would be French food, but they handled the Russian food very well! It is a small restaurant with eclectic decor and they were closed to the public for this intimate affair. When we walked in, the main dining room had about  tables and a good sized dance floor. Tall centerpieces and white tablecloths graced the tables which were laden with cold appetizers. The band was setting up on the stage. The guests, however, were shepherded into a smaller dining room on the left for cocktail hour. We enjoyed hors d'oeuvres and drinks. After cocktail hour, we moved into the main dining room and settled down. The menu had about  cold appetizers and a schedule of hot appetizers coming out, then main entrees, and cake over the course of three hours. Cake wasn't coming til pm! Whoa. We tried to be nice to our friends getting married and telling the waiter not to bother opening up the  bottles of liquor and wine on our table as we would not be drinking all of it and his was response was, ""It's a Russian wedding. It will all get drunk. "" Apparently, for a Russian wedding there is food, introductions, dancing, more food, more dancing, more food, shots, more dancing, more food, more dancing, and then cake. I was so tired by the end since I'd flown in that day and was avoiding alcohol so I wouldn't totally crash. It was a lovely reception, the wait staff was very professional, and the Russian food was solid."|4|96|2|Routine| Improper food labeling or menu misrepresentation  [ date violation corrected: 10/28/2014 ] Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 10/28/2014 ]
L’Olivier French Restaurant 2|3.5|French in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|105|2|3.07142857143|" My husband and I showed up for our reservation and waited for several minutes to be seated. While waiting we realized that the restaurant was hosting a reception party and we were the only other guests in the restaurant. It felt very strange and we felt like we were intruding. No one came to seat us so we left. My husband planned a special night for me and we ended up having to find a new place to dine, which did not turn out so well. I wish L'Olivier would have let us know a reception would be there that night. Came here tonight with my wife for a romantic relaxing dinner. Our server Gabriel did an AMAZING job, very personable, funny, and had great recommendations. The porcini crusted sweet breads were amazing, as well as the scallop risotto with lobster sauce! Good food, great price, amazing service! Tough to rate this place.  We went there for the first time last Saturday night.  Food was really good;  ambiance was horrible.  Food:  baked brie and potato pancake salad, scallop risotto, duck breast, tart tartan, and some other cream filled pastry.  The desserts were actually a bit of a disappointment. . . you go to a French restaurant and you expect really delicious desserts.  These were good, but not blow your socks off good.  However, the other food was quite yummy. . . . the risotto was awesome. Service was good, no complaints there. Cocktails were very strong and generous. Price was very reasonable. But the decor. . . . . oh my. . . . it was poorly decorated back in the 's and has not gotten better with age.  It is just completely out of date and cheesy.  A wire Eiffel tower with sparkling mini lights like from a Christmas tree. . . . really? Fake ivy. . . . ?  Ugh.   I think this is what is killing this place. . . . if they redecorated and brought the place up to current standards, they'd do much better by attracting a younger crowd (and more people in general). If you want a good meal and are ok with a not so cool vibe, you should try this place out.  You'll likely be happy with the food.  But honestly, with so many other restaurants in SF to go to, I don't think we'll be back. . . . just don't want to immerse ourselves in crappy, 's, Hobby Lobby  inspired, ""French"" decor. Came here on Valentine's day, the quality of food was bad, my boyfriend ordered the steak was so hard, wasn't over cook, was the meat. I was very disappointed. The staff did their job to makeup this unfortunate by offering an option for my boyfriend to reorder another entry. The decor is a bit strange and the place was somewhat empty but my husband and I enjoyed our dinner here.  It's kind fun (at least for us) to eat somewhere kitschy and unusual, and the place and crowd are definitely that.  But the food was really good  escargot and baked Brie salad for the apps, then beef cheeks and cassoulet for our entrees. All were delicious.  Tarte tatin for dessert was also very tasty.  The service was very attentive and friendly  and I really appreciated how they split our apps onto two plates (one for each of us).  The wines were very reasonable too.  Oh and they gave us each a complimentary glass of port with dessert  nice touch.  Overall, I'd recommend it for a quirky but yummy dinner. Updating a star from my last visit.  Forget overpriced, snobby Michelin rated Fleur de lis.  Tonight I had awesome escargot (much better than my last visit) and a scallop risotto in lobster cream sauce that was to die for. . . . simply amazing flavor.  The staff was very attentive and friendly.  I was very pleased with the overall experience and will definitely be back again soon! . . Friday.  Large party.  Holiday party season.  OpenTable came through with a reservation for six people at L'Olivier. I dragged down the median age to about half.  Every other patron looks like they were finishing up an early bird special (not sure why, their prix fixe menu goes all night).  But I digress. I had the escargot and the steak tartare to go with a glass of bubbly, white, and red.  Nothing was memorable, but nothing was bad. Not a place I'd go to again, but glad they fit us in last minute. I used to come here often many year ago because I lived close by. The food is very average and I would not recommend this place unless it is convenient to you. It is in need of a remodel. Not a bad choice, but nothing special. Sometimes they decorate the restaurant in interesting ways, but they should pay more attention to the food, I think. It would be a fun place for a party, and the staff is nice. We had a party of  and the food was amazing.  They have a very nice back room, quiet, service was excellent, Gabrielle and crew we really appreciate it.  Nicolas  is the new chef and he is truly an artist.  we will definitely be back, probably with the husband next. Apparently he comes from Bistro Cental Parc, you can tell. I hired Zina and her wonderful hard working team at L'Olivier to cater our wedding. What a great decision that was! The food was exactly as discussed except for it was even more beautiful looking in person. Zina had carved animals into watermelon, placed orchids on the sides of all the platters, and added her special touches to everything to make it even more gorgeous! Our guests were in awe with the decor! I wish I had gotten a chance to actually eat at my wedding, but that is almost impossible for a bride. What I can say is that I enjoyed wedding leftovers for  days in a row and loved every morsel! Thank you Zina for all your hard work and I will definitely be recommending you to future brides! We were seated at :. We had the  course fixed menu. There were two of us.  The entire meal took over two hours.  The food was definitely not worth the wait. We started with the wilted salad which consisted of a few thinly sliced apples and two small pieces of goat cheese and the avocado salad which consisted of a blob of day old or week old shrimp rolled in thousand island dressing and more wilted leaves. Our entrees were salmon smothered in bbq sauce and chicken doused with some caramelized sauce on a bed of potatoes.  Dessert was a piece of chewy chocolate mousse cake and flavorless hazelnut mousse.  A definite no on returning. Good and very reasonable pricesHad the rack of lamb, excellentLove the escargot & the onion soupGood serviceWe had  people in our party and they did a great jobNever got a dish wrongAnd we switched seats on them when we played a gameWill definitely be backWant to bring my mom & my sisterThey both love French food Recently came here for a birthday celebration. Since our party had about  people, we were seated in a private room. There was another party going on at the same time and it took up the entire main room. I noticed two full smaller rooms near the front entrance as well. We had our party in the side room, which was perfect because the room blocked out the music that was coming from the other party. The only downside was that the room got extremely hot and we ended up opening the exit door in the room. I also guess there's a storage room entrance through the side room, so random staff would be walking in and out of the room. We had mini quiche and stuffed mushrooms as well as a fruit/vegetable platter. The ordering process was easy and quick. Since we had a huge party, there was a set menu with few choices. They were very accommodating to a few of my cousins that had a specific diet. The staff that was in charge of our party was very attentive and nice. I ordered the baked brie in phyllo dough as a starter. I actually really enjoyed this dish. I'm one of those weird people that actually likes the rind of the brie, so I didn't mind it. If you hate the taste of rind, i suggest not ordering this dish. It was baked to perfection and the phyllo was nicely crisp. I ordered the tournedos of filet mingon. I ordered it rare mostly because i KNOW that with huge parties, often times the meat is precooked and heated again. It didn't really matter if this was the case or not, because the meat was more towards the medium side. The meat was so dry, I was using all of the sauce to help. The truffles actually tasted great as did the scalloped potatoes and the vegetables. As for dessert, you'd be safe with either the soufflé or the crème brûlée. Both were delicious. The bathroom is near the far wall, and it was a bit awkward walking through another party to get to the bathroom, but no one really seemed to care. The bathrooms are a bit claustrophobic as well. I mean the stall is barely big enough for you. But, it's nice and clean and that's all that really matters. I recently came to L'Olivier for a birthday dinner, and I have to say. . . . it's fantastic!The service was great and attentive. The food was delicious, and the atmosphere was nice as well. As a vegan, I truly appreciated how accommodating the staff was. They prepared a vegan meal for me, so that I wouldn't have to just watch everyone enjoy their food. I had a green salad for my starter. It was a green salad. . . . I can't really say anything else about it. The dressing was a bit salty, but that wasn't a huge deal. Then, for my entree, I had a salad with grilled veggies. It was way beyond what I was expecting! It was delectable, and after finishing it, my stomach didn't feel heavy at all. Finally, for desert, I had some fresh strawberries. Yum! I have to admit, I was looking at everybody else's soufflés and brûlées. . . they looked so darn good!Overall, great experience.  would recommend this establishment for special occasions."|4|72|11|Routine| Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 3/12/2013 ] Improper food storage  [ date violation corrected: 3/12/2013 ] Moderate risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 3/19/2013 ] Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities  [ date violation corrected: 3/12/2013 ] Permit license or inspection report not posted  [ date violation corrected: 3/19/2013 ] Food safety certificate or food handler card not available  [ date violation corrected: 3/12/2013 ] Foods not protected from contamination  [ date violation corrected: 3/12/2013 ] Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 11/14/2013 ] Inadequate warewashing facilities or equipment  [ date violation corrected: 3/12/2013 ] Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils  [ date violation corrected: 3/12/2013 ] Inadequate ventilation or lighting  [ date violation corrected: 3/12/2013 ]
L’Olivier French Restaurant 3|3.5|French in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|105|3|3.18309859155|" After experiencing so many bad restaurants that get good reviews, largely because of the ""atmosphere,"" I'm stunned that this, one of the better restaurants I've eaten in anywhere in the world, gets THREE STARS. All the things I'm reading salty, dry, bad tasting, poor or snotty service are simply not true, ever. I've been coming here regularly for years and have never had a meal that was less than perfect. The tartare, the foie gras, the rabbit, the steak, all superb, never salty, never tough, the greens among the tastiest and freshest I've ever eaten, the wines and cognacs excellent, the coffee excellent (rare in America even in classy restaurants) and the desserts superb, especially the crème brûlée, which surpasses anything I've eaten even in Paris' th arrondissement. Their pastry chef has  years' experience and it shows. People who say this is not good food have their tastebuds up their dark and moist region. The service is exemplary and never snooty or rude. Again, Americans, probably because they suffer from an inferiority complex, seem to find anything European to be surly or snooty. They should grow up. It would be sad to see a restaurant this superb close its doors because American palates are so sadly unsophisticated. Or maybe L'Olivier should start seating people on cushions on the floor and playing hipster bar music while broadcasting sports with the sound down to people who swill overpriced generic sweet cocktails and checking their iPhones every five seconds. Me, I like cuisine. Thank you for an enjoyable evening!!  The food was. far. and. above much better than we all anticipated. . . This is truly an off the beaten path gem!!The foi gras was right. up there with any I've had. . . . the mussels and Bri. filled. Phyllio dough was Soo flavorful!!Our entree. portions were surprisingly the largest portions I've had in town and both the Sea Bass and Salmon were amazingly cooked to perfection with great flavors and texture!!  All sauces were light and dense Yet filled with robust flavor. . . Desserts were good, Yet the apps and entrees truly stole the show. . . . . Tanya treated us like royalty and I've now found a new fave in town!!  Thanks for the amazing Merlot Tanya!!Check. this place out. . . . its tough as. nails to get in, so feel lucky if someone makes room for you!!Definitely returning!! This is absolutely one of my favorite places. I've been going there on a regular basis for the last few years and also hosted there a few important family events. The prices are very decent. The owners and employees are super friendly and attentive. The food is diverse and well cooked, so everyone can find something to their taste on the menu. My personal favorites include baked brie in philo dough, lobster bisque, veal cutlets, rack of lamb, duck confit, and filet mignon, just to name a few. The real highlight of any dinner is, of course, the dessert. I would highly recommend their soufflé and creme brûlée. They also have an espresso machine, so if you feel like a cup of real coffee, there's no need to go to a Peet's :)The decor is tasteful and very homelike. The atmosphere is intimate and cozy, beautifully supplemented by live music on Tuesday nights and Sunday afternoons. This place is great for all kinds of events. It has a few separate rooms and a full bar. The main room has a dance floor and a small stage. Overall, a great dining place and a perfect venue for hosting a private event. Went back once again for one of their lunch specials with a friend.  Since we've eaten at just about every place downtown, we figured we'd give this one a go again.  I know they won't miss my business, but I felt stupid even paying for my meal.  They took over  minutes to get us our food, but my order was wrong.  I ordered a pasta dish sans meat.  That's not hard.  It's pasta.  After  minutes I got the pasta dish with meat.  I explained the issue, told him we need a check because we've wasted our entire lunch.  He came back fifteen minutes later with the check and the replacement meal.  I told him I didn't want the meal before we got the check, so this was just odd.  He left and didn't come back.  I didn't want to walk off without paying, but without the new check there wasn't much I could do.  I just paid the bill and left going back to work late and flicking this place off every time I walk by. Occasion: Friends birthday dinner for a party of  peopleI loved our fancy private room, but the food. . eh. . not so much. Everyone ordered the $.   course Prix Fixe menu besides me. I ordered the Sauteed Crab Cake and the Roasted Chilean Sea Bass (big mistake).  Appetizer: The crab cake was too mushy and it didn't seem to have much crab pieces in it. It was mixed with some sort of chopped up lettuce = no bueno. Entree: After eating half the tender Sea Bass, I couldn't take the sickening sauce on top, so I had to scrape it off. Dessert: The waiter brought in a tray of sample desserts (part of the prix fixe menu) and kindly described all the different options for us to choose from. My friend offered me his dessert so I decided with the mocha cake. Sweets usually never fail me, but it did that night. Gee. . . just my luck! But I'm glad I had great company to make up for all the loss. I rather enjoy this little place and it's conveniently located for us.  The staff is very pleasant and attentive and try hard to accommodate us even when it's full or they are having a party.   We enjoy the food which has an American/ European flair.  It's worth a yelp. Great place for birthday party for  or more people. We had a party of . And I requested a private room for my friend's birthday party. This makes it so much better! The service was great. A SUPER DUPER friendly Russian waiter. The price was descents, taken into account we had our own private room. The food was A Ok. It tasted like American diner food; I had steak with fries, the seafood was very fishy (dislike). The dessert was good, best part of the dinner. French restaurant with Russian owner. The owner is a friendly man with a good sense of humor. It's a quaint little place down in the Embarcadero. Sort of nestled into the middle of a block, so its not that noticeable. Fairly decent portions. The seafood here is pretty good. I had the sea bass here and it was tender and seasoned to perfection. The crab cakes were also delicious. Some of the other dishes were lackluster though. The beef tenderloin was tough. I guess some of the dishes are hit or miss. The prices aren't insanely extravagant so I guess you can take your chances. Unpretentious, attentive service, relaxed atmosphere, and good food. It is definitely not on the hipster list. This is not a bad thing. You can actually have a hushed and relaxed conversation. And the staff are genuinely glad to have you. Unlike so many other restaurants, they don't behave as if they're the ones doing you a favor. I've walked by this place for years, but the sign in the window says, ""Grand Opening"". Oh, but you shouldn't have. No really. My friend spaced and didn't make reservations for lunch at Kokarri so we thought we'd come here since we had no desire to shlep any farther in the rain. ""Is this place even open?"" [crickets]Thursday (/), lunch time, only  or so tables occupied. Although the service was friendly and attentive, we were here to eat. The food? Yuck. The sea bass was anything but fresh, smothered in some sick sauce that made the whole dish inedible. Who screws up a steak & frites? THIS place. It even looked unappetizing, but she was a soldier and pressed on. I picked at mine a bit but just couldn't go any farther with it. No, I don't want the rest boxed up because I'm stopping at Safeway for a corn dog. Quality and taste aside, the entrees were pricey well over $ and we dropped a good $ on lunch (without even having a glass of wine!) I can name a bunch of places in this neighborhood I would have rather spent that kind of money on. If Shady Pines is how you roll, knock yourself out. But if all you've done is walk by this place to and from work. . that's about all the attention it deserves. Non, merci. Came here with the extended family for my aunt's retirement party. We went on a weekday night and got our own private room. This being one of our first french restaurant visits, we were excited about the ambiance, environment, and waiter service. For this meal, money was not an issue as we were willing to spend more than enough to taste the many different food options they had. First off we ordered our personal appetizers(soups and salad) and at large appetizers like the crab cakes and escargot. The crab cakes were quite delicious and the crab taste could be tasted. The escargot were also great. There was another appetizer my uncle ordered that he let me taste but i totally forgot the complex french name. . . but it was basically some avian specie's organ that reminded me of sausages(but it was tasty and i liked it). The soup of the day which was pumpkin soup was great, but the lobster bisque me and several relatives ordered were a bit too salty(probably just because it was not the soup of the day). For entrees, I got to taste some of the seabass my dad ordered and it was amazing hands down. I ordered the rack of lambs(this being my first time ordering a genuinely cooked lamb) and it was delicious, succulent, and was not hard in texture. For dessert, the creme brulee was excellent. My cousin and I shared a fruit tart. It was homemade which was great, but its just average. Overall I enjoyed my first french restaurant visit. We've been going to L'Olivier for the last several years for Christmas Day dinner. Every year, the prix fix meal has been amazing. The portions are very large, we leave utterly stuffed! The lobster bisque and fish dishes are wonderful. The service is always very friendly and attentive. The restaurant is old school French looking, it's not fancy or modern, but the food and the service makes up for the decor. I would highly recommend this restaurant for their holiday prix fix meals or a special occasion. My second time now eating at L'Olivier French Restaurant, and all I can say is nothing but a wonderful experience. I enjoy the atmosphere presented by the staff and the restaurant itself; the scene created by the restaurant owners gives off a true feeling of France as you sit and enjoy a meal while conversating with friends. I'm a European restaurant lover at heart and am used to coming into a Russian, French, Italian Restaurant; sitting down for a few hours just to talk with the people who join me for lunch/dinner allowing us to catch up while the food is slowly prepared for the most mouth watering, flavor potent, restaurant experience imaginable. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a legitimate feel of what European restaurants are. Come out and have a relaxing night on the town where you can sit down, enjoy some music, some food, a few drinks at the bar, and the company of anyone joinning you for a meal. .  Stars. Always have great service at O'lvier. Service is great and food is fantastic. Never had a meal that i did not like. Celebrated way too many occasions at this place. Will definitely be coming back for more! The only problem is parking, which is too hard to find around Embarcadero area. This restaurant is run by the parents of two of my friends. Excellent atmosphere and delicious food. A wonderful place to enjoy a meal with family, or have a nice get together with friends. :) We celebrated my daughter's wedding there. Food was delicious, service was very nice, and the owner was the sweetest person I have ever met. My guests left very happy and amazed by the restaurant. I strongly recommend this place for small weddings, parties and group dinners. Loved the place. Recommend this European Restaurant for Wedding Reception (lots of food) and Dinner. . . . They got good food like French and Russian and great music. Not easy with parking, it was not enough waiters on reception. I decided to go to this restaurant because it shares the same name as mine. When I walked in the decor was very disappointing but then I was impressed with the food. The service although slightly slow was friendly. The worst french dining experience that i have ever had! Everything was dreadful  service, ambiance and food. My friends and I were planning to have a girls night somewhere nice after shopping downtown, so we all dressed up. Since we all had on our fancy attires, we decided to have some french food for dinner. We called several fine dine french restaurants, none of them had a table available. It was impossible to get a table on a Saturday night on such short notice. Finally ""your reservation of  at : is set"" a lady from L'Olivier told us over the phone. We got there  mins early and saw that there was a wedding party in the main dining room. We waited like  mins, no one came to greet us and get us seated, so we walked around to find the hostess or a server, after talking to a server who was serving the wedding party, we got seated by a unprofessional waiter/bartender/busboy/whatever in a small creepy room which was only big enough to fit  tables. We didn't mind as long as they served good food. But as it turned out, the service was slow (a  min wait to get our next dishes after finishing the previous ones) and the food was incredibly disappointing. None of our dishes was good, all subpar. Even the simple and basic tuna tartare was tasteless, all you tasted was oil. My friend could honestly make a better beef tartar than L'Olivier. We realized why we ever able to get a table here on a Saturday. Everything was bad, worse, and the worst.  Don't waste your money at L'Olivier, save your dollars for a better French restaurant. WAY over priced. The food is good but underwhelming. AVERAGE in every way. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  Christmas dinner was over priced and uninspired!No wonder reservations are easy to get! Came to this place for Christmas dinner   people in the family.  We were extremely disappointed and underwhelmed by it all.  In fact, it ended our Christmas on a rather sad note.  They advertised a  course meal for $, plus % service charge, tax, and none of this included any drinks.  The first course, the soup, was inedible.  No flavor, no taste, and very watery.  It was claimed to be a pumpkin soup, but there was no pumpkin taste at all.  Some of our party ordered the crab cakes for the second course and said it was inedible.  The other choices seemed to be ""OK. ""  The third course was good, and no complaints from anyone there.  As for the desserts, well the choice was very limited, and they were mediocre at best.  Aside from the high prices, and the mediocre food, the wait staff was very unfriendly, and very inexperienced.  For both our drinks and food, the waiters served them to the wrong people, and at the wrong ends of the table.  Hello . . . !!  Why are you writing down the order and then not looking at your notes!!  One person at our table was given a glass of wine full of lipstick stains.  Last, but not least, we were sat at a table next to the office door, in an aside room.  We asked for a different table, but were told they were completely booked and nothing else was available.  When I'm paying $+ per person for Christmas dinner, I expect to sit in the main dining room!  The decor in this ""other"" room was stale and old, and the room had no ambience.  And, to top it all off . . . the restaurant staff kept on going in and out of the office door.  No thanks . . . I won't be coming back here. We had come to this restaurant many times.  Once for lunch and all others for dinner.  Their Sea Bass in lunch menu is wonderful  very tender, juicy and difficult to let go, if you know what I mean.  The portion was good, but I would not refuse a second helping of the fabulous fish!  It was served on the hot plate, right from the oven  DELICIOUS!During our last visit on Christmas Day I had their rack of lamb  cooked just right  my favorite medium with red and juicy middle  yam!  My husband chose turkey.  I didn't try it, but he seemed to be very satisfied with his choice.  For the first time we were seated in the Club room, smaller room on the side, behind their bar. And while main room reminds you of the Paris bistro, the atmosphere of the small room is  a bit romantic as in the traditional french restaurant circa s.  We really enjoyed the privacy of it too. I was actually very entertained by one of the reviews from the same night where an author described ""rat race over the ceiling  silly me, I thought it was garage door opening and closing in the adjacent facility and it did not bother us at  all. . . Although it was busy, the service was timely and cordial.  I personally enjoyed the humor of the servers and personal attention from Zina  the owner of the restaurant.  Somehow, you feel at home there, very comfortable, cozy and warm.  While we were siting in the small room, I really liked the color of the walls in the main room  very French Bistro.  We would come back to have dinner and for greater family celebrations for sure! I went to L'Olivier for Christmas day dinner and to say I was underwhelmed is an understatement. There was nothing wrong with the meal but it was very overpriced. Service was non extraordinary and food was nothing to write home about. In short, it wasn't worth the $. /person they charged. I should add that that charge didn't include drinks. I don't recommend this place. Came here for a work party. Service was not great. The person who took our drink order only asked a few people at the table if they wanted drinks and then left without checking in on the rest of the party. When we asked if the rest of the table could put in our drink orders, the wait staff acted as if we were bothering them.  At one point, one of the members of our party informed the waiter that she had gotten the wrong dessert. The waiter gave her a hard time and questioned why she didn't like the mocha cake she had been given (she hadn't even tried it yet, because it was not the dessert she ordered!) The food lacked flavor and was overly salted. I would definitely not come here again.  From the clientele, it seems that this restaurant caters to the over  crowd.  I will say that the maitre'd/hostess was very nice, and she was trying to serve us our drinks, even though it was clearly not her job. To top it all off there was a hair in my chocolate mousse, which was thick and wire like :(  This left me with an even worse impression, and a gross, nauseated feeling in my stomach. I would definitely avoid this place in the future. Came here for a company party and what a miss this place is! I'd expect the food to be at least decent for a supposedly  $ sign restaurant, but I can clearly say I've had better elsewhere. The decor is beautiful and elegant and the waiters are very helpful but their food is too simple and plain for a fine dining experience. Their version of antipasti meat plate are slices of deli turkey meat and pastrami. Huh?? Really?? My entree was nothing complicated but a grilled filet salmon with a side of  rice, steamed carrots and string beans. Something you can get at TGIF or Chili's for a cheaper price. The only thing that was well remembered was the live music and us dancing away with the wine we brought ourselves. Absolutely fantastic service and food.  Did a supreme job catering our party and went well above and beyond what they promised on the set menus.  The snobs rating this restaurant down have no idea what they are talking about. I actually think this place deserves .  stars.  Important note for other people who love duck: Contrary to what their online menu says, L'Olivier does not serve duck confit as a dinner entree!!  When I came to this tragic realization I spent forever deciding on an entree, but the waiter was very patient with me.  The service here is generally very good.  In the end I decided on rabbit over fettuccine pasta  it's a pretty rustic dish, and the portion is huge!  The bunny based sauce was flavorful, the rabbit leg was fall off the bone good, the back was tough and dry, the fettuccine was overcooked.  However, the bouillabaisse marseillaise was magnifique!  I recommend ordering the bouillabaisse if you are here for dinner on a Fri or Sat night. Went here for lunch and had the prix fixe menu.  The food is pretty good but what distinguishes this restaurant is that it has to be the cheapest French place in the city.   course (appetizer and entree) is $, add dessert for $ total.  The restaurant is decorated nicely and everything was very clean. Started with the risotto which was good and I would have again.  Had the flank steak as the entree which was okay but not great.  The steak comes with fresh french fries and vege stir fry which were good. Service was fine  waiter was nice enough and stopped by to ask how the food was. The restaurant doesn't get much traffic so it's actually a great place for a chill meal in downtown SF.  Certainly different than most other options. Seems that checking out the other reviews this should be a place to steer clear of for large office party groups, but I'm not judging the restaurant on that criteria. I had dinner after work here early on a Monday, the place was not surprisingly, pretty empty. The decor is very French in flavor, you could (almost) be in Paris. The food is a little pricey but solid, my chicken was cooked just right and flavorful, the wife's fish came up hot and tasty. Our waiter was great, attentive and chatty, just the right amount without being overbearing. Note: if you are a local, ie: you live in the neighborhood, they have a fantastic deal for you every night of the week (Mondays % off all wine!). Is it my favorite restaurant? No. Did I enjoy my visit and would I return? Yes I think I might. This review is for Zina more than the restaurant, although it's nicer and cleaner than many other 'russian' places.  Zina catered my sis in law wedding and the cocktail hour was fantastic  unique appetizers, great presentation and service. The dinner was not bad either. Several weddings and parties we attended at the restaurant also left us with an overall pleasant impression.  After all, that's the reason we go there  have fun with friend, drink, dance, and. . . yes, eat(though that's not our priority) The best rest. I've been to is in Barcelona(Spain) nothing has topped that experience in  years. . . . and I doubt anything will. . . . . This is a review for Zina, who catered our wedding this month. Zina created the most spectacular menu for our Russian wedding. This woman is passionate about what she does and genuinely wants your day to be the very best. Our tables overflowed with the most delicious Russian and Georgian delicacies. Both Russian and American guests are still raving about not only the quantity of food, but the quality of the food. If you are looking for a caterer to do a traditional Russian wedding, look no further than Zina at L'Olivier. I'll never forget her hugging me at the end of the night and saying, ""It's all over now! You can relax! We did it!"" Oh, and she charges virtually nothing for the amount of food she prepares. It's insane. This is no ""beef or fish"" wedding stuff. This is over the top, decadent, sumptuous food for the senses. Hire her for your wedding!! been here a few times for lunch and the food is pretty good. the pre fixe menu is a nice option for about $ (app, entree and dessert). we had lunch here yesterday and they set us up in a nice private room. while the ambiance and food was overall pretty good, service was not that great. we had to ask for water refills, they got one of the entrees wrong, and the food in general took a while (the place was not that busy). the food standouts were the mushroom soup and i really enjoyed the creme brulee which was served warm and was quite tasty. hopefully they step things up. I went here for a company party and I've definitely had better food elsewhere. The options were steak, salmon, and vegetarian. I opted for the steak (getting really tired of restaurant salmon, it all tastes the same). The steak was OK, not better than I expected. I only had a small plop of mashed potatoes, something that should never be served in small portions. The spinach salad with lardons was good, though. Big pieces of bacon. For dessert I chose the chocolate mousse. The other option was flan. Now, I realize flan sounds fancier and mousse sounds standard, but I figured I couldn't go wrong this way. Turns out the mousse was the winner. Not intense but it hit the spot. A friend's vegetarian couscous was the best tasting entree. I wished I'd ordered that instead because it was the most flavorful. Service was to the point for such a large group and the space isn't bad. There's a podium and some open space, and it's not hard to get around to other tables to chat with people. The retro feel reminded me of some old 's ""Continental Style"" restaurant in Chicago or elsewhere in the midwest, which frankly was fun. The food was average, also what you would expect for s tastes. I imagine my grandmother would have loved this place  innocuous Bouillabaisse ""Marseille"", extremely rich desserts   mild flavors overall. The service was fantastic; the waiter attentive, informative, and incredibly professional. Yum! Came here to celebrate my aunt's th birthday and reserved a banquet room. The food was so delicious! When we arrived, there were all sorts of Russian appetizers laid out on the table, aesthetically breath taking and the flavor was to match the decor. Main course took forever to come out but it was delicious nevertheless. My mom got a steak which lacked tenderness but my vegetables were good. I'm curious to come back here and actually order something from the menu, so I'll probably be back. I think the staff could use a little more training, no one came to check on our food or refill our drinks although the pitchers were left there for us to self serve. I was waiting for a refill of my coffee during desserts but it never came so that was a bit disappointing. If you haven't been here, I would highly recommend it for the food. The chocolate soufle and grand marnier soufle are magnificent. I thought the soufle at Le Papillon is the best. This place is awesome. Ok, service tends to be better on slower days. But Zena is an awesome lady and is always welcoming to us and our party. I give her a  star for now. Wondering what was in tomato/mozarella salad's dressing. . . Fish was a tad greasy.  Got indigestion. Used to be much better. . . Service was excellent. Nothing has changed. Can't figure out why the service is so bad. The dinner group ordered more than a few bottles of wine, which then sat on a table near us. . . (we were in a private dining room). Waiters/busboy/owner didn't feel the need to pour the wine for the folks waiting for a sip. So, I get up to pour it for them (since no server was stepping up to the daunting task). I was told that they will pour the wine, and ""you should sit down"" , so I responded, then POUR IT ! . Oops, then they pour red into a white wine glass, white wine into a red wine glass. Holy Moly. Once again not my choice to dine here, and there I was again. . . . . Food is pedestrian,  just OK (kinda thought some of the salad ingredients came out of a can from Costco, as well as the lamb, ops the lamb from Costco is actually better than they serve) Checked out the "" Russian Banquet"" via email, which took  weeks for the ""owners"" to respond; did so out of curiosity of a "" French "" restaurant with a dining specialty of ""Russian"" food. Sounded good but never had a piroshki at a ""French"" restaurant. . . . and never will. The food is over priced and not very good. The fennel sauce on my fish tasted like Tom's tooth paste.  The steak tasted more like an average American steak, prepared with little imagination.  The ambiance is stuffy and caters to senior citizens.  Our waiter was very friendly, though. We ended up paying an arm and a leg for a less than satisfactory experience. This was my second time having lunch here with my co workers and I enjoyed it again. There were  of us and we started off with escargot and mussells. Mussells were good, but nothing to be excited about. I was very terrified of eating snails, but my co worker assured me it was good. *drum roll please* It really was good! Didn't taste slimey at all. We all ordered salmon, seabass, seafood pasta, and the meat trio. I had the salmon with a side of creamy mashed potatoes, veggies, and sauteed spinach. I liked and devoured everything on my plate. For dessert, I had the creme brulee and it was fantastic. My other co worker thought it was too sweet, but it tasted fine to me. Lunch is pretty inexpensive, especially for a French restaurant, and the service was good. I'd definitely come back! Ugly, run down, depressing decor, tasteless food (there was no distinct taste of any kind to my white wine mussles, or seabass as main course). The waiter was scatter brained and it certainly was not worth the expense. Perhaps there was a time when L'Olivier was considered a hip joint. But, it must have been at least as long ago as when John's Grill opened on Union Square. I was here for a holiday party. Let me tell you how it went. The decor was nice warm earth tones. The service was down and dirty. They got the job done, but a smile would go a long way which I understand can be difficult when you are understaffed. They do have a full liquor license allowing them to accommodate many different tastes, but no real bar. The food  options were ribeye, chicken, and salmon. Sounds like a wedding menu. I went with the salmon which was ok. The sides was a rice pilaf in a cream sauce and veggies that were blanched and quickly sauteed. The food came out warm and the plates were not even hot. That really affected the dish. The dessert was meh. Flan that flopped in taste, but the chocolate mousse ok. Always had a pretty good meal, but the best part might've been the service. Extremely attentive and they handle large groups well. A lot of the locals dine here when the work crowd clears out, so that is a sign that these folks know French cuisine very well. Awesome bread and desserts. I come to a restaurant for food, not to look at the wall color ( although it is extremely yellow, but it didn't spoil my appetite). The food was amazing, and I am hard to please. Mm. . . . excellent mushroom soup. I also tried their beef tartar and seabass, YUMMY! My date had filet mignon for the entree, and was pretty happy with it. I also liked that their portion were larger compared to the average portion size at french restaurants. I don't know if other reviewers came here on an ""off"" night, or what. The atmosphere was great, the staff was friendly and helpful, and parking. . . you can't  beat valet parking when it comes to SF. I was hesitant about trying this place after reading the reviews, but I did, and I have to say this restaurant was much better then I expected. Plus, I actually like the decor, and the fact that it is spacious  good for banquets. The bad reviews that I have read here are completely untrue. We have had our wedding reception and celebrated many birthdays and other joyous occasions at ""L'Olivier"". The food is always fresh and very tasty! The service is awesome! The owners always greet us with a smile! We love this restaurant very much !Oksana & Boris I'm ashamed I had lunch there, don't tell anyone, please!I didn't pick this, that, I guess its called a restaurant. If you have not been to Russia, go there!. . . the food was  nasty, really nasty! We had a birthday here a while back, and the service and food were both splendid!  The decor was thematic and quaint.  We even had our own little area for our party and it had a cute indoor fountain!  I definitely recommend this for big groups.  Keep in mind that they'll require you to go with the prix fixe menu.  Don't worry, there are plenty of options and everyone was happy with his/her meal. Lastly, the waiters were prompt and polite. Tonight was quite honestly the best Valentine's date I've had yet. It's true that the company you're with makes the difference. I'm basing the  stars from the general experience we had for Valentine's . Our reservations was set at :pm, but because of all the annual pillow fight event, we were running late, so we decided to call hoping we would not lose our reservations. They mentioned that tables aren't held, but when we got there ( minutes after our reservations), we were seated promptly with our choice of tables. We chose a table off to the corner of the dining area to the right as you enter the restaurant for more privacy. Apparently, many others were inconvenienced by the the v day traffic as well. We were promptly greeted with water service and their prix fixe Valentine's menu  Starter Course. Lobster Bisque. Sauteed Rock Shrimps Provencale in Pastry Shell. Mache Salad with Marinade and Cherry Tomatoeswith Balsamic Vinegar DressingMain Course. Pan Fried Seabass Fillet over Ratatouille, Tomato Coulis. Rack of Lamb with Herbs and Celery Root Mashed Potato. Grilled New York Steak with Potatoes au Gratin, Maitre d'Butter. Salmon Filet with Ginger SauceDesserts. Fresh Strawberries with Grand Marnier Sauce. Floating Island with Raspberry. Chocolate Mousse CakeAll of this including a glass of champagne for $ per person. I decided to start with the bisque, indulge with the rack of lamb, and end with the mousse. And since we were one of the first guest to arrive, our service was prompt and orderly. It seems as other couples arrived, their orders and courses arrived after ours, so major plus for early reservations. I was thoroughly satisfied with my combination selection. The bisque was extremely rich and buttery. Though I am not a huge fan of lobster, I would've easily wanted an order of this to go with their tasty bread. The huge basket of bread was served with a slab of cold, hard butter. For a place like this, I would've expect them to at least bring the butter to room temperature, or serve it in small sauce bowl so it's easy to scrape with a knife. I used the bread to sop up the buttery bisque, so no additional butter needed. The rack of lamb arrived, prepared medium rare. Their medium rare was a little more on the rare side for me, as I usually like the pink of the chop to be more centered, instead of pink to the edge. Regardless, it was still very delicious, and I even wanted to pick up the bone and give it a proper cleaning. This came with a side of well steamed veggies, and fluffy mashed potatoes. I was not too impressed by the their dessert selection, as I am always on the hunt for a more unique dessert menu. I decided to have chocolate mousse cake, since I was a little tired that night and thought the caffeine in the chocolate would energize me for the rest of the evening. I was very surprised with the turnout, the mouse was layered beneath a layer of light and fluffy chocolate cake. Overall it was nice balance of richness and sweetness, not too rich like some desserts. We were able to finish the entire dessert. The only reason why I did not give this place five stars was because of on one of the restaurant employees (possibly a manager) weirdly eying our table four times, wierd because there were no tables next to us in the direction she was looking at:First glance  she glances only at our table, and walks away from the dining area. I didn't think anything of it. Second glance ( minutes later)  she glances at our table again, and has a conversation close to our table with our server who just picks up our check and credit card. She speaks in Russian to him. Then our serves motions towards his apron where our check and credit card was placed. They walk away. Third glance ( minute later)  she glances only at our table again and walks away. Fourth glance ( minutes later, after I return from the restroom)  she glances at our table, and I start feeling awkward. I don't think she was mindful that this was Valentine's Night, and all her awkward, obvious glances to our table did not set the mood. On that note, the ambiance was mediocre. The dining area we were seated in felt like a converted greenhouse turned dining room.  I didn't feel it was particularly romantic, the lighting was a little bright, and all the noise from the event occurring in the next room detracted from our quiet conversation. If you want to have a quiet, private conversation, this may not be the best place. But, if you like to be more lively and have a greater than whispering conversation, this is a good place. As long as I am with my hubby, I would definitely come back. And I would definitely come back for an order of their bisque and freshly warmed bread basket. this is not the worst that i've had.  i almost gave it two stars, since it was not a miserable experience. . . but then i thought, i really can't come back here. let's start with the good. . . they've got a great selection for prix fixe.  usually prix fixe involves salad, some mediocre and simple soup du jour and n. y. strip or salmon.  v day actually offered lobster bisque and rack of lamb.  that's pretty amazing. downside?  it wasn't really lobster bisque (or it was vat of bisque cooked with a single lobster. . . claw).  the lamb was not medium rare (closer to medium) but this was forgivable.  the lamb's complete lack of seasoning, and it's too sweet cream mashed potatoes, not so much.  the other sides on the plate were equally bland and begging not to be eaten. the waiter looked like a cross between dolph from simpsons (see: rob clarkson. com/duff br…) and a serial killer.  it's v day so i don't have much to say about poor service.  the glasses were dirty and stained. . . which was gross.  if you're thinking of going here. . . go find another french restaurant. I came here for Valentines Day with my girlfriend and all I can say was that it was horrible. The only redeeming factor about this restaurant is that it's relatively cheap when compared to other restaurants on Valentines Day. The decor of the restaurant is somewhat modern. However, when I went there, I was seated in their restaurant extension room, which basically is just a glass wall arch with walls on both side. You can tell this is an extension because the floor is actually slanted, and, unfortunately, me and about /rds of the patrons were seated on this ""slanted"" floor. How positively annoying and disorientating. The dishes were also scratched up and our cups were still dirty. But hey, it's forgivable on Valentines Day. . . right?To add to the discomfort, the day I was there was also someone's  year anniversary party. while I usually think this is sweet and lovely, the music they were playing was plain annoying. Ironically, when another fellow patron was talking at the bar while waiting for their table, one of the people at the anniversary party basically told them to shut up and yet when we were eating dinner, we could barely hear each other through their 's music. I found this very insulting because valentine's day dinner is supposed to be quiet and romantic. You'd wish the restaurant wasn't ran by idiots. Onto the food, Valentines Day had a prix fixe menu. We ordered the appetizer: lobster bisque, the shrimp provincialentree: Lamb chops and New York Steakdessert: Strawberries and Chocolate CakeThe lobster bisque basically tasted like it does not and never did contain any actual lobster. It's hard to describe the taste exactly, but needless to say it required an hour to be served to us when it tasted like it has been sitting on the burner the entire night. The shrimp provencial is a dish that contains shrimp served between two pieces of pastry. This dish might be the best dish of the night just because the pastry shell was quite delicious and the shrimp was basically baby shrimp with olive oil and basil. However, every shrimp has the digestive track (the back vein that you remove) still in tact. A very disgusting reality for any restaurantThe lamb chop was actually semi decent. Despite having any real taste, it was cooked decently well. The dishes on the side, however, were questionable. There were vegetables and mashed potatoes that were squeezed out of one of those frosting bags. In the end, the potatoes looked like a soft english cookie due to its swirl. I'd much prefer a big slab of potato with gravy slabbered all over it, but to each our own. The New York steak, however, is where the tower begins to crumble down. The Steak itself is basically a steak I can find at any Denny's restaurant around the country. The color of the meat itself is a bit dark which means that the meat has probably been in the freezer for a bit too long. The meat was also not marinated, which is a pretty big deal when you're dealing with cheap meat. The meat was also % fat, which is just disgusting. I don't know if it was just my dish or what, but this type of steak has no business being in any semi fancy restaurant. The desserts were nothing to write home about. The chocolate cake tasted like it came from Safeway (way too sweet and way too much frosting) and the strawberries dish was just too sour. Thus ends my lovely evening. Also, our waiter was really, really, really, really slow, which should be expected on Valentines Day, except he was only in charge of ten tables and he seems to be wondering around the restaurant aimlessly. It also doesn't help that he looks like a serial killer. Anyway, I would avoid this restaurant at all costs, unless you are looking for a subpar meal. Being that I was with my true Valentine I will give L' Olivier five stars.  It did have its kinks but I could see passed that.  They do deserve a star because we were  min late and they gave us an extension.  Stupid Pillow Fight made so much traffic! Once we arrived we where seated promptly.  We had the opportunity to sit at any table we chose.  The tables were decorated with a vase of baby breath and a red rose.  Confetti of red trumpet cupids, and red hearts sprinkled around the table cloth.  We then picked our meal from a prefix meal.  I chose the Lobster Bisque, Sea Bass with Ratatouille, and Chocolate Mousse for dessert.  The lobster bisque was buttery, rich, and had a slight hint of lobster.  This would have been much better with a few chunks of lobster garnishing the bisque.  One plus was the french baguette, it was warm fresh, crunchy, soft and delicious.  But the only draw back was the hard quarter stick of butter served on the side.  The sea bass was cooked perfectly, very moist and seasoned very well.  The only problem was the two bones I found.  If swallowed this would of been a Valentines gone wrong.  The veggies were cooked perfectly drenched with a tomato sauce.  But very out of place was a boiled peeled baby potato with parsley sprinkled on top. Which was way under cooked and only the outside edible.  To wash this down we had a glass of bubbly.  The final dessert was a square piece of chocolate mousse cake with raspberry coulis.  The mousse was light and cloudy.  It went very well with the raspberry coulis.  This restaurant had its kinks as I mentioned in the begging but overall it was a wonderful dinner, due to the face that I had my Valentine.  Judging from other patrons around me they had a tougher time with the staff and ordering. If you ignore the decor then L'livier is just okay.  Alright. . . I will concede. . . a poet I am not.  Went here for lunch and enjoyed their tender rack of lamb.  The dish was a bit odd, however, in that it is served with a tiny amount of vegetables and a whole bunch of french fries.  Why french fries? Makes no sense.  They are trying to be a bit upscale, yet they fall short of the mark with the fries.  About $ for the lamb dish.  Lastly, I tried their chocolate mouse cake for desert. Not bad, but nothing special either. As for their decor, just take a look on their website.  You be the judge. We had reservations for a party of  and they seated us promptly. The service was attentive, although not particularly friendly. The ambiance was cute, not many patrons in the joint. The food was delicious, I had a brie appetizer, the pork loin and finished off with the choc mousse cake. For  bucks I was not disappointed. The portions were adequate, but do not expect a giant plate of food. I left satisfied and still had room for a second round of dessert later in the evening ; ). When my accountant told me that we were eating here for lunch, it dawned on me that I haven't eaten here for over fifteen years.  Meeting for a business lunch, our party was one of many that occupied the half full dining room.  They had a private room with a larger party of twenty already dining.  The diners were a mixed crowd of FIDI professionals, office staff, and neighborhood people.  It certainly isn't Aqua or Tadich at all, but it is must more laid back.  The four of us dined on the two course prix fixed menu ($.   bargain for this neighborhood):AppetizersChicken and Vegetable soup  Bowl of a fresher version of Campbell's vegetable soups with chunks of white chicken meat.  Not bad. EntreesPork Tenderloin with Fried Potato slices and vegetables  Three tender boneless pork pieces pan fried with a light brown gravy; vegetables were green beans, carrots, and yellow zuchinni slicesSmoked Salmon with toast and diced red onions  Forget whether this was one of the entree options or taken from the regular menu. Baked Seafood with Basmati rice and vegetables  I only noticed the salmon on the dish.  Can't remember what else was there. Because each of us was on a time schedule, we did not order the three course ($. ) meal which included a choice from their dessert tray.  With the closing of MacArthur Park, parking was plenty; I later learned that they offer $.  valet parking right in front of the restaurant.  The accountant and the banker told us that this is their new lunch hangout as we did not feel rushed or pressured to leave.  The only blip was that the smoked salmon came about ten minutes after the other diners were served their hot food. . . excuse me, smoked salmon is COLD?!  I would come back for lunch if I were in the area or wanted a leisure lunch. Truly one of the worst meals I have had in San Francisco, perhaps ever. The food was just one bland dish after another, served in a dingy environment where everything  from the dishes, to the decor, to the service, to the tableware  seemed like it was a secondary concern for the proprietors. I couldn't even finish my soup  two spoonfuls in, I just stopped trying. From what I understand, this was a French restaurant, that was bought out by Russians who kept on some of the French chefs.  So I guess its somewhat of a hybrid French Russian restaurant. I came here for a huge Ukrainian birthday party (complete with real life Ukrainians, Ukrainian MC and Ukrainian French food).  The main room was a large hall with space enough for tables, a dance floor, and a place for a live band.  The wait staff spoke both languages (Russian and English) very well, and were very friendly.  They weren't the best at clearing off the dishes, but the way these things go, its hard to tell which dishes are done with and which aren't.  (For those of you who don't know, its buffet style, but the dishes are placed on the actual tables, instead of separate tables). I admittedly am not a huge fan of Ukrainian/Russian food.  In fact, I'm not even a small fan.  But I guess the french influence really showed because there were plenty of dishes I enjoyed.  Despite my lackluster review, and rating, this was by far the best Russian party (excluding weddings) that I have ever been to. . . Three things on the prix fixe menu that make L'Olivier's a gem: ) the baby spinach vinaigrette with feta cheese, ) the chicken blanquette with basmatic rice, and ) the creme brulee!  I can't speak for the other dishes, but all of the aforementioned are simply stellar!  This is one of my favorite places to lunch when a work related luncheon is scheduled.  The service is wonderful, and the staff does a fantastic job of accommodating large groups! I had my wedding rehearsal dinner here recently and the whole experience was wonderful!  I'm especially pleased because I live in Seattle and my husband and I just picked L'Olivier off of the internet so we weren't exactly sure what to expect.  We had a beautiful private room for our party of about  people and the service was absolutely fabulous.  The food was delicious and they had a nice menu printed up so everyone could take a look at the options.  It's in a nice location down by the Embarcadero too.  We would definitely recommend them for your private event! Le restaurant du awful food.  Blech.  I don't know what possessed us in the first place to visit the retirement village on a Friday night.  Honestly, the whole area was a ghost town and it was only : and they weren't supposed to close until .  Anyway, we get to the restaurant and there is one other group in there and they left in about  minutes.  This place is HUGE so it felt kind of weird to be in there along.  They weren't closing and we had reservations, so that should have told us something was wrong.  The dinner started out okay.  Joey had the soup of the day, vegetable puree and I had the mixed green salad and they both were very tasty.  It stopped there.  Joey had the sea bass and it smelled and tasted like a dirty goldfish bowl.  I had the fllet mignon with truffle sauce which I swear was from the Hungry Man kitchens.  It was so bad I couldn't finish it.  Towards the end of our dinner at : or so they started clearing off all the tables and were very noisy about it.  We really wanted dessert (I know, I know  WHY??) so we ordered off the dessert cart.  Little did we know we literally got what we say.  You cannot tell me they made me creme brulee and and managed to get it chilled in two minutes.  Needless to say we will never go back there and I don't recommend you go either unless you get a senior discount. went here for a large party last friday (we rented out the whole restaurant) and our meals were already ordered for us. i had a pork pate appetizer, sea bass with fennel sauce and creme brulee as desert. the pate was the first pate i'd ever had and it was pretty salty and tasted a bit like bologne. it didn't come with anything except a small salad, normally you eat it with bread?the sea bass was a bit dry and unflavorful, i asked for extra sauce which was just ok for more flavoring. the creme brulee didn't have a crust to crack on top and came in the largest creme brulee dishes i have seen about in in diameter and inside the custard was maybe /in thick. for the price it stated on the menu $ pp, i would be extremely disappointed to have eaten here, the service was poor and the quality of food was less than mediocre.  However, I only paid $ as the meal was subsidized by the party i  was with, and still I don't think my $ was well spent. this place was not worth the money. our dinner for two was .  hours long and the food was a /. especially for the $. best part of the dinner was the chocolate mousse cake and it was just average. the violinist was a nice touch and the place is cute. but food needs improvement. i don't know how this place is now, but back in the day when i went here with my family it was pretty darn good. i got the filet mignon i think and it was delicious everytime i got it. the desserts were the best part of the meals even though by the end of it we couldn't eat anymore. my sisters and i ate so much bread that we barely had enough room for the entrees. the bread was that good along with the butter. my mother loved the lamb here. i tried it and it was good too. I came here for a work lunch, so with our large group, we were given a private room, and a special group menu.  The restaurant is very charming. Very much old style French.  Lots of floral decorations. I had the lobster bisque to start  one of my favorites.  The flank steak was delicious and cooked to perfection.  I usually order medium rare, and this steak was on the nose. For dessert, chocolate mousse all the way.  Rich and creamy  and what can I say?  It was chocolate!This isn't the best French restaurant in the city, but it's good.  Our lunch prix fixe was about $ a head.  Expensive for lunch, but for the three courses and the variety we could chose from, it really isn't bad.  It's a fairly big menu for a group prix fixe.  Something for everyone. The best thing about L'Olivier is that you can get a prix fixe, three course French dinner for only $. .  The worst thing about L'Olivier is that your prix fixe, three course French dinner tastes like it costs only $. . Before I move on to the food, let me tell you about the atmosphere here.  It's the holidays, so a myriad of sparkling lights, cheap plastic snowflakes, garish stockings don't even seem particularly annoying.  The empty band set and a barrage of fake plants, however, are annoying.  And, unlike the snowflakes, they will be there year round. We were seated at a table that was perfectly positioned in the part of the room where the restaurant carpeting met the hardwood dance floor.  I almost tripped when I sat down!  Furthermore, at a table to our left, an adorable couple celebrated their th wedding anniversary.  At a table to our right,  desperate men and  desperate women were being lectured by their friendly Table For Six counselor.  Ah, the circle of life!The three course prix fixe menu offered a variety of choices.  There were about  appetizers,  main courses and a dessert tray with  items.  For my appetizer, I had warm brie cheese in philo dough served with some salad.  This was by far the best part of the meal.  The philo dough and the brie were delicious!  Alas, the entree was coming next . . .  My sea bass had  giant fish bones in the middle!  Who serves a sea bass filet with bones?  The fish itself was rubbery, salty and overcooked.  The sauce that generously covered the fish tasted like Thai peanut sauce with a touch of WD .  Even the tiny bit of rice served on the side of my sea bass was horrible.  I hardly finished half of my meal, and I would have sent it back had it not been for my friends who paid for the meal.  The coffee mousse cake was fine, but not spectacular. It was my second time at L'Olivier, and, I can assure you, my last one. Oh yeah, in case you're wondering, I didn't sense any chemistry among the Table For Six couples.  I actually thought that one gentleman might have not been interested in women at all . . . is it possible they made a mistake? I came here on a Friday evening and noticed there was an almost empty room with only two other tables occupied. Oh well, that was fine for me since we wanted our own privacy anyways. The food turned out okay and not spectacular, but you do get what you pay for. Don't expect the best French cuisine you've ever had, but DO expect the best prices you will pay for French food. I would have given this restaurant three stars, but the souffle was spectacular! They have regular with wine and chocolate flavored. Yummy! Would I come again? Most likely, because of the souffle. Decor was OK at first glance.  But then the fake plants and empty band set in the corner starts to bother me.  As for the food   got the filet mignon   extremely tender.  So it was nice, but I was expecting more.  Couldn't taste the truffles in the truffle sauce.  There's a small side of mesh potato and few pieces of beans.  Service was OK but it took a while to get the food.  Bread was nice and warm. I go to this place pretty often with my friends and family for the past couple years. A little bit over a year ago they renovated the place adding some modernity to the place but yet leaving the traditional French look which I find really attractive. I think the food there is really good. The fish and I mean every fish dish that I tried there is really tasty. I really love desserts and the souffle is exceptional! Nice place, good food, easy to park, professional and polite stuff, very good place to take your family and friends too, especially if you have a large group of people. My mom and her lady friends decided to lunch and invited me along for the ride. I'm always down for a good free lunch!When I first walked in I notice the antiquey flowerly type of decorations, and then I proceeded to the back  BAM! The walls are painted in the most awful bright pee yellow color ever. It clashes with the rest of the pastel colors in the restaurant. Hm. . It's almost disturbing. Anyhoo, I was smart and used my coconut.  My mom and her friends were already at the restaurant so I called my mom and asked her to place my order for me so that I could arrive and sit down and enjoy the meal and company without having to feel rushed. The mushroom soup was really good and full of flavor! Absolutely my favorite part of the meal! I had the swordfish for my entree, which was tender, but I could've done wihtout the creamy saffron sauce.  Overall, the food was just north of mediocre.  But totally affordable and worth their lunch special price of $ for a three course meal!Would I come back again? Yes. (with my mother and her friends)Would I take my uber cool hip friends here? No. Thanks mom! :D French food in the sense that I envision French people in a retirement home would eat. My entree, a flank steak w/shallot sauce was mediocre and the side of steamed vegetables was cold. This was the second year our company had a function here and the second year I ate tepid retirement home food. The chocolate mousse was OK. Two of us hoped to enjoy Armagnac after the entree. Being touted as a French restaurant, we thought we'd be offered a decent selection. We were wrong. The first bartender asked didn't know what Armagnac was. . . . They eventually found one bottle. My suggestion: Go visit your Grandmother with a bottle of Armagnac in hand; you'll save money and have a better time. I read the other review it's a shame the place has fallen to crap.  I understand the original owners sold the place to the current ones.  I'm basing my review on the original owners.  I used to go to this place quite frequently.  Gotta love their prix fixe lunches.  Hopefully it's better now?UPDATE:  The company had a farewell lunch here recently.  I ordered their special pre fixe menu ($ for  course meal & a drink).  I had the green salad and fish.  No complaints here.  The fish was juicy.  Dessert was something off their platter (chocolate mousse).  Food is just as I remembered it. Oh yeah, we got the front room all to ourselves (it was a big party)."|4|90|5|Routine| Food safety certificate or food handler card not available  [ date violation corrected: 7/11/2012 ] Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 7/11/2012 ] Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 7/11/2012 ] Improper food storage  [ date violation corrected: 7/11/2012 ] Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils  [ date violation corrected: 7/11/2012 ]
St. Regis Hotel Lobby Bar 0|4.0|Bars in San Francisco, CA|Pricey|113|0|4.05882352941|" Posh, polished and totally swank. Channelling that very British vibe, this most definitely is a St Regis! Attentive service, great snacks, awesome eats and well made drinks. All this and wrapped up into a very cool, sophisticated vibe from the many patrons! Looking for an after work cocktail or a liquid libation in a hotel lobby that is probably better then the one you may be staying in. . . make this your go to place in the Arts District. Chin Chin! One of my favorite ""local"" bars. I know it's a hotel bar but I can always find a seat, the wait staff is always fast and friendly. . . and the pours are quite generous. They provide little snacks  wasabi peas and some other crunchy Asian mix item (I don't know what it is)  but it's always nice to have some bar snacks during happy hour. As you can imagine, drinks are not cheap  glasses of wine are $ $  but it's worth it for the top notch service and comfortable surroundings. They have great seating and lots of it. ""The Ruby"" is my favorite! Bar is really nice, delicious drinks and good service. I especially love their complimentary bar snacks! The Regis Bar is a very classy place and you will not find any hipster crowds here.  This is a very upscale lounge with sophisticatedly dressed people drinking their favorite embellishments.  The drinks are pricey and well made, but thats what you would expect for drinking at the St Regis. Needed a place to chill for a couple hours after the convention ended and before our dinner reservation, and the St. Regis is a close walk away from the Moscone Center. Our server was friendly and attentive and the place is cozy enough, but my god, $ for an Echigo beer?? $ for sparkling water? Oh wait, it's a hotel bar. Ok ok, I'm back to reality. I would probably stop by here again if in the area if I needed to conduct business, but if it's just me or I'm with family, I'd probably go somewhere more reasonable. Walked down after lunch from the ""W' Hotel.  The lounge is really pretty , old Hollywood Glamor .  The service fast and Friendly.  They had sound of Jazz as the background music, which made the atmosphere upbeat.  I had the I had the Visper Martini with Lillet, the James Bond recipe, it was really good with a different taste , all i needed was one.  My friend had the Chardonnay and was pleased. Not to loud but had some noise, so you didn't feel like you were in a dead space.   I will definitely go back with friends from out of town if I am downtown. Once MOMA opens back up that would be a great place to go. Classic, unpretentious but sophisticated, high energy lobby lounge with skilled old school bartenders who can make any drink without problem.  This place is so great, and reliable, it feels like a warm blanket.  All the barkeeps are great, and it's a place I return again and again. Working in the hospitality field, I am very particular about hotel bars. This one is deserving of the St. Regis name. Perfect service, comfortable yet upscale, and welcoming atmosphere. The cocktails? Will light you on fire. Yum! I highly recommend taking out of town guests, having an early evening meeting, or for a romantic pre dinner drink. You cannot go wrong with a drink here. *drinks only review*Pretty damn good spot for classing it up for some drinks! We went here with some team members for pre holiday party drinks on a Saturday evening and this is really a great spot. Drinks are pricey (as to be expected) but generally well made. Service was really good at the start but fell off a bit towards the end of our ~ hours there. Waitresses vanished for a while and it took an inordinate amount of time to get orders in and to get orders delivered  I'm talking people who showed up had to wait  minutes to place an order. They have quite the whiskey selection and bartenders make a mean cocktail. Definitely try the Vesper Royale (~$) if you're a fan of a VERY boozy drink. If there's a drink to avoid, it's the Elderflower Fizz (I think that's the name). Sounds good in theory but the soda water really waters down the taste. Would have been great had they left the soda water out and kept it with only the sparkling wine as the baseAnd a bonus if you're a points whore like me: since this is in a Starwood hotel you can earn Starwood points for your spend (which will most likely add up quick)! Just give the staff your SPG number or hang onto the receipt and submit it after the fact. I'll certainly be back when looking for a change of pace from the usual bars around the office Nice lobby bar in the St. Regis, right on Mission and rd. We came here to chat before going into the adjoining restaurant, Ame. Modern, understated elegance, but typical hotel lobby bar, except perhaps the people seem slightly more refined than your average hotel bar. Or maybe everyone was dressed up for holiday season parties. Not crowded or noisy, but comfortably busy. They do have some drinks they are known for, St. Regis, that is, like their signature Bloody Mary, attributed to them in their New York location back in . If you like Martinis and have a couple of Benjamins burning a whole in your pocket, try their $ Martini. Service was attentive, friendly, but restrained, like the rest of the hotel. I had a Tanqueray and Tonic. My friend had a Sapphire Martini, slightly dirty. Not the $ Gin Martini. Not sure of the prices because my generous friend took care of it. I took care of dinner next door, though. The Lobby Bar is awesome. . . . . . . . . . Modern spot for exclusive drinksQuiet Sophistication atmosphere and Décor is Classy. Excellent drinks but expensive. Without the crazy. Wine and drink selection. Staffs are professional and friendly. Better lounges. While the rooms are very nice, the person who cleaned my room also stole my flat iron.  When I contacted the hotel to have them send to me, they said they didn't find it.  I'm sorry, but stuff doesn't just disappear into thin air!  Be careful no to leave anything behind when you stay at this hotel, as you most likely will never see it again! Nice modern spot for stiff drinks!I came here during the weekend before Halloween and the place was packed with people in their cleopatra, pilot, phantom of the opera costumes. Despite all the seats being taken, I didn't mind standing around scouring for the next open seat as I chatted with my friend. After  minutes, we were able to sit down in oversized chairs and enjoy the wasabi peas and snacks. Their cocktails averaged ~$ and they have one page of selections. Most of the drinks look interesting, i. e. #PumpkinSpiceLatte, Diplomat, and etc. I tried the Diplomat and it was super strong and sweet. Overall a really nice hip bar where you can sit, relax, and chat with friends without feeling cramped and screaming over everyone. The price is a little steep but I would come back for an occasion. p. s. Entrance to the bar is on the alley and there is most definitely no view. However, if you catch SF during an event, you can enjoy some fancy people watching. I've been here a few times but the last one had to be one of the more interesting drinking experiences here. Im sitting at the bar with a friend and this crazy drunk dude saddles up to us and starts a conversation. We'd been chatting with the bartender for a while and how he's coming with new drinks and that one of the spirits' websites had featured his recipes. Next thing I know the drunk guy is all over my friend and Im having a good laugh. He tells us he's going to buy us drinks and whips out the American Express Centurion card. Yes the titanium black card. He buys our drinks and tips the bartender $. He then proceeds to tell us about how his argument with his wife is totally a buzzkill and that he's at the bar to ""beat her downer"". After his last drink, he stumbles around, and one of the staff basically have to lead him back to his room from the elevator. Crazy patrons, good drinks, and good times. Elegant Spot for a Quality Cocktail!Had a crazy day at work?  Or a long day of shopping in the city?  Whether you're a tourist or a local, this is a fantastic spot for a cocktail after a long day, a quickie before a night out, or even a first date. The bar is as sophisticated and elegant as the hotel. Their Asian Inspired menu adds a twist to the classics. And, even if there's a crowd, it's quiet, so you can chat or relax by the fireplace. Ended up here one night when I was reunited with old friends and we really just weren't into all the loud bars in SF on a Saturday night, since all we wanted to do was just sit and catch up all night. It felt a little uncomfortable when we first went in, because first of all we were all very underdressed (I was showing my friends who were visiting from out of town all day. Naturally we were in comfortable clothes), and also because we were much younger than the overall crowd. The drinks were expensive, OF COURSE, but we got settled in the comfortable couches with the YUMMY cocktail (lavender gin fizz!) and bubbles and we started feeling good. We ended up staying there til they closed, and I really couldn't have asked for a more comfortable, chill night. One minus star because of its obvious flaw, the price. But thanks to the price they are able to keep out loud and obnoxious bar crowd, which I really appreciated on that particular night with my old friends. Definitely will be going back when I need another night like that, or for a fancy little night in town. Comfy seating, decent service, and the availability of excellent appetizers (highlight: pork buns) makes this a great spot for an afterwork drink. It's a fairly brightly lit space which means: better for meetings than dates. It can get quite busy, but on a recent Friday happy hour visit we were able to find seating quickly. . . of course all bets are off when a big conference is in town!"|3|93|1|Routine Inspection| Improper reheating of food
St. Regis Hotel Lobby Bar 1|4.0|Bars in San Francisco, CA|Pricey|113|1|4.6| I have liked this bar since the first time I came to San Francisco likely because it doesn't feel like you are in a small town in this bar. I am questioning now though if its really that great a place to come on such a regular basis, first of it is kind of in the middle of the driveway and lobby, there is no view to speak of and it feel a little like the walkway to Ame too. Also Clase Azul Reposado Tequila is priced the highest in San Francisco as far as I am aware and they resent increase the price a little too. It's also irritating that pointing out to a bartender their exceptionally steep price on said tequila, he replied that that's something he is proud off. Such a stupid thing to say it makes you want to ditch both him and the bar. I also had a taste of a very bad cocktail here recently that tasted nothing but water made from cucumbers, to the same bartenders credit, he did replace it with something better, they shouldn't have bad things like that on the menu though. Came back for their drinks! Earlier than expected, but good nevertheless. My colleague and I came here after Jersey Boys Wednesday night and sat from around  pm  : am. Even though it was late, there were still quite a bit of a crowd, but not loud obnoxious people  more of the classy type at the venue. I liked my drink quite a bit. It's called Bummer & Lazarus. Give it a try :)Our two drinks with tip came up to $. I absolutely love this bar. It's very chic and upscale; perfect to start out a night, or to just grab a few bites and cocktails with friends. The servers are sweet and the drinks are good. My recent cocktail was the gin and sparkling sake drink. Delicious!! They have good tequilas and champagne too. Also, those crunchy wasabi peas (bar bites) are addicting! Love this place Hotie Totie.  People who live near the roof pay  k a month to live here.  Hot cars and quality service out front. Stopped here twice during the holidays. One evening after dinner for dessert and coffee and another evening with a group of friends. Their dessert was pastry chef delicious. The coffee was so good that cream and sugar were unnecessary. The second visit I ordered a fortified wine I had never heard of or tasted before. The were out but she asked if she could substitute a  year old tawny port for the same price as the wine. Wow that was the smoothest port I have ever tasted! It was a generous pour and some of my friends tasted it and also loved it. Love the vibe/decor here. Love the heroic paintings. The waitstaff including the bartender were really nice, friendly and helpful.|3|94|2|Routine| Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils  [ date violation corrected: 7/1/2014 ] Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities  [ date violation corrected: 7/1/2014 ]
St. Regis Hotel Lobby Bar 2|4.0|Bars in San Francisco, CA|Pricey|113|2|4.0875|" The bar is beautiful, there is an open fancy gas fire that is probably  feet long. Comfy sofas and a nice view of all the comings and goings in the hotel. There is a menu of upscale cocktails and not being a sophisticate , the idea of a drink containing egg whites did not gel. We stayed an hour and had a combination of Chardonnays and Wheat beers, the service was a little slow . My wife wanted to look at the wine list and our server did not come back. When I had finished my beer she did return but she should have returned for her order. There was a bar menu and some of the items looked amazing but sadly we had already eaten. A very cool spot and well worth a visit. We were staying at the St. Regis and stopped by the Lobby Bar for some quick bites before an event.  While I didn't stay long, I still had a good experience here. Tried:  Bloody Mary  The only BM I've ever had that was clear and not red.  still tasted the part.  served in a martini glass. was good but not a favorite of mineFried Oyster sliders  fried just right.  I would order these againPulled pork bun  pretty tasty.  no complaintsFries  Just right.  Great fries!Service:  great service.  very attentive here Came here after the extraordinary game last night. Still elated from a once in a lifetime experience at AT&T park. . . Giants winning the National League Championship at game . . .  Didn't even let the Cards score,   unbelievable! We were soaking wet because we wanted to wait till Marco got his MVP award.  I happily agreed to dry off and celebrate our monumental victory against the Cardinals. Well since we were drinking Blue Moon at the stadium, he knew that a classy place to have a glass of wine to celebrate would undoubtedly place a huge smile on my face. Oh how he knows me so well when it comes to wine and dining. The wine was as phenomenal as how I was feeling:  the Giants are in the World Series and I'm in the city and not in Dallas surrounded by Ranger fans!Ok I admit I don't remember the name of the wine, but it was definitely a Petit Syrah blend from France. The ambiance was pretty chill, but soon started to fill up. I've always loved this bar. Last night will definitely be memorable! Go Giants! Expensive but drinks are pretty good. Impressive hotel with cool/intimidating murals. Classy ambiance, busy location  home of the original bloody mary! quite the variety of choices for BMs  I chose one that was herbacious and it was that to a T. I liked the italianish one too but I forget what it's called. good place to kick off a day of wandering around San Francisco The bar menu comes from Ame so it's good stuff with an Asian influence like the tempura poke roll with seaweed and green onions. The tuna and seaweed from the roll sang with umami. Although it didn't have a traditional fluffy tempura coating, it's hard not to like something that's been deep fried to go with cocktails. For those who complain about the two bar snacks, at least they have bar snacks which are vanishing like water in the desert from the bar scene. Of the eight bars I visited on my SF vacation, this was the only place that had bar snacks. The drink menu is designed to impress with some pours costing $+. That's way out of my budget, so I stick with the fanciful $ cocktails like the Black Ships, Momotaro's Song, Gilded Vice, and Old Man and the Sea. The list periodically changes because the Ame Tremor and Berry Crush from my first visit here are no longer on the menu. The cocktails are consistently too tight and restrained for my style. I prefer drinks that are more open bodied and full. Both times I've been here, there are plenty of customers (including celebrities), but it's never hard to get a couch. I wished i could camp here at the bar all night to enjoy the motion sensor fireplace and sipping champagne. This is my favorite place to hang out after hours for drinks and to catch up with friends.   I love the appetizers, my favorite is the sushi. The cocktails are fantastics!  I have dined at Ame Restaurant several times, both lunch and dinners.  Overall, this place is great. happy eating. Love this place! Very pricey. . . $ for a tiny cocktail. . . But worth every penny! Love Sin Number Six. . Yum! I love this place. When you want to get all dolled up and have a fancy cocktial in a beautiful setting, this is the place to go. The bartenders are nice (not pretentious), the drinks and wine are good (yes pricey), but to be honest I think a bottle of Anchor Steam is the same price here as it is in the rest of the city. If you like the St. Regis bar, then you'd also like the Pied Piper too (located in the Palace Hotel). This place is so well done with a touch of minimalist and then over the top rococo style red painting.  They give you free snacks and the place is super loungy.  Bonus, they have a fireplace that is sensitive to any stupid person or drunk person that tries to burn their hand off or something as the whole thing shuts down. .  Marvelous.  I can't wait to stay here sometime like all the stars. When I finally leave San Francisco, if I ever leave San Francisco, I'm going to send to my best friend Eddie an invoice for the difference in price between cocktails at the St. Regis (~$) and at, say, a regular haute/hip bar ($, let's call it), x the # of drinks I've had at the St. Regis (ah, like  at this point? ?). Because if it weren't for him calling me one night during his Brief Sojourn in San Francisco Without His Wife (who was the advance party for their move to Lansing, MI (med school for her, otherwise, yeah, why would anyone ever?)) but like I was saying if it weren't for him calling me one night to squawk in my ear some variant of, DUDE! You HAVE to come down here!, I never would've considered myself near liquid enough to, you know, go to the hotel lobby of a St. Regis for drinks with any regularity, if by ""regularity"" I can be understood to mean, ""ever. ""But he did, and I went, and now I'm several hundred dollars (further) in the red (than I otherwise might be). Oh I know what you're thinking: What, your correspondent has no self control? But you need to understand: it's so beautiful here. Everything from the furniture (high end hotel quality, sleek and low and as minimalist as you can get while still having cushions) to the light fixtures to the bar (which I'm remembering now as marble, but don't quote me on it, I rarely sidle up to the actual bar) to the laser safetied fire feature to the murals (yes, those murals; I've spent a goodly amount of time staring at these things, have gone back and forth on it and am decided, and will debate any of you on this) it's all so gorgeous, you see, and every few months or so I get a yen, an actual physical longing, to head back. As for other aspects of the ambience, I'll put it to you this way: It never gets too loud, and the service has always been impeccable (the latter being what you expect, and pay for, at places like the St. Regis, the former being very important to me because who ever turns to their companion while sitting in a bar and says, You know, it could be *louder* here? No one, that's who). Oh I suppose you want to know about the cocktails and victuals themselves. Well, I'm here to tell you that they're delicious well crafted, interesting (though they have jumped a shark or two), and composed of top shelf booze (ie, good shit). And that's what I'd say about the food, too: usually quite lovely with the occasional downer, well crafted and made with good ingredients. Lastly, for some years back then there was a waitress who was literally an angel, that's what Eddie and I called her, it seemed like she was always the one to wait on us and she had these bright soft eyes and olive skin and I saw her once on the street in a sundress in SOMA (it was one of the  hot days in San Francisco between  ), she was smiling and walking towards me, and my life for several glorious paces became like a music video, everything behind her got blurry and watery and there was just her walking down the street, brighter than the sunlight. Well, she's gone now I think, I haven't seen her in a year or more. I always kind of wanted to say something, make a move, but then felt like such an impostor. Me, a paralegal, a failed writer, sipping my $ cocktails in the St. Regis lobby. What would happen if she saw my Wizard's knobby knees? ps: Dear St. Regis, Wanna know why you're getting  stars instead of ? It's because you're chintzing on your snacks. You used to offer wasabi peas and hickory smoked almonds and a cute little melange of rice cracker thingies, and now the almonds are gone and the peas are gone and in their stead you're offering these like high end cheese doodles and some other garbage. Hey! You're the fuckin St. Regis Hotel for god's sake! You may think you're serving me nourishment with my, ah, $/ cocktail(s) ok, cocktails but really all you're doing is putting in front of me three little trays of evidence that some pencil necked and pushing twerp back at the Regional Office found some way to boost the San Francisco hotel's bottom line by . %. Fucker. Stop being so fucking cheap. You're the, ah, I believe I mentioned, St. Fucking Regis your entire existence is predicated on the practice of needlessly spending money. Cut the shit and bring back a) the peas, and b) the almonds. You're plutocrats, all your hotel guests are plutocrats, and most of your hotel bar customers are plutocrats (with the remainder being, like your correspondent, pretenders to a plutocrat throne). Don't you know it's degrading for plutocrats to eat cheese doodles, no matter how haute? It is fun to stop by for a cocktail.  Their food used to be delicious and is now ho hum.  It is nice to have a relaxing place that is not a dark typical  bar. Way over priced. I will only come back if it is on a company account. The Lobby Bar is a great place to get a good, strong cocktail. . . . just be prepared to spend some $. It is a very beautiful space and the bartenders are great. . . I have tried some of the appetizers and they are pretty good. . . nothing spectacular, but good. Come for the hospitality and ambiance, but make sure to bring your wallet! When I travel to the city I stay at the St. Regis and the lobby bar is a great place to start the night. The ambiance is relaxed with comfortable couches and plenty of bar seating. The bar does get crowded as the nine to fiver crowd rolls in so if you include yourself in that group either sneak out of the office early or prepare to stand all night. The service is attentive and there is a good selection of drinks, my friend had a citrus blossom martini (Svedka Clementine Vodka, Orange Juice, Lemon Juice, Grapefruit Juice, Simple Syrup, Topped with Champagne) which she said was very good. I am a scotch drinker myself and they do have a good selection. I'm not sure about the appetizers because every time I've come here its to have a pre dinner drink. Drinks are a bit pricey however, its whats to be expected from a hotel lobby bar so don't be shocked when you look at your check. This is an elegant looking bar. As hotel lobby bar goes this does a pretty good job of looking stylish without being too modern and cliched. The main problem here is that after work hours it becomes an absolute zoo. I suppose its great if you like that sort of thing but if you want to enjoy a quiet drink in an elegant space you should only go during off hours. Decent.   A little spendy, but I hope you are expecting that before you go there. Blasphemy, I know, right?  Before you start hurling refuse at me, gentle Yelper, read on:I was here Saturday night, and requested the Navarro Vineyards Gewurztraminer Spritzer, neat. . . you know, just a glass of grape juice in a wine glass.   The bar snackage was stale and can all be purchased at Cost Plus: rice cracker crescents jacked with chili (skipped that), an abomination that masqueraded as gougeres, and freaky faux edamame puffs.  The cocktail attendant (is that sufficiently gender neutral and politically correct?) plopped a glass  me with a glass of Pinot Noir in front of me.  *Scooby Doo Sound*Cocktail Attendant went Kaizer Soze on me, and so I tried to make eye contact with the bartender at my :.  No dice.  I even swiveled my body, and turned my eyes on to Laser Beam Intensity Setting, which the Cadet will tell you is not at all subtle. *Crickets*  Finally, I picked up my glass, and walked up to the bar.  ""Hi.  This isn't what I ordered  I ordered the Gewurztraminer. ""CA:  ""Yes it is. ""KD:  ""No. . . it's not.  It's the wrong color.  This is the Pinot Noir. ""CA:  ""That's what you ordered.  The grape juice. ""KD:  ""I know what I ordered.  The Pinot was not listed on the nonalcoholic drink menu, ergo I could not have ordered it. ""CA:  ""I will be happy to show you the bottle that the bartender poured it from. KD:  *exasperated eye roll of disbelief*CA:  ""See?""  *presenting Navarro bottle of PINOT NOIR*KD:  ""LOOK.  Pinot Noir.  The drink menu says Gewurztraminer. ""CA:  ""I'll talk to my Manager. ""A couple sat down across from me.  The gentleman turned to his companion and said, ""Somebody puked in the bathroom sink. ""I don't mumble.  Chardonnay. . . Cabernet, I can understand the mix up.  But since when do you ever argue with a patron?  For the life of me, I cannot understand why the bartender kept his head down during the entire time I was trying to get my drink transgression resolved.  The Manager appeared and explained:  Apparently, they'd run out of the Gewurztraminer, so they took the extreme liberty of substituting the Pinot Noir without advising me, figuring grape juice = grape juice.  How insulting.  Rightly, they didn't charge me for the drink. And like that. . . I was gone. This is my sis's token ""let's meet up for cocktails"" before dinner go to spot. Thus, I'm spoiled. S. O. and I waited for the sis to arrive. . . we managed to get a couch and that's surprising for a Saturday night. Service is prompt and friendly. . . I ordered two sidecars for the sis and I and the S. O. just had a Stella. They give you almonds. . . Asian crackers and deep fried edamame while sipping on your drink. Our sidecar wasn't good BUT they do have Hanger One so they're awesome in my book! We'll be back for sure! The one thing I want from a lobby bar is amazing drinks, good finger foods and efficient service, all of which the St. Regis provides. I'm sure it can turn into a scene at some times, but I found it pleasantly adult and subdued. The St Regis Hotel Lobby Bar epitomizes what a posh hotel lobby bar should be. Large comfy couches, excellent prepared drinks and impeccable service. It's pricy, but the drinks are fantastic. Extensive menu of martinis and custom cocktails. Their rendition of a Hot Toddy was really tasty. It's a quiet and relaxing place for an afternoon or pre dinner drink. This place is pricey but fabulous. The ambiance is definitely swanky  it's St. Regis. You couldn't have it any other way. It's more of a place to meet up with a friend(s) after work and have a conversation  you actually can hear each other. I wouldn't come here as a place to lounge and chill. The crowd is much older and business minded. They do offer wasabi beans, which is addictive. Do plan on dropping some $. I'll definitely come back as a meeting spot if I'm in SOMA. The drinks here are really good. The bartenders know their stuff and will suggest or make you a custom drink if you're not sure what you want. Also the fireplace thingie is awesome. So swanky. Better place to have a conversation than the W next door, but not as lounge friendly where you could hang out for a while and relax. The W's livingroom definitely takes the cake in that regard. we came here for a prewedding party and it was pretty chill on a friday night.  it was mostly just us with a few other groups here and there.  we did notice a few women who could pass as prostitutes but we werent sure. the setting was pretty nice.  chairs, lights, its right off the lobbyi ordered a drink off their cocktail menu called sweet heat.  its a tequila drink with chili.  and it was gross.  please get a better mixologist! Swank, fabulous, and pricey! . . . . Been here a few times for drinks with friends. Recently came back for a coworker get together/ holiday drink time party! You cannot reserve any of the sofas or chairs so plan to get here early if you have a big group. My coworker and I arrived at pm during the week and lobby bar was not packed at all. We were able to secure a long sofa and about   chairs over the course of our time there. As soon as we were seated our server came over to greet us and bring us those delicious snacks. Oh and they just don't get you paper napkins here  you get nice black CLOTH napkins. . . yes so high class. Anyways they have a pretty good speciality cocktail list (I love the kaffir lime martini) and my coworkers enjoyed some of the other drinks that they offered. Our server was very good and came by often to check on us. We also ordered food off their bar menu. Menu changes at I think pm for diff small snacks. We had fries (OMG so good must order!), strip steak to share, sushi rolls, lobster pasta. . all of it was GOOD! All in all our group was happy and full! Service, food and drinks were EXCELLENT. Definitely a place for drinks and some bites! Wow ! I felt so lux and fabulous when I was here for drinks. Try to get to sit at the sofas with tables. Ambiance was super romantic, yet fun for groups to get together. yes the bar snacks, wasabi peas! I would definitely dress up a little more than casual here, just so you can feel little more special!that night I could definitely smell the folks loading up on whiskey! Love this place.  Wasabi peas rock.  Meet here for business after hours or pre Metreon libation. Beautiful bar with an excellent wine list. Willie Brown is a regular. This is one of those bars where you get a great mix of business travelers and locals. Pricey, but worth it. Tall ceilings, chic decor and zero character. I've been in a handful of times for cocktails, most recently on a Sunday afternoon for a ladies book club. On a warm sunny afternoon, it was perfect and quite with plenty of room for us to choose a corner to cocktail and chat. But otherwise, cocktails are pricey (granted, to be expected at the St. Regis) and somehow even the wasabi peas seemed bland (+ for free bar snacks, though). Our server seemed generally confused and was unable to come up with even a remotely relevant answer for questions on the wine list and just seemed blank (but at least they didn't stare us down for occupying a corner for two hours). In any case, neither the staff nor the setting have any warmth behind them and it's certainly not on my list of must go places. There are bar snacks. . . then there are the snacks from St. Regis. Seriously, their complimentary bites have to be the best of it's kind I've ever had in my life. Between the roasted almonds, wasabi peas and these little baked critters that tasted like gourmet Cheez Its, I could have dined on their goods for hours! If I were a little more intoxicated, I could have definitely seen myself smuggling baked crackers in my pockets for consumption during my cab ride home. They've got some pretty great drinks to boot. SF is full of fancy pants cocktail bars, and they're no different. Muddled this, fresh picked that. You probably get the idea. It's also a pretty nice hang in the middle of SOMA. No nonsense and tons of room to lounge around. Had drinks here over the fourth late afternoon/early evening.  Had a round of drinks and full bar menu (upto and including a $ kobe skirt steak that was awesome) and got out for around a hundo.  Service was impeccable far superior to any service I receive in the greater southern california area.  Wouldn't come here at night/during a busy time  but july fourth weekend it was really chill and classy. Sexy ambiance. . delicious bar snacks. . . excellent flight of single malt Scotch. . hands down my fav hotel bar in the city. . . Wow. . I can't believe this place got such high ratings. Yes, the decor is nice, in that it's got a line of fire here and there which, don't get me wrong, is very cool, but I think a distinction between decor and ambiance is in order here. I say that because, while the decor is nice, the ambiance is a bore. ) Because this place is in the lobby of a hotel it's very well lit. Two things that should never mix are alcohol and bright lighting. And ) also because it's part of the hotel, there's a good number of middle aged people waddling around. Again, middle age and alcohol. . two things that should never mix at a bar. So, empty, this place is very nice because you can focus in on the decor, but the crowd and overall ambiance to this place make me. . . well. . want to hit the bottle. I had excellent service and excellent drinks, all paid for.  No real complaints here.  Willie Brown sat a couple stools down from us, so that was cool to see a real SF celebrity around.  So much better than some disgusting reality TV hack like in LA. This place is way too expensive for my homeless ass, and there's no way I'd come here on my own.  You'll find my ""going out"" taste more along the lines of a ""kiwi"" MD / in a paper bag on a porch someplace. Fortified wines are delicious AND make you feel classy. If you ask anyone that knows me to pick my favorite bar in town, there's no hesitation they would pick St. Regis right away. I love this place.  Proper cocktails, excellent service, awesome atmosphere, comfortable seats.  What else do you need when you're in the mood for a good drink?One question always haunts me about this place though. . . the murals? Really? I love the swanky feel of this bar when you walk in. The decor is polished and velvety with comfy couches and arm pillows. . . everything I love about getting a cocktail. If you're a little hot blooded like myself I don't recommend sitting right next to their high tech  fireplace (which is basically one long line of hot hot fire). I instantaneously felt as though I was in a sauna, and next time I'll head for the less crowded couches by the window. For my taste, every cocktail lounge should just exude sensuality with a low beautifully candle lit atmosphere. St. Regis totally got it right here. I also really love their complimentary toasted almonds, wasabi peas and other snacky bar finger foods. My cocktail, ""The Forbidden Fruit"" was strong and perfectly mixed with vodka, cinnamon, and a kind of apple puree totally amazing and not too sweet for my taste. .  starsIt was nice, it's the St. Regis after all. . . but hardly a fan.  Located in the lobby, it's very spacious with very high ceiling.  Large paintings on wall  quite interesting combination of Greek and modern.  Fireplace is cool, something I've seen from Candice Olsen's design and what I would like to have at home one day.  Unfortunately those seats were taken but we did get the window seats.  Very comfy chairs that are extra deep, lean back and you can take a relaxing nap.  To chat with hubby, we both need to lean forward a bit while sipping our drinks and nibbling on wasabi peas.  Of the three little wooden boxes of snacks, our favorite was definitely the wasabi peas.  The cheese crackers were not so good, definitely don't go well with the drinks.  Service was professional and friendly.  Like the better lounges, they bring the bottle of the wine you ordered and ask if you would like a taste before pouring. . . just as if you ordered a full bottle at a restaurant.  Hubby had the Forefathers Sauvignon Blanc ($) and I had the Yuzu Lemon Drop ($).  It's like a lemon drop but it wasn't great.  I know we are paying for the name and ambiance but an ok cocktail is that. . . there are better cocktails at better places. I'm still as enchanted with this bar as the first time that I set foot in here, but it isn't as often as the drinks are a little pricy and I've jumped up on the ""Saving $$"" Bandwagon.  However, recently after a friends birthday party, I came back for a drink with a fellow that I met at the party.  When my date moreorless realized that I had no intention of putting out that night or any night with him, he ditched me on the sofa.  Ladies, when they take their jackets to the bathroom, that's your indicator.  The dude isn't coming back.  I didn't really care,my main concern was that I didn't want to get stuck paying for the drink he ordered. Therefore I needed to relay to the bar staff that I had been ditched. .  Their gentlemanly behavior more than redeemed mankind in my book.  Hector took my hand and insisted that I have another drink at the bar.  It was me and a bunch of businessmen sipping Scotch, and I felt very self conscious about suddenly being alone.  But the bar staff was very friendly and I felt as if it were their last mission on earth to make me smile and end my evening with a bang.  To repay their kindness, I promised that I would return to the bar the following week.  And I will! I love cocktails. I love good looking men. If those come in large quantities, I'm probably having a very good night. If I show up to a bar, and there are attractive men in nice suits, chances are I'm not going to hate it. If I go to a bar, and there are attractive men in nice suits that want to buy me fancy drinks, I'm definitely not going to hate it. If you want to go to a place where you may run into the guys from American Psycho, or have a discussion about exchange markets over whiskey on the rocks, the St. Regis is a good spot. The entire crowd looked fantastic  it made me want to go max out my credit card on BCBG and Louboutin. For the ladies, they have a great, varied cocktail list, and the ones I tried were delicious. My favorite was this berry cocktail that was the equivalent of a berry mojito, and I probably drank one too many of them. The bartender was very attentive even when it got crowded, and the number  thing that I loved: THERE WAS ALWAYS AN OPEN SEAT! Maybe it was just luck, but I never had to stand if I didn't want to. That was major. If you're looking for dancing, or at least some hip grooves (wow that sounds like something an old woman would say), the bar at the W is a better spot because they have a DJ. But, if you're looking to start the night at a place a bit more intimate and quiet (and classy) the St. Regis is definitely a good place to hit up. The fireplace near the main door is very interesting. Trying to touch the flames would just cause it to go off by itself lol. . . I have been here quite a few times on different occasions. When they first opened, there weren't many people, so I liked the fact that it was relatively quiet and I could enjoy a nice quite evening chatting with my friends. Then now they seem like they are always busy and loaded with people on the weekends. Service has somewhat deteriorated. But you better dress somewhat nicely otherwise the waitress might not be too attentive though the bar tenders are always nice. It's also a great place to have desert as you can order desert from the menu till pm which comes from AME. Most of them are excellent. And so are the snack sized appetizers. I always order the Yuzu drop and the wine and sake list is also pretty extensive. OK. . . not the greatest.  gotta give  stars for the prices and the atmosphere.  I am a bit more of a cool little gem that is great for just mingling intimately and hanging without any sort of stuffy vibes. . . . so, this place was a bit too pretentious for me and way overpriced for my date (I actually felt bad that we got out of there with my date probably emptying his wallet completely for me). Company was all good had a holiday cocktail party with some of my friends. . . . but otherwise, I probably would not go back sorry St. Regis, Saint of all things overpriced. **I'm adding another star because I have been wanting to go to a plush bar lately and the first one I though of was St. Regis so obviously it made an impression. Two point five stars for the opulent decor and intriguing vibe. The drink prices however are ridiculous. Having read reviews here I was expecting some mind blowing cocktails, um no, mediocre at best. I don't mind shelling out for a GREAT drink but these were meh. Please, come over to my house and I will SHOW you how to make a Cosmo sir (or lady, I really didn't see the bartenders). So yeah I guess if your drink is very straight forward, or you need to impress someone, this place would suffice. I would take my LA cousin here. Like I said, its plush, and we all know how much Cait Z likes her plush and fancy ness. I would add another star for the wonderful company I was with but honestly, does the St. Regis have anything to do with that? No Luxury without pretension. That's totally the St. Regis. It's not trying to convenience you that it's better then that other place down the street, there are no snotty bouncers on power trips, and the bartenders are attentive and cute. The St. Regis Lobby Bar is totally comfortable being its tasteful, classy self. I had a great time here last night. You can enjoy conversation with the person you're with, instead of hollering over music that's too loud. I love the high ceilings, and the beautiful light fixtures above the bar (props to ashton c. for his great description of the interior). And while I expected that the St. Regis would be elegant, I did not expect them to serve absinthe! and who know that our local Hanger One distillery makes not just vodka but also absinthe?! We ordered it and in front of us the bartender set reservoir glasses, delicately slotted spoons with a sugar cube on each, and a classic 's fountain of ice water with two spouts. The bartender simultaneously opened the spouts so that water ran over the sugar cube and dissolved the sugar into the absinthe, creating the milky, iridescent cocktails of so much infamy. No green fairies last night though. A favorite spot, great for a date Here you can sit on a very comfortable sofa and have a server take your drink order. You will be served lovely little wasabi chickpeas and nibbles. The interior itself is the best part; the space large, well lit, with high ceilings and tight, clean design. The color palette is sublime and gorgeous  the materials and the textures, the way it's all put together warm and elegant. I think Virginia put it perfectly, ""sexy but chill"". Upscale but not pretentious. Comfortable and relaxed  a great place to sit over a nice drink in a nice space and have a nice chat with your lovely date. I'm in love with this place.  The perfect place to get a good drink, upscale yet chill atmosphere. I wish I lived in the St. Regis. Ask for Ali.  She'll hook you up. Now, for the record ""this part of the hotel is run by a contractor"". I have been staying at this hotel and conducting business here for the last two years. % of the time the lobby bar operation falls short on service  from the bar to the cocktail servers. THEY NEED A MANAGER ON THE FLOOR HERE. I don't know why this is the weak link at this property, but it is. Swanky, swanky Bar. . . . really cool, good people watching. Drinks good but pricey, love lounging in the comfortable seating! Great place to hang out after going to the Moscone center. Munchies are good. . . . try the wasabi peas, they are spicy, fries are good. Mm. . . . sexy but chill. Walk through the lobby and find inviting leather seating, glass coffee tables, a long strip of blue fire to warm you up on a typical cool San Francisco night, cool lounge music, and the kind of classy ambiance that can only be found at the St. Regis. What is there not to like about this place? Weak mojitos (my current poison), unfortunately. But my charming company of about  people (great place for groups) liked the various drinks they ordered, so it was probably just the mojitos with a problem. This is NOT a meat market like the W. The patrons were decidedly older and more sophisticated. I just ate it up! The best part of the St. Regis hotel lobby bar is the fire pit thingy right up front. We learned that if you put your hand in it, the flames jump down. I think this is to keep the douchebag clientele from seriously harming themselves after getting sauced on $  $ cocktails (really, now!). The second best part is that the staff here will just naturally assume you're a hotel guest and treat you like royalty: there is a lot of door opening and holding as well as offers to get drunk girls a cab AND carry their purses AND open the cab door  AND make sure you know where you're going. . . not that any of that happened to me. Drinks are pricey wine by the glass is in the $ $ range and cocktails are not cheap but that's why you should come here with someone who will buy your drinks for you. This will make for a much better experience. The seating is comfortable and cozy and the douches get drunk early and head up to their rooms, which makes relaxing and enjoying one's drinks much easier. And quieter. The bartenders are downright charming and good looking to boot. Plus, you get wasabi peas , almonds, and something else while you imbibe. I am wild about wasabi peas, so I'd probably go back just for those. And the fire game. Swell digs.  For some reason I am on the swanky hotel bar circuit.  I did quite enjoy this spot.  The seats along the wall, although very comfy, yet leave you sitting very far apart from your drink date.  But, great service!!  The snacks are the same as the The Four Seasons.  Coincidence?  Not sure, but wasabi peas are always appreciated.  Beware, that if there is a convention in town it is near impossible.  Great spot to have a drink before going to the museum, I shall be back! i really love the st. regis. its one of the most up scale places to be at in the city with out the feel that your being watched like a hawk because you dont fit in. the drinks are really exceptional, and all these people complaining about the prices, all i can say is what do you expect? its the ST. REGIS! some of the staff are very exceptional, and some just make you want to kill. its so hit or miss with a waitress in the sitting area. the bar has always been a great experience. all the bartenders are really friendly. i am having my birthday here in two days, and i hope that it will go smoothly. . . after all it will be me and  of my closest friends. i hope the saint is ready. . . .

The perfect place to go for an apres Sex and the City movie cocktail with your girlfriends. At first, we had designs on the W, but it was filled with Moscone Convention chumps, so we setled on the S. Regis, a much superior establishment indeed. At $, the cocktails may be hard on the wallet, but easy on the palate. . . an infusion of ginger beer, cointreau, and vodka go smoothly down the hatch and worth every drop.  Waitresses are very attentive and male eye candy easy on the eyes.

Willie Brown, Sean Penn, and Kirsten Dunst have met me. I must either be going to all the right places at the right time, or I'm just that fabulous. Actually, I'm both. This place is a great spot to stop by and have your first drink. . . or drinks to start off your night. Then head over to XYZ, Roe, Fluid, B Bar or. . . all of the above. Just make sure you're dressed to super impress and invite me. Was late meeting a friend at the hotel's bar thanks to the city's poor cab situation. Grr! My phone was buzzing with text messages. TXT: Chopchop, nt cool enough to hang alone. REPLY: Tad late. Mk friends. TXT: Mthrf*#@!!A first look at the bar may intimidate the introvert, but it can also be one of the more sophisticated and friendly hotel bars in the city. My friend was kept supplied with Martinis and conversation thanks to amiable, jovial, aim to please bartenders. Afterward we made some inquiries as to how far our restaurant was from the hotel. Instead of giving us directions we were ushered to a courtesy car, having us arrive at dinner in a BENTLEY. Some company car. We soaked up every minute of our chauffeured Grey Poupon moment. The experience turned my mild mannered friend into insta pimp, who upon exiting the car repeated his new mantra, ""Cause that's how Daddy rolls. "" The bar is representative of the classy, Rock Star service one can expect from the St. Regis! I can't possibly give the St. Regis Hotel Lobby Bar more than three stars because:. A passable Manhattan will cost you $.  before tip . The kitchen closes at : pm. The place is a bitch magnet (as are most swanky hotel bars)Otherwise, it's a pretty good time. There are a lot of couches and comfortable seats. The service was slow, at best, but my buddies and I passed the time with good discussion and excellent people watching from our table in the corner. If watching people who are trying to be seen is your thing (and let's face it, everyone likes to do that once in a while),  then the St. Regis Hotel Lobby Bar is definitely worth a visit. One of my favorite places to grab a drink with friends. Swank. Check. Good drinks. Check. Great people watching. Check. Damn good wasabi peas. Check. This is a great place for happy hour or any hour. One of the benefits of working for Yelp is that many of my co workers and I are on an undying quest to always try new places. Luckily for me, everything in this city is fairly new, so every time we hop to a new place, it's a fun reason for me to excited because I then have a new place to report on. The St. Regis Lobby Bar is a fave of my buddy Nish N's. We've come here for meetings, for sad news, for a happy drink, a post work drink and even just to shoot the shit and eat wasabi peas. The looks of this place is nice. I wouldn't say it's the warmest or coziest of hotel bars, but really, what hotel bar has a homey feel? What it is, is a nice place to catch a glimpse of some business folks using their expense accounts and of course, a guaranteed place to see San Francisco Willie Brown at the same seat at the end of the bar laughing it up. Good stuff. If you're looking to impress someone, you could do a lot worse than the bar at the St. Regis. It's very hip and ultra professional, and the atmosphere and decor fit in nicely with the lobby of the hotel. Plus, I like the Wasabi peas they have spread out on the tables and at the bar. However, if you do hit up the St. Regis, be sure to bring some plastic. Drinks here ARE NOT CHEAP. I had two rounds with a friend recently that set me back nearly $. Oh, and the bar tenders aren't the fastest or the friendliest of sorts. But considering this is a swanky hotel bar, the staff is fine. It's an older crowd, which means you won't have to put up with the riff raff that plagues other spots in the area. And every time I go there, I usually spot a celeb or two (Willie Brown, Downtown Julie Brown, etc. ). . . Okay, maybe not an A lister, but you get the point. . . Two stars for a lovely classy locale snazzy little hotel lobby bar in SOMA 'hood. If the swanky couches and decor don't make you feel classy, the $ martini will. I had a jack and coke here (a bargain at $) and it wasn't just the service that was weak. Sadly you'd need several such drinks to really start making a dent, so you'd be best off just stopping here on a special occasion for a single drink to soak up the ambiance before moving on. Ah, the Reeg where to begin? I love hotel bars, but I generally don't frequent them because of the pricey ness factor. But, when Vino Venue was shut down due to the faceless corporate asshats who refused to pay the lease for eight months (**SOBS**), one of my favorite ""bartenders"" from there got a job at the St. Regis Lobby Bar, so I had to check it out. In doing so, I met two of the most fabulous bartenders on the face of the earth Darius & Rafael. (I have since met Brian, who is also great. ) These guys KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING, and it doesn't hurt that they are just wonderful and fun to be around. Half the time, I just let them make me whatever they feel like, because they can make some tasty ass shit that is not on the drink menu. What else should you know? Oh yes. . . the ladies of the evening. The SFPD has actually distributed a photocopy containing various photos of several known high class sex workers who have been photographed working the area, including The Reeg and the XYZ bar. That was an amusing thing to see. Also, as has been mentioned, the drinks are absurdly expensive. I give the place specifically the bartenders five stars, but the bar manager just raised the prices of the specialty drinks from $ to $. Really? Was that really necessary? Bothersome.   star for that. The crowd is on the older side, but even though I'm in my late s, I like it. This is one of the only places in the city where someone has offered to pay for my drinks, which is just nice every once in a while. This place is not really a hotel bar. It's more of a lobby where you can get drinks. I took a seat on one of the couches that was weirdly located back to back with another couch. Overheard:Older put together lady: I mean, she sits on her ashh and gets, *hic*and gets $K a year just because, just because she's married to you. I mean, I work *ice clinking*, . . . . I work my ass off at your*hic*goddamn office for $K and what do I get? Nuffing. *hic* Nothing. Older married CEO type: Why must it always end up here between us?*heavy sigh**large gulp**sound of eyes rolling*Boyfriend: Jesus Christ! Heineken's here ar. . . . .

EVAR. Oh, and by the way, Heineken's there are $.  star. Ahh the St. Regis Lobby Bar. What can I say, I love hotel bars! Tasteful and classy atmosphere where I can sip on a cocktail and carry on a conversation with someone. I've come here over a dozen times with friends and even spent one New Year's Eve here. But definitely an older and more sophisticated crowd frequents this chic place. I think that's the reason I like it. If you're looking for a younger late 's, early 's crowd. . . . head down the block to XYZ at the W Hotel. Now this is a great place to have a convo. without the crazy YELLING. Yes, YELING that is NOT a CONVO. It is a SCREAMING match at some spots that really kills it for any erotic possibilities. Get my vibe?It is an older crowd, but hey, they have the moolah and are the ones that KNOW how to appreciate quality and gotta respect that in my own groove. . . oh, yeah. . . . BEWARE of those women that look like ""Pros"" and I am not talking ""Prozac, pills for older men's libido"", but hey. . . . was I just imagining it. . . I don't know, but they sure were suspicious. Yuck. . . or whatevah. . . I don't live like them. I pay with my own  American Express. / for the guys who work here. Definitely has that swanky modern euro hotel bar vibe, complete with the blazers, $ jeans, and ridiculously priced alcohol. $ for  vodkas?? Seriously?? I've been here a few times and every experience has been fabulous.  Now that I've read Ari G's review, I'll have to look out for the people he flagged!  I never really noticed. The Sweet Heat is my favorite drink.  The last time we were there, they informed us that they had no basil.  We decided to try it without and it was amazing tequila, lime juice, hot chili pepper . . . what else can you want?The food is pricey but also really good.  I've shared some appetizers with friends and they were all excellent.   It's fun to just hang out at the bar and enjoy the crowd.  I did notice last time we were there on a Friday night that it gets super busy so coming early is key.  When we got up to leave, this woman just walked into me to grab the table.  She seemed very determined and her manners were a bit questionable! This place is relatively new and continues to evolve.  It reminds me of the XYZ lounge back in the day where pretentious folks go to by overpriced drinks and mingle with fellow jet setters. The ambiance is comforting and the service is great.    I wish the drinks were more affordable. I live right across the street from ""the Reej"" and like to pop into the lobby bar from time to time.  It's very sleek and they have a great selection of booze.  As you should expect, the drinks come with a price and the crowd can be interesting, at times.  When I'm here, I like to play a couple entertaining people watching games with my friends:.  ""Spot the high class hooker""  They are easy to spot when they get dropped off adjacent to the valet area in a black SL Mercedes ($K+. . . P. I. M. P. !).  You get bonus points if you make the spot post entry.  Tip: professionals get the ""nod"" instead of a verbal greeting from hotel/bar staff. . . it's pretty funny because THEY ALL KNOW.  .  ""Check out that miserable couple""  Bro, I know that spending $/night for a ""romantic weekend in the city"" sounds like a great way to salvage your relationship but you should just tie Old Yeller to a tree and spend that money on yourself.  Because when the two of you are crammed into one of those love seats, not talking or making eye contact, it makes the rest of us sad.  But like a car crash, we all have to watch. The Reej does boast a cool ""indoor fire"" and occasional b list celeb sightings so it does round out the experience  as a  star hotel, you would expect nothing less. . . . . After not getting into our first choice for New Year's, we decided to stop by the bar in the St. Regis. We found a place to sit for our party of five and they provided some party favors. The decor was very sleek and modern but still had an inviting vibe to it. I would definitely stop by there again for a drink. Meeting a friend for a late evening drink at the XYZ bar just proved to me once again that I am too old for that crowd and the noise and the trademark repetitive W  music.  We hustled over to the much more sedate Ame bar at the St. Regis and it was a breath of fresh air.  So serene but not boring  just so much more elegant.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed the beautiful surroundings and the crowd of friendly well dressed tourists and locals.  The bartender was friendly and welcoming.  Lately I have experienced a happy rash of bartenders at the nicer places all too willing to provide tastes of the various wines on offer until I'm satisfied with my choice.  The St. Regis bar was no different.  You do pay handsomely  $ for a Sancerre  but it is so nice to feel well taken care of.  A really nice spot for a friendly drink and some excellent bar snacks.  The experience was so nice I forgot I wasn't actually having a glass of wine at a friends place, and at the end of the evening got up to leave without paying.  I was quickly and amiably reminded of my oversight and paid the bill before Security arrived. This place has some amazing fries! Four stars for that alone.  Aside from the potatoes, the bar is nicely decorated and the drink menu is pretty strong. classy but not pretentious. the bartenders i mean, not so much the clientele. i go here quite a bit. don't sit at a table if you can help it, stick to the bar. the bartenders are rad. drink selection awesome. sometimes you end up meeting people that you thought were random but end up knowing who they are and it's a relief when someone you admire is cool. if you come in with attitude later in the night, chances are you're going to get some kind of attitude back. the bartenders aren't uppity so they could care less what you're wearing. but they're social observers and they can smell it if you're worried about if you're classy enough for the place. just be yourself, not a jerk, and everything will be cool. bring some $$ though cause it aint cheap. The St. Regis Hotel Lobby Bar is my favorite place to meet people for drinks downtown. Swanky but unpretentious for the most part and the free bar snacks are delicious. You can hear people talk which is a nice change from the usual shouting match you have to engage in at most bars. It's definitely a place to go with friends for a nice evening drink after work, though I get the sense that if you were looking for some action (I'm not) it wouldn't be too hard to find. $ for an average martini. Sure its a hotel bar, but give me a break. I love this bar. Sure, my martini costs $ here, but it comes with three perfectly skewered pieces of cucumber, a cloth napkin, and little munchies. But the best part is that is such a nice relaxing place to have a nice quiet drink and chat anytime. Even on a Friday night. Even after PM. I made the mistake of going north of Market last Friday, thinking of the bars as I imagined them on a Saturday or Wednesday evening. The problem is that on a Friday, they all turn into loud, crazy places. And the quiet places close early. So I ended up back at St. Regis where they served until about , and since it is a hotel lobby, let you stay as long as you want. I ended up curled up next to the fireplace well past two without any dirty looks. I had to really put on my thinking cap when it came to assessing an overall rating here. The ambiance is easily five stars. It's beautifully appointed and conducive to conversation at one of the intimate tables in their staged, luxe living room. The specialty drinks were amazing. I had a Hiro tini  a very dry spicy ginger/cooling cucumber combo, while Robert P. enjoyed a sugary yuzu infused number. Interestingly, our cocktail choices were reflective of our personas, too, since he is young and sweet and optimistic, whereas I am bitter and old and kick a lot. The service just plain sucked after we placed our initial order, though. Our drink wench turned into Jimmy Hoffa on us, so we never had a chance to do a second round (which we would have), so that was a one star experience. It was also annoying that Robert kept doing a terrible Regis Philbin imitation  saying things like, ""Regis likes his martinis. "" Overall, I'll settle right in the middle because there is a lot of potential here and it is so freaking gawgeous."|3|92|2|Routine| Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities  [ date violation corrected: 6/3/2013 ] Employee eating or smoking  [ date violation corrected: 6/3/2013 ]

SOUPS Chicken Pho:  starsMy favourite chicken pho I've ever had, with perfect firm springy noodles, delicious broth and tender white chicken meat. Vegetarian Pho: .  starsThe same delightfully tensile noodles, with a healthier broth lacking the chicken salt from the chicken pho. Contains bakchoy, broccoli, bamboo, black mushrooms, cabbage, celery and I added tofu. Satay Beef Noodle Soup:  starsToday I was looking for a hearty soup because this winter has put an interminable chill in my bones that clear pho can't drive off, so I tried the Satay Beef Noodle Soup for the first time. . . New favorite dish!! It is so yummy and has all the fatty beef tendons and thin sliced lean meat you could want. Asparagus and Chicken Soup: .  starsAnother comforting dish for cold nights.  It's an egg drop soup with soft curds of yummy protein floating in the thick glazed soup. Chicken Curry Soup:  starsThe only one of their soups I didn't like.  The flavour is a little weird, maybe too much curry powder.  The best Vietnamese chicken curry soup I've had so far is at Sunrise Cafe (yelp. com/biz/sunrise caf…) on Bryant St. FOOD Beef with Eggplant:  starsChicken with Eggplant:  starsChicken with Double Mushroom:  starsSauce has a weird artificial flavour. Claypot rice dishes: .  starsDelicious and SO much food for what you're paying. Five Spice Chicken: .  starsBBQ Pork with Imperial Rolls Vermicelli: .  starsThe BBQ pork comes in thin strips reminiscent of bak kwa (Chinese BBQ pork jerky), but these imperial tolls are deep fried, crunchy and packed full of good flavour. Crab Rangoon:  starsAll the crab here is imitation crab. I was wondering for while about this little place. . . Every time I come from work. . . I had the BBQ pork disk on Saturday afternoon. It wasn't full , but there were some interesting people sitting in front of me. . I made a request for brown instead rice. White rice make u fat. . . I found the pork to be  very delicious, and they serve it with steam broccoli and slice of carrot. . I had to order extra pork"" Cuz I eat a lot"" I wish they add more pork instead of too much rice. . WOW! WHAT ARROGANCE! i have been a happy commercial customer/ diner here since  ( i own almost / of the adjacent block and it's properties), so i eat there a LOT! as do a bunch of my employees. . . . . . WELL, NO MORE! i just walked up there to get my usual dinner (sweet & sour chicken, as of late) and this waitress whom i have never seen before (genarally a very nice young man works the counter and takes my orders )  FLAT OUT DENIES ME SERVICE! FULL DISCLOSURE:  i had the ""audacity"" to try to pay for my meal ( a total of $. ) with a $ dollar bill, a $ dollar bill, and then (GASP)  quarters to cover the last  cents. . . . i almost always pay via CC, but just didn't feel like walking down the street to my car to grab my card, SO SUE ME! i assumed that paying the last $ dollor of my bill in change would be sufficient, seems reasonable, right?WRONG! i was immediately informed she could not take ""that"" with a TON of attitude as disgust, like this little waitress was so much above little old me. i was understandably VERY insulted, and made a scene, informed her i would make sure they loose the business  of ALL of my employees and tenants (people are usually very loyal to me and my company, which i founded here in SOMA in ' because, well,  i reward loyalty). . . I guess i'm just at a total loss on this one, i'm a pragmatist at heart, and this level of egotism and elitism will do nobody any good. SO TO SUM UP: good cheap food, but that much arrogance has the tendency to spill out all over the food. not to mention that combating that type of atmosphere isn't easy, and leads to indigestion. lol. Good, cheap chinese food is NOT rare in SOMA by any stretch of the imagination. So save yourself the unpleasantness and walk the extra  block to one of the  chinese joints on th st. , or even just step up to TU LAN!! FINALLY BACK OPEN ! WOO! HOO! best vietnamese food outside of the triangle!JEEZ, I SURE HOPE THE $ IN CHANGE WAS WORTH THE LOST BUSINESS. I JUST NOW STOPPED MY  BUSINESS PARTNERS FROM GRABBING A BITE THERE TONIGHT, AS WELL. so,  dinners lost already tonight alone, i hope it was worth it! Meh waayy too oily. I know Chinese food is oily but there was enough oil at the bottom of the box to bathe a person in it. I stumbled across this restaurant because it was so small that I almost missed it. As a result I got curious and went in for a visit. A couple of revisits later, I can say that I'm duly impressed. The restaurant itself is very small. The decoration is not exactly all that good. But the family cooks with the type of down home earnestness rarely found nowadays. The food is not Michelin Star worthy, of course. But their prices are absolutely excellent (most menu items are under $ FOR very generous portions), especially in comparison to some of the restaurants in Chinatown where the average dish is smaller but is priced at more than double, sometimes even quadruple the price of  Mission's dishes. The place is not in the best part of town for sure. But as another reviewer said, if you happen to be staying in the Best Western Carriage, Best Western Americana, and the Good Hotel, then this place is literally  steps away from you. The best Pho I have ever had in the city! I've been coming here for years and have never been disappointed. Great authentic food and great service. Love the BBQ beef, Pho, clay pot, and yellow curry. Yum! You definitely need to try this place. My favorite hole in the wall restaurant. Friends, I can't really review on much other than their quick service and their excellent claypot!  I'm not sure it worth trying anything else.  I always get the veggie one and ask that they keep it in the oven a little longer to make the rice nice and crispy on the bottom (maybe it's a Persian thing and if you are Persian or know a Persian, you'll know what I'm talking about).  It's usually busy, both at the restaurant and the phone going off  these are all good signs when there are so many choices in SF.  The only warning is, sometimes a really crazy person might walk in (rare but I go enough that it's happened twice since I've dined there).  They have never been rude or disrespectful to the person but try to handle it the best they can.  Usually they leave without weirdness and I appreciate that. Again, CLAYPOT. After  hours, no food delivered. Canceled order to get refund. Suddenly get call about how they're not too far away (restaurant is by this time, closed). On the phone, I Refuse to accept the food. Guy on phone is begging me to take it, even for free. I refuse again. Awful. Will never order from here again.  hours?  Really? I've been back many many times since my first review and this place is now my go to spot for quick, cheap, and tasty chinese/vietnamese food. The combination clay pot is delicious. Also, surprisingly the PHO is really good as well. I'm usually skeptical getting pho at a hybrid restaurant but this one definitely passes the test. This is a pretty good lunch spot. I love the spring roll. Sweet and sour pork. I noticed that the clay pots are very popular. Its a hole in a wall kind of restaurant, it gets pretty packed during lunch. The prices are very fair. And there are a lot of items on the menu to choose from. I love their combo claypot, a meal in one pot, crunchy, chewy, with lean Chinese sausage, a little of everything rice, chicken, chinese mushroom.  Once it arrives, do not mix, leave it alone.  Let the crispyness cook a bit longer.  Have an ice Vietnamese coffee and there you have it, my last meal on earth.  Unless, I also order the Pho with Satay Beef.  My stomach will be so full I probably can't move any way, so why try to move.  I'll get stuck in one of their booth and I need the ""jaw of life"" to cut me out.  Don't mind the service.  It's the thought that counts.  In this case, it's the food that counts. Agree with the other favorable reviews.  Gave them  stars b/c decent Chinese food in SOMA, that delivers, & for me was @min.  Very important when laid up with a cast & can't get around.  The pork chow fun was surprisingly good.  shrimp w/bok choy wasn't bad, @average.  & prices are just right. $.  for lunch special here. They offer a huge seletion on the lunch special menu, all of which look really good. They had either a tofu or eggplant lunch, but not a combo and had problem combing them to make one lunch when I asked. Really fresh food, loaded with MSG and tasty sauces. The Salt and Pepper Fish is not on the menu, but I was able to order it and it was just okay. The batter was too thick and it could have used more seasoning. It's the most authentic Chinese place in the SOMA area. The prices are extremely good too. I normally stick to the beef chow fun or claypot combo. Best dish: Claypot Combo Food: / starsAmbiance: Authentic Chinese (kinda dirty feeling)Price: /person Service: I like the people that work there, they're very friendly. The ownership changed hands a while back and the food, which was decent before, has gotten even better. I'm a big fan of chow fun and theirs is really good  they even asked me if I wanted it ""wet"" or ""dry"", which is rare outside of Chinatown. The service is friendly and fast, the food is not fancy, but filling and tasty."|4|81|6|Routine Inspection| Unclean hands or improper use of gloves Improper storage of equipment utensils or linens Wiping cloths not clean or properly stored or inadequate sanitizer Moderate risk food holding temperature Low risk vermin infestation Unclean nonfood contact surfaces
7 Mission Restaurant 2|3.5|Vietnamese in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|150|2|3.90909090909|" Most of the menu is under $ and I'm more than satisfied with what I get  portion and flavor. I can't complain about their service because they're quite polite to me and my husband. As well, they're quite reliable with Seamless orders. This is one of our favourite take out places. Although the food isn't outstanding, its decent, not too greasy, and a reliable delivery service. Russ, Jason, Kien, Zaw, and I went to this place for one thing, and one thing only  clay pot rice.  we were on a straight mission to find clay pot rice and thanks to yelp we found this place.  Fair warning to true clay pot rice aficionados  this is more like fried rice in a clay pot as opposed to genuine clay pot rice.  Although it's not % clay pot rice, I still liked it.  We paid $/pop for rice in a clay pot with your choice of toppings.  mine came with chinese sausage, chicken, and mushrooms.  Now in a normal chinese place, it would take up to   minutes for clay pot rice, so you can imagine my shock when it came out in  minutes! My theory is that they took rice, fried it, topped it, then put it in a clay pot and put it in the oven.  i can tell it was in the oven cause there was some rice sticking to the bottom of the clay pot and it was sizzling when it came out. My other clay pot mates said it was good, and cheap, but not legit. I would definitely go back.  not for tube steak though. just for the clay pot rice I walked right past this place for years for fear of what inexpensive food in the soma may or may not contain until a friend dragged me in and I had the pho (#) and was very impressed. The breaded chicken dishes I personally avoid but the pho is perfect. Only ordered delivery, so can't speak to the service or decor. The prices were cheap, like most Chinese restaurants. Hot and Sour Soup: A large serving, with the right amount of thickness, sour/spicy kick, crunchy vegetables like wood ear, and meat. Surpassed my (admittedly low) expectations. I just wish they hadn't filled it with scallions. I hiss at scallionsMongolian Beef Rice Plate: For the boyfriend. Disappointing. Way too many onions = way too much onion flavor. Inexplicably cooked in a sweet sauce reminiscent of ""orange chicken"" (*shudder*). The beef could have been more tenderSatay Beef Noodle Soup: For me. :) Noodle soups are my favorite food and satay is one of the best sauces ever invented. Satay beef noodle soup is not difficult to make, which is part of its appeal, as it never fails to satisfy me.  Mission's version had that delicious, spicy, savory satay broth I love so much and the beef was quite tender. It was also packaged well for take out Yeah okay, decent food at moderate prices. It lacks a little character in the dishes to really stand out. Seems like they are a little stuck between Chinese and Vietnamese. I wish they'd show a little more creativity and dedication to the dishes. Mostly great because it is rather on the cheaper side, takes credit cards, and (at least for me) in a convenient location. No big fail, yet rather a place to grab a cheap lunch. Staff is sometimes a little overwhelmed when it gets crowded here but always friendly. Free tea is definitely a plus. Just checked the latest health score inspection result:   not that great. I find it a little sneaky that I have never seen the actual score hanging in the restaurant anywhere. Hope they improve again. Its been  years and dozens of orders later and I actually have grown to like this place. Its fast, convenient, friendly service. The food has gotten much better and the portions are large enough to save half for later. If you work in the area and want fast asian food then this is a great place to check out! I was a little skeptical coming here, but the second you walk inside it smells wonderful. They have some of the best pho I've had  the broth is amazing, the noodles are great, and the meat is delicous. Would come here again. This place gets my vote. Pho is excellent! And food makes your tummy say Mm. The staff are very nice. Note: Don't go here with picky eaters. Get what's on the menu. Don't ask to make substitutions, just eat the delicious meal prepared for you. I've eaten here a few times as it's pretty close to work and lunch spots in this part of SOMA are far and few.  I can't tell if the resto is more Chinese or Vietnamese as they serve both but their food is decent. So far, I've had their Won Ton Soup w/Noodles, which was good but it didn't have pieces of chicken or pork like others spots serve it up but, it fixed my craving, not sure I'd order it again though.  I've also had their Salt & Pepper Pork Chop Rice plate.  For some reason at the time, it was served to me warm, borderline cold but the steamed rice was piping hot.  There was a good, lunch sized portion of pork chop, which was tasty, could've used a little more pepper and jalapeno but, that's just me.  Their Mongolian Beef Rice plate was decent, my only complaint, which is common for most every Chinese resto I've been to is that they load it up with veggies, the red peppers, green peppers, green onions, onions and just a few pieces of beef.  By the time I was done, all those veggies were what was left on the plate. They serve you hot tea automatically but sometimes you have to ask for it.  I've ordered their Vietnamese Iced Coffee twice which was a nice treat to end my meal, not to mention, to keep me awake for the rest of the day. Service, just like the tea, is hit or miss, but overall has been friendly.  The resto itself is seriously a hole in the wall, it's not somewhere you'd go with a group or celebrate a special ocassion, it's seriously just to eat and run. Overall, it's not the greatest Chinese/Vietnamese food out there but, it's a nice spot if your craving rice in this neighborhood. Since my bf lives close to this restaurant, we go there for the sake of convenience whenever we don't have anything to eat. The food there is okay. It's a little bit oily for my taste. For dessert, three bean dessert has pretty strong coconut flavor to it. Like it has really really thick coconut milk."|4|63|8|Routine| Consumer advisory not provided for raw or undercooked foods  [ date violation corrected: 4/10/2013 ] High risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 3/25/2013 ] Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 3/25/2013 ] Inadequate food safety knowledge or lack of certified food safety manager  [ date violation corrected: 3/25/2013 ] Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 3/25/2013 ] Foods not protected from contamination  [ date violation corrected: 3/25/2013 ] Improper cooling methods  [ date violation corrected: 3/25/2013 ] High risk vermin infestation  [ date violation corrected: 3/25/2013 ]
7 Mission Restaurant 3|3.5|Vietnamese in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|150|3|3.41489361702|" Delicious Shrimp Salad Rolls with Peanut Sauce!  I liked that the chicken noodle soup came with a bunch of different ingredients you got to mix together yourself.  The chicken and broccoli over rice vermicelli was good but tasted like it had been sitting in a warmer for a while and could have been fresher.  Overall, I'll order take out from here again :D Maybe delivery is the wrong way to go here. Their Vietnamese sandwich was % the size of other sandwiches I'd seen, which would've been okay except for the fact that the bread was stale and soggy, and the pickled vegetables inside tasteless. Same as below. I get take outs here because it's convenient for work. Their customer service is really great and very ethical, unlike most such places. It's for that reason I give this place a  star. You can tell the owners are from southern China when the dumplings come out incredibly fried and oily. Obviously, this means you should not order the dumplings but go for their seasoned meat items and pho, which is the mainstay of much of southern Chinese cuisine. Their five flavor seasoned chicken is really good! But their other more Americanized Chinese cuisine errs on a greasy side. Overall, I would definitely come here for the convenience, efficiency, and when I'm ordering a classic southeast asian dish. Oh yeah, and it's more reasonably priced compared to other places nearby. Mediocre food. Convenient location. Decent price. .  for average chicken fried rice and complimentary tea.  Mellow atmosphere and a decent amount of customers.  I would come back here, but only if I didn't have any place else to go and was too lazy to cook. Not a destination, but definitely a stopping point. I've tried all sorts of stuff here because I live so close and I'm super lazy when it comes to cooking. Most of the items they have are average tasting and affordable so you really can't go wrong (compared to other Chinese takeout places where only a few dishes are acceptable and everything else is SO wrong). My favorites would probably be the beef pho or their combo fried rice. However, even as my favorites, they are still pretty average so don't expect the flavors to blow your pants off or anything. This place is a solid  stars but I'm upgrading my rating because they can feed me within  minutes of calling and I know that, no matter how adventurous I get with the menu, I will always be satisfied and full. I work right down the street and just discovered this place today. The food was fresh, not greasy at all. It seemed very healthy. They have pretty good vegetarian options which is awesome, but I guess they're known for their beef too. It was a small place, but kind of neat in it's own way. The prices are great, and their portions are filling. Awesome, probably my new go to for lunch. Best pho in the known universe. I was craving a vermicelli bbq pork + egg roll bowl. Everywhere else seemed to require cash or didn't deliver. They have a $ minimum for delivery so I had to tack on a couple extra items I didn't really want. So, ended up with the vermicelli bowl, vegetarian spring roll, potstickers and crab rangoon. Nothing was great, or really, even that good. Potstickers were overcooked / crispy instead of soft and doughy. Crab rangoon was disgusting and had almost no filling. Definitely not typical crab rangoon, not sure what the filling even consisted of. Spring rolls, also nothing to write home about. Feel like I wasted $+. I love this place! Staff is friendly, and food is cheap and god. I can eat here every day but I don't know how healthy it is. But so far I've ordered their BBQ Pork salad and their BBQ Combo and they were really good. I'm gonna be coming to this place alot! I've had better, it was alright. the prices were fair. The utensils were dirty, so we requested plastic ones. Don't think I would visit a second time. Average pho.  The go to plate at this place is #, Combo Clay Pot.  Hits the spot every time.  For under seven bones, you get shrimps, chicken, mushrooms, and lap cherng (chinese sausage), over rice.  Eat in is better than take out by far for this plate.  Definitely a very large serving. This is an okay restaurant to get Vietnamese vermecilli noodles. However, my dad ordered the beef stew and the beef was hard to chew. I would rather walk a few blocks to Little Saigon than coming here for Chinese/Vietnamese food. The egg rolls are small and the food is only so so. It's a bit suspicious that they serve Vietnamese AND Chinese. . . . but I live one block away so tried it out. I was very underwhelmed. Food was bland, just OK. . . not the worst ever, after adding tons of spices and sauces to everything the noodles tasted alright. The shrimp fried rice is made with the most microscopic shrimp ever, like larval stage shrimp. I give it two stars because the people who work there are nice and accommodating. Very, very boring food. This part of Mission St doesn't have much in the way of restaurants  you're better off going to Subway. This place is our go to spot when we don't want to hassle with parking or we want delivery. The food is more of a  star A Ok rating. The pho is solid and they have a wide variety of other dishes that are actually Chinese versus Vietnamese. Here is why you get the extra star. When you get delivery and they say it'll be there in  to  minutes, it actually arrives in about  minutes. In all honestly of ALL the places I've every ordered from in SF this is the only place that actually delivers in . under an hour and . delivers with in the time specified. The other week we ordered from a Chinese place less than a mile away (yes we were that lazy) and it was an hour and a half to get our food. So yep this place gets bumped up one star for that. Oh and they guy who answered and took our order actually understood what our order was with ease. Delivery guy also had no problems. Usually the delivery guys will call us and not even try the call box. It's SF. It's condo's and apartments everywhere. Seriously you don't know how to use a call box. Delivery experience was so easy with  Mission. It's a reason why we keep coming back here. I've been here twice. The first time was great, it's a nice, cozy place with good service and an extensive menu with an excellent price tag. Their potstickers are really good and way cheaper than anywhere else I've seen. The sweet & sour soup is really tasty. I'd been meaning to review the place before, and if i'd done it after my first visit I might've gone with   stars. HOWEVER. . . my second visit. *shudder. I just placed a pickup order, got to the restaurant to find everything packaged all nicely and ready to go. I get home. . . started eating my soup, when I notice this odd looking soup component in my bowl that, upon further investigation, turns out to be a ROACH. Yes, a roach. Little antennae and all. In. My. Soup. (ew ew ew ew)Thus heralds the end of what was going to be a beautiful relationship. I really don't think I could go back without wanting to puke. I just tried this place on a whim this week for a work lunch since I hate paying $.  for salads. I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised. Though I most likely would not eat in at the restaurant, the take out is excellent and fresh tasting. I felt satisfied and my meal was just $. !! Try  Mission Restaurant for a weekday lunch in SoMa. Delicious, cheap, and fast. I used to come here all the time when I lived around the corner.  However, its not worth heading to the neighborhood just to eat here.  I do like it though: Its cheap, fast, & with a nice staff.  That said, I'm also not going to pretend its the best food ever.  Come here if you're looking for decent & cheap Pan Asain cuisine (most dishes are Chinese/Vietnamese/Asian American). I haven't seen pho this cheap in a long time. . . but with a cheap price tag, you can assume that you get what you pay for. I can't really muster any comment for the pho except ""OK"", in that it is okay in every way: the noodles are not too soft or hard, the broth has taste but nothing too special, and there is ample meat per bowl. But with that cheap price tag comes smaller portions. I was less than full after finishing it, and to me, there's nothing worse than not feeling full after a meal. The cheap price is nice, but I would have gladly paid a little more to have the right amount of food. Otherwise, come here if you need a quick pho noodle fix. The staff is very. very nice, attentive and quick. Just don't expect anything above average. Fast delivery and pretty good prices, but not very good food. Everything I ordered was extremely greasy. I mean, for egg rolls you kind of expect that, but there was oil literally DRIPPING off, like they didn't even bother to drain them. The five spice chicken didn't taste like anything except fat. I also found a nickle sized chunk of bone in it. The crab rangoon filling was actually really good. Lots of crab, little filler, not too sweet. However, there was barely any filling in the dumpling, which kinda cancelled it out. This is a review of delivery from  Mission Restaurant. Easy to order via  eathours. comDelivery  The order was placed at : PM.  The order was delivery at : PM.  That is a delivery time of  minutes.  There is no delivery fee.  The delivery person was professional and polite. Order Minimum   It is relatively high ($). Packing  The food was packed into clam shell containers.  There was some slight leakage but it wasn't overly messy. Mongolian Beef  This was very bland.  Even the hot sauce I requested only helped a little.  The meat was tender.  The vegetables were relatively crisp.  The portion was large. tinyurl. com/abChicken with string beans  It had very little flavor.   I did not find the flavor that it did have enjoyable.  It may have simply been personal tastes, but I did not like the taste at all.  The portion was large. tinyurl. com/zzgrmBBQ Beef Sandwich  This was also very bland.  The meat had no flavor at all.  The vegetables were fresh and crisp though.  The roll was a pretty good roll.  It was dense but it worked.  I would not order the sandwich again though. tinyurl. com/nalnnaPrice  Their prices are pretty good.  The entrees including rice come in at around $. BBQ Beef Sandwich  $. Chicken with Spring Bean  $. Soda  $. Mongolian Beef = $. Subtotal: $.  Tax: $. Total:   $.  Fortune Cookies  They did not provide fortune cookies.  Arggh, I hate it when I do not get a fortune cookie with my Chinese food. Overall  For my tastes, their food is just not as good as many other Chinese restaurants.  The service and the costs are good though. Went here for the first time today i enjoyed the five spices roasted chicken i recommend getting it w a fried egg. .  overall not a bad place to eat. Tried them for the first time yesterday and thought they were okay. I didn't realize the items on their menu were rice dishes which means reduced portions and mixed in with the rice. Nevertheless, the food was inexpensive and the delivery was fast. Good on a rainy night when you want something quick. The food was very greasy. Although it was hot, it was completely tasteless. The orange chicken had no breading on it and tasted of grease. The crab rangoons were so disgusting I spit it out after one bite. NEVER ever eat here. I wish I hadn't paid for it. . . Warning: don't come here wanting/needing pho.  You WILL be disappointed. Waltzed in Sunday morning in (somewhat) desperate need of MSG soup with noodles.  Except, they're out of pho noodles.  They're out of flat rice noodles.  So to improvise, we were served spaghetti in our ""pho"". Oh, I'm fancy. One of the few times I did not feel better after noodle soup.  Fail. just discovered this Great  restaurant loved the vegetable pho  great service and very clean . It's cheap and they deliver. YES!However, I did not enjoy their Combo B plate. . . . too salty. But, go for the Pho. You just cannot go wrong. when you go to an asian place, you expect horrible service, disgusting environment, extra oily food, a complete lack of creativity but tasty comfort food. surprisingly, this place is not like that, the service here is VERY good for an asian place.  yes, i said very good.  the girls there are super friendly, attentative and try really hard to be accommodating.  the place is still disgustingly sticky and the food is somewhat oily and covered with MSG, but the chow fun there is delicious and my all time favorite from this place is their seafood claypot.  apparently it is not only my favorite but the favorite of over % of the patrons there at any given time.  i don't actually find good rice claypot (boa jai fan) in many places but this place is wonderful and refreshing.  i want to give it  stars but its so run down. . . and a hole in the wall that i just cannot do it. Everybody needs their hole in the wall. The one whose name is continually disseminated, yet remains a best kept secret. Where one feels the most comfortable  as in one can appear in just about anything without the slightest self consciousness. This is mine. I come here at least once a week. While there are others in my neighborhood that also merit frequenting, somehow this is where I am most comfortable. The service is fast, and friendly. And most respectable of all, the owner works on site, in and out making deliveries, and when staff if preoccupied, you'll see him taking orders or refilling the tea. The ambiance is clear of ostentation: red and gold scrolls tacked to the walls; photographs of the food with handwritten descriptions lined against the booths; a glass case of soda; a refrigerator of the beer selection. A flat screen television hangs over the place, and plays small town football games, or at times home video gag shows. Without all the means, or cause, for arrogance, one might argue that it's not really the best they've had of Vietnamese cuisine. What the hell  we've all had better of something somewhere, haven't we? But if I ever took the time to (learn how to) cook, I'd be very proud to be able to make anything on their menu. Yes, I've had better pho (Beef Noodle Soup) somewhere else, and I rarely order it anymore. But only because I've exhausted their recipe. Aside from what is traditional, they've also got some (of what I can make out as) inventions of their own: the Beef Stew Noodle is a sort of variation of the American, an interesting fusion. The Clay Pot Combo, as well as the rice plates, does not boast much, but are honest and satisfactory. (The Five Spices Roasted Chicken needs setting aside as some of the best I've had in the city, second only to that of Sunflower in the Mission) And for the price of it all, how dare anyone ask for any more? If you want to treat yourself, go somewhere else, armed with a considerably heftier wallet, and your peacock's pride. If you want to treat yourself to the satisfaction of your own modest means in the kitchen after a long day at work and save yourself the fuss or preparation and dirty dishes, this is the place to be. This place is great!   Great food. Great price.  Great owners.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone hungry. It was a cool day yesterday so I decided to come out here for some warm pho soup for lunch.  Pho selection was decent but lacked anything containing tripe which I like.  The soup wasn't too bad, it looked salty when it arrived but turned out that wasn't really the case.  As for the side condiments, I wish they would provide the hot peppers to spice out the soup, not just the bean sprouts.  At least the service was friendlier than what I recalled from prior visit. I like their vegetarian pho a lot. It's not the best I've ever had, but it's like a dollar cheaper than mot places. There's a couple places in the city where that dollar makes the difference, but whatever. I can't speak to the rest of the food, but friends of mine have eaten other things and they all seem to be stoked on what they got. Service isn't bad here. The guy who seems to be the only person I ever see serving food is always nice. Food usually comes out pretty quick. This is one of those places where it's not necessarily anything to go out of your way for, but absolutely worth going to on a regular basis if you're in this neighborhood. I always recommend this place to friends. My new favorite spot!First night in the city, looking for some good Chinese or Vietnamese food that delivers and ended up running across  Mission.  This place over delivered!  First of all, the plate was a healthy portion.  I ordered garlic chicken with rice and my wife got some pho which I must admit was some of the best pho I ever tasted. To top it off, their prices are amazing.  I don't think anything was over $. .  I will definitely be ordering normally from here. Here's the deal. I was on the way home from work and decided to try this little Chinese Vietnamese place on th and Mission. I called them when I got off the bus. The told me it would be  minutes. I walked half a block to the restaurant and waited no more than three minutes before my food was ready. I love nothing more than fast service on a late night after a long day at work. I wanted to order the Pork Lo Mein, which wasn't on the menu. I explained to them what I wanted and they said no problem! The food is pretty standard greasy chinese food, but to a better degree. The pork was delicious and tender and the veggies in my noodles were not over cooked at all. The noodles were pretty standard. Overall, very good flavors. The service and the food cannot be beat for the price. Bottom line, if you are in SOMA and in need of Chinese,  Mission is your best bet. I live just around the corner from  Mission. I resort to coming here when I'm too lazy to travel for some cheap Chinese food.  I'd get it delivered, but I can't be THAT lazy.  I ordered take out once and ordered the tofu & vegetable over rice and the crab and asparagus soup.  The tofu plate was average.  Just what I expected for the price.  I was more fond of the soup.  It really hit the spot.  However, they use imitation crab meat.  But what can you expect for $?I ate here another time and tried the pho.  Not impressed.  It was just OK.  I actually didn't eat much of it not because I didn't like it, but I guess I just got tired of the taste.  My friend got the clay pot which was delicious.  The server recommended it as well. Overall, it's a great place to get a good, cheap fix. Well,I can say that this restaurant is a staple for me as it is very close to my work. The owner and staff are consistently friendly and they are always willing to fulfill any requests. I love the curry soup and get it with egg noodles instead of rice and always ask for it spicy! Mm. A good stand by for me whenever I need it! I go and I go frequently, but only because it's right by the job and they take my card with no minimum. The Pho is less than impressive, but I do enjoy the ""satay beef noodle soup"". I don't see that item in many other places. Rice plates and appetizers are average. Overall rating, less than average. Great food! Great service! I come here very often and rarely ever leave unsatisfied. Their claypot combo is definitely one of their best dishes. .  star.  Place was ok.  Tried Pho, BBQ Pork rice.  Food tasted ok but portion was small.  More meat please.  It's located next to our hotel so it was convenient. Recently the weight of the day had me feeling like the only cure for my discontent was something greasy and unhealthy. As such, I decided to give this place a try since its proximity to my home requires minimal effort to get to [yeah, one of those days. . . ]. I got an order of the veggie imperial rolls. The verdict? Disappointing. It felt like the oil they used was the same oil they've used to cook every single dish in the restaurant since it opened. You know you're putting a veggie roll into your mouth. . . but somehow you still taste a little bit of everything else they fry. Not good. Offering a mix of chinese and vietnamese cuisine,  Mission serves it up quickly and deliciously at very reasonable price. Located in SOMA, they also deliver to nearby neighborhoods. I've tried a few things on the menu and I've enjoyed them all. Their five spice chicken and grilled meats are tasty. They also offer brown rice  a nice option. This used to be my go to place when i worked in the neighborhood. I had clay pot rice and combo plates about   times a week. I recently went back for the first time in over a year, and the owner's lit up with a smile and he even remembered my usual order (including the request for no onions). This gesture spoke volumes about their friendly service. If only every neighborhood had a joint like this. . . I normally come here for the claypot rice. I bring my mom and wife for dinner. During lunch they get packed. The ppl here are great. I've always found the service great as well. Visited this place based on yelp ratings and because it was right across the street from my hotel. Had the chicken fried rice and it was just okay with flavor. Wanted to try the rolls also but found it odd that you had to buy an order of  to try. I just wasn't that hungry so I passed. Went here for dinner tonight and was completely satisfied.  I had the Mango Chicken on a bed of rice for $. .  The taste was right and the price was right.  Food was ready in less than  min.  I'll be back. Freshness, quality, and tasty food for a very affordable price.  The owner and his crew are awesome, always courteous and attentive. I've ordered take out from many different Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants, but at  Mission you get the best of both worlds, not only is the food delicious, but they get it to you fresh and fast.  I love sitting at the restaurant itself, since they always have 'the game' playing on tv.  (BBQ pork over rice with bok choi and the Clay Pot are two of my personal favorites) Kudos to the variety and selection of all their tasty dishes. A friend of mine recommended this place and said the clay pot rice is out of this world. So I decided to give it a try. It's in the SOMA area so I wasn't too sure because I've heard of this place. When we got there I looked at their menu outside. . . Vietnamese on the sign but menu has the usual chinese dishes. . . nothing special. . . actually nothing that I wanted to eat. So we look on their menu. . . no clay pot? huh? oh it's a special on the wall. We ordered three clay pot rice and honestly I'm surprised it came out so quickly. If you've ordered clay pot rice before, it takes   minutes for one be done. I know how it's fast but let's get into the pot. . . chicken, mushroom, shrimp, and some thinly sliced chinese sausage(they charge $ extra for more sausage which I didn't get but my friend did. . . and it's not that much more compared to mine). . . . the clay pot had the nice burnt rice on the bottom and just not enough rice! The sauce they used is just sugar, soy sauce, and just too much pepper. It's a sauce you would use for a catfish dish you would find at a vietnamese restaurant. Conclusion. . . . not so sure why I wasn't impressed with the dish. . . yes it's sweet which always help with your appetite but maybe a little less pepper and more rice. . . oh the rice, since they used half the amount of rice for a usual clay pot rice, that's probably how they could cook it so fast. Will I come back. . . um not sure. . . I've had better clay pots at other places. P. S. Please change out your sticky spoons and chop sticks or change them out. . . . and can you stop ""unchained melody"" and other slow music during my lunch hour. . I almost fell asleep! I've never seen a chinese owned vietnamese restaurant before. This place is right next to my usual mani/pedi place and I picked up some food last week after my manicure.  Had pho and shrimp spring rolls. The pho broth was a little greasy but the shrimp spring rolls was good. It's a good place in SOMA for a quick pick me up vietnamese food. they also have chinese food too! Good solid spot for inexpensive, but decent Vietnamese food. I had a vermacelli bowl, and it was tasty, good balance between vermacelli and meat (and egg rolls). Nice spicy/sweet sauce. Great price. This review is for the special pho only. To be fair, the rice and vermicelli dishes looked fine, though the ""lunch special"" just seemed overpriced. Anyways, I am somewhat of a pho snob. After having pho in Australia, it'd be hard to give any pho place in the US five stars due to the quality of noodles used here. So, here goes:small sized bowl  deductionfresh sprouts  goodfresh lemon wedge  goodfresh mint  goodmissing jalapeno peppers  deductionbeef balls  good (the tasty ones)sliced beef  not raw on top, deductionmissing tripe, tendons, etc  big deductionbroth taste  average, can't tell if there's MSG or not, so that's a good thing, but it didn't reek of beef flavorbroth temperature  hot, goodnoodles  standard fare and loosened, goodBased on the pho only, I would not ever go back. Service is responsive and good. A simple little spot for a quick Chinese fix without having to make the trek out to the madness of SF Chinatown. With a mix of Chinese and Vietnamese dishes all for under $, there really isn't much to complain about this place. Only waiting a mere  minutes for the food to come out, I was utterly surprised. Clean, cheap, & quick  that's all I ask for when I'm in dire need of food. Ordered the sweet and sour fish + rice dish minus the veggies (because all I really wanted was the fish) for only $. . The portion was large enough to fill up  people, and even though the flavor was nothing spectacular, it's definitely a bang for your buck. A tad overloaded with batter, the fish was only mediocre, but I was stuffed after just a few bites. They also offer combo dishes for about $ , which includes eggrolls, meat, and rice. Pretty good deal, if you asked me. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but it's a nice spot to check out if you're in the SoMa area and you don't want to throw down a lot of bills on dinner. Good, cheap, clean location. Standard Chinese/Vietnamese dishes. Glad this is around in the SOMA neighborhood.  stars for their veggie plates. I haven't ordered anything else because this is where I grab lunch when I feel like I need some green vegetables in my life. (This neighborhood is short on cheap green veggie lunch options. ) My favorite has to be the string beans, which has a nice mushroomy brown sauce.  They toss mushroom, carrot and onion in for the veggie dishes, and will add tofu on request.  Eggplant is a bit oily. Always quick and friendly. Dining room usually busy at lunch. Glad these guys are here. Nothing much to say.  Cheap and satisfying.  Maybe its me, but all small Vietnamese restaurant that I have been to in the city are one and the same. I have been waiting for the weather to get cold to have a reason to get a bowl of pho. So when my coworker suggested Vietnamese for lunch on an oddly gloomy Monday, I was in!The four of us shared an order of vegetarian imperial and spring rolls. I was a bit surprised when the spring rolls came out with fish sauce (?) rather than the peanut sauce I'm used to. Then I looked at the spring rolls and I remembered that the rolls with the shrimp aren't considered vegetarian. Maybe fish sauce is usually served with vegetarian spring rolls? Oh well. They were still good, and so were the imperial rolls. Although the wrapper too, looked different to me  not as translucent as I'm used to. Eh, what do I know?But I do know that my pho was a bit flavorless. I wonder if this is what people are talking about when they say ""no MSG, no flavor?"" I'm not sure if they use MSG here or not (no signs around indicating that they don't) but there was something off about the broth. The two baby pieces of shrimp, several fish cake and fish ball pieces, and imitation crab were so few and hiding beneath the noodles, I had to search for them to make sure this was the seafood soup I ordered. Since I did appreciate the great service, large glass of hot tea, and cheap prices, I would come back here. But next time I'll try the vermicelli bowls with pork that my coworkers had and I was eyeing. Good food, but not amazing. The restaurant is clean and nice and the staff was very friendly. I will eat here again because it is in my neighborhood, but it is not a destination restaurant. This place is seriously less shady on the inside than the outside. Which is good. It's the classy kind of hole in the wall. That made me happy. I had the pho. It was kind of briney. I want to give this place more stars because I genuinely liked the restaurant. It felt nice to be in. Unexpected. Full of potential. But honestly if I was craving pho around there and it was a weekday before  I would still go to AllSTAR. I never knew a restaurant existed here. Came here with a local business owner for lunch today and it was packed. I give them credit for running this place like a well oiled machine. We waited for maybe  minutes. The owner obviously knew my friend so he ordered right away so when we got our table the food would be timed perfectly. Lo and behold, that was what exactly happened. I don't know why I feel like I'm being rushed here? This whole meal including conversation while eating should last only  minutes. It is that fast! There are plenty of parking around this neighborhood. I suppose if you work around here this would be an ideal place to eat if you don't have the time to travel elsewhere and if you are on a budget. We ordered Crab meat and asparagus soup (average) Five spice chicken (average at best) Seafood Pho (below average) Clay pot (probably their best dish here) I noticed everybody else ordering the same thing. I had some and it didn't really impress me. It took only  minutes to make so if you are looking for that crispy bottom and rich flavor from the rice, you are not going to get it here. The presentation and the seasoning was there, it just didn't have that time to marinade to be great. For  ppl .  How can you beat a place where the owner remembers your name, favorite order and drink preference AND has amazing food? You can't. It's a small place so don't expect anything fancy, the inside is just a few booths, tables and chairs and a counter up front where they keep the soda. Even so  mission is a great spot of a filling fast lunch. They always have fast service, good food and prices easy on the wallet.  mission is my favorite place to eat in SOMA. It's really cheap and a huge amount of fresh, delicious well prepared food. The cashew chicken, sweet and sour and the egg dishes are personal favorites and make sure to order the delicious fried rice. If you're ever in the area drop by for lunch! This is my and my friends go to spot for a quick cheap dinner. The guy behind the counter is awesome and we always have ridiculous conversations. There is a wide array of choices and almost all are fantastic. Definitely worth a try for a cheap lunch or dinner. Maybe .  stars!  This restaurant has been here for quite some time, and even though I've walked passed it nearly every weeknight on my way to the BART station for the past + years I've never set foot in the place until recently.  With the crazy economy and some of my regular SOMA lunch spots disappearing by the week I've been frequenting different places to add to my lunch rotation. So I've eaten here twice in the same week mainly because they've received some fairly positive Yelp reviews, and if just based on my two visits I don't think this restaurant makes anything that is super special, but they do make some basic Chinese and Vietnamese selections quite adequately with good flavor, good portions, very good service and very minimal MSG. I went the Chinese route on my first visit with an order of potstickers (static. px. yelp. com/bphot…) and a beef chow mein (static. px. yelp. com/bphot…).  The potstickers had a very thin skin much like Japanese gyoza and were crispy on the edges.  The predominantly pork filling wasn't quite moist enough and was a bit oversalted.  The vinegar and soy dip definitely helped in masking some of that salty flavor.  I liked the chow mein more as the beef was only slightly tenderized and there was plenty of fat chow mein noodles.  I'm not a big fan of the thin, crispy Hong Kong style egg noodles so these fatter flour noodles were definitely preferred.  They keep the fillers such as onions, bean sprouts and shredded cabbage to a minimum so there was quite a bit of beef and noodles in the dish. For my second visit I decided to try some of the Vietnamese offerings with an order of the deep fried vegetarian imperial rolls (static. px. yelp. com/bphot…) and a vermicelli bowl [a. k. a. bun] with grilled pork (static. px. yelp. com/bphot…).  The imperial rolls were quite good with its filling made up of silver noodle thread, shredded carrot and cabbage.  The rolls were fried up to the point where the cabbage was actually creamy.  They left out quite a number of ingredients from traditional bun dishes.  There are no bean sprouts, cucumber, cilantro or fresh basil in  Mission's version.  The bottom layer is simply shredded iceberg lettuce.  The portion of cold vermicelli noodles was quite generous though and the grilled pork while sliced bacon thin was very flavorful.  Finely minced peanuts and sweet pickled carrot finished up the dish. The service is very friendly, and while the food doesn't come out of the kitchen lightning fast the wait is quite short. It was a walk by find looked in, saw people were inside and grabbed a booth. Service and food within  minutes. $.  netted a steaming cup of tea, and an enormous bowl of plain vermicelli noodles with beef. I loved it  they had sauces that I could mix and match as well. New neighborhood favorite I love this place and feel so lucky to live around the corner.  They know me. The people are really friendly and the food is consistently good, but do yourself a favor and don't order pho. Try the corn and crab soup. Have no complaints with my shrimp salad roll experience. $ for two, made quick, friendly service, rather good. Appreciated the abundance of hoisin sauce on all the tables. Really, can you ever get enough of that stuff? Not in my opinion. Although this isn't true Vietnamese because of the Chinese touches, it's decent and cheap enough. Don't come here for the pho, it's just OK, better stuff is nearby.  However, the vermicelli with the grilled pork and imperial rolls are outstanding!  Noticed the staff were digging into some interesting looking rice dishes and claypots.  That's next on my list to try. This is not really true Vietnamese food. . . more like Chinese food that's INFLUENCED by Vietnamese. That isn't bad mind you, but don't expect to come here and get pho, or too many other completely authentic Vietnamese dishes. Still, the food is freaking delicious, and they serve a couple cheap viet beers. You can watch sports here. . . and the vibe is good. Decent pho for the price, but it lacks the tripe and other stuff that makes a bowl of pho complete. I guess that's what makes it affordable. Not the worst I had though. This is my th time going here and I am a pure  mission addict. The clay pots are great. This time I had # if I remember right. Which is beef with spring rolls. It was very fresh and good. The service is great and the prices are very good. I am defiantly going to eat here again! so good & so cheap! most of my break times i order to go in this resto and the owner always have a free coconut drink or thai iced tea ready for me. I love this place because whenever i request extra hot on my dish. . . he rates it from  to  and he know i'm a ! One of the best authentic vietnamese restaurants in SF. The other one right up there is PPQ (pho pho quoc) on Irving/th Ave. Prices are unbelievably affordable, food is prepared quickly and it is tasty. Been eating there for  yrs and love it. Awesome prices and excellent food and service!  I seriously need to stop eating there so damn much but the fried shrimp and fish curry are delectably devine!   Eric GonzalesCamputee Press Cheap and good. Usually not busy and quick service. If you want a lot of food for a good price, this is the place! Tery is the Man! He got what you need, I recommend The Veggie Chow Mein, Although the whole menu is delicious, Very reasonable prices. One of those Soma quality chinese vietnamese restaurants. Food is superb I really wish this place was better because its right near my house and its relatively cheap.  Also since its a veitnamese/ chinese combo, I was hoping the pho would be good, no such luck. . i mean its not inedible but it isnt the flavor fiesta i expected, plus they use lemon instead of lime, whats up with that?  I think I even heard one of them ask someone if they wanted a lime and then the dude brought out a lemon, maybe they dont know the difference? Oh joy!  I just moved into the neighborhood, and I was delighted to find a tasty to eat nearby.  The place is clean, staff friendly, and the prices. . cheap!  We had the crab and corn soup, which was served piping hot and full of flavor  I had the spare rib hot pot, which wasn't on the menu, but it was written up on a little piece of paper stuck to the wall, and anything with that sort of treatment has to be good. .  And it was.  Tasty morsels of spare ribs in a sizzling hot pot with black beans and bok choy.  Good.  Yum.  I will be back  mission, I will be back for more. Each time I've gone here I've noticed a definite lack of freshness and taste to the food.  I kept hoping that one day the food I ordered would ignite my taste buds.  Alas, no such luck. At best, I'd say the food was edible. I would suggest you make the walk out to Larkin and find a restaurant that serves good food.  Mission serves as a good option for the lunch crowd in SOMA. But probably not too much other than that. I would recommend making the two block ( SOMA block) journey to Tu Lan down Mission. The # at  Mission is decent but it's counterpart at Tu Lan (#) dominates. There's just no comparison. If you go, don't let them sit you in the back room. It sucks. I would rather get it to go and try to eat it in the middle of th street while dodging traffic. I used to eat here at least twice a week.  The good veggie options (tofu w/ vegetables or broccolli/mushroom) for $ a serving is hard to beat.  But a few months ago I started getting those nasty MSG headaches. I asked the server at one point about it and he got sort of evasive and said that no place is really MSG free, it's already in the sauces and what not.  The soup is still ok but these days I can't even bring myself to go in. pho is pho is pho?  not really.  the more pho places I try, the more I understand that they do mess it up (i. e. flavorless bowl of soggy noodles). But PHO at  mission is consistently yummy.  I've also had their spring rolls and pot stickers (again, yum).  There's never a wait and the price is right. oh hot bowl of deliciousness, I'll see you again soon. Pretty good, inexpensive Vietnamese food.  And all the pictures of the uniformed Chinese Communist Party leaders riding valiantly on horseback make me feel particularly warm and fuzzy inside. Love the rice bowls with pork or chicken.  Delicious and affordable. If you are aching for Vietnamese in SoMa here's the place.  When I used to work on th and Howard I used to frequent this place for lunch a lot.  Now that it's a stones throw away I hit at least once a week.  Any combo with vermicelli noodles get it.  Oh, for the amount of food you get for the price you can't' beat it. A friend who lives in the neighborhood brought me here for dinner last night. This is a nice alternative to TuLan, which I love, but makes me feel like the roof is going to come falling in on me at any minute and so I can't relax and enjoy it. I had the vegetarian chow mein. The noodles were nice and thin and they put tomatoes in it, I love that! We shared an appetizer of spring rolls w/shrimp, which were fresh and tasty. The place is clean, the service is friendly and despite the violent film being played on the flat screen during our shrimp roles, I really enjoyed it. It was packed with a combination of tourists and local neighborhood peeps. Can't wait until I visit my friend again and try something new! So so, I only had the sandwiches (pork & beef) and they weren't very good, had much better elsewhere (over priced too $). But  the place was packed out and the staff was very polite and friendly, so that earned an extra star. I didn't try any of the other food so this is really only relevant to the sandwiches. if you walk in past closing because you didn't know, they wave you to sit down and then they ask about your friend who you brought  three months ago with his whole family, THAT""S COL!! I've been here a number of times always with the same friend and i usually order the same thing because it's so good. lemon chicken (the white girl special) which they make with lime for an extra yummy tang and the veggie salad. I have also had the vermicelli with beef. , which growing up was one of my favs. theirs delivers quite well. great  for a run in run out meal. my co workers and i go here for lunch a lot. . . the people who work here are really friendly, and it's a nice, clean atmosphere. usually not hard to get a seat around lunchtime (but try not to sit in the back room). food is decent for the price. i really like the bun with pork and imperial rolls. the pho is good, nothing special, but at least they have it unlike tu lan. my co workers are fans of the clay pots. overall, a good place to grab lunch if you're in the neighborhood. Pho  no go here except for the Curry Chicken one  please walk a few blocks to Larkin for better selections. All dish plates  goodBest deal  combo hot pot (it's number  something)  not the ones posted on the wall. I finally decided to check out this place, very divey interior (or neighborhood for that matter)I got the curry noodle soup that Ed U. was talking about, seemed like it had potentialThe dish (was ready in min)Generous portion (one drumstick, one breast, both with bones). The meat was a bit hard and I'm not really down with white meat. Also it wasn't cleaned all the way and you could see blood residue hanging off the bone, won't turn me off but that ain't super cool eitherThe broth had the right color but was watery. I liked that it came with potatoes, there's bits of fried garlic in this too (yum). Seasoning a bit bland, it's missing some lemon/lime juice and greens (some cilantro, I dunno, something)The rice noodles were kinda overdone (too soft). If anything I'd get the dish with rice, maybe. A bit disappointedIt's cheap though, $. On Yelp's advice, I tried another dishChicken chow mein (ready  min) $. They use thin noodles which I'd rather they didn't but it's not bad. The whole thing is very much a canned affair (bamboo, mushroom that I could skip), there's cabbage, carrots, broccoli, onions and goodies, they use dark meatOverall not the greatest thing, fills you up (not huge portion which is surprising), better than the curry noodle soup. Next time, maybe try beef or porkFrom pictures I thought the  spice chicken over rice would be good, totally abject (roast chicken is pretty dry), don't bother with itbbq pork chop over rice, $. two thick ish small slices of of pork with scallions, it's not very tender but solid, there's a ton of rice, cabbage and pickled carrots. Decent though won't break records They keep the hot side hot and the cold side cold. . . though I am sadly not talking about the dearly departed McDLT from McDonald's. God, I miss that burger. No, I'm talking about how they pack up the pho (noodle soup) when you order it to go. They have the broth and the hot ingredients in a Styrofoam liquid container, the cold noodles are in a little burger type container and the bean sprouts and hot peppers are in a little baggie. It's quite an operation, but it works. You put it all in a bowl at home, and it can be pretty tasty especially if your fridge only contains a piece of moldy cheese and a half empty Diet Coke bottle. I usually have the $.  Curry Chicken Noodle Soup which has a couple of chicken pieces (still with the bones) bathing in a curry infused broth. But they offer the usual suspects when it comes to Chinese and Vietnamese dishes  lots of rice plates, chow mien, even BBQ sandwiches. I have to admit none of the food I've had is all that outstanding, but it ain't disreputable either. It's perfectly decent for a quick meal, and since it is technically my neighborhood Asian restaurant, I come in here often to make orders to go. I can't remember the last time I actually sat down and ate there though.

BLAH BLAH BLAH this is what i really wanted to write about. . . . there is a cute new asian girl waiting tables there now. her english is getting better and better (from zero when she started) and she is really sweet. but one of the first times we saw her she had a red t shirt with gold letters on it that said 'santa's favorite blond' ! seriously awesome. either she did not know what it said and just liked the colors or she did and got the irony. either way we all fell in love with her and are super glad she is still around. rock on santa's favorite blond! you can serve us up steaming bowls of pho ga any day : D Very decent fast Vietnamese food. Always seems to be open, and always a good hot meal. Looks slightly sketchy, but the food outweighs the apprehension. Great service, and they figured out how to pack Pho to go!  What a challenge. . .

No special sauce or anything. And they have pepperoncinis! The pesto pasta salad is really yummy, highly recommend. Simple, delicious and fresh sandwiches! Inexpensive. . . It's hard to find a ""east coast"" type deli. :) It's really easy to miss this place if you aren't looking for it, but I'm glad I found it. It's a great place to grab a sandwich if you live in the Castro. The sandwiches are really good, and you can usually get in and out in two or three minutes. There are a few better sandwich shops in the city, but given the speed and friendly service this place is a must. They also have a good selection of chips (that is to say, not just the standard lays varieties). When I lived in the Castro I would typically stop here on the way home from work once or twice a week. This place looks bland, but it's actually very, very awesome.  They have a bunch of beer, wine, food, and other concessions all at extremely reasonable prices.  Basically it's like what a ""deli"" SHOULD be: Actual sandwiches, actual conveniences, all done well. And the folks who work here are really nice, and they've been working here as long as I've lived here, so they must be either family or treating them well. Old neighborhood feely friendly, everything you ever want in a deli.  Love the $.  Baklava.  Had the Dutch Crunch Pastrami, just a plain good old sandwich.  Everybody coming in ordered the ""avogobble"".  Need to try that next time.  Had too much turkey in this past week.  The Holiday cookies were calling to me, good thing I had the volume on low.  This place is so European, so many meats and side dishes. YELP is so cool! I have been craving all week for a Reuben sandwich and whenever I come to Castro, it's either for their happy hour, dancing, coffee, or hanging out with cool friends, and I certainly would have never thought of Kosher deli here if it wasn't for my trusted YELP Mobile!Man this place rocks! They have everything to fill my craving. I jumped right away and ordered two sandwiches. One corned beef and the other pastrami both on rye. I was so excited about the sandwiches I completely forgot to order the sides like potato salad or I was even thinking of humus and couscous! I did have my eyes on their deviled eggs which looked delicious!!BTW  my sandwiches were delicious!The owners  the nice gentlemen and the nice woman I'm sorry I didn't get your name, thank you for making my night and for making me your awesome Reuben sandwiches. Your pricing was just excellent! What a great deal! Thank you also for your warm smile and for your excellent customer service. I definitely know where to get my Reuben fix when I'm in the Castro from now on!Rossi's Delicatessen also sell plenty of many goodies here too including lotto and they're open late until PM. They even serve fresh coffee and you can even buy them by the pound!Cheers ~ Here's all you need to know about Rossi's: super friendly guys (and gals), great, simple, inexpensive sandos, and you'll always leave with a smile on your face."|2|90|4|Routine Inspection| Low risk vermin infestation Wiping cloths not clean or properly stored or inadequate sanitizer Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils Foods not protected from contamination
Rossi’s Delicatessen 1|4.0|Delis in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|77|1|4.05084745763|" I get the bacon, egg and cheese bagel every time. . man that is tasty! And they are always so nice. Should give the lunch a try next. for some reason i really wanted to like this deli, but i didn't i ordered their special roast turkey sandwich on a dutch crunch roll for lunch one day. my tongue was in shock at how salty it was even with the water content from the tomato and lettuce, and the bread. that is the amount of salt i would use to gargle with if i had a sore throat to get rid of unwanted microbes  but not to swallow. perhaps there other items would be better? I just walked out of Rossi's with a Falafel Deluxe for $. It's like the mother of all falafel wraps, oozing with delicious hummus, fresh cucumbers and tomatoes and so many falafels that are spilling out of the wrap like crazy. And I had no idea it was a full pita  two half circles stuffed with heavenly goodness. I'm impressed! It's a little cramped in there, but I guess I shouldn't complain since I'm just going to go in and buy a sandwich and leave. I'll come back! Maybe ask for a smaller option for a falafel wrap since I ate half already and I am way too full for the second. Nom nom nom. Absolutely delicious! Fantastic deli sandwiches. Great family owned business that's been in the Castro for a long time.  I love going here before heading over to Dolores Park. havent tried anything but the falafel pita, but i have to say its pretty amazing and inexpensive for the quality. It's on my way to metro, and it's open before am.  Seems good enough for me.   I had a smoked ham sandwich first time and falafel deluxe the next.  The food was okay, very typical quality from a deli, but the male owner and the female cashier were very friendly both times. As I waited for my smoked turkey sandwich to be made this morning, I checked out their salad selection and made note of what to order next time.  It's a woman I've never seen before at the register today, and she just handed me the wrapped sandwich with a couple of napkins.  When I asked for a brown bag, as she bagged the sandwich.  ""Next time,"" she emphasized, ""I'm going to charge you  cents for the bag. ""  This was a first, and maybe they're just starting to enforce it, but Deli Lady if you're reading, ""Next time, I'll buy my $ sandwich elsewhere. "" What a great Castro area sandwhich shop ! The falafel deluxe is my favorite thing in the planet! By far the best falafel pita I've tried in San Francisco, they always keep me coming back for more. .  starsThe couple running the joint are super nice. Their selection of meats is vast and cut fresh per order it seems like. The wide array of salads are also nice and nothing is breaking the wallet too much. I got the Sam's special which was a good sandwich for the price but nothing really special about it. Very typical and something you can make at home. No special sauce or anything like that. With that said, I will still continue to visit regularly as other sandwich places have lower quality and charge almost $ for it. This place keeps it real. Geno B. says:                                                        ""Rossi is the best!""*blushingDwayne A. says:""I love Rossi. ""swon!Pretty O. said:""There are not a lot of great deli places like it used to be, with that saidRossi is truly ONE OF A KIND. ""thank you. Nick C. says:  ""My only criticism for this place is I wish the sandwich would of been bigger, it is definitely on the smaller side when compared to other deli's and sandwich shops in SF. But all in all, it was a fulfilling experience. ""err. . . . sorry, Nick?. . . . sometimes it isn't the size of the pen but the author who writes with it. . . . or some shit like that. I think Rossi has an average size sandwich. At least it was a fulfilling experience. Austin C. said it best tho: *at least to me""There are some things in life that are complicated. And there are things in life that are fucking awesome and simple. (Rossi)""seriously tho. Good sandwiches if you are in the castro. thank youand good night. The BLT is so good! Staff could NOT be nicer. Great selection of wines and beers and deli foods. Support this place! I love this Deli! I always get a turkey sandwich on Dutch crunch with lettuce tomatoes and avocado. Sam is the best. Everyone is friendly and helpful. Glad they are here. Check them out. Amazing Deli! Excellent service, average sandwich. We'll opt for a special next time  maybe they are more exciting? We will be back and I'll update this review when I have a second chance. they make everything in here. . . . . i would say it is the best place in castro. i am here almost every other day. great, great loving people. Falafel pita sandwich creation thing was so good! This litle hole in the wall was a great place to grab something quick to eat before our show at the theater across the way and their food options seemed endless. Also, when they ask if you want hot sauce, it really is hot. There are not a lot of great deli places like it used to be, with that said Rossis' Deli is truly ONE OF A KIND. This establishment has been in the neighborhood for more than  years! They are mostly known for their deviled eggs, the avogobble (which is a fresh roasted turkey with avocado) and their variety of affordable cheese. I come here every morning though, for my breakfast bagel. I get the bacon, cheese and egg bagel sandwich and I LOVE IT! Toasted perfectly and a full filling meal before I go to work. This establishment is a one stop shop. . . there are so many goodies to chose from that its often difficult to just buy one thing. As for their customer service, it's GREAT! Rossis' Deli is family owned and they are genuine, friendly people. :) Best bacon, egg, and cheese on a bagel I have ever had! Their customer service is tops to boot. Definitely becoming a regular. Great sandwiches! And for a good price too.  Love the guys behind the counter, always nice and helpful. Quick nice spot to grab a sandwich after work or school on my way home Get the Sam's Special. Two WordsDEVILED EGGS( well ok more than two words, I love this place. Great sammiches, the people who work there are quite friendly regardless of what some of those here might yelp about. ) I'm their chicken salad sandwich addict.   bucks for a filling sandwich that hits the spot every time, totally worth it! Just got done working out and was VERY HUNGRY! I decided to try a new place to grab a quick sandwich before I went home to really get my grub on. This place came through with flying colors. One of the best Ruben Sandwiches I have ever had. Thinly sliced pastrami, delicious dressing, and perfect amount of kraut. I had a feeling that would not be enough so I looked at what else they had and was surprised at all their different Greek side dishes (Tabouli, Greek AntiPasta Salad, Hummus, etc. . . ) So I decided to give their Greek AntiPasta a try and I was happy I did. Really fresh and delicious artichoke hearts, olives, sliced bits of salami, feta cheese, olive oil. . . . man this stuff was healthy and REALLY GOOD. As for their service, GREAT! The guy that helped me was nice and gave off a good impression. There was also these two GORGEOUS girls that helped me cash out, and were very nice as well. My only criticism for this place is I wish the sandwich would of been bigger, it is definitely on the smaller side when compared to other deli's and sandwich shops in SF. But all in all, it was a fulfilling experience. I will definitely come here after I workout for more food! Rossi's is probably one of the oldest establishments still in this neighborhood. But just because they're an oldie doesn't mean they're not a goodie! I was actually forced to go here to pick up a sandwich for my co worker so I grabbed a roast beef avocado on wheat roll with everything, and a side of potato salad as well. This meal was one of those pleasant surprises that you find when you're wandering the area looking for something to eat. . . Anything to eat! My sandwich was affordable but they put a really good amount of meat and goodies in to make it a great sandwich. There wasn't any special sauce or anything that they put on it like ike's or little lucca's but it was just a really hefty and fresh sandwich! And the side of potato salad I got was delicious as well! Rossi's is definitely a great delicatessen and I'll be returning more often for lunch! Rossi's Delicatessen is one of the best delis in the Castro. In middle school, I come here everyday upon getting out of Castro Station to wait for the . In a moment of thirst and hunger, I go to the store for a bag of chips and soda knowing I'd step into Rossi's for the first time. The staff there are very nice. This deli is worth going to if you are in Castro. My sandwich world revolved around the likes of Ike's, and when they closed up shop, I was pretty devastated. I knew there had to be pretty good sandwiches around the city as alternatives, but I didn't realize that delicious sandwiches would come out of Rossi's in Castro. I'm not connoisseur for the simple bread and meat meal, but I will say that I am a little selective. With that said, Rossi's has a really tasty fresh roasted turkey sandwich, which I get on a toasted dutch crunch roll. Cheese? Why not. Extra pickles and olives. Hells yes. It's not your typical subway sliced meat. Nope, this is shredded turkey meat, which I was a nice surprise the first time I ever bit into it. For a little more than $, you really can't ask for more in a sandwich. Also, if you're still hungry you can pick up some greek pasta salad or a piroshki. The guys behind the counter are always friendly and quick. I work near Union Square but I still make it to Castro for lunch at Rossi's. Try it out! For years, I have enjoyed the fresh roasted turkey sandwiches offered for sale at Rossi's Deli.  However, in the past year, whomever is in charge of removing the turkey meat from the bones needs to be retrained.  Again and again and again, I have found pieces of bone in a turkey sandwich that I have bought at Rossi's deli.  The sandwich I ate today contained a huge chunk of bone that I can't imagine anyone missing when the turkey was deboned AND YET AGAIN when the sandwich was prepared.  Will Rossi's Deli wait until someone chokes to death on one of their turkey bone sandwiches, or will they wait for a lawsuit, before they care enough to make a concentrated effort to provide boneless turkey sandwiches to the public ?  As for me, I've bought my last item from Rossi's Deli. Sandwiches here are delicious, ginormous, and budget conscious. And with Safeway on the cigarette ban, this is the go to place for a pack of smokes in the 'stro. I also buy lotto tickets. The place just screams good luck (in fact, I got a $ on my mega million ticket last week!) Best deviled eggs on the planet. Good, fresh food, super friendly staff!  The best BLT and  EggSalad sandwichs, good fresh salads . . . and amazing pickles. . . . . love the neighbor hood feel. . . good selection of cheese, small selection of wine. Rossi's is the best! I always come here and get a sandwich for lunch, because it's priced well, and the sandwiches are delicious!The fresh roasted turkey is delicious, and they have a great selection of cheeses to go with it. The side salads are also quite good. The Greek pasta salad is fun made with orzo instead of the typical rotini pasta. I also have gotten the meatballs to go, and they make a great easy meal  just cook some pasta at home to pair with them. I also love the selection of Ritter chocolates. I always have to give in and get a square for dessert. Plus, they sell lotto tickets, a fair selection of wine, beer, and liquors, and random chips and breads. And the people who own it are always SO nice! Fast deli sandwiches that are good and filling!I go there on my lunch hour and get the smoked turkey. Nummers! They also have a great deli bar. Salads, macaroni, hummus, Cheeses galore. . . . Oh and there is this one Man who works the counter. . . . so handsome! I love love these guys and family. I'm there every weekday getting my coffee. He calls it Jet fuel. It gets my day going. I also agree with the transexual or was it the . Yes their BLTs are better than the other deli's around, those other deli's don't compare. I still miss Maritsa. Keep up the good work! So many time had I walked right past this place that I was surprised to find out it was actually a deli.  From first glance, it looks like a random liquor store but after walking in I was amazed at their deli selection!  My personal favorite, of course, are the deviled eggs.  Just how momma used to make them!  The only downside to my new find is that I'm starting to get deviled egg cravings at all hours of the night and find myself throwing on a sweatshirt over my pjs to walk over and get some!  I tried the egg salad sammich the other day and it was ok.  I think I prefer my eggs unadulterated.  I saw they have bologna sammies so I can't wait to get over there and relive some of my other childhood memories!The dood behind the counter is always really nice too!  Ike's is just different. . . but I'd head over to Rossi's if the line at Ike's is too long! I've fallen in love with the sandwiches from Ike's, but I feel that I should try the other neighborhood delis first before I swear off all other Castro lunch spots in favor of Ike's. . . Rossi's is clean and run efficiently.  The sandwiches there are fresh and made to order.  The prices are very fair.  Plus I can buy Lotto tickets there. . . Still, Ike's this is not. . . So I grabbed a turkey sandwich  here today to try this place out and once I opened it. . to my surprise . . . it's fresh carved! This is something they should advertise. . . . had I known I would have gotten a sando here long ago. The turkey had a nice flavor to it. . . it wasn't dry either. . The guys in here are pretty nice. . . they even toasted the bread :) After reading the other yelpers comments. . . I will also be buying muni passes here :) Some of the sa LOVE them. . . family owned deli in the heart of the Castro.  You can get all the things you want (and need) in life. Handmade sandwiches (which are VERY hard to find in San Francisco  not including SAFEWAY), coffee, pre made salads, MUNI passes, chocolate, cigs, alcohol, wine, lottery tix, / & /, etc. . . Local, nice, family owned, multi generational  wonderful. If you are looking for a place to grab a bite to eat, to go somewhere and eat, stop here.  If you are looking for a place to go get that ""oops I forgot. . . "", stop here. I miss this place so much. I used to work in the Castro, and Rossi's was the best perk of my job.  The best  delies I've ever found in SF are Moesha's Pipic (sp?), in Hayes Valley, and this place.  I've heard there's another on Polk St. , but I've never been there.  I'd appreciate pointers from other yelpers. Anyway, Rossi's is the real deal for east coast deli fanatics.  The meats, cheeses, and salads are kosher and top quality, and the prices are below, and the quality higher, than pretentious rip off tourist traps such as ""David's Deli"". I lament that they no longer offer an onion roll as an option for thier sandwhiches, which was a great appeal for me, and the only reason I considered withholding  stars.  I gave  stars, anyway, because the food and service is so good. Go soon, and you will go often.  The other reviews are right in noting the real friendliness of the service.  If you order a fresh cut roasted turkey sandwhich, they warm the meat with a little juice before they put it on the sandwhich.  There aren't a lot of places left in The City that would bother.  These guys actually want your business, and make sure you know they are glad you stopped in.  They've been in this tiny location decades while other Castro businesses have come and gone.  If you stop into thier shop, you will know why. They also sell Muni fast passes. Pretty fantastic deli/lunch joint in the heart of the Castro. . . would definitely come here more often if this place were closer to me.  I'm originally from the East Coast, and this place reminds me of the delicious Italian & Jewish delis found in Philadelphia and New York.  I had the ""Sam's special,"" which was ham, turkey, and cheese with all the fixings.  The rolls were top notch and the portions were generous.  Prices were very reasonable.  They have a large selection of drinks. . . everything from Vitamin Water to Iced Yerba Mate tea to alcoholic stuff.  They also have some ready made salads and stuff that looked pretty yummy. good food, nice staff been around for a long time. from Muni passes to food a great one stop shopping place! and they care about the area! Cute neighborhood deli with cute couple running things. Perfect place to grab a Lotto Quick Pick & those decadent Lindt white chocolate balls at the front counter  for $. Good dolmas and reasonably priced. . . nice people! I love the sandwiches that I get here.  They always make them the way I want them with no mistakes.  They also have a good selection of drinks, chips, chocolate and homemade items.  I always buy my lottery tickets here because I like to support small businesses.  However the owners have gotten into a few shouting matches with customers, vendors and each other while I was in the store, and that makes for a very uncomfortable experience. It's easy to do. Take things for granted. My mama lived in Muscle Shoals, Alabama and never went to the Music Hall of Fame and I haven't been to Chinatown in  months. That's what I was thinking about when I walked into Rossi's today, really yearning for their falafel sandwich. . . the big one. Rossi's might not be a fancy up style kind of deli but it's a family run place and a neighborhood establishment. I love their Sam's special, the deviled eggs and the varying side salads but I craved the falafel. And, yea was it good. Perfectly fried falafel balls along with tabuleh, cucumbers,tomatoes and hummus. All for six bucks.  I promised myself later, as I finished the last pieces, I won't take Rossi's for granted anymore. Oh, I'm taking my mom to the Music Hall of Fame and all the other places she hasn't seen when I see her next month. . . Thank goodness I remember seeing this place listed in my Yelp search for a cheap yet quality place to grab food in the Castro or I may have been starving through the Monday night Noir City double feature. OK, maybe not starving cause I can go a night without dinner, and besides there was pizza, thai, and taquerias to choose from too. But the original plans changed. The Ike's Place plan was shot because they close at : on Mondays. The plan to go to Blue, which has been bookmarked for me to try because of the mac'n'cheese on the menu, was shot because the MUNIs were all packed and we had to wait for a train with room. But lo and behold directly across from the Castro Theatre is Rossi's, which I vaguely remember as having lots of stars for their overall review. So I ran across the street while my friend stood in line and, upon looking a the menu, immediately knew I had to try the Devilled Egg Sandwich. Now, I added cheese because I like cheese with my egg salad, but this sandwich NEEDS NOTHING but what they put on it. I honestly could hardly taste the cheddar I asked them to add because the devil gives such a kick. I'm now realizing this sandwich also was appropriately foreshadowing our movie that night, a Film Noiresque take on the story of Doctor Faustus. Did those eggs sell their soul to taste so good?The rest of the menu appears pretty standard, with two or three more decent sounding vegetarian options, and all sandwiches come with the standard trimmings, and also with options of adding cheese, avocado, some other stuff I can't remember. But the Devilled Egg Sandwich. . . . kicks ass. This is not a ho hum sandwich in the least. For once, I'm actually appreciative for public transportation delaying and canceling my other dining plans! For almost three years now, I've been changing buses at the corner of Castro and th Streets in the Castro.  And in almost three years, the only places I regularly go are Escape from New York, La Tortilla, and Taqueria Zapata.  I also sometimes went to that Taqueria El Castro place before it became Kasa, which I'm still afraid to try. All of this is to say that Rossi's Deli has been right under my nose all this time.  I'll admit that I'm a little afraid sometimes to visit delis and corner stores in the Castro.  Not because I don't like gay people but because I don't like the unreasonably higher prices Castro businesses charge gay (and other) people because apparently you have to charge more or people just will not like your deli or corner store. So honestly I think I did know about Rossi's, but I was always afraid of being overcharged.  So I came in here for a sandwich, a side of macaroni salad, and some hummus; and it was well worth the (average for San Francisco) price I paid for it.  The sandwich was amazing.  The hummus was OK.  The macaroni salad was a little sour, but I tend to have that problem with most people's macaroni salads.  (There's some non sour macaroni salad I remember from my childhood that nobody seems to be able to replicate. )  I'm definitely going to come back here, as I want to try more sandwiches.  They also have a bunch of other sides that look delicious. I also got some Kettle Chips nachos here, and they were really good.  Now, Rossi's didn't invent Kettle Chips nachos, but this is the first place I remember ever seeing them, so I'll give them that. Their sandwiches and deli foods are in my opinion as good as most.  The main reason I give Rossi's four stars, though, is their excellent customer service.  The folks who work there (my fantasy is that they're a family  maybe I'm wrong) are friendly and helpful.  The place has a wonderful neighborhood feeling to it.  I've been a customer for a lot of years, and I always try to patronize them when I can.  You should give them a visit too. Mmm. I crave their BLT with avocado on sweet roll. Awesome, awesome sandwiches. Tasty deviled eggs. Pastas salads are pretty good too. The guys behind the counter are ALWAYS friendly to me. Plus I can buy my muni pass on the way out. No complaints. It's the perfect place if you're looking to grab a sandwich (or snack) to go. No, no, no. My friend Joui was having a birthday celebration in Golden Gate Park, and I wanted to bring a bunch of nibblers.  I usually buy my Muni Pass at Rossi's since it is on the way to the train, and I remembered seeing lots of packaged italian cookies & crackers in there. I ended up purchasing quite a few snackables.  When I got to GG Park, and started putting the cookies out on plates I was mortified.  THEY WERE MOLDY.   Yeah  greenish mold on the chocolate cookies.  Lovely,Nastola.  No more cookie purchases here.  Although, I guess I'll continue to buy the Muni Pass. . . I lived in the Castro for  years, right on the corner of Castro and Market. I discovered Rossi's one day because I had to buy a Muni pass but then saw the great menu of sandwiches. I got a fresh roast turkey on dutch crunch with cheddar cheese, and my love affair began. . . That if hands down, bar none my favorite sandwich in the city and yes I've been to Molinari's. It just has the perfect combination of turkey (one star just for the dark meat alone), melty cheese, mayo, mustard, tomato and awesome wilty from the warm turkey lettuce. I like to pull it apart in my own particular way and savor my way to sandwich heaven. I moved from that apt.  months ago and I am having serious withdrawals from the Castro and my sandwich. just a great Deli to stop buy.  The food is really good, the Drunk Goat Cheese is one of  my favs.  Very nice group of people work there, always friendly. Very convenient. I used to get my muni pass there. Never purchased any food items there, but always wondered how fresh their deli items are. . . Rossi's is the best:) I live in the Castro, and Rossi's has become a staple of day to day life here. The sandwiches are delicious, I reccomend the Avogobble and the meatloaf on toasted crunch,  the deviled eggs are also excellent( though once or twice they have been partially frozen) The customer service from the guys behind the couters is excellent. I appeciate thats its family run and I usually go buy all my liquor/alcohol there. Great neighborhood deli that's great for more than just sandwiches. . . perfect to a quick, one stop picnic basket filling. The sandwich fare isn't that fancy they offer the basic assortment of deli meats and nothing crazy fancy. However, everything is prepared well and is quite fresh. Where I really appreciate Rossi's is their selection of cheeses. Again, they're a bit more limited than Ferrari's, but what they do have is priced far more reasonably. Service has always been friendly whenever I'm in there. The ONLY place on Castro Street from whence to purchase your brown bagged beers during Pink Saturday revelry. I love Rossi's.  Their Avogobble is a great sandwich. I love the guys behind the counter. . . Whatever. The old guy that works there totally called me a fag in Arabic not knowing that my friend standing next to me understnds Arabic. Nice behavior in the heart of the Castro. We fags pay your rent, dude. This place is great, and I don't say that just because I'm a Rossi myself. I say that because there is such a good selection of cheese and at very good prices! Need a small amount of gruyere for your Sunday brunch quiche but don't want to break the champagne bank? Rossi's is your place! They always have nice sweets, like halvah for a dollar, good panettone and last time I checked, quite the variety of Christmas stollen. They're nice too, which gets my vote every time. A good selection for a small space. Fresh made sandwiches, great cheese selection, and the guys behind the counter are nice. They also have some interesting imported cookes hanging 'round the deli counter."|2|86|5|Routine| Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 3/31/2014 ] Foods not protected from contamination  [ date violation corrected: 3/31/2014 ] Wiping cloths not clean or properly stored or inadequate sanitizer  [ date violation corrected: 3/31/2014 ] Low risk vermin infestation  [ date violation corrected: 3/31/2014 ] Moderate risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 3/31/2014 ]

Great chicken. Big serving for the price!! The owner's really nice too :) Just came back from there and I am absolutely never going back. The owner was so rude when I asked him a question regarding their sandwiches and later on ignored what I wanted to order.

The Special comes with one piece of chicken, smothered in nommy sauce, a baked potato, a huge roll of bread, and your choice of salad. All of this for $.  tax inc. (CASH ONLY)If you love butter this is def. the place you are looking for. The baked potato is cooked nicely, so soft and is filled with a generous amount of butter and when you open up your huge roll of bread, BAYUM! Hayluh butta! lol can't even tell just looking at it but inside is definitely a surprise. Don''t count on going under your calories on MyFitnessPal for the day. Haha. They have about five different salads to choose from. At the top of my head, I know that they have macaroni salad, potato salad, garden salad, jello salad, & a beets salad. I forget what else they have but my favorite salad is the macaroni salad. It's light and not too mayo ee ( I didn't know how to spell it so I just sounded it out, haha) and it's seasoned with love. When he gives you your portion of macaroni salad it's so huge that some of those little guys will fall over and play in your chicken sauce.  But don't worry! It pairs well with the chicken & sauce. Your taste buds will be jumping with joy. The only thing that's changed at Chick N Deli over the yrs is that the size of the chicken has shrunk. With all of the carbs that are given I'd like to have some more chicken. But it's okay Mr. Chick N Deli man. I still love your food. :)The owner is really nice too. He looks grumpy at first, but he's not. Don't judge a book by it's cover! Teehee. After asking for a to go box he gave me the option of choosing a big or small box. I packed my leftover yummies and before we walked out he asked if I wanted a plastic bag. Usually I have to ask restaurants for a bag. Overall, I say whoo hoo to Chick N Deli. You know you wanna try it. K Bye! Keto. Paleo. (Most likely not grass fed but hey I'm not really paleo. )Nothing comes up when you search for those words except Crossfit boxes. I hope this review changes that. If you are on a low carb diet this is the place to go to for a quick meal. For $  I get a half chicken and  salads. Skip the potato, skip the bread. The owner is fucking cool. He has funny old school dude attitude. Don't overlook this place. It's not fried chicken, it's rotisserie. the chicken is moist and succulent. Someone else said the green salad is a little bland or soggy or something. Here's my advice: get the beet salad and the green salad and mix them. I pound the half chicken and both salads   times a week. Delicious :) Super cheap lunch special. Great place to pick something fast. Chicken was extremely tender. The sauce, however, was extremely tangy & spoiled the meal. Ribs were on the dry side and the pasta salad was plain. I did like the potato salad. It had a nice celery crunch & nice and colorful. My time was warped soon after I walked in here. youtube. com/watch?v=opOs…It was like, 's diner, interior, decor , wall paper and every thing. In another dimensionWith voyeuristic intention.

OMG, I was SO  loving the Great Juicy Chicken!The baked Potato was hot and nicely buttered, so as french roll. I got Macaroni  salad. Great!I'll say same thing again and again. The Best Lunch Special in the city. I'll come back for the sandwich. I'm sure that sandwich would be the same. I admire a place like here, keeping American traditional still exist. I've been a customer since the 's. The food has been the same as long as I could remember same with practically the same prices. Gotta have the Turkey & Swiss! The sandwiches are the size of TWO and best of all its still under $ bucks!The deli is really old school and could use some renovation but for a small mom n pop shop its the best sandwich spot in the area. They have plenty of seating inside. There's decent street parking available and they have a  minute pick up spot right in front. Take care of Mike and he'll take care of you. I was driving up Mission St right after class, and was planning to hit the local McD's, but saw a sign ""Chick n Deli"" emerge as I crested up the hill.  Thinking that I could go to McD's any other day of the week, I thought I'd give this odd corner shop a try.  Parking metered spaces in front of the store were empty too; and a sign promoting a $.  lunch special sealed the deal.  I entered, and there were just a few construction workers grubbing away.  The server eventually emerged from the back, and I ordered the quarter chicken special.  Right away, he sliced open a baked potato, and topped it with butter  skin was thick, a good texture.  Then he snagged a chicken leg  tasty and moist.  It comes with optional BBQ sauce (take it).  Choice of any salad  I chose the green salad  succulent and tangy but a tad soggy.  And a bread roll, which he slathered with butter  surprisingly good.  If I had to go by weight, there was probably at least a pound of grub in my takeout container.  Admittedly, the ingredients aren't fancy; perhaps that is part of the charm.  From the read of other reviews here, I am enticed to return and try the other offerings. . . and skip McD's again. Ghetto hood good at old school prices. Walking into Chick N Deli was like a step back in time, when things were much simpler. Growing up in the s, my only care in the world was making sure I remembered to wear biker shorts underneath my school girl uniform (or face getting the evil eye from the nuns) and not skinning off the bottom of my Keds again (or face getting the evil eye from my mom). It's a far cry from today as my main concern is how I'm going to manipulate some s*cker into marrying me so I can pop out a kid before my eggs expire. I'M KIDDING. . . ""settling"" is the worst thing a person can do. Seriously. Chick N Deli took me back to those days of innocence and looking at the reviews, it has been around just as long. Unlike most businesses that can't even make it past their infancy stages, Chick N Deli manages to stay afloat because of customer loyalty. A simple, yet novelty concept that so many business owners seem to ignore. Never piss off your customers; more importantly, NEVER piss off a Yelper. Easy peezy. :)With offerings of rotisserie chickens, ribs, sandwiches, salads, and fruit smoothies, Chick N Deli is a welcome change from the taquerias nearby. You can get  whole chickens and a pint of salad for just $. ! You can feed a family of four for  meals talk about recession friendly prices! yelp. com/biz_photos/gjDm…Yesterday, I came in just before closing and picked up a whole rotisserie chicken for just $.  (cheaper and tastier than El Pollo Supremo down the block)! yelp. com/biz_photos/gjDm…The chicken had been roasted until the fat from the skin had been rendered making it deliciously crispy. The dark meat was succulently tender and infused with robust seasonings. The white meat was a tad dry which is understandable being the end of the day and all. However, it was nothing the accompanying BBQ sauce couldn't solve. Lacquering each piece of chicken in the tantalizing BBQ sauce gave each bite a zing, awakening my taste buds. Good grub at old school prices and friendly service with a warm smile. . . Mike, the owner definitely knows what's up!OTHER NOTES: *Closes at  PM*Easy street parking *Cash only this is a great place. my fav is the roast chicken, the tuna sandwich and the potato salad. all delicious! mike the owner is a nice guy,too. there is a parking space reserved for customers. this is a great delicatessen!   eric mauer Randomly went to this place today. . . Very old school! I had the / chicken combo and I must say it was quite good! And for $, you can't go wrong!I may have to swing by one night just to pick up some whole chickens! This is what I call good old working class food. None of the inner Mission hipster  dressings here. He has a good selection of sides, macaroni salad, potato salad, garden salad, and coleslaw mashed potatoes, to name a few. All made fresh with farmers market veggies. I got the quarter chicken. They serve an awesome BBQ sauce but the chicken is so good I never use it. He heaps two sides on there, enough for two meals for under $ bucks a person. I go to this place on Mondays, not all Mondays, but some. The guy who runs the place can be it a bit a bit ""short"" with customers but he's fast as hell and I'm sure he means well. Anyway he'll make you an awesome "" sandwich for $ and the short ribs are good too. He only accepts cash but there's an ATM in the place. After years of absence I have made my prominent return to this childhood spot. My dad and I have been coming here for years, and it still is as it has been the past  years. I'm  now. My fav: Roast Beef Sandwich; as mentioned, these sandwiches are huge for $. My friend couldn't finish the sandwich he ordered. I was able to because I am a beast. I still remember the taste from when I was a little child, couldn't resist not finishing. Another fav: ""The infamous"" rice pudding. My last visit, they were all out as they are popular amongst the blue collar workers that stop there for lunch. My nd fav is the BBQ chicken. We usually get the combo, which comes with macaroni salad and bread w/butter and with a quarter chicken= makes perfect $ meal. You can even add fruit (watermelon, cantaloupe)I now live in the East Bay so I won't be as frequent of a visitor as I once was, but I'll surely swing by whenever I'm in the city. + Thumbs Up Great neighborhood spot with wonderful food.  Mike works hard and treats his customers well.  He's very friendly and knows his regulars.  The portions are quite generous.  If you're in the Outer Mission, don't miss it. This is a great old school place if you want a good meal at a good price.  You can feed a family of  for less than  bucks!  The ribs, chicken, and sandwiches are all wonderful.  The owner, Mike, is a great guy who is a crackup.  I wish there were more no nonsense places like this to eat, as it reminds me of my childhood in SF.  Chick N Deli is a winner. The quarter chicken specials are the best! Tender rotisserie chicken with BBQ sauce, a baked potato, your choice of salad, and a hunk of bread and butter all at a reasonable price.  They have a great variety of salads, tasty sandwiches and ribs, and good gyros.  Mike, the owner, is a real friendly guy, and even back in the day when I believe his wife and her sisters were running this place, they always handed a couple of lollipops to my sister and me.  It's always nice to stop at a familiar place in the neighborhood for such simple but delicious food. Ive been coming here since I was in high school.  Love this place.  Prices have always been great.  The food is delish.  I always get the / chicken special and a drink. Best sandwich and chicken for your buck. The sandwiches here are huge and delicious. When I come to the City I always come here to get my sandwich. I just have one and that's all I have to eat the whole day. Great sandwiches!  thumbs up! i've been coming here since i was a wee man, since it's near my grandma's house. I've to have better hof brau type food.  the owner's been there forever. . . he looks like he came straight outta goodfellas hehe. their roast chicken special's gone up over the years (current at just over $). . . it includes  whole roast chickens (which are always perfectly roasted) and a pint of your choice of any of their fresh salads. their ribs & sandwiches rock too!! See my review for the Chick and Coop on Mission Street in San Francisco (which also applies to the Chick and Coop in Daly City). I live three blocks (I think) away from the Chick and Deli.  It's a great place, especially their roast chickens.  I got two in the last two days alone!You can't beat it.  As I told Mr. Prokopos the other day when he offered me BBQ sauce, ""it's good without the sauce. ""  He agreed.  That's how he has it too. The other day, I saw a man order a whole chicken and a soft drink, proceeding to eat it there.  Now, that's good chicken. Located only a few blocks from where I grew up, the place hasn't changed at all.  The owner is renowned Excelsior Greek, Mike Prokopos.  I took my dad here last Friday because his Alma Mater, Lowell High School was going against mine, Balboa High, in a High School Football match up that ended up being a classic game that ended on the final play.  His school beat mine   on a  yard field goal.  *insert sad face*But, back to this place: it's blue collar and no frills.  There is only one selection of bread and about  boxes of potatoes next to the seating area.  For less than $, you can buy a gigantic sandwich that rivals the size of Burritos that can be found on Valencia street.  However, because of a recent court ruling, Burritos technically, according to legal doctrine are not sandwiches.  Panera Bread company wasn't too happy about that. . . . but I digress. The sandwiches are good here.  The service is stoic.  Hard.  But reliable and very honest.  No smiles.  No ""I love you, let me kiss you on the cheek, and have a nice day. ""  Lots of one syllable sentences.  Even the business card of the place is white with black letters with a very stiff rooster standing on the upper right hand side of it as if in military formation. But this is the working class neighborhood of San Francisco.  Toothpicks?  Forks?  Knives?  What are they?  A sandwich is a sandwich which, is what you get here.  The quantity alone makes this place worth considering. Observational note:  note the poster of the very beautiful woman smiling and holding a pita sandwich.  She's been there for at least  years.  I wonder where she's at these days.  I wonder if she realizes that her beautiful image holding a pita sandwich has been inside this store for all these years.  I wonder if she realizes that men fall in love with her smile that brings out the longing romantic in every man. I wonder if she ever took a bite of the Pita Sandwich.  or, did she threw it away after the photo shoot was wrapped up. I wonder.  I digress again."|3|100|0|Routine|This inspection has no violations.
Publico Urban Taqueria 0|3.5|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|138|0|3.0| I've passed by this place in multiple occasions on the way to the Peet's right next door and decided to try it one day. Most days when I passed by, there's a line and the seats are taken up but it was usually during lunch hour so it's sort of expected but if it's there's that many people there, it must be good, right?I show up at am and was the third in line and looked over the menu. I decided to go with the burrito bowl since I wasn't in the mood to use my hands on a burrito. The guy taking my order was friendly and my food was made pretty quickly. As for the burrito bowl itself, it was a pretty large portion and had the usual fixings of rice, beans, corn, salsa/pico de gallo, guacamole and meat (I got carne asada). Everything about it was good except one thing  the food was luke warm. I don't expect the food to necessarily be piping hot but this was on the brink of being cold almost. That aside though, it was good, the guacamole was made with real avocado that I could taste. Nicely seasoned rice, a healthy serving of beans, meat and salsa. The lettuce, I could sort of do without but it was fine. The price was a bit hefty though for a burrito bowl (~$). Decent burrito for its price. My Perfecto Burrito wasn't fully wrapped at the bottom, so my fillings fell on to the table. Thanks! I really liked this place. I was in a rush an needed a quick bite to eat. I saw this little taqueria and was pleasantly surprised. I love Mexican food and was happy to find that Publico did it justice. I got the Tostadita with carnitas. It was fresh and tasty. My food came out fast too! I wasn't put off that they only accept cash. This place is sort of like a food truck so you can't blame them. Plus there is a Chase ATM right next to the ordering window. Also the prices are super reasonable!The only thing that sucks is that I literally ate my food in a parking lot because that is where they are located. Prices have gone up in the last few months but food is still the same and service has gotten worse.  The last four times I've ordered they have gotten my order wrong  I don't like lettuce in my burritos and I prefer refried over black beans and I'm very explicit about this when I place my order.  Today they got both wrong.  And I had to wait  minutes for my order.  Think I will just stick to the items on their menu from now on, and/or go after the lunch rush since there's only one guy making the food. . . Very good. Carne Asada quesadilla. Chicken burrito.  Chips.  It's simple and easy for a quick meal while you're on the go. Location is right in the parking lot, so not the best place, but you make do. Wouldn't be opposed to coming here again.  It was good. Portions were decent. This review is based on the price and how the burritos tasted. This place is a ripoff. They charged me $ for  super burritos and didn't give me chips. Every other Taqueria i've ever been to in and out of the United States gives you chips and salsa,guacamole to go with the chips for free. These guys are idiots and i am never going there again. The only reason i didn't make a scene right there was because i was on my lunch break. They have a stupid sign up saying that all prices are final and that there is no bartering,negotiating etc. These idiots wouldn't need that stupid sign if they would just charge what Taqueria's normally charge and give chips. This is the most expensive Taqueria i have been to in San Francisco in the last  years. They will get no repeat business from me. I recommend skipping this place and going to Taqueria Cancun on the corner of th and Market. The burrito's didn't taste how burrito's normally taste. They are scamming. They aren't running a restaurant, they no overhead cost, when i went there i only saw  people, they work in what almost looks like a painted up wooden outdoor shed and they are charging more money and not giving simple things like chips and salsa and guacamole. I've been to several other Taqueria's that are actually restaurants,have to pay overhead cost, have several employee's and still manage to charge a good price, offer a better service, and offer things that chips,guacamole,salsa free of charge. I'm not the kind of guy who would normally feel the need to ask about things like this before placing my order because other places normally do it right. It would be like going to McDonalds and ordering a number  and not getting french fries. This definitely isn't where you'd go for authentic mexican food.  It's kind of in between Chipotle and what you'd find in the mission. Not everything is good, for example, the tortas and the soup suck ass, but the burritos and tacos are clean with reasonably not suspicious meats. But most of all they have an awesome salad with avocado, black beans, and corn. This review is based upon only on price. Just can't stand when a taco stand charges for every last item including papers, chips, etc. This will be my last time at this joint. Plan an extra dollar for items like chips, extra pico de gallo, hot sauce and the like. I ordered a carne asada taco here and bit in to find a huge piece of twisted metal wire in my food. I was obviously freaked out and disgusted. The kid at the counter gave me my money back but, there's not a chance in hell I'd ever eat here again. The one bite I did have was pretty gross and flavorless anyway. Great service!  Tasty carne asada burrito! Not bad for a walk up in a spot positioned to serve mediocrity. Got a carne asada burrito with some guacamole and black beans. Pretty decent. Conveniently located in an indoor parking lot. I've passed by last week and decided to order something from here today. I ordered a Jack Cheese Quesadilla with Chicken and it is delicious. The way the quesadillas are made here looked very interesting. Quesadillas I've ordered at other taquerias are folded up in the shape of a semi circle resembling a taco. I've found this very interesting and it's definitely culinary creativity. Another spot that will definitely satisfy my Mexican cuisine cravings. I am definitely coming back the next time I am in the area. I am craving for something else from the menu as I write this review. When you are here and you're craving for Mexican cuisine, Publico Urban Taqueria is the spot to turn to. Efficient services and friendly staff members. FYI: Cash Only|5|100|0|Routine Inspection|This inspection has no violations.
Publico Urban Taqueria 1|3.5|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|138|1|3.09090909091|" A little suggestive sign in front says: Never shop on an empty stomach. I took the advice and got their crispy taco with % avocado guacamole. This treat brought me back to life after hours of brain drain garment decisions. Their crispy taco is the best, and the ingredients are fresh. I go every every time I need a boost from exhaustive shopping at Nordstrom Rack. I was really hungry and couldn't wait so I stopped by this little shop located right outside of Trader Joe's on th street. I had seen it so many times while going to buy groceries, but finally tried it (after I yelped to make sure it was decent first of course :D). Bottom line: Decent place for some Mexican food to get you full that isn't too expensive. Better than Chipotle, but not as good as sit down Mexican restaurants or Mexican places in the Mission (but what is?). I got the El Perfecto Carnitas Burrito for around $.  and it's definitely a sizable burrito that was hand crafted instantly and delivered into my arms within  minute! Blazing fast service, just how I like it. It was pretty much a super burrito with rice, beans, guac, sour cream, some other stuff probably, and meat. There was actually quite a bit of meat, like I could actually taste the carnitas and there were some big chunks of it in there. Second to the meat there was a lot of rice. I felt pretty guilty eating the rice and tortilla carbs. Gg. The girl in front of me got the nachos, and boy let me tell you, she had me wishing I had gotten those instead. At a price of $. , I almost turned around and went to order myself one, but being so mentally strong (minus the fact that I came here in the first place since I was hungry), I forced myself to keep walking and settle with just the burrito. The nachos had a lot of stuff on them, that's all I know. So yea, I think I'll try the nachos next time I'm here. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the pricing, quality, quantity, and service of the food here. How was that such a bad burrito? Maybe I am spoiled in the Mission but that definitely makes the list of worst burritos I have ever had. I can't pinpoint why. . . . It just tasted. . . Wrong Used to like this place but it's been going downhill! The Mexicali salad has no dressing anymore, the tortilla soup shrunk to half the size. It's bland and lukewarm. What happened El Publico? Gettin too much business because you're the only food place in the strip mall so you think you can cut back now? It's sad really. I eat mostly meat and vegetables and don't need rice, beans, tortillas, chips and everything else other Mexican joints try to shove down your gullet. Like jack in the box I realized Publico has a secret menu when I ordered just a bowl of meat. To my surprise I was presented with an enormous amount of freshly grilled chicken topped with pico. Seriously, we are talking about a pound of chicken here. Best part is that it is under $. I can trot into trader joes next door and spend more on raw chicken that would not taste nearly as good. The quality is high and the taste is excellent. If you are paleo, max out Publico before you go shopping. Best quick Mexican for best price I've seen. Wish they had better hours but the food is great. Good price  Soma is lacking Mexican so this place is great to have nearby. Be careful: they often close   min early. Highly recommend the super burrito literally the only place to eat in the nordstrom mall on a sunday. okay food, average prices, quick services Their salad is a great deal. Really fresh. I asked for a side of guacamole and it was the smallest container EVER for . . Boo! overpriced for barely an okay taste.  i ordered a rice/beans/cheese/salsa burrito to go.  i got it and i left.  what they delivered was a rice/beans/salsa and / teaspoon of cheese burrito.  next. I'm usually kind of picky when it comes to Mexican food. Most places I've visited have put a big emphasis on specific menu items or are known for their ""special"" sauce. Then there are places like this that are very humble for what they offer and talk a good talk when it comes to their food. I had the El Perfecto Burrito with rice, beans, and carne asada. Great flavors all around, like the world's best symphony orchestras playing sweet music to my taste buds. Although the tortilla was a bit saugy, it was made up in everything else. The chips were okay but the salsa made them better. If I were to go back, I'd like to try their tacos. A friend of mine also found them to be a good source for soup. Don't expect to find a hole in the wall, sit down. Rather, they have a small. . . stand?. . . located outside Trader Joe's and Pier  imports. Don't be fooled though, it is legit. There is also limited seating. But I'd suggest to take it to go, unless you want to be BFFs with the pigeons. Public Urban is a good go to. I'll surely come back here when I can. This hidden gem that is tucked away in a small city shopping center in Soma off Bryant and th street (Trader Joes, Bed n Bath, etc). Truly a hole in the wall operation with first class fast food!! Hooray for the Mexican salad, trust me just try it. The street tacos are also fantastic, as they are stuff to the max with your choice of meats.

Solid, tastey. Could use more selections, but they are good at what they offer. This place was serviceable. I liked the nice colors the menu had and the selection seemed OK. I was starving after shopping so I got a Carne asada burrito super with black beans and guacamole. I also ordered a drink. The girl that worked there was pretty cute, though when my order was ready she forgot to give me my drink. I was surprised to see there were no chips included. When it was ready, the chef basically said ""here you go gringo. "" I laughed, but he should be careful about saying that because someone else might take offense. I didn't. I give the lower rating because of these things that fell below standards and bang for your buck. I forget the price but it was probably as much as papalote. Cheap, tasty street Mexican food.  Good crispy tacos.  Try the pollo verde topping. Surprisingly good, fast and just what we needed prior to shopping at TJ's. Got the veggie taco and they were very generous with the avocado and queso fresco.  yum! Beware. Cash onlyHow can grilled pepper and onions turn out tasteless?Mushy rice?How fresh is this stuff? That is what I get for going to a taqueria in a shopping center/ After a day of walking and shopping the Gift Fair  it was a treat to stumble upon this place!  As i stood in line and watched other customers eat their yummy looking food, I couldn't decide what i wanted.  I ended up with a Mexican torta  Super yummy licious!  It was also really big   hours later, I ate the other half and it was still just as good.  It was a perfect ending to a long day!"|5|98|1|Routine| Food safety certificate or food handler card not available  [ date violation corrected: 11/25/2013 ]
Publico Urban Taqueria 3|3.5|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|138|3|3.75| The Crispy Taco with Chicken was one of the best things I've eaten. Soft taco shell with beans, cheese over a hard taco shell with generous amounts of delicious grilled chicken and avocado at a great price. Solid. A little gem tucked away in a busy strip mall Freshly made and nice ingredients.  The chicken was very fresh and very nice tasting.  I like the location and decor of the stand.  Wasn't incredible but good enough to eat a quick taco or two.  Very basic. My favorit thing here is the Mexicali Salad: Two crispy tortillas stacked with black bleans, choped romaine, grilled chicken, corn, radish slices to add crunch, heaping portionsn of avocado and sprinkled with queso fresco. It is the perfect combination of yummy goodness. . all for $. . . . a steal! cash only. quesidilla's not half bad. This tiny spot with outdoor seating near TJ's and Nordstrom Rack offers tacos, burritos, tortas, quesadillas, salads, nachos, soup, enchiladas and more. The meat options are limited to safe, popular options: carne asada, chicken chile verde, carnitas verde, pollo asado. Choose from black or pinto beans. They are vegetarian friendly and try to use organic ingredients and local vendors whenever possible. The street tacos come on two small corn tortillas, soft and pliant, with onion, cilantro and salsa. Tacos are generously loaded with fillings. There is no salsa bar. * Chicken chile verde taco ($. ): big tender chunks of marinated local chicken had a nice grilled flavor,  the chile verde was too salty and sour, the red salsa wasn't spicy at all and didn't have much depth of flavor, cilantro was visible but didn't have much flavor, very wet overall* Carnitas chile verde taco ($. ): niman ranch pork shoulder was fatty and luscious, but I didn't like the chile verde (too salty, sour) sauce or the red salsa. The taco was way too wet again. I liked the meats but not the salsas. Cash only. Disappointing. Ordered a veggie burrito and it was EXTRA oily. On top of that, I gave the cashier $.  for a $.  bill and was expecting $ back. He insisted that I gave him a $ & $ bill but I am certain I gave him two $s. I argued back but then let it go because he was not budging. It's especially disappointing because the burrito was so sub par. had the pulled pork (carnitas) and guac . . .

I literally work across the street from this taqueria. I have always found the food to be fresh and delicious. Some favorites are the street tacos (can't go wrong! so simple, so tasty!) and the salad. All of the meats are good, juicy and good quality. The wait is never long either but be warned, cash only. My one complaint is that chips are extra and frankly when I do splurge on them, the portion is too large and I end up wasting half of them. I reccomend this taqueria, no frills, but deeply satisfying food. The carne asada tacos are delicious, but if you want spicy, this is not the place to go.  However, the service is great. Food baby.  Seriously. It's weird.  I've been to the Nordstrom Rack here several times before and I've never noticed this taqueria.  Maybe because it's literally a hole in the wall slash food stand.  But today, I was actually looking for a place to eat and lo and behold, the bright red paint caught my eye. Between my coworker and I, we shared Carmen's Nachos, a crispy chicken taco, a carne asada street taco, and a carnitas street taco.  Along with a Snapple, the total was about $. This review will be quick and easy, just like the food.  The carne asada was average, no complaints.  Between the two street tacos, the carnitas stole the show.  Hella juicy with a slap you in the face kinda flavor.  Both had hella fillings.  (yelp. com/biz_photos/mJxt…)  The crispy taco was HUGE.  (yelp. com/biz_photos/mJxt…)  The chicken was moist and had decent flavor.  I'd get it again.  But if I were to only get one, I'd definitely get a carnitas crispy taco.  The nachos were yummers too.  Tons of toppings.  (yelp. com/biz_photos/mJxt…)  But I'm a fan of simple nachos, so next time I might just go with their ""High School Nachos"" which are just chips and cheese. This spot is perfect for all the hungry Rack or Trader Joe's shoppers.  They have a few tables to eat at right in front.  Napkins, utensils, and everything else is to the side.  Enjoy! Very BOMB tortilla soup. Spicy and hearty. Made me feel much better being sick and all. . . . I had one of their burrito which happened to be too dry . Their cheese quesadilla was pretty good . Their quesadillas are huge ! I couldn't finish the whole thing because the cheese is very thick and fattening . I didn't notice that they had fillings after I ordered . Will probably be back for a quesadelli w/ filling but will go somewhere else for a burrito . This place is really not that good at all. The carne asada burrito tastes like a prepackaged trader joes burrito. They should try loading it with a little more veggies or something to make it taste a little more fresh instead of being a flour tortilla with rice beans and meat. That's a little plain, and I got a side of pico de gallo to put that on top and it didn't help much at all. Positives: very very very tasty burrito. Negatives: burritos are a bit undersized relative to others in the Mission (good if you want a light ish lunch); nickel and diming is lame (cheese is a dollar extra, guac or sour cream is extra, lettuce is extra); no free chips (really? are we that bottom line?). This is quite possibly one of my favorite Mexican stands in the city. My friend would always bring me the bean and cheese burritos from this place, and I never knew where she got them, but I was hooked. The other day she took me here so I could finally see for myself where I could get these amazing burritos and other Mexican deliciousness. I definitely recommend the bean and cheese burritos which are about $ I believe. Their refried beans are actually made of black beans instead of pinto beans which is AMAZING. I tried the Charlie's Crispy Taco ($) vegetarian way which came with roasted peppers and onions and guacamole instead of meat, along with a crispy and hard taco shell, pico de gallo, cheese, and lettuce. My my my was it good!I'll drive out to this place just for the food, but you can kill  birds with one stone and go shopping in trader joes or nordstrom rack while you're at it! Besides this complex having some of my fav stores (Trader Joes, Pier, Nordstrom Rack, etc), this little shack is really really good! My husband and I tried the same thing  a crispy taco wrapped in a soft tortilla but he had the chicken version and i the veggie version. IT was super flavorful and so satisfying. Must try, but check the timings for operation! :) love this place.  the food is fresh and tasty. but i really really really love that you can order beans w/ veggies as a side dish, but it's big enough for a meal. also, nice and close to the gold's gym for a healthy and tasty after gym snack/meal. Don't order the burritos. The torta is simple but great. The tall red headed woman who takes your order may be the unfriendliest creature on the planet. I usually find myself eating at Publico on my way to pickup groceries from Trader Joe's.  I make it a point to eat at Publico's before I go shopping to avoid ""put everything in your basket because you're starving"" syndrome.  I've probably eaten at this Publico about  times and the only thing I've eaten there is a street taco with chicken.  The only thing my street taco has is the tortilla and flavorful chicken mixed in Cilantro.  I love it because its satisfying and light.  Why four stars?  Well, a few reasons.  ) The Publico closes early, typically between pm and pm.  This is a bad time because its around when I go for grocery shopping as well as dinner time.  The worst is getting there and finding that they closed early (this happens from time to time). ) The window where you order is made for short people.  I'm over  feet tall I have to get on my knees just to place an order.  Poorly designed ordering window. ) Publico is cash only.  What is with the spread of cash only restaurants/bars/food stalls?  Does the  % credit card companies charge eat that much into profits?  This is the th century and we're a society of cashless people.  ) There is only outdoor seating and as you know, SF weather can be unpredictable (it rains here in July for gods sake)!Nonetheless, I still recommend Publico if you want a fast, cheap, and quick meal. Okay so I had the Mexican Torta today (//) for lunch! I must say it was DELISH!The Carne Asada was flavorful and tender, bread soft and grilled. Check em out! :) I don't see why there are so many bad reviews? I frequent this place a lot after I shop at trader joes or bed bath n beyond. I've never had a bad experience with the customer service or the quality of the food. Yes it does suck that they take cash only but don't all taco trucks? I always get three street tacos.  carne asada and  pollo asado with extra onions and cilantro and hot sauce. I always like my Mexican food with more of a kick of flavor since I find most tacos to be bland. I love how the carne asada has no fat at all. It's real pieces of steak and no weird fatty stuff. The chicken is also marinated well. The servings are generous in each taco and I get full off of . I haven't tried their burritos yet since I can't really finish one by myself but I'll have to try one soon. Tacos are $.  each and remember it's cash only. The Mexican torta for its price was a little sparse, but had tremendous flavor. Carne asada was tender and went well with the avocado and black beans. The bread it was served on was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, which made the texture of three sandwich a pleasure to experience, especially with the crisp lettuce. The cilantro mayo was light, creamy, and added a nice set of flavors without being overpowering. This meal loses a star for its price point, and the lack of decent customer service. They weren't rude, but their apathy shows through. Part of the Mission Bay food company, this unique little taqueria is better than decent.  The service lacks in motivation as they make no effort to let you know they're ready to take your order.  granted I'm  foot tall, but I couldn't see one person's head through their order window located at about  feet high.  After I made an effort to say hello I was greeted with a smirk.  I said ""ok"" and continued to ask for the salad.  The lady behind the glass window asked ""Filler?""  I had NO clue what she was talking about.  taking a stab I asked ""Do you mean, what kind of meat would I like?"" and followed that with ordering chicken.  No more words were exchanged as I handed her my money and waited for my salad to arrive. The food was good and with notes about Dos Pinas on the menu I figured as much.  I enjoyed my salad with Chicken ""filler"", but will not be going back anytime soon. Pep up Publico. Gracias por la ensalada. First time here so I ordered  street tacos: Carne asada, green chilies chicken, and the other chicken.  All have a kick so diner, beware. Good bang for the buck. But you better like spicy or order anything mild. The simplicity is a delight and the value is completely unbeatable in this city. I'm obsessed with their bean and cheese burrito! I usually get the kids portion because it's a decent portion and it's under $ (cash only). Everything I have seen them make looks awesome and I love their black beans. I tried this place out based on some of the reviews here, and I wish I didn't!  The only thing good about it is that their guacamole is thick rather than watery like so many Mexican restaurants.  I had the street tacos, one al pastor and one chicken verde.  Both of them were too spicy, salty, and greasy.  I was glad they had horchata, but it was crappy.  It was sweet, but there was no cinnamon at all.  I was really pissed I didn't spend my money on El Tonayense instead. I like burritos. I like tacos, too. I really like tortas, and I never ever order them because they're never quite as good as I'd like them to be. greasy taqueria tortas are a fine and wonderful thing. Publico serves up a DE licious torta. mine was carne asada with all the fixins and I am kinda sad I already decided to save the other half for tomorrow's lunch . . . it was that good I'm willing to expand the old belly. I've also had veg, chicken and carne asada burritos, and they're each quite tasty. the refried blacks sort of create a one note flavor, but still tasty and CHEAP. I mean, $.  for a burrito is hard to find even in the Missh!oh, and they do a crispy taco that possibly even rivals Nick's [or Underdog's, or whoever does the good ones these days . . . ]surprise! clean hole in the wall CaliMexi eats when you're bushed from a Nord's trip or are preparing for TJ's. I will go back. So the first two times I ate here I didn't know what to order so I kept getting stuck with food that was just ""Ok"". Now, I am an expert and know exactly what to ask for. I go here at least once a week because it's right across from my work. Street tacos SUPER goodBurritos I always get a  Fajita chicken burrito spicy. They also pack extra spicy salsa if you ask. Clean as a pinto bean, this urban taco shack will be your pit stop as you prepare to navigate the grocery aisles of the bustling and oftentimes chaotic Trader Joes that shares the same lot. Not a typical Mexican joint, it offers a more modern and healthy yet reasonably authentic take on simple Mexican street eats.  I recommend the chicken soft tacos in which the chicken takes on a delightful barbecue flavor and is clumsily set amidst a medley of green chile sauce, fresh chopped onions, tomatoes and cilantro. Well, I tried the chicken asado and the pork tacos  very tasty, and good price.  Just like a truck!  The thing that irks me is that it advertises to use local, sustainable products when possible.  I went specifically to the place to eat a quesadilla thinking they'd be a place that uses cheese with no growth hormones, but when I asked, the woman didn't know what cheese they use.  Wish they'd give it up about the advertising. I had the chicken chile verde and it was delicious!  A complete meal rolled up in a tortilla for $.  can not be beat.  I especially liked that they provided a large cooler of iced water so you didn't need to buy a drink.  How thoughtful! Hands down. . . the best street tacos in the city. Not to mention they are dirt cheap. With tax, it's about $.  or something along the lines of that. Always stop by here when I go shopping. Two street taco's: perfect portion and delicious. Not bad. Had the street tacos, grilled chicken.  The chicken had a good flavor and the salsa was very good, not too spicy.  They were very fresh tasting, not oiling like some street tacos from taco trucks.  My friend had the nachos, they looked good topped with plenty of guacamole, sour cream, beans salsa and jalapenos.  I would go back, the tortilla soup looked interesting. Cash only,  a few tables right by the stand for outdoor seating only. I love the food. Just reviewed the wrong location. Ooops!  The service is great and the people are very friendly. I love the red head!!  She is always so nice and remembers my order. I have food allergies so this means a lot to me. The only suggestion I would make is brown rice please and out door heaters. It's cold today! Tacos were pretty standard.  Good but not amazing. Never shop at Trader Joe's on an empty stomach!  Well, it doesn't matter because I end up spending a lot of money there anyway.  Before shopping there today though, we decided to stop for some carne asada street tacos at Publico Urban Taqueria (great location in the center of the shopping plaza!).  Yum!  It hit the spot as they are flavorfully cooked with white onions and cilantro sprinkled on top, and they are just the right size to make you full but not too *oink* full.  Yum, we ordered more!!  Afterwards, we still spent a lot at Trader Joe's, but at least we weren't grouchy from empty, growling stomachs!  Muchas gracias! This place has solid street tacos ($.  each) and burritos.  I usually get the taco al pastor, which comes piled high on two little corn tortillas.  There's so much meat that I usually split it in half and use the tortillas separately.  Today, I got the burrito al pastor instead and it was delicious! It has rice and beans inside with the yummy meat and makes a fat mess that requires  or  napkins.  I really like their selection of hot sauces too.  This place is the perfect stop before heading into Trader Joe's.  It totally makes up for the crappy parking and stupidly long lines inside TJ's on a weekend afternoon. By the way, it's cash only.  If you're out, there's a Wells Fargo ATM nearby. I guess Urban means American? Is that why the red sauce tastes like 'Ragu'? I only like the chicken bc it taste bbq'd. Flame broiled from a picnic. MMm. MOJITO IT(add cheese, quac, 'Ragu', sour cream thrown on top)? Why did I do that? BC I wanted to spend $ instead of .  for avo, .  for sour cream, and $.  for cheese. I'm cheap and dingy. Next time go for the add ons. I don't hate this place. Try it. How in anyone's world could this place average out .  stars confounds the realms of my imagination.  Really?  We were shopping at Trader Joe's and hubs was whining of painful hunger pangs.  This place is a small booth outside TJ's with a small outdoor seating area next to it.  In a moment of weakness, I agreed to eat here.  I ordered the carne asada enchiladas and he ordered a burrito.  Of the three enchiladas that came on my plate, I couldn't bear to take more than  bites of one of them.  Was about to toss it before my husband intercepted out of curiosity.  He thought my enchiladas were better than his burrito (no way in hell I was going to try a bite of his burrito so I can't comment personally on its taste) but it was a consensus that our respective orders tasted gross. One star is a misrepresentation by the mere fact that it gets a ""star"" which is generally accepted to connote some degree of worthiness.  Damn, this was bad.   Cash only. Note: Vegetarian Review: I hate to say that I love this place. Its inconspicuously good. Bean & Cheese burrito (my go to) here is pretty delicious; and for only $. , F YEAH! Their Veggie tacos have avocado slices, and they for sure hook it up. Though this is more of a  / star kind of place, I'm upping it since, they're super fast, and they're cheap! Faster than waiting in line for a taco truck, no joke. I absolutely love this place! The food was delicious  I would definitely recommend that everyone try their tacos  and the service was great too! I was helped by a bubbly redhead that answered my million questions about all the menu items and finally helped me decide what to order. I will definitely be returning here whenever I have had a full day of shopping at Nordstrom Rack. BOMB TACO. and cheap. The Tortilla Soup is so amazing! I hadn't tried it until yesterday, and today had to go back again! It's got rice and avocado in it along with the soggy tortillas and shredded meat. YUM!I also really love the Mexicali Salad (minus sour cream, plus chicken). YUM!Cash only, so be prepared! Cashier looked like she didn't want to be there (which she might not, but at least pretend).  Was on the phone when there was no line.  She didn't greet the customers, so at one point someone had to ask "". . . can I order?""Otherwise, food was pretty average. Pretty good tacos. I'm not going to say that this place is good enough that you would actually endure one of the world's worst parking lots just to eat there. . . nope. . . no way jose. However, if you find yourself at Nordstrom Rack, Bed Bath & Beyond, or Trader Joe's, and you need a snack, this place will hit the spot. My taco was like the ""double decker"" tacos that Taco Bell used to (or still does) have. No real review on the food as I was not afforded the opportunity to even order.  When I went, two women working both windows were chatting on their cell phones (to each other? who knows).  One kept pointing to the other, and I inquired as to whether they were open or what.  The other one. . tall nasty looking redhead gave me tons of 'tude and said ""we're switching registers. . . OKAY?""Beyotches.   I will never have the chance to see if they're any good or not, cuz I now hate them. went to bed bath & beyond starving so my friend and i ate at publico urban taqueria  pretty much the only place serving hot food in this shopping plaza.  the burritos we ate, carne asada and chicken chili verde, were both actually pretty good!  not bad at all for a quick bite to eat while shopping!  the price is beyond reasonably cheap and food is very edible and good!  they're also fast, clean and the staff is friendly.  i would definitely make a stop here again whenever i shop here.  the only thing i wish they had was indoor seating b/c on a day like today, it would've been nice to sit inside a warm restaurant.  but hey, eating while shopping is good too! If you're hesitant to get your authentic Mexican food from a street truck or a corner vendor's taco cart, this is the next best thing to a trip to Cabo. From the deliciously thick Tortilla Soup to the Nerf football sized Chicken Burrito, this tiny spot tucked in the parking garage (between Peet's Coffee & Trader Joe's) serves up some hugely flavorful south of the border tastes without the usual greasiness. Surprisingly comfy patio seating and oversized shady palms make for a little oasis amidst the chaos of bustling weekend crowds and near to impossible parking. The cash only policy is a PITA, but you won't need a lot of it. Tasty. These guys have interesting (but HILARIOUSLY messy) crispy tacos. They take a hard taco and fill it normally, then on the outside they wrap it again in a soft tortilla that has black beans on it. When I received it, the guac and the salsa were overflowing from the top and got all over my hands whenever I tried to pick it up. Prices are decent, $.  soft tacos. Crispy taco was $.  but it was definitely filling. I would say the most interesting thing here is their vast array of hot sauces. I tried the jalapeno harissa (tasty but needs more kick) and the jamaican style (tastes more like el yucateco than anything but is nice and hot. ) stars for the food (not amazing, not bad) and  extra for the great hot sauce! Just OK. The taco kind of got lost under all the toppings. Filling is not as exciting by itself. When you're shopping at Nordstrom Rack, TJ's, Pier  Imports or Bed Bath and Beyond, you're bound to get hungry. And, as I recently heard, if you're at UCSF Mission Bay. Yup, Publico Urban Taqueria is rumored to be opening a new location next to Subway on the Mission Bay campus. I like Publico because the food is solid and the eats is cheap. It's fast and clean and they give you a decent amount of food. My favorite is the carne asada taco because it has so much cilantro! And the aqua fresca (while mas fresca at El Farolito) is fresca. The Fiance likes this place because of their selection of hot sauces. They have your run of the mill Tapatio and Tabasco but then they have insane sauces that will blow the roof off of your mouth. I remember one particular afternoon after a TJ's stop. We sat down to have a quick taco or two and the Fiance picked up one of the more spicy sauces. The label warned us not to use too much but the Fiance scattered a generous portion over his taco. We each took a bite and within seconds, I was grabbing for our newly bought milk carton and steam was coming out of our ears. Publico is cash only. There is a (I think) Golden Bear ATM in the alley between the record store and TJ's but you can always pop into TJ's to buy a banana and ask for cash back. The grilled veggie burrito will get your through your ho hum day.  As the hipsters say in their argot  delish. This place is good if you're shopping at Trader Joe's or Nordy Rack and just want to grab a quick bite.  The salads are tasty and the tacos are good but messy, knife and fork messy.  Definitely not your typical taqueria, but good and fresh.  The chicken verde is what I usually order.  In my personal opinion, they should change the hot sauce selection.  A place advertised as a taqueria should not only have Louisiana hot sauce to choose from. This place is hit or miss.  The veggie burrito is good, but others can be oil bombs.  Your best bet here are the tacos.  You can't go wrong with al pastor. I tried every single one of the different hot sauces available here.  Not just boring Tapatio sauce, but there was an assortment: Jamaican, Chipotle, Garlic, whatever else!  Loved it.  I always pass by this little hole in the wall (literally!), but this last time I decided I needed to eat before I did my grocery shopping at TJ's. ""Never shop on an empty stomach"" says the sign on the window.  Ha! I suppose it saved me from buying a bunch of junk. The Mexi cali salad is healthier version of an order of nachos.  A little bit of chips with a lot of chicken, avocado, and lettuce.  Definitely not authentic Mexican taqueria food more on the Rubio's side  but that's the way I like it!  Adding this to my list of easily accessible eats. . . easy parking, fast, cheap, and relatively healthy! This place is awesome, fresh, tasty and great hot sauce choices. The Chicken Mexicali salad is too good to be true. Bottom is lined with chips, with black beans piled on top with lettuce, tomatoes, corn, this super tasty chicken, crumbled cheese and a whole sliced avocado. For $? If you're running errands at this shopping center and you're hungry, you have to stop here. I loved this place for what it is: a taco stand, in a parking lot, with really good chicken chile verde. Ever go to the grocery store with the intention of just buying a few things so you just grab a basket. . and then realize that your basket is overflowing and things are falling out, and your arm is really sore from carrying it?  You then a) ditch the basket for a shopping cart, b) sort through the items to see if you can arrange them differently so you can stack them more efficiently, or c) start putting things that you want but don't NEED back. This is how I viewed my experience at Publico. After passing by many times going to Trader Joe's, I finally decided that I needed a healthy dose of Mexican food.  I stopped by and ordered a carne asada street taco ($. !), a chicken crispy taco, and an order of nachos. The grocery basket analogy applies to Publico's tacos.  When I opened the box for the carne asada taco, I saw that mounds of carne asada, cilantro and onions were crushing two tortillas, which were sitting sadly at the bottom of the pile.  I tried to pick the taco up, but there was no way I could even get the ends of the tortillas to remotely meet.  So, I congratulated myself for grabbing a fork while I was waiting for my food, and ate about half of the meaty filling until I could pick up the tortillas and eat it like a taco.  Even then, I still had tons of the tender, flavorful carne asada left inside, and it kept squishing out from the ends as I took each bite. The crispy taco was less impressive.  The pollo was well seasoned, there were huge dollops of fresh guacamole and pico de gallo, and like its already consumed street taco friend, the fillings were overflowing.  Outside the crunchy shell, they'd glued on a flour tortilla with some refried bean paste, and I wasn't a fan of that.  If it'd just been a crunchy taco shell, Publico would've earned my  stars, as well as my love and never ending affection, right here and now. The nachos were the least impressive, as it had what tasted like store bought Taco Bell nacho cheese (don't get me wrong though, I love Taco Bell), too much refried bean paste, guacamole, pico, carrots (?!) and jalapenos.  Not a fan, and I probably won't be ordering this again. All in all, Publico is a surprisingly good, cheap, fast place in the heart of the Brannan/Bryant/th St. shopping center.  Cash only.  CCG stamp of approval *here*. KAGA MARIKO is a Japanese female movie star that sounds like . . . . Caga,maricón. Btw,me, "" can I get  bbq pollo and  carni asada taco?""a latino lookin' girl at the store replied, ""what?""me, "" I wan't  bbq pollo and  carni asada taco?""the latino lookin' girl at the store replied again, ""what?""my GF said, ""he said he wants  POLLO and  CARNI ASADA TACO!""the latino lookin' girl at the store, ""Oh,  chicken and  steak taco! OK!""I was like, "" whathafx? . . ""So, my gf got  chicken and  steak, I got  chicken and  steak Street Taco, $.  each. Not too bad!It's pretty good shit. Btw,KAGA MARIKO is a well known Japanese female movie star. It isn't Caga,maricón, mozafxer! I was at Nordstrom Rack and got super hungry and the closest restaurant around was this place. My expectations were pretty low but the chicken chile verde completely exceeded my expectations, especially for $ bucks. The burrito was nice and spicy and they had a good selection of 'insanity' hot sauces available at the tables to kick up the heat even further. Delicious burritos/tacos/everything else for cheap! Great place to stop when you go shopping in the complex. Ordered the Mexicali Salad with steak. Ingredients were really fresh and they had about  different kinds of hot sauce. awesome Had two veggie street tacos for $. . What a price! They were really good! Lots of folks there for lunch sitting outside. However, I made the mistake of not taking the ""insane"" warning on their insane hot sauce. I love me some painful food, but this was off the charts. I was in total misery for about  minutes. You are warned! the place looks really cool from the outside , windows, order and pick up , service is super fast which makes it pretty clear why this place is not the best , pastor taco was not bad at all, but the steak looked like rubber and tasted not so fresh and full of fat , its a cheap and quick place if you're in a rush but not a place that you would crave like the taco truck by best buy Street tacos for $.  and they're piled high with delicious meat!  What a deal!  I'm definitely going back to try the crispy taco. The meat was flavorful, we had the al pastor and carne asada tacos. The place is clean, the food looked and tasted fresh and it's easy on the wallet.  I only wish they were open later than pm. This place is awesome. . It's the closest place to get a decent burrito that isnt super huge and falling all over the place. . . ! The chicken or beef street taco's are a great deal. . . The service is cool too and it's near my work. . . ! Orale Publico. ! Plan A: Grilled chicken burrito. Wheat tortilla. Denied. No wheat tortillas. Plan B: Chicken with green sauce soft taco. Jackpot. Half the cost, and enough delicious chicken to make a burrito at home with a wheat tortilla. Which I did. I was toiling for Jennifer E. again at her fab cupcake emporium when she asked what I felt like eating for lunch. I didn't care much and she came back with this gem of a carne asada burrito. Super flavorful and juicy without being too, too messy. I liked that there wasn't rice in it and the guac was pretty darn tasty too. (I usually don't even like guacomole, so they had a lot to overcome on this yelper. ) I ate it all in about  minutes flat, it was so tasty! If I'm back in that area, I'll give them my business for sure! Unless Jennifer E. needs some help at her store again and feels like treating me to lunch. . . ;) Great quesadillas and salads for little money. Awesome!  Maybe not exactly authentic, but I'm okay with that!  Totally reasonably priced, and I love that they use eco friendly packaging! Get the chicken chile verde burrito, no rice, add avo.  friggin YUMS.  a great meal for about  bucks, with a soda. Conveniently placed near my office.  Two veggie street tacos for $. ?  Fresh ingredients, veggies crunchy?  YES.  Veggie burrito is substantial as well, even as I typically order it, without rice.  They have a selection of HOT (and I mean HOT) sauces at the counter. . . tread carefully.  I love tabasco, wasabi, and many, many heat oriented sauces and foods. . . but this stuff is BURNING. overall, a great, inexpensive, quick lunch place with fresh ingredients. I went here today and ordered the vegetarian quesadilla.  They get points for grilling the flour tortilla which makes it extra yummy.  However, the ingredients were so mushy it was all falling apart when I tried to eat it.  I wasn't a fan of the overcooked red and green peppers; it just made for more mush so that half of the quesadilla ended up on my plate and not in my mouth.   What this place has going for it is the super hot sauce labeled ""total insanity hot sauce"" located by the water, utensils, and napkins.  That and the fact that pretty much everything on the menu is under $.  CASH ONLY!  (Wells Fargoans: There is an ATM  hops away)My boyfriend had the chicken quesadilla and it looked like it was put together a little better than mine since he was able to gobble it up without any spill.  I had a bite or two of his and I'll certainly be back to order a chicken quesadilla (or try a burrito) because vegetarian quesadillas are not a win here.  P. s. I was just here an hour ago and am already going through hot sauce withdrawals.  Hot sauce fanatics: YOU MUST TRY THE HOT SAUCE! I actually really like this place. . . maybe because I am always ready to pass out after power shopping at nordstroms rack but what can I say? Solid cheap tacos and very convenient. Basic carne asado taco without breaking the bank and bringing me back to life after running around the rack. Its a taco stand and I don't expect much. . . . but the chicken tasted weird (tried  times. . . same result). . . so giving it just  stars. Probably gonna try some veggie stuff next time. . . . hopefully nothing tastes ""weird"" in it. Dropped by to shop at nordstrom rack and trader joe's and I was hungry and found that there's this place that sold tacos for only $.  each!  Ordered a chicken and beef taco, both were decent.  If I happen to come to this center again, I'd definitely get me some tacos if I'm in need of a snack.  Very generous on the meat and the tortillas actually made it all the way back home and were not soggy at all. (about  minutes)  Cash only! After visiting this taqueria located about a block away from my workplace three times and ordering a burrito each time I was ready to write a nice overstuffed  star review for them.  Then I decided maybe I should give the place a fourth try and order something I'd never had before.  That was Wednesday afternoon, and here I am writing a  star review for Publico Urban Taqueria. I think they refer to themselves as the ""Taco Truck with Zero Emissions"".  Clever.  It's literally a hole in the wall with a very limited menu.  Actually, considering the mini size of the place I'm surprised they offer as much as they do.  The little restaurant is located beside the parking lot inside the shopping complex at  Ninth Street kind of between the Peet's Coffee and Trader Joe's. Each time I ordered a burrito here I found the filling to be generously stuffed.  The filling barely fits inside the tortilla so if you like messy, drippy overstuffed burritos this place might be to your liking (yelp. com/biz_photos/mJxt…).  Their base burrito contains rice, vegetarian black beans, queso (cheese), mild salsa (hot salsa is available upon request) and your choice between carne asada, pollo asado, chicken chile verde, al pastor or vegetarian.  I've tried the first three but have yet to go with the pork or the veggies.  I probably liked the chicken chile verde the best; however, the green sauce definitely needs more spice.  Fresh avocado, sour cream, guacamole and other ingredients can be added at extra cost.  My norm is adding sour cream ( cents) and guacamole ( dollar).  The burritos are wide and stumpy as opposed to the familiar sleek and narrow silver bullets of other taquerias.  I thought the burritos were nice and filling but nothing really special. I returned for a fourth time.  There were new items posted on the window.  Enchiladas in a mild ""rojo"" sauce !  I'll have to try those on my fifth visit!  I selected a Mexican Torta this time which I understood to be a Mexican sandwich.  I absolutely loved it a lot more than I did the burritos.  They take an ordinary looking sandwich roll, slit it open, hollow out some of the bread and add mayonnaise, jalapeno slices, fresh salsa, shredded lettuce, fresh avocado and a generous portion of the meat of your choice.  I selected the pollo asado.  Once the sandwich is made it is toasted hot to the point where the mayo has melted and the outer crust of the bread is hot and crispy.  Take a look at this (yelp. com/biz_photos/mJxt…)!  The preparation time for this is a bit longer than the time for preparing a burrito, but in my opinion well worth it.  The torta was excellent!They have refreshing agua frescas here too.  I've tried both the cantaloupe and the watermelon ones, and loved the watermelon one quite a bit.  Their prices are very gentle on the wallet too considering the large portions you are being fed.  It's cash only though so come prepared.  The restaurant uses recyclable and compostable products and utensils, has outdoor seating and posts a fine looking health score of .  The two young ladies that work there are very nice too.  This is a welcomed addition to my list of nearby lunch spots. Cash only. Located in the parking lot. Generous amounts of chicken and avocado on the salad. Asked for dressing on the side, but they put it on the salad too. DO NOT USE THE HOT SAUCE NEAR THE RECYCLE BIN so crazy hot. I was crying and blowing my nose for nearly  mins. minus a star for priceminus a star for size. i had a carne asada super burrito. with a soda came to about $. More like a baby burrito. Now that I think of it, I could have walked down the street to the taco truck and gotten a super burrito triple the size. #)*@$. Despite the size, flavors were really tasty, fresh black beans and fresh, flavorful rice. Will probably still eat here after shopping at Nordstrom Rack. This place is ok, if you don't mind waiting forever for your food and if you just want something cheap and ""mexican"" to fill you up. I've had the torta here, which was ok. Bland, but descent. I have also just had the boring cheese quesadilla as well since i often crave bland cheesy quesadillas. The quesadilla wins over the torta. I love cheese. If your starving and craving something a bit ""mexican"", this place will do. The torta is delicious!  Took sort of a long time for them to make it considering i was the only one waiting for food, but it tasted so good.  And the beans are all vegetarian woo hoo!I also have to say that on a night when you just need to grab some groceries at Trader Joe's & a quick bite to eat this is an ideal situation. And just FYI: there is only outdoor seating & they only take cash  star because the food doesn't taste bad when it's fresh and their meat taste Good but not like real asada or al pastor and their AGUAS FRESCAS are DELICIOUS. Prices are much cheaper at authentic taquerias and you get larger portions than here. One day for lunch I ordered carne al pastor nachos. . . . what a waste of my money! )the black beans looked like they were old,too watery kinda looked liked mirky water. . yes eww, )the guacamole tasted like  week old really nasty taste )IT WAS COLD, mind you that they had ""just made it to order"". . . i dnt thnk so,they probably gave me some nachos that another customer hadn't came for. Today i ordered the carne asada burrito. . thinking maybe it was going to be a different experience. . . a little better but NO. My burrito was smaller than a baby burrito and for  dollars?! sounds cheap but at an AUTHENTIC TAQUERIA the super burrito is that price or just a tad bit cheaper . o yeah and no chips to go with it. So if you're craving mexican food, go the REAL TAQUERIAS BETTER PRICE, BETTER FOOD, BETTER SATISFACTION I'm not sure why this place is called an ""urban"" taqueria, but maybe its because its located in the center of the busy Trader Joes Bed Bath and Beyond shopping district.  Its perfect for those hungry shoppers (like me!) who need a substantial snack or even a meal.  I've tried the corn soup there, which was way too salty; I couldn't finish it.  But their saving point is their tacos; two soft flour tortillas absolutely stuffed with meat (enough for another taco!).  I've tried the chicken and pork, which were both very good.  My man had the carne asada burrito, which he said was a bit bean heavy and dry in the meat department. He didn't feel too well afterwards either, but it didn't blow into  Still, if you stop by here for a snack, I definitely recommend the tacos!  Oh and they have some really cool hot sauce selections called ""Pain is Good"" (though not very spicy, they are really flavorful and all natural). Despite being non Hispanic, unable to speak Spanish, and unable to cook for shit, I still for whatever reason feel qualified to label Publico and others like it as ""gringo taquerias. ""  That's not necessarily bad; Papalote is pretty good, and Chipotle is ok.  Here are some telltale signs of a gringo taqueria: Modern and/or weird decor It's clean White people work there They have obscure hot sauces instead of Tapatio and the like You have to pay for chips The chips come in sealed packages (that was a new one for me)I ordered a veggie burrito, which was ok.  The beans and rice were a little dried out and not too flavorful.  They used fresh sliced avocado instead of guacamole, which I like, but the avocado wasn't ripe enough.  The grilled veggies were a nice touch, and the cheese was good.  I had to pay extra to get sour cream in there, but the total was still under $. The location is good and the environmentally friendly practices are commendable.  I put some of the garlic hot sauce on my burrito; it was hot for sure but I would much rather have Tapatio or something like it.  I think they did a good job with the eating area; some simple tables semi enclosed by plants.  It slightly blocks out the parking garage that you are surrounded by, and there's some natural light from above. I'm sure I'll try Publico again next time I shop at Trader Joe's during the day (which, I'd forgotten, is an awful experience on a Sunday).  But my impression is that this taqueria is mediocre. Love this place! A great place to swing in for a bite before you brave the crowds at trader joes. The ""street tacos"" are fantastic and an amazing bargain. We've tried all the meats  can't decide which is our favorite Chicken chile verde or al pastor  they are all great. One other great touch: they use ecologically sustainable ingredients and the wrappings, utensils, cups and plates are compostible or recyclable. The seating is a neat place to people watch as the road rage takes over the drivers circling for parking. The street tacos are awesome. $.  each  and two of them together is a decent sized meal. Not only that, but the flavor is kickin'. I mean, really tasty. My wife got the chicken burrito. I only had a couple bites, but it was good, too (she agreed). This place gets  stars partly because of the surprise factor (meaning I'm pleasantly surprised this little cheesy looking, brightly colored shack served good food). I have been back twice now, and each time I test myself a little more with that hot sauce they have that says ""pain is good"" on the bottle (try the Garlic flavor sauce  HOT). And delicious. The carne asada burrito was not very good. I felt sick after eating it.  This place uses a second grade meat.  This place has nothing on Pancho Villa.  The only good thing about this place is the location.  If only they used better ingredients and more flavorful better quality better marinated meat, this place could be decent.  Just based on location if they carry a better tasting product the owner will hit the jackpot. Had two chicken tacos they were very good!I will go back. shittiest tacos ive ever had in my entire life. fucking disgusting. i dont know what it is that they think they are serving but that al pastor is certanly not al pastor. these fucking tacos couldn't be further away from authentic. ive had better tacos from taco bell. So I'm a funemployed gal on the go who likes tiny snacks to keep me going. . . oh and beans.  I really like beans. Enter Stage Left; Publico. for UNDER $ i received a hearty veggie taco with beans, grilled peppers, queso AND avocado.  For gods sakes you can't get a SIDE of avo. for under two dollars at some places.  Perfect for on the go, yummy, not greasy 'happy' mexican food. . . you know what i mean. Trader Joes run with a Publico Taco  my new errand extraordinare Publico has a cute sign that says ""don't go shopping on an empty stomach"" and that is so well placed with a Trader Joes in the same center.  I ordered a taco chicken chile verde and carne asada. The quality was there but the chicken chile verde just seemed to be the pollo asado with chile verde.  I was hoping the chicken had been marinated for hours and had completely absorbed the chile verde.  The flavor seemed to be rather lighter than you might expect.  The carne asada was prepared well but on both tacos I want a small extra touch finer chopped onions, more cilantro, salsa.  There is so much opportunity to make a taco that has a point of difference and keep me coming there before I go to Traders Joe's.   I was not wowed as I like to be with all food but there is so much opportunity to add a few touches to make the visit one that lives beyond its actual visit. This $.  burrito may have just saved me $. Grabbing a bite to eat at Publico just outside of Trader Joe's is a brilliant way to fill up and not shop on an empty tummy. The guys working there were really nice and I love that they are trying to use environmentally friendly ingredients. I had the burrito with pork and it was a little fattier than I would like but the rice and beans were good. Next time I think I'll opt for the veggie burrito that has avacados, cotija cheese, grilled onions and more. Great little taqueria by Trader Joe's.  They were testing out the kitchen today so the meal was free!  I really appreciate the gesture of the meal while they work out the kinks which there were a few.  I would recommend the torta gerry's way with a tortilla and the watermelon agua fresca.  I like the compostable packaging!"|5|100|0|Routine|This inspection has no violations.
El Pollo Supremo 0|4.0|Latin American in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|118|0|3.64285714286|" They have the best chips and salsa! Service is slow even if you call your orders in but the food is good. We always order the chicken w/rice and macaroni salad and of course, extra chips and salsa. As an Caribbean American chef my review says it all! # Stars Love it!! First off, I was a daily customer for some months now, with a consistent experience of sub par customer service, so I wasn't expecting much today. I arrive at the register a couple minutes after their opening to not be greeted by anyone. After waiting a minute for either the man at the grill or the rude little woman packaging tortillas to turn around, I repeatedly yell ""Hello"" and ""Hola"" to get their attention. I was either completely unheard over the silence of an empty restaurant. . Or I was being ignored. Once another customer came in, the man at the grill turns and tells the lady, who took another minute to finish her prep to come to the register.  So that's  minutes of my timed lunch that was wasted just to get their atention. So I order a large chicken soup. In regard to the food, it is one of two reasons I come here: the other is convenience. To top off the wait, the soup I ordered wasn't enough for the $ minimum on card so I couldn't complete my purchase due to not having cash. Even if I did want to add a drink and a side it wouldn't have been enough. Funny how I come everyday, and they let me use my card for transactions even smaller than the one I had placed today. No soup for me. In conclusion I gained hunger, irritation and a sense of regret for previously accepting their awful service. Thanks El Pollo! So if you grew up eating flame broiled chicken in LA like I did (before even el pollo loco), this is the only, I mean only place in San Francisco to get it. The chicken is so flavorful and the skin is crispy and delicious. The salsa is just right, a little bit of a kick but not too much.  times out of ten the chicken is awesome. But occasionally the chicken is overdone or burnt. So yeah, it is not perfect. The sides can be hit or miss. The rice, beans are pretty consistent. The corn, sometimes meh. Everything else is just ok. They used to have more fish and seafood but I guess they didn't sell enough so they don't have it anymore. They actually used to do a killer clam chowder with mucho clams but oh well. Get the taquitos & a Jamaica drink! dalé Been coming here with my family since the early 's it's good to see one of the restaurants or places that I've grown up going to is still open which is a rare thing nowadays. The menu seems to be the same and hasn't changed much. Their chicken is still as good as I can remember, it was juicy and flavorful and I didn't have to wait long for my order which is always great in my book. Can't say I'm a fan of their food. I happened to stumble upon this place while taking a stroll up Mission St and decided to order some chicken to try out. They also had a free taquito deal via Yelp. I ordered a quarter  chicken and taquito to go. I did not care for the taquito at all. It tasted really plain. As for the chicken, it was really dry by the time I arrived home which was a  minute walk. Even the leg meat was dry. The skin has a nice seasoning to it, but I really wish it was moist and juicy. Overall, I won't be back to this restaurant anytime soon. It's just not my cup of tea. amazing grilled chicken! Best Pollo Asado in town!! Hands down. Not many people understand the texture that a well prepared pollo asado entails. The chicken is savory and juicy when fresh out the broiler. Yet still very tasty when a bit dry. I've been looking around for a spot like this. Glad I found it! Would definitely recommend! Una estrella es la categoria que le doy pues tienen un servicio pesimo, he ido hoy con mi familia a comer a este lugar y estoy bien decepcionado , soy cubano y se lo que es un mojo para yuca , por favor! el mojo no es solo aceite y ajo,pero lo peor es el servicio. En ningun restaurante de San Francisco cobran por el agua de la llave , esto es realmente ridiculo , he pagado dos dolares por dos vasitos de agua para mis ninos y la han cobrado como si fuera agua de botella, luego , al momento de pedir servilletas y cajas para llevar la comida senti como si me estuvieran haciendo un favor y ni siquiera fueron suficientes para empacar. Perdieron un cliente!One star for the worst customer service. I ate there with my family today and I am very disappointed. I am Cuban and I know what mojo for yucca should be like. Please! Mojo is not just oil and garlic. But the worst is their service. I don't know of any restaurant in San Francisco that makes you pay for tap water! Ridiculous! I paid two dollars for two cups of water for my children and they charged me as if it were a bottle of water. Then when I asked for napkins and a to go box, it was as if they were doing me a favor and it wasn't even enough for the food we bought. They just lost another customer!! This is definitely ""The Real Los Pollos Hermanos""  and it's really good! I believe ""zesty"" is the word. Everyone likes zesty!The chicken is great, the sides are great, and the price is definitely right. The chicken soup is also fantastic. Great little hole in the wall that makes me glad I live in this neighborhood. Chicken is good if you have  min to hang around and wait for it. I have been there possibly  times and each time the wait gets longer and longer even though their main food is chicken! I went in this last time and I was not told the wait time was  minutes until after I paid. I was pretty upset and watched the same reaction from every customer coming in. A few were smart and asked about the wait and walked out instead. I sat and watched along with about  other waiting customers as the workers packed  trays and trays of chicken for larger orders that were being picked up yet the measly  piece chicken I ordered. took exactly  minutes and to boot their bathroom was out of order! This place is like a mom and pop El Pollo Loco that is less clean, and less tasty. What's nice, however, is that the restaurant offers a wide menu, even offering plantain as a side dish. I really wanted to like this place (especially since they had sweet plantain!). but unfortunately  chicken was dry, our taquitos stale, and sides were just  ""Meh"""|4|96|2|Routine Inspection| Food safety certificate or food handler card not available Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings
El Pollo Supremo 1|4.0|Latin American in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|118|1|3.55555555556|" We only order the organic chicken which we love.  Their chicken soup is also very good.  If you want flame cooked chicken this is the place.  Good, Cheap and Organic.  Have always gotten good food from here and glad they are near buy.  Wish they were open later. I was totally looking around for Gustavo Fring behind the counter.  And maybe Hank and Walter White in the parking lot. But all I found was good chicken.  And a cool ""super chicken"" mascot. I am quite happy to have an El Pollo Loco knockoff in the hood. Just judging from the chicken, Pollo Loco wins out, but I give Supremo a very close nd place.  I'll be back. El pollo NO supremo. You know how when you're starving everything taste good? This was not the case. I ordered the Fish and Chix ( pieces of chicken and  piece of fish) and it wasn't satisfying at all. The pieces of chicken didn't have much meat and the outer layer was charred. My fish was huge, the length of the plate, but it tasted disgusting. Barely had any fish in it and the tar tar sauce was super plain. Filet O Fish from McDonalds has better tar tar sauce! Horchata was not refreshing and it tasted watered down. Also, after I checked in a deal came up. Would've been nice to know I could've gotten free taquitos before I made a purchase. Healthy, Cheap, Fast & Family owned. Is there really anything else I could ask for? I have been coming to this place for years now and I love getting take out! I eat out a lot and I'll admit most of the time it's not healthy so this is my go to place when I need something simple and healthy. Looking from the outside it may not be anything special but wait until you try their chicken! It's worth the drive so I say go and be surprised. Good food.  Chicken, nom nom.  Just don't come close to closing time. . . lol it's the last pieces, d'oh!  Tres leches cake was great though!Service = okay. Prices = cheap. The first time I ate at El Pollo Supremo was in ! Ever since then they've been my favorite place to get some yummy yummy chicken and cuban inspired food. When I was getting my fix last week, I noticed that the chicken is now certified organic!  I was very happy with the quality of meat that they are providing for there customers. Just a few suggestions when ordering here, the plantains are AMAZING! The black beans and rice are also super flavorful and pair wonderfully with the plantains chicken and horchata! m. . . . just making myself hungry writing about it all :p I havent yet tried the fish tacos (saving them for my next visit)! Super excited! Wow the chicken was soo good.  I liked the fish tacos, but they were fried, and that was unexpected.  The platanos and yucca were all very yummy, we had boiled fried and sweet  everything was pretty fantastic.  The corn tortillas could have been better, but we're picky. Chicken DRY and too salty.  Black beans and rice ok, but nothing special.  Burrito tasted fine but kind of small for the price.  Will we return?  Nope. I don't know if they had a bad day, but I was so disappointed to discover that the salsa packages both had mold on them, and the plantains, that I usually love, was fried in such rancid oil that it was uneatable. We used to get the chicken dinner when my kids lived at home, and I had looked forward to the return. The sweet potato fries saved the evening, the chicken was fine, but no tortillas with a  piece chicken dinner?"|4|88|5|Routine| Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 5/29/2014 ] Unclean unmaintained or improperly constructed toilet facilities  [ date violation corrected: 5/29/2014 ] Improper storage of equipment utensils or linens  [ date violation corrected: 5/29/2014 ] Inadequate warewashing facilities or equipment  [ date violation corrected: 5/29/2014 ] Moderate risk vermin infestation  [ date violation corrected: 5/29/2014 ]
El Pollo Supremo 2|4.0|Latin American in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|118|2|3.75|" My family used to order food here during my middle school years but stop going by the time my brothers and i were in high school. Then my mom finally decided to order food here again after + years since she was craving for their grill chicken. Since then, we started to come back again. My family usually either the  pieces or  pieces family pack including two dishes (usually the beans and rice) and tortillas and salsa, and order couple corns as well. Their chickens are always good whenever we order especially if you're hungry. But Sometimes the chickens can be dry since the chickens may be sitting on the grill for a while. Beans and rice are average. Their corn, its usually flavorless whenever we order but its still have the juice when you bite into the corn. Will definitely come back here whenever we crave for their chicken or don't feel like cooking since its so close to my house As many times as I pass this place by, I finally tried their chicken a couple weeks ago. MEH. Service was good, but chicken was dry. Like, super dry. Basically they grill a ton of chicken all day and stack them on top of each other until someone orders. Not as many sides to choose from compared to other restaurants within walking distance. This place has a lot of potential, though. They really need to step their chicken game up. I don't get it. That's what I used to say back in school when calculus would try to be explained to me. I still don't get it. Which brings me to El Pollo Supremo. My wife would rave about how good this place is and how the chicken is and how her family likes to go here.  So we came here today. It's Sunday so they serve Lechon Cuban Style sandwiches. Which I usually would like.  But this place is called ""Pollo"" Supremo, not Lechon Supremo.  So here's what we ordered:Pollo Torta:  it was dry.  Dry as heck!  Chicken was dry.  Bread was dry.  This sandwich needed lube bad.  Mayo, salsa or something.  Lechon on the side:   I ate the Lechon with some corn tortillas.  It was also very dry.  Like the Mojave Desert. I ordered a soda and they handed me a little kiddie cup.  I think if they realized how dry their food was they would be giving me a large cup of soda.  Something to wash this food down with. Someone please explain why my wife likes this place.  Because Pollo Supremo is much like calculus.  I just don't get it. i know how to eat and i love this shit My second visit to El Pollo Supremo was a bit disappointing, and I figured out that the key to the place must be timing. The cook at El Pollo Supremo evidently cooks a meal for the dinner rush that he expects in the early evening and then, in my case? When my friends and I rolled in at eight or eight thirty? Served us the same dinner rush chicken hours later. The first time I visited El Pollo Supremo early and the food was good, hot and fresh, the second time my friends and I visited we were evidently the unwilling recipients of old tough dry chicken. While I appreciate the low cost of El Pollo Supremo in general? Nobody should have been fed this chicken, it should have been bound with mayonnaise into a salad, made into soup or thrown away. The problem that half of the reviewers had with dry chicken, coupled with the ecstatic reviews of other reviewers, as well as my own personal experience has lead me to believe that they do this the same way everyday. In a perfect world the restaurant owner will read this review, make a little bit less chicken early and try not to serve old chicken.  In the world that we live in I suspect and suggest eating here at six PM!Also? Several reviewers loved and recommended the flautas. I am not in agreement. The chicken in the flautas had an odd flavor to me, they were greasy, the chicken filling dryish and not that flavorful, although the guacamole and salsa that El Pollo Supremo make are quite good? I like it better on chicken. Next time I will come early and stick with simple chicken, beans and rice and yucca. Seriously? If the owner of this place cares about his customers then he will pay attention to the complaints in so many reviews of dryness and make better kitchen decisions. It is like eating at two very different restaurants and a completely inconsistent dining experience. Was visiting a friend in Daly City so we rolled over here since we were hungry and it reminded us of Pollos Hermanos. Walked inside, and noticed everything was clean and looked pleasant. Prices were nominal for SF. I had the Burrito Supreme(?) and my friend the torta. My burrito was decent tasting and well sized. Reminded me of El Pollo Loco, so not bad. My friend got the torta. . . I should've copied. I initially wondered why it was so pricey, even for SF, but once he opened it, it was monstrous, and came with fries and a drink. Solid. Will return next time I'm in town. This palce is so bomb. It's like a Mexican style BBQ place. They BBQ these whole chickens and they are so good, the skin is crispy and rendered down to no fat. They have a YELP CHECK IN OFFER if you check in you get free chicken taquitos and they are SO good!! Best taqutos I've ever had white meet legit chicken and the crispiest tortilla with no grease. YUM! The salsa is the freshest salsa you've ever had. The rice, oh that rice. . . . does me so good. The beans are standard, we always take the left overs home and mash them for refireds the next day. Oh and if you get the family dinner thing (whole chicken, cut up, tortillas, beans, rice, salsa) you'll have enough for   people for  meals or   ppl easy for one meal, jsut get extra tortillas. The chicken taquitos are a MUST have. This place has been a family favorite for years and is always a treat. Good price for a great family meal. I absolutely love their roasted chicken. Really don't know what else to say except it's great tasting and worth it. Their fried black beans and rice are also a favorite and worth trying. Add a side of fries and some horchata and you simply have a great meal. The staff are friendly, parking's usually good and it's not a bad place for either eat in or take out, the food's what matters!"|4|96|2|Routine| Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 10/30/2013 ] Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 10/30/2013 ]
El Pollo Supremo 3|4.0|Latin American in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|118|3|3.91891891892|" EPS has been here for years and it looks like a food institution worth of triple D. . . . but after having lunch here, it's pretty much certified wack. A tasty looking pork sandwich (pan con lechon) poster brought me and my lunch crew in like fat kids to a cake. False advertising since they only have it on weekends. (yelp. com/biz_photos/cxsx…)I settled with their  pc grilled chicken w/tortillas side and soda for $. Should be their specialty right? Well, the tiny barely meaty pieces came out inedibly dry. It's like they used aneroxic midget chickens and then overcooked them.  I'm not really sure if it was disturbing, disgusting, or delicious but their salsa was previously frozen so it's more like a slurpee. They're fish stick taco ain't worth the trip either.  (yelp. com/biz_photos/cxsx…) (yelp. com/biz_photos/cxsx…)Menu and grill shot (yelp. com/biz_photos/cxsx…) Really, really, really great chicken!  It is so moist, and with a bite, all the meat falls right off the bone.  It's crazy how quickly you will devour a leg, wing, and a thigh!  There are many types of combos that you can order.  They even have burritos and such.  I came here with my dad and we got a  piece meal that came with a drink, fries, and tortilla for $. .  We killed it quickly and were still hungry.    star for taking so long to give us our food. forgiving to give me my drink, and when I asked for it, she said, Didn't I give it to you already? dad told me he wanted coffee after the transaction, and when I gave her my credit card a second time, she said, You don't have any cash? . __. Overall, great chicken, not so much the service. This place has really grown on me. As one of the few solid food joints in my neighborhood, we have started going here more and more. They have a great family meal that can feed   people for $. The chicken is tasty (but sometimes is can be a little dry). It comes with tortillas, salsa and two sides. The sides are pretty standard but the Spanish rice and black beans are solid. They can sometimes be a little bit inconsistent. For example, the platanos that we had from them recently were really dry. But, the time before that, they were perfect. It is not a place to go out of your way for but a great place to check out if you are in the area. One few places in the bay with real Cuban side dishes and CHICKENS!They even have Pan Con Lechon on the weekends. The owner is really friendly. Where can you find a roasted chicken restaurant with a Mexican touch?  The Outer Mission of course!  Just pull into the convenient lot in front of the kitchen just off Mission St. There were only a couple tables occupied around noon time, so no long waits.  I tried their # combo:  pieces of chicken, a side salad (cole slaw, potato, or macaroni), and some salsa and tortillas, and a small soda, for $.  + tax.  Beware, the salsa is hot!  I found the chicken a tad dry but was seasoned well.  Also, I was able to upgrade my soda to an horchata for $. .  However, the cole slaw had a slightly odd odor to it. Love this place, I've been coming to El Pollo Supremo since I was a little kid, I remember they used to have a location on th an mission, and on th an mission, they even had a location in San Mateo on b street, they have all closed down except for this one located on Geneva. the chicken here is Delicious, its basically Cuban style chicken, and they have this Cuban salsa that is so bomb lol people who have eaten there know what I'm talking about, it kinda looks like pico de gallo. . . . . . . but its  times better lol, the Rice isn't the best but it goes well with the chicken, I always have an order of black beans on the side. The only downside to this place, is the location, parking can be a bitch sometimes, and the neighborhood isn't the best, a couple of years ago there were bullet holes in the wall lol, but the area has cleaned up a lot since then. I recommend this place for breakfast lunch or dinner lol if your in the city and are in the mood for some Latin style chicken you should definitely check this place out. Oh and for all the people on here comparing this place to EL Pollo Loco, Hang yourselves.    :) The chicken is always good, sometimes a bit dry but never BAD. I guess my only complaint would be the lack of variety on the menu and maybe more white meat on their other dishes like the torta or taquitos/flautas. The closest thing to El Pollo Loco that this area has to offer. . . it's actually a bit better quality, but pricier also!The chicken there is excellent. . . perfectly moist and nicely flavoredTheir fried shrimp is awesome too. . . not over breaded or overcooked like most fast food placesThe fried plantains are so so though. . . the one time I got them they were kinda tough on the inside and burnt on the outside.  They were still palatable, but I've definitely had betterFlan on the other hand was awesome, and it's the real kind, not that jello y sh*t that most places try to pass off as flan.  Tasted almost as good as homemadeThe place does have its own parking, it's super small (like   spaces) I go to El Pollo Supremo. . . for their fish and chips. The chicken isnt all that  in my opinion. Their fish and chips are good. Not too greasy and a good portion. Its a bit more pricey than the chicken, but its worth the difference to me. I used to think there was no better chicken than this, until I discovered El Pollo Loco, the chicken taste it better and the cool thing about it is that they have all different type of salsas outside for your convenience. Also they give you the cup and the fountain drink machine is outside for free refills, at el Pollo Supremo you have to pay full price for your refill and frankly the building is very old and beat up. El Pollo Supremo is located in the east and south bay and trust me you won't look at El Pollo Supremo the same ever again. It will look more like El POLLO SUPREMGHETTO This is the BEST grilled chicken in San Francisco!  I have been going there for  years, and it's still as delicious as ever. My family of  gets a family pack dinner with sides and everything for under $  and it's FANTASTIC!  You can't beat that. So as we are running down mission tryin to train as we pass up all these restaurants my friend tells me this spot is a good place to pick up dinner. Hint: if you are tryin to train Mission is not a good spot to run cuz you end up feeling hungry as u run by all the restaurants.  Anyways after a really good workout we decided to pick up some grilled chicken, black beans and rice, and some fried bananas.  The restaurant is reasonable priced comparable to other chicken joints like popeye's.  They have a wide variety and selections on the menu.  So we ordered the  piece meal which comes with tortillas and fresh made salsa.  Hm their salsa is fresh and spicy just how I like it.   I never thought to eat grilled chicken with salsa but it works.  I would go back and order dinner again when I am not craving fried chicken and want a healthier alternate.  They also serve  tres leches and flan. . yum! When I went to Mexico and, i tried the chicken and rice out there I never thought that I would EVER find anything like it EVER again. . . My boyfriend decided to take me here because I was starving as usual nothing new lol. Okay well, the point is that WOW. . . this food literally made my stomach absolutely happy it was almost as good as the chicken I ate in Mexico and the SALSA was delicious! I honestly can say I'm a fan too bad I live far from it or, else I would definitely come here more often! I feel like even though the place doesn't look super appealing. . . they do have an awesome name ""El Pollo Supremo"" its pretty intriguing give it a chance and I'm sure you won't be disappointed. . I haven't tried all the things on the menu but I will when I go back again (: I haven't eaten here for years since I decided to be health conscience. The chicken here is Da Da bomb. And I love the spanish rice here. Uber good. I had the  pc rice and bean combo and it was delicious! I Also tried the friend plantains for dessert and they were great as well. This place is an overall good grilled chicken fix for a great price. I highly recommend that you try it out. How could I not stop at a place called El Pollo Supremo??I wasn't disappointed. The chicken seasoning was delicious!! And the chicken was moist. Beans & rice were decent, too. $ with tax included for / chicken, beans rice & soda was a little steep (I can get a whole chicken with no sides  my preference  at Pete's for $) but the chicken was so delicious I'm kinda ok with it. pretty good chickenthe salsa is a little bland A lot of my friends from the city are familiar with the place and have all had great things to say about it, so when I was in the area I check it out and . . . . by far, THE best grilled chicken! I also have tried the black beans and rice, plaintains and sour cream, fried zucchini,  and their fish tacos Mmm! Every thing was so delicious, the staff was super friendly, and everyone eating there was so into their food. Def a great lil sit down spot that has some really, really good food to choose from. I highly recommend you try it! The chicken is pretty good, the spice marinade is definitely yummier than rotisserie chicken from Safeway and Costco.  It's more expensive though, almost $ for one chicken; you can get  from Costco for that price. I've been there a few times, the first time was the best.  The last couple of times the chicken was too dry. I wanted to get something for lunch near my friend's place who lives about a few miles from here. Driving down Mission. . . I stumbled upon this restaurant with the chicken & fish sign. I happen to love both myself and there was a small parking lot, so I thought it was a win already. Well I decided to get the fish & chips. They are not the best I've had, but they are decent and they got me full. The french fries were pretty good. What I like about this restaurant is the portions they gave me for how much I paid for the food. If I ever come here next time I definitely want to try the chicken. Good ass chicken! LOVE LOVE LOVE Pollo Supremo. I had the food from Pollo Supremo catered at my sons birthday party. The service is WONDERFUL and best of all the food is GREAT. The owners are super friendly and always a pleasure to see. I enjoy everything about Pollo Supremo and happy that their location is convinient. I always stop by when im craving some good food, especially when i want a home type meal for dinner or lunch when im not home. I will definately be choosing pollo supremo for my next big event. Thank you so much for the wonderful service and the great food! PS. i LOVE the chicken. ;) YOU MUST VISIT POLLO SUPREMO IN SAN FRANCISCO!! Not bad, but depending on who's the cook that day it can be hit or miss. A couple things that stand out on the menu that I recommend are the yucca with garlic sauce and the tres leches. It's cool that El Pollo Supremo takes cards because a lot of places in the neighborhood do not. This is what happen if Colonel Sanders was born in Mexico, rather than Kentucky. Lol. Honestly, EL Pollo Supremo is so so if you take away the hype, you just have a normal fast food joint. I think people mistake a place  being popular as a good place to eat, without really thinking, why am I eating here. The food in my opinion is so so, and nothing really about it, stands out as super great ass food. El Pollo Supremo is known for two things: one for chicken, the other is fish. The chicken menu has a good selection of cheap food: the charboiled chicken is served with tortillas. If charboiled chicken isn't your idea meal: get a chicken sandwich. You can get additional orders of these items:(White Rice, Morco Rice, Spanish Rice, Pinto Beans, Black Beans, Potato Salad, Macaroni Salad, Cole Slaw, Green Salad, Corn, Tostones, Plantains,  Taquitos, Fremch Fries, Onion Rings, and Yucca). On the fish menu: Fish and Chips, Fresh Fish Tacos and Fish Sandwiches. You can get both in a fish and chicken combo: served with rice, beans or fries. Veggie Head: Try the Fried Mushrooms. Yummy in my tummy!All fried items are cook with canola oil. Kinda wish it was vegatable oil, but oh well. No cholesterol doesn't mean it's healthy, it has bad things likeany other fast food place. They do have daily specials: ask them. Does do catering. Location: the place looks like any sit down fast food joint, it's semi clean, but some of the employee couldn't understand English well. That being said, do watch out for crazy ass people in the driveway parking lot. When I was here, this crazy homless women was trying to get into people's cars while they were driving in. Crazy! This place is okay if you feel like not cooking and you want something quick to go. . . grilled chicken is cool with beans and rice and salsa. I can say i eaten here more than a couple of times due to it is in my neighborhood and once  i'm tired of eating burritos and chinese food. The chicken is flavorfull. I also like white meat, so the dryness was not a problem for me. I ordered the combo # and at the bottom of the menu is says that combos come with tortillas, salad and salsa. We (my Husband and I) only got the tortillas. We never got salsa or a salad. They also kind of messed up on our order, but they were quick and happy to fix it. This place is awesome!! Best chicken I've ever had. I love the fried bananas and the chicken flautas it's a must try!! My bf has been coming here ever since they first opened. If your around the area come and grab a bite of this tasty chicken! you must go here for the grilled chicken, and nothing more. The rice is dry, and beans are soggy, and the tortillas are not hand made. I went to this place, and had the Chicken Burrito(big picture behind the register), not what I expected. To sum it up, chicken good, everything else, not so good. Wonderful, wonderful chicken.  It goes great with their amazing salsa.  I don't know anywhere else in the city where you can get grilled chicken this good and this cheep.  The marinade is amazing, and the chicken are cooked on a flame grill.  I also recommend the black beans with rice side.  Really good cuban rice, loaded with wonderful flavor. I had the whole chicken here and it was very flavorful but very very dry.  The reason why I rarely order chicken is because I don't like choking on the dryness.  I've come to compare every chicken that I have with costco chicken because costco chicken is the bomb (it is also cheaper than el pollo supremo).  I don't think paying $ for a whole chicken is cheap.  I'm not sure if the good flavor overcomes the dryness but I don't think I will return here again.  Pros: flavorful chicken. Cons: so very very dry.  You better know the heimlich maneuver because you'll need it when you choke. After eating tacos from the El Tonayense Taco Truck yesterday, I was craving for a taco around dinner time. Picked up my bf at the Bart station. Told him ""Let's go to El Pollo. I want a taco. . . ""So we got there and I noticed they had a sign. It was something I've never seen before. What the?! Could it be?! They're finally serving burritos here?! LIMITED TIME ONLY!?!? Quick, someone punch me in the face! I must be dreaming!  Oh. My. Gawd. Forget the taco! I'm getting an effing burrito instead! Um. . . there goes my taco craving. . . My chicken burrito was DAMN GOOD and HUGE! It also came with a side of chips. Also very tasty. I'll pay $ $ for it anyday! Next time I come here, I'm hoping it'll still be on the menu. *crosses finger*Btw, their chicken is delicious! My bf loves it! =) Yum!  Decided to venture out of my comfort zone, and try something new in the 'hood.  I felt DARING and went to El Pollo.  I've been trying to eat as healthy as I can with my husband, who is NOT on a diet whatsoever, so I had to find a spot where we both can enjoy something.  Place was crowded on a Saturday afternoon, friendly cashiers/employees.  We ordered the  piece chicken w/ beans and rice.   I PREFER breast/white meat.  So dry to me is not bad.  I had a semi dry breast that had tons of flavor.  I enjoyed the breast to myself, and my husband had the other  pieces.   He also ordered the chicken taquitos, that he devoured.  I will def be back to order some chicken breasts. . I was tempted to order french fries, but I had to stay on track. . . eff diets! I second Perci N's review of this place to a tee, so rather than wasting my time typing up something about this place, here's a link to his. . . yelp. com/biz/el pollo su…And I will also add that the tortillas seemed steamed, or even microwaved, so when they cooled off they were stuck together. Peeling them apart only damaged the tortilla, further ruining the experience. Gosh, can't even get the most basic things right! Best grilled chicken of all time. There is nothing like Pollo Supremo grilled chicken. It's a totally different style of chicken that most people are not used to. The chicken is so tasty! Most of the side are good, but the grilled plantains are phenomenal. The decor could use some work, but the chicken makes up for it. If ravenous zombie vampires were to engulf the city, rest assured that this place will be tha safest place in the mission. A garlic lovers grilled chicken.  Minus one star.  one day juicy tender goodness, the next sub saharan desertBut when they dont dry the little bird out it is oh soo good.  The only thing better would be beer can chicken slowed cooked with an offset grill. . . but who has time for that. El Pollo Blando. Tasteless and dry grilled chicken. Why is this place so highly regarded? Either Yelpers have never heard of El Pollo Loco  more than likely, considering most Yelpers are locavores and/or abhor chains (at least in public)  or they've never actually grilled a chicken themselves. Actually, I'd guess both. And my god, the worst beans and rice I've ever had. You thought the chicken was bland and dry? Try the beans and rice. It makes for better wall paste than side dish. Kudos for having a parking lot. In this hood, that's like being the only guy in the tribe with a daughter worth not just one, but two goats. We always order the Family Deal which consists of grilled chicken,  sides, and tortillas. We'll also throw in some taquitos. For sides, we go for the black beans and rice. Everything is so yummy.  If you feel like having chicken other than KFC  then this is a great alternative. They actually have parking which is a plus and service is fast and friendly. ze chicken was delicious.  everything else was ""eh. "" this place is really all about the chicken. the seasoning was done perfectly but i wish i could say the same about the fish tacos. just get the chicken. Fast, friendly service. Cheap, good food. Parking right up front. No wonder this hole in the wall place has been doing business in the exact same location for so long. The grilled chicken is SO tender and SO tasty i usually get a half chicken and eat it with tortillas & their (really hot) salsa & it reminds me of ""back in the day. "" Their chicken taquitos haven't changed prices in like  years it's like $.  for . It's served with sour cream and guac and is grubbin. Their sides are pretty wonderful, too. The fried plantains & sour cream, the onion rings its a good, cheap way to add to your meal. Man, I hope this place never goes away; it would be like taking away a part of my (delicious chicken filled) childhood. The neighborhood stores have changed a bit throughout the years, but El Pollo Supremo stays the same. Srsly, just take a look at their decor and uniforms! The location is a bit sketchy, but not as scary as the chicken joint down the block. Chicken is tender and juicy with a nice crisp skin. They have way too many side dishes available to choose from and I recommend the fried plantains. It's fairly cheap as long as you don't go overboard with the sides. I normally do not Yelp every place I go because you don't think of your regular eateries as places to yelp about. But today I changed my mind like Keyshia Cole since I once again had their juicy chicken. I always get the Family Deal($) with a whole chicken, large sides and plenty tortillas and salsa. Plus you wait like  mins for it. I'll forever love this place. Hands down this is THE BEST grilled chicken I have ever tasted. Try it and you'll be hooked too!!Location is hard to get to but they do have  parking in front for about   cars. Unlike the comments by other yelpers, eating in is perfectly fine. The decor and ambiance is like any other fast food place like Burger King or MacD's and it's clean. another great hole in the wall at the good ol' neighborhood. my family and i have been getting the grilled chicken here for years.  its simply juicy and very tender.  i also love their fried bananas with the sour cream.  simple, good, and reasonably priced food at its best. This place is not going to change your life and its not a fancy place by any means, but the chicken is great! Some grilled chicken, torillas, and a side of spanish rice and you're set. I've been meaning to try some of their fish offerings but haven't done it yet.  I'll have to do that soon. Support this spot! Tried to come here again and it was open this time :)While I like the char grilled aspect of the chicken, nothing else really stood out for me. It didn't appear to have been marinated or have additional flavouring. . . I guess they're relying on you to eat it with the salsa. It wasn't that juicy either, so all in all nothing special. If it was in my neighbourhood I might check it out once in a while, but definitely not worth the trek all the way out to the excelsior just to eat it. Seriously the best chicken ever. Tangy, and tender and juicy. Get there early before they sell out! The best thing about it is it's in a neighborhood most douchebags consider ""sketchy"" (ie: there's no Starbucks). Everyone eats here, Hookers, gangsters, businessmen, families, cab drivers, construction workers et al. They eat here because it's delicious and there's no bullshit. This is a surprisingly tasty hole in the wall Mexican style chicken joint.  It's not a great neighborhood, and you might easily drive right on by thinking ""no way I'm eating in there"" but you might want to reconsider.  They mainly serve grilled chicken, and I must say, it's GREAT.  They roast it until the skin is crispylicious and yet the meat is tender and juicy.  You also get your choice of side dishes and a couple of warm tortillas.  They have great horchata too. Now here's the part that will really blow your mind.  They have a private parking lot!  I think this is my first ever SF review that didn't include ""parking jihad"".  Of course getting there is driving jihad or mass transit jihad.  They have small tables for groups up to , and large tables for groups up to . Best of all, it's CHEAP. It's damn good chicken. Crispy skin, moist, flavorful.  I've tried most of their sides and can easily go without any of them. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about this place and their  delicious chicken. One of the best chickens I have ever tried. Very Juicy and tasty. My family buys chicken from here when we have big parties or just to eat on a Sunday afternoon. Their black beans are scrumptious as well as their fried plantain. The people here are very friendly and will serve you as best as they can. The place is small and can get pretty packed on a Sunday afternoon but is very good for catering large parties.  Wish they had more places like this with good quality fast food! yummy chicken The workers are strangely really nice.  I mean they don't really get tips, so what's the incentive?  It does have a homey feel to it indeed.  I got down to my  monster of a meal:   pieces of Chicken. . . which amounts to half a chicken, beans, rice,  pieces of taquitos (free), tortilla, and horchata.  I finished everything but the beans.  The chicken is indeed very good  very moist and tasty charred skin (best part in my opinion).  The taquitos came free through Entertainment Rewards, and I swear to God they came with sour cream that had a hint of banana.  Will definitely go back if I'm ever craving chicken, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, not because of anything off putting, but it's a bit far too go for just grilled chicken.  It's only a few notches better than El Pollo Loco. I don't know how it happens but whenever I'm in SF I end up in this place. It's a solid place to get a good meal. The food is usually fresh. The only thing I don't like about this place is that it is kinda dirty sometimes. Parking is a little tough. . . . . . but. . . . meh. If you're a grilled chicken lover you won't be dissapointed. Pollo Supremo is the sort of place you just don't see anymore: Mom & Pop fast food with high quality ingredients.  It reminds me of the taco stands we'd go to in Southern California when I was a kid.  And unike a lot of places like it, in the neighborhood (e. g. Beeps), it doesn't seem to have changed hands a dozen times and been run into the ground. Now let's talk about the chicken.  It's really really really really good.  The meat is fresh and the pieces are big and juicy.  It's some of the best Mexican grilled chicken I've ever had.  The flautas are also a whole lot of yummy!  I'm thrilled that they seem to stay busy.  Yep, I'm definitely a fan. Supremo indeed!  You know I loves me some chicken. In fact, I sort of have a chicken problem, and this is where I get my fix.  Chicken, rice, beans, salsa, and tortillas; m hmm, its a fiesta thrown in honor of my belly. My baby is laid up recovering from knee surgery, so dinner plans fell to me tonight.  Decided to take a shot at this interesting looking chicken take out place and WOW was I impressed.  The chicken is juicy and super tasty, the taquitos are fantastic, the rice and beans delicious and the salsa good and spicy.  Got the family pack ( pieces chicken, tortillas, salsa,  large sides) and requested the above mentioned taquito deal.  The girl taking my order didn't seem aware of any such offer on Yelp, so I paid .  instead of .  for the taquitos.  No biggie, total came to $, and we have plenty of leftovers for later.  Minor quibbles are not getting the discount on the taquitos, and you have to pay extra if you want any of the more interesting sides (yucca in garlic sauce, fried plantains) with your combo meal.  Still well worth it and I'll make sure to report on their other items like the tilapia. I've lived three blocks from this place for a year and a half but only got around to trying it a couple of nights ago. I gotta say, it's pretty solid. The place itself is a relic from another restaurant era. It's got a charming, beat quality to it not overly clean and slick like all the chain restaurant's these days. As for the food, the chicken was nicely grilled, moist and flavorful. The meat was falling off the bone, the skin was crisped to perfection, the fat nicely rendered. We got the family meal deal (comes in at just under $, or just under $ with the entertainment rewards % off coupon) that comes  pieces of chicken, tortillas and salsa, and two sides. This would probably be enough for  people with average appetites. Or dinner for two and a decent sized lunch leftover. We opted for the basic pinto beans and spanish rice for our sides. These were nothing special, but accompanied the chicken well. Some of the other sides looked pretty good (definitely gotta try the tostones and fried plantains, which unfortunately can't be combined with the family meal deal). The price is right (especially with the coupon), the vibe is classic, and the food is tasty. Next time you've got a hankerin' for some chicken, walk past Popeye's and hit up El Pollo Supremo. Update //:They apparently downgraded their guacamole from the real deal (i. e. actual avocado) to runny green glop. Skip it. Other than that El Pollo Supremo still does it up proper! chicken pros = tasty & juicy. . . marinated & grilled just rightchicken cons = small piecesall meals come with salsa & warm tortillas. side dishes to try: plantains, rice & beans This restaurant is a paid advertiser on yelp, and their advertising worked!  I saw the photo with the chicken and fresh veggies, and decided to make the trek down there to try it out.  I was extremely disappointed to find that they no longer have any fresh vegetables on their menu.  False advertising!The chicken was pretty decent.  But I probably won't go back because when i eat chicken, i want it with veggies. I love the grilled chicken here. .  starsThis review is mainly for their chicken. The chicken is tasty and juicy MOST times, but it's hit or miss. I've had occasions where it's a tad bit on the dry side. Here's how you do it  Strip the chicken, line them up into the warm tortilla, throw some salsa (taste and looks homemade) right on top, roll it up, and put it right into your mouth. Yum! All the flavors right into your mouth . . . just delicious.  We've had sides of their large size fries and onion rings. Although nothing special, they're still good. Back to their salsa, i like it so much i use it to eat w/my fries. Uh huh, fries! No ketchup needed. A whole chicken is always enough for my family of . Friendly staff and enough seating during lunch. Its never been overly crowded in all the years i've come here for lunch. Empty a few times in fact. Parking is very limited. . . probably enough for   cars. Good for catering a party. Bathroom is outback and is pretty nasty so avoid if possible. Tasty chicky and fantastico sides  platanos and yuca  yumMayMay!! Best Cheap Chicken AwardSince I've turned my nose up to fried chicken I've become quite the grilled chicken connoisseur and El Pollo Supremo takes the cake for the fast food category.  The recommended method of consumption is putting chicken, potato salad, rice, beans & salsa in a tortilla and eating like a little soft taco.  That's fun for a while but I usually resort to just digging straight into the chicken and eating the sides separately. The oyster sandwich is another favorite they've perfected in my book.  It's true. I love the fried plantains. . . . . dee lish us.  Can get pricey if your eyes are bigger than your stomach. Pollo Supremo stands strong in my running list of take out neighborhood restaurants. Grilled chicken, or fish of your choice off the menu (catfish, snapper, tilapia. . . ), is served well seasoned on a bed of steamed broccoli, zucchini, baby carrots, and onions. The portions are mid sized, so if your family eats a lot, err on the side of ordering more to have some left over for later. YUMMO Mexican style roasted chicken the skin is crisp and tasty and the flesh moist.  I don't know what spice rub they use on the chickens, but its delicious and imparts the most wonderful flavor.  That, combined with the smokey taste from the grill, makes the chickens here almost perfect. I'm not a huge fan of the sides, but I do love the fresh, warm tortillas and salsa that come with every meal.  You have the option of eating the chicken on its own, but the meal becomes phenomenal when you eat the chicken wrapped in the tortilla with a hefty spoonful of their salsa.  The salsa is very fresh, full of oinions and tomatoes, and just a hint of heat.  Good thing they provide plenty of napkins at the table because your hands will get messy.  Prices have gone up in recent years, but the chicken is so worth every penny, especially when its coming fresh off the grill.  Occasionally, if you are there during off peak hours, the chicken won't be as fresh and therefore, a little dry.  The area isn't the nicest, but the staff here has always been friendly and we've never had any problems while dining in.  Parking spaces can be a bit tight, but they usually have a few open.  Overall, El Pollo Supremo makes one of the best roast chickens in the city and its one of my favorite stand bys. Who cares if it is not in the nicest area. . . The chicken is always scrumpcious.  The best part. . . a hidden little gem. . . is the salsa! Don't know what they put in it, but I can never get enough. . . . hm salsa. . . I love Pollo Supremo  the chicken dinners are amazing  roasted chicken and great tortillas and the sides. . . I especially love the black rice and platanos. Yummers!The parking lot is a bit difficult to maneuver, especially when things are busy  but it's worth the chicken. They lose one star for having lost two big to go orders  for the worst of the two (a community event  order of  taquitos) they gave me a gift certificate, though, which I thought was nice. i spent some time down in LA and loved ""El Pollo Loco"". That's one if the only thing i would miss from SO CAL. This place takes the void away.  out of  times the chicken is cooked right. Very flavorful and juicy. Great selection of sides. I especially like the Mac salad and Spanish rice. Orders are always brought up quick since they constantly have a mountain of chicken cooking.  They take CC's which makes it more convenient and have their own parking. the bad thing is that occasionally if you stop by @ the wrong time say when its slow and they haven't sold much chicken you will gets yours a little to dry and crispy  to the point where there is not to much meat left. The best grub gem in the outer Mission!  I've been going to Pollo Supremo for years. . . there's one right in the heart of ghetto Miami (location is the key to each one's success).  The best damn fire roasted chicken EVER, people. . . seriously.  Sides are awesome. . . black beans & rice, fried plantains, flan, and plenty more.  The family meal is a steal: whole chicken,  large sides, fantastic salsa, tortillas, and sour cream all for $ bucks!  You can call ahead an order, roll up into one of their always available parking spots, and head home to feed the fam!  They'll all be stuffed, even the little pug who gets all the table scraps : ) when i didn't feel like entering the shady world of popeyes, i'd come here a few times to get some chicken.  at times the chicken was a little dry though, but when it was cooked right it was tasty and so were the side dishes too.  friendly people :) Open late to satisfy the hunger pains of folks too brain dead to whip up a homemade meal ala Ms.  minutes herself, this Restaurante fulfills the primal need to assemble one's own food.  Okay, you have the option to roll your crispity crunchy chicken in the freshly cooked tortilla they give you, but hey, that's almost cooking.  Warning to those on those LOW/NO Carb diets, this is not the place for you.  They serve rice, plantains, sugary desserts.  Just don't come in.  The rest of you.  Remember that mini vans take a while to park, so don't get all flustered watching me fit my car into the space.  I promise I won't hit your car. Chicken is heavenly  yum.  I love this place!  Sometimes there is nothing better than some pollo supremo chicken, wrapped up in a corn tortilla, and topped with spicy salsa.  Josh is a special fan of the fried plantains. The chicken is yummers. . . . roasted chicken with a crispy salty skin and sides for every Mexican food craving.  Spanish Rice and beans. . . real pinto beans in the broth just like I have it at home.    Even the fried bananas tasted good.   It's a Cheapo Depot, too!!   My boss and I shared a whole chicken which came with two sides, rice and beans. Also with corn tortillas steamy and foil wrapped.  Also three styro baby buckets of spicy salsa.  I took home the left overs. . . I recommend going home to eat  unless you don't mind licking your fingers in public. . . We may not have El Pollo Loco in San Francisco, but we have Supremo!  Great grilled chicken, with all the fixin's like rice, beans, toritllas, and good salsa to go with it.  It just tastes like it is so much healthier than Popeye's a few blocks south.   Parking is easy in their private lot.  Good deals too. . . ."|4|89|3|Routine| Wiping cloths not clean or properly stored or inadequate sanitizer  [ date violation corrected: 6/8/2012 ] High risk vermin infestation  [ date violation corrected: 5/31/2012 ] Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 6/8/2012 ]
La Taqueria Menudo 0|4.0|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|115|0|3.75|" The cashier here needs an attitude check and a lesson on customer service. Without customers, La Taqueria Menudo will not be here. The cashier/order taker is the first point of contact with a customer. I'm astonished that the restaurant allows her to act this way. I went to La Taqueria Menudo with my boyfriend after walking around the Mission. We wanted burritos and decided to try this spot out after reading the positive Yelp reviews. Boy was that a mistake!We ordered our food to go and then took a seat while waiting. As we were waiting, I noticed they had fresh carrot juice on the menu. I went back in line to order a large carrot juice as the woman rudely says that they do not have it. Me being confused, I asked why it was on the menu and she cut me off in a scolding tone simply saying ""we don't make carrot juice. "" All I can do is say OK, right? Well, I asked to redeem my free soda offered on Yelp. That woman became very nasty withe me saying to give her my receipt and yelling at me for not having it in hand. I asked my boyfriend to hand me the receipt and she grabbed it out my hand. She started mumbling angrily and just said ""which one?"" As I couldn't understand her, I said ""sorry, what was that?"" She raised her voice once again and said ""WHICH ONE DO YOU WANT?!"" and pointed to the sodas. After making me feel guilty for asking for a soda, I asked if I could get my receipt back (since you need it to get your food). She said no and gave me a dirty look. I learned that redeeming a promotion on Yelp is a crime at this restaurant. As for the food, it's alright. The male employee handed me my food without being abusive like the cashier, so maybe not everyone is so unpleasant. Unfortunately that cashier was enough for me to never, ever want to come back. I'll be sure to let my friends/family know as well. As others have said in reviews below, there are PLENTY of better taquerias nearby to go to. AVOID THIS PLACE. Most of the time I'm here, it's not very crowded. It's usually mi madre y a couple of other people. The food is pretty damn good too. I love their burritos and super suiza quessidillas This joint had been my jam since i moved here  years ago. The pozole is fantastic and their tacos are always spot on. This place is AMAZING!! The place is clean, staff is so great and the food! Well it's perfection! I have been to many places back home in So Cal but this place hands down us by far the best in No Cal! The Suiza Quesadillas and the Shrimp Tacos were the tastiest I have had! And the carnitas tacos were so yummy!! I will def be coming back on our next stop to Mission District The nachos here are pretty standard. But the water here is terrible, it's room temperate and has a weird lime taste, not to mention the tiny oz plastic cup it comes in. I do NOT recommend coming here if your thirsty Basic taste what to expect. No hidden gem. Probably won't come back. Maybe if I was local or near by then in return just for some causal taste food. Something about their burritos, nachos and quesadillas get me consistently coming back. Not as greasy as others in neighborhood Food always fresh. All food is delicious. But my favorite is alambres and súper suiza quesadilla. /"|3|94|3|Routine Inspection| Improper storage of equipment utensils or linens  [ date violation corrected: 10/7/2014 ] Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings Unclean nonfood contact surfaces
La Taqueria Menudo 1|4.0|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|115|1|3.5625|" This taqueria has gone downhill since managment changed. The food isn't as good. . . slighly more greasy. I will say they have some good salsa verde. That hasn't changed and its one of the better salsas out of all the nearby taquerias. We were craving Pozole so we went to La Taqueria Menudo  loved their tacos already.   It's hard to nail a homecooked pozole and it tastes just like my mom's!   La Taqueria Menudo got it. I always toil between this spot and Mexico Tipico when I'm making a trip to Casa Lucas produce and today I realized that Tipico will always win. Tipico has great pozole but they only serve it on a certain day can't remember which, so I went to Menudo because I HAD to have Pozole, it was an emergency. My dude ordered chorizo con huevos which was really good, the beans and rice were good too but the beans had a pile of unmelted shredded cheese, which was strange, toss that sum'bitch under the salamander! My pozole left a lot to be desired. U know how pozole has all those accoutrement? Bitches love accoutrement. Especially this bitch. Well this pozole had no such tasty toppings. It was a bowl of good broth with like  small piece of good tender pork, a couple piece of floating fat chunks, like literally less than / cup of hominy, two tiny lime wedges and a shaker of dry oregano. Frown faces for days. Where's my tostadas or fried tortilla strips? Where's my effin shredded cabbage or iceberg? They're next door at Tipico that's where. The tacos and burritos here are on point, but I'm so disappointed by the menudo. The only other menudo I've had was homemade so maybe it isn't fair to compare, but the actual flavor of the soup was sort of one dimensional and kind of bland. It wasn't terrible but I wouldn't order it again. Now it would be absurd for me to come to a place called La Taqueria Menudo and not order the menudo. After all, I'm in a constant hunt for the best bowl in the city, and ironically, one of the best ones can be found a few doors down at the brightly lit Mexico Tipico. So the gauntlet's been thrown down on the linoleum tile to see who makes the best menudo. I came here after taking Jamie W. to the airport on a Friday thinking it may be worth a try despite some advance word that the menudo was on the meh side. The place is bigger than Mexico Tipico but also darker (photo: bit. ly/MsYl). The server at the counter wasn't much for chit chat since I probably looked like an out of place yellow gringo. Local families appear to come here staking the tables, listening to the Latin pop on the jukebox or staring at the soccer game on the big screen. Yes, of course, I ordered the $.  bowl of Menudo which they subtitled Tripe Soup for people like me, and indeed it was stock full of honeycomb tripe. There were a couple of good size calf bones in there, too, so with the lime wedges, chopped onion and cilantro bits all folded into a piece of foil, I was set (photo: bit. ly/HbyHj). It was pretty decent flavor wise, and frankly, I had some part of an internal organ with almost every slurp. It's just that the red broth was not quite as rich as others I've had recently like at Mis Antojitos, and the tortillas tasted a bit on the packaged side. As a chaser, I had one of their $.  Super Tacos with Carnitas (photo: bit. ly/ioZEC). It was a sloppy affair with the guacamole, salsa and sour cream all on the runny side as everything was piled onto two stacked tortillas. This was also decent eating, nothing more. All in all, I think the menudo here might be worth a return visit if Mexico Tipico is too packed (as it usually is) to wait. FOOD   stars. . . decent menudo but wish it was a bit more given the name of the placeAMBIANCE  .  stars. . . a bit dark and on he loud side with all the families cavorting about as they wait for their ordersSERVICE   stars. . . surly at the counter but the gregarious manager comes by to check on youTOTAL   stars. . . middling menudo may be enough if that's your only option I ordered a pork tamale and there was no meat in it at all, just cheese and jalapenos. I think the lady messed up my order. Also got super nachos with really tough steak and stale chips. Gross. Between  , It was a fun crowd but the burrito wasn't good =/ I have been coming here since i was a kid, it's the only place i go for a classic mission burrito   I always get the super burrito with steak, the meat is always fresh and tender and the burrito is HUGE and at the same price as other similar places so you can't go wrong. Another item off their menu I enjoy is the ceviche, a traditional seafood cocktail, a real treat on a sunny day; the shrimp and fish is really good  and always fresh of course. Don't forget to try their menudo on the weekends its better than homemade and always good when getting over a hangover. PS. It's a little out of the way but definitely worth it. Wow, I used to love this place. . . that's before they changed ownership and cooks. Pros: One block from my house Food tastes fresh Cons: female cooks do not know what they're doing wrong orders, missing items (I've had to return to the store several times to correct an order) the French fries are OVER cooked not just once but several times. not friendly at all (except for older cashier lady. . . . but she's been there since the other owners) fancy cash register for accuracy but the cooks don't follow what a waste of moneyIn a nutshell: I miss the brothers that owned it along with the young male cook. Maybe it's time to try the Taqueria a few doors down. Okay white people (im white too) don't be afraid of all the Hispanic people next door at Mexico Tipico They know something you don't. . . Menudo SUCKS. The only reason I am not giving it one star is I was fooled by their salsa bar and larger local than Tipico so I came here to menudo many times, UNTIL I GOT SICK OFF THEIR  CRUNCH TACOS! ( and I never get food sick, NEVER)Trust me people! Go to Mexico Tipico next door I worked in a Spanish clinica and no one EVER wanted Taqueria menudo always either Mexico Tipico, Taqueria Vallharta, Guadalajara Taqueria or Farolitos Taqueria. See you have choices! all these Taquerias are within  blocksListen to a local and avoid the food poison. =) I love trying new taquerias besides El Farolito and Taqueria Cancun (they are both very good), and decided to finally write a review for La Taqueria Menudo. The super burritos here are tasty! I always opt for the carnitas (fried pork) with black beans which resulted in a medley of tasty delight. A plus is that they do accept credit card. However, the one thing keeping them from being  star is that their chips are stale when you carry out. Plenty of parking in the residential area. Menudo is tasty and well made depending on whom is workings otherwise the food is awful. Sometimes the fault is on the counter person taking the order carelessly and sometimes the cook is the careless one with one's order. If one's lucky the food is great. We've nicknamed this place""hometown""! This place always cooks their dishes with fresh ingredients. We always order their tacos or their burritos. The meat is never overcooked or dry! In addition, they make fresh salsa and the green sauce is just the right level of spicy! They've also updated their decor which makes it more appealing to dine in. Out of all the taquerias on the mission, THIS IS THE BEST ONE! Please see my Nobel Prize winning theorem in the field of Quantum Restaurant Mechanics applied onto Taqueria Menudo, with particular mention of the  Crunchy Tacos, Pollo Asado plato, fish tacos, and all the complimentary salsas: chillo, pico de gallo, salsa verde, and more. Taste x [($Price/(. )(. )Portions)]_Service x [(Ambiance x Location^)]=HR! {HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! SQUARED} Love the food! Friendly staff! I love this place. I come here all the time.  Tacos or Pozole is my usual. Whether I'm hungry or just need to eat my feelings taqueria menudo is always there for me. Thanks for always being my carton of ice cream :)     Depending on the guys who are making the super tacos they may come out a little different, but always good. I've never had a bad experience here, great service all around."|3|98|1|Routine| Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 10/7/2014 ]
La Taqueria Menudo 2|4.0|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|115|2|3.91764705882|" I'm authentic born & raised Mexican. Had one of the best Menudo ever here!! The two other dishes we got/shared were also very good, flavorful & authentic.  Plus, you can't beat fresh made tortillas! Carna Asada Fries. . . . This taqueria is so good, it redefines the word ""good"" as ""over the top!""My son moved to the Mission about  weeks ago and started frequenting this gem. He was anxious for us to try it out and when we arrived, there was a sign in the front window advertising a change in ownership. Our first question to each other was, ""I wonder if theyre going to keep the same recipes?""Not to worry. The new owner, Miguel, welcomed us, introduced himself and after we had sufficiently gorged ourselves, asked if there we had any suggestions to improve the offerings. The answer, ""Have you ever heard the expression, 'Don't mess with success?'' That is exactly what applies here. This place is so over the top that it doesn't need any change. It is clean, pleasant and the employees friendly. The food is reasonably priced and the portions are plentiful. A fully stocked  salsa bar with at least  different varieties of salsa and peppers offer enough variety for more than  different combinations. I only wish that this great taqueria was down the street from my house!Good luck and best wishes to Miguel as he strives to continue the tradition of outstanding South of the Border cuisine! This place is hit or miss. I used to live around the corner from here and it was pretty decent, so when ever I am in the neighborhood I like to get super nachos for nostalgia.     Today I went here and it was the new owner's first day, so I am hoping he reads this, cause I've opted to write this review rather then call and complain. I am hoping that it will make changes for the better (but whom I to think that anyone cares).      Today was a bad day for nachos. After I eat the nachos today I had a really bad stomach ache.  The carne asada was really over cooked (usually is here, but sometimes its really good and cooked just right), and the chips tasted really stale, like they been out over night. I think based on my severe stomach ache and the stale chips, they need to really make sure that they keep their kitchen clean and ingredients fresh.      I hope that the new owner can make some positive changes. He seemed to micro manage the cook really closely but obviously there is something wrong because of my bad stomach ache. I will come back again in the next couple of months and update my review and give more stars if its better. I don't usually like giving low stars, but I am doing it out of tough love. Taqueria Menudo one of my go to spots when I'm long on hunger and short on motivation to cook for myself, and the reason is pretty simple:  order of super tacos is a nice light dinner at about $  orders of tacos is enough for a normal meal, and it's about $.   order of any of their platos (enchiladas, flautas, sarape, albondigas) is enough for a very generous dinner and then lunch the next day, and it's $  . Nicely warmed and salted tortilla chips as well as their salsa bar is available free of charge to all customers. Food is cooked up quickly and the counter staff is friendly, more so if you order in Spanish, but cordial in English as well. If you're looking to get something and you're sick of tacos and burritos, I'd recommend their Birria or Pozole, as both are quite good. Overall, there's a lot to like about Menudo. It's like the gold standard of taquerias. There are better ones out there, for sure, but they offer consistently good food at good prices with nice ingredients and good service. Also, you get to watch either Soccer or a Telenovela with your meal on their two enormous TVs and there two kinds of people in this world: people who love telenovelas, and liars. I just recently popped into this joint and discovered they are fantastic. Five dollars gets you a tasty baby burrito, I recommend the carne asada, its so flavorful, and their rice is nice and soft, reminds me of my grandma's rice. They also have free chips and a salsa bar that doesn't quite, their pico de gallo is delicious as well as their tamatillo salsa. I came because I've been having a crazy craving for flautas. I'm from southern California so I love real good authentic Mexican food. This place was not up to par. Their version of flautas was not appealing whatsoever, the beans were lukewarm, the rice was mushy and overcooked. Maybe my expectations of good authentic mexican food just can't be held in SF This is my favorite go to taqueria place (especially after the bars). I always get the vegetarian burrito and being the picky eater that I am, they let you modify it however you like. Also, the whole menu is pretty cheap!Usually, there is no long line and the food comes out fast.  The food and service is really great! Fast service, full sauce bar (self service), clean, great selection and spacious. About $ for a super vegetarian burrito with tortilla chips. This place is much cleaner, faster, and more convenient than other places. When I worked in this district I love coming here for my super burritos. It was something about this place that just kept me coming. But this wasn't a good thing because at times I would get really sick from their food, guessing someone didn't wash their hands. So now that I had been to other places, I realized this place was good. Just not the best and certainly not bad at all. The portions are friggin' huge!  The baby burrito is only $.  but I could barely finish it.  I blame it on the free chips and salsa!The service here is speedy, efficient and very friendly.  I don't like pico de gallo that much and the guy behind the register was gracious enough to offer let me sub out the pico for whatever other salsa I wanted.  Normally, if i ask for no pico, the cashier will just take it out all together, so the fact that he offered to let me sub it out was extra nice of him. Overall, food here is pretty decent, not the best Mexican I've had in the vicinity.  Cheap, fast, and pretty good. This place is great! I lived near here when I was little and the food is still great and me and my family still come here till this day! This is my favorite burrito spot, been going here for many, many moons, and I love it.  Super Burrito, pollo en salsa roja. Their tacos are also quite good too. I recommend this place to anyone wanting a quality burrito! The best salsa in SF! I love this place so much. I can only vouch for the regular tacos and they are delicious! What you get is: two tortillas (not homemade, but you don't want that because it would throw off the tortilla to meat ratio), pile of tasty meat (I like the carne asada), salsa and onions. . . oh I'm making myself hungry again. Free chips and self serve salsa bar complete the meal. The price per taco is a bit steep, but oh well. . . I'm always on the lookout for restaurants with the taste of the food from the old Mexican neighborhood where I grew up in Chicago.  This place has it! We ordered the Especial Burrito for $, the  enchilada plate of carnitas, and a large horchata. Chips and salsa bar for free. Beautiful hand painted murals, and wall and floor tiles. You can practice your Spanish by watching the TV! Been coming here for a long time. The food is great but I consistent. (for a while, they switched to red onions. . . love them in sandwiches, but not tacos. ) The carnitas is good % of the time and just okay the rest. The service is half and half. I only come here at night. The lady behind the counter is. . . Well, she shouldn't be there. I feel like I need to get on her good side just for decent service. Twice, she gave me refried beans when I asked for whole. I can't read spanish, so I don't know what she's writing. Aside from that, it is still good food. Highlights from this taqueria:) by far the best quesadilla in this neighborhood ) great salsa bar One of my all time favorite taqueria's. Big portions, reasonably priced and delicious. Great salsa bar, friendly service and good variety on the menu. Always worth stopping by when I'm in that hood. Try the lengua burrito! The best place for a super shrimp burrito. . . . They don't use small shrimp, They use prawns! It's also great that they have a free salsa bar, too. The super nachos is also off the hook! Excellent food. Excellent prices. Friendly staff. A must try in the excelsior. Our choice for a late night grub.   tacos with pastor, chips and hella salsa. One thing you can count on here is inconsistency. They're complimentary chips are not freshly made in house, nor are the tortilla wraps, unlike the place a few doors down. I used to order the same thing: the veggie Chimichanga. I get it at Menudo because you can't get a Chimichanga at many other Taqueria's around here. Yet. . . it's been a different experience every time. Always slightly satisfying in a grease craving fulfilled kind of way, but generally not that great.  My last experience I attempted to order the Taco Salad, because the big sign posted beside the cash register called to me, alas they ""were out. "" Then move the removable sign!I rarely go here anymore simply because the person taking my order (who is the face of the business and should smile once in a while!) is usually just plain cold. Pretty good for a taqueriainconsistent depends who is workingsurprisingly their fish is ALWAYS good (eaten here at least  times)sometimes they make hand made tortillas (awsome) sometime they don't  :(very good salsa barI find eating in the food is better than eating outI find I get better food before pm weekdays I think the owner tends to show up I've had the MOST AMAZING chile quilles great home made tortillasother times just scrambled eggs with rice and beansTakeout tonight was amazing flautas which I NEVER order freaking delicioso and camerones de diabla just the right amount of spiceHit or miss % t of the times out my   times there it's greatComplaint it isn't the cleanestThey don't have menus anymore that you can take homeno websiteno menu onlineIt's my fav in the glen park/exelsior area and prices are rightSomeone please take pics of their menu and post them!  Hope this link works of the one menu I found online ( partial and hard to read) flickr. com/photos/nicole…just read reviews seems consistent with my experience either the best or so/so but mostly great so owner get your good chef a pay raise and have him hire folks and pay $ bucks a month a for a website and get some menus people can take home with them! keep up the GREAT work with the good seafood!  You will get a reputation need a website!(probably some new chairs too that one's butt doesn't fall through) lolAnd DON""T become ANYTHING like taqueria cornita (I'm between you and them) keep your prices right and don't dare start offering spincach/sun dried tomatoe tortillas PLEASE Where can you find a good bowl of Menudo? Certainly NOT here. . . I LOVE OFFAL liver, heart, sweetbreads, tongue, trotters, tripe; you name it, I will eat it. I especially love honeycomb tripe for its soft, chewy gelatinous texture and rich meaty flavor so naturally I love menudo. I don't know many places that serve it so after searching on Yelp, I came across La Taqueria Menudo. Yes, LTM is a taqueria, but one would think that if they have ""Menudo"" in its name that it would be one of their specialties. . . WRONG! I'm also on a diet so I'm NOT suppose to be eating out, so another FAIL of the night but I digress. On Sunday, February th my friend and I came to LTM at about : AM (closes at  AM). LTM is located in the Excelsior district so there was plenty of parking especially at the wee hours of the morning. I ordered the Large Menudo ($. ) thinking I can have leftovers the next day. When the woman brought out the bowl of Menudo, I was a little surprised of how it looked nothing like the one pictured on Yelp. The picture on Yelp showed a large bowl of tripe peaking out from all over the surface of the broth while my bowl looked like a pool of broth. yelp. com/biz_photos/ALV…The Menudo was served with corn tortillas, limes, chili flakes, and oregano. To break it down. . . I was literally ""fishing"" for the tripe. There was one  oz piece of honeycomb tripe which was mainly fat that had not been trimmed off and   pieces of tripe the size of a pink pearl eraser. The tripe was cooked properly; it was soft, chewy and meaty but seriously, for $. ?!?!? That's more than $/piece!The red chili base soup lacked richness; it was BLAND and NOT SPICY at all. I was literally dousing the soup with oregano, raw onions, limes, and chili flakes just to give it some tang, spice and heat. We also got a side of chips but had to request it. The chips were warm, light and crisp. However, I was not impressed by the salsa bar. There were about  different salsas: Pico De Gallo: Bland and tomatoes were not ripe. Salsa Verde: Bland and watery. Salsa Rojo: Salty but lacked heat.   Salsa Taquera (""Taco Sauce""): Didn't try. Salsa Negra: Didn't try. In all fairness, my friend got the Suiza which she said was good but not great. Despite this, I was disappointed in the Menudo; it was NOT worth the calories and fat. Perhaps, it was an off day or I got a bad batch who knows? Nevertheless, if you can't correctly and consistently make ""Menudo"" right, maybe you shouldn't have it in your name. Just saying. . . I'm on a search for good Menudo, so if you know of any places please holler at me. Thanks!P. S.   The customer service is non existent and the workers' disinterest excudes an unspoken rudeness. down graded to  stars. . . recently went back for my favorite shrimp burrito and was disappointed.  the burrito was still pretty good. . . but they replaced half the shrimp with chopped up beef.  i'm  confused. . . i thought i ordered a shrimp burrito?? It turned into Sh*t. It sucks now. New people there can't take down orders right. I got a burrito today and again, the wrong one, plus it was mostly sour cream and sauce. Plus the rice was undercooked, and I got re fried beans when I asked for whole beans. I did not ask for a vegetarian burrito, but it hardly had any chicken in it!I had been coming here for at least  years! And now I'm mad that they turned into crap! I cant believe I miss reviewing this the first time. This is the nd time TB has brought me here, the first one is probably almost about the same time last year. I suggested since its raining that maybe we can get some hot soup, and he immediately said that he wanted MENUDO. . . not the Pinoy one but the Mexican. . . . and like always being a foodie that I am he knows that Im not gonna say no. . . lol. I am from the Mission, so if its tacos and burrito and quesadilla, Id rather go to El Farolito. . . . but the Menudo taste so good. As far as service is, the girl at the counter could have been more friendly, the guy who cooks the meats and the one who prepares the dishes in the kitchen are much more customer friendly. Would definitely comeback for the Menudo. I just got back from this place and the late night lady was the RUDEST person i've EVER met in my life!I got  tacos and a burrito! I paid, and tipped % (no biggie right?). so the guy making the food was gonna put some guac and sour cream on for me, then she wanted to charge me (ok i understand that) but then she said "" you need to pay for the shrimp"". . . . I JUST PAID! i tried arguing with her with my receipt but she wasn't havin it!. I didn't get it at all. . I just paid, plus i tipped! (tipped at a taco shop! seriously! i don't know anyone else who tips there!). . . so i paid,, i was kinda madThen i asked the lady ""wheres the salsa bar"" she points at a locked cabinet and walks away. . . . uh. . . ok! So the cook (he was nice) gave me a cup and told me to open the top). . . the lady comes and yells at me ""you have to pay extra from the cups. . . . "" (ok, she didn't yell, but she was quick about letting me know). . . . i was like ""WTF I tipped you guys and paid extra on top of EVERYTHING!Ok. . . i was furious by this time and i got a pen and paper out and ask for the managers name and her name. . . she wouldn't give me her name! She wouldn't give me ANY information. . So. . . I got home after that whole thing. . . . I only had  taco in my bag!I don't care about the money cause i tipped first and didn't complain until i asked for the ladys info and she wouldn't give it. . . I'm really upset with this place. . . I went to El Farolitos after that. . . . they gave me a free cup for my salsa, were very nice. . . and i tipped them twice what i tipped the Menudo lady!. . . . Go here only if you really need to. . . Oh sweet goodness. . did I just find the perfect quesadilla place?  After weeks exploring the Taquerias of the Mission I think I've found the magical place!  The quesadilla was BIG and FLAVOURFUL and HOT!  I took it to go and had to drive  mins back to my house and it was still smokin hot to the touch when I tried to unwrap it. ZOMG.  Delicious.  How do I even describe a quesadilla except that it exceeded my expectations.  With all the ingredients that every other taqueria has, how is that even possible?  I don't know but you need to try it yourself!My only qualm is that they give you very little chips (a small bag, but some places give me NONE so I shouldn't complain. . ) and even though they have a GORGEOUS salsa bar (OMG  DIFFERENT KINDS?) I wasn't thrilled with any of them. All in all. . . . I WILL BE BACK. ""yay! i'm a fan!"" is right. . . ok, so i totally neglected this place when i used to live around this neighborhood. . . because this place is GOOD! but it's still worth the drive for me to get my shrimp burrito!! shrimp burrito? THUMBS UP! whole shrimp. . . and lots of IT! fresh toppings? OF course!Salsa bar? OMG, AWESOME SALSA BAR! this place is nom nom nom good. . . go here! The baby burrito indeed a bit smaller in size, but taste, massive. Some of the best grilled chicken, plenty of black beans and salsa all rolled up in the always loved wheat tortilla. I was thinking three stars when I left as the baby was only $.  cheaper than the regular one, but a few bites in, I realized the mistake was mine in not going full size. Feel free to learn from my mistake. Taquería Menudo surprised me. The reviews were raving, the salsa bar was touted, and I was excited. I entered a large empty restaurant at  pm on a Saturday, where the same soccer game was being blasted on two TVs on opposite sides of the room, creating a booming, echoing effect that you could describe as disorienting. Ordering was therefore somewhat of a challenge, but we made do with what our voices could do among all those competing wavelengths. Our sodas were not exactly what we ordered, but we just decided not to care. Walked over to the salsa bar, and it looked exactly like the pic linked to this review (yelp. com/biz_photos/ALV…). I felt I was in for a treat. It was actually a disappointment. The salsa verde was good, and the salsa fresca was truly fresh, but it was also bland. What looked like your typical salsa casera was just some watery stuff. The chips were also just ok. I was starting to think I might be in for a disappointing meal. Well, neither a book should be judged by its cover, nor a taquería by its chips and salsa. My nachos al pastor (w/o sour cream) were delicious! (yelp. com/biz_photos/ALV…) There were lots of the toppings, and just enough chips . The meat was tender, flavorful, and you could tell it was freshly grilled. The guac was tasty, and the salsa, the same seemingly bland salsa fresca from before, really rounded out the experience well. I also appreciated the cheese they used not being the processed nacho cheese you sometimes get. Everything about these nachos was perfect. Now my number  nacho spot. This is my go to neighborhood taqueria, and my favorite in the city. I almost always get a regular carne asada burrito with black beans or a couple regular carne asada tacos, and I have never, ever been disappointed (I stay away from ""super"" anything at any taqueria  all that really means is ""drowned in guac and sour cream""). Consistently amazing, quality food, and the owner and staff are really friendly and down to earth. Recently my favorite cook left and they hired several new staff members, which bummed me out  until I went to a far inferior taqueria and realized how spoiled I have become eating at La Taqueria Menudo. If you live anywhere near Excelsior, this is where you should go to satisfy your burrito cravings. I really like this place.  I usually get tacos or a quesadilla and they are both great.  They've got a delicious salsa bar and your meal comes with free chips.   The salsas change each time you go. . so hopefully they have your favorite when you're there.  They aren't labelled so you just have to hope you don't accidentally take home the fire from hell salsa that I did once :)Price is reasonable.   Parking usually isn't too difficult at night and they are open relatively late. I always pay with a credit card which doesn't have a line for tipping on it. . . they need to fix that.  I've chosen not to go there before when I did'nt have cash since I didn't want to be the jerk that doesn't tip. We were lost and starving and decided to park the car and find a place to eat that didn't mind me having a pup in a carrier. The restaurant is not fancy at all. Kinda reminds me of places in Mexico. I loved the feel. All the food looked fresh. They didn't mind our pup and even gave us quarters when we ran out for the meter. The food is incredible! I couldn't finish my Menudo even though I ordered small. It was one of the best I've ever had. My husband loved his enchiladas as well. They also have great variety of salsa to go with the chips or to be added to the food. I love the fact that they freshly squeeze orange juice after you order it. Absolutely recommend it and will be back for sure! //Lady: Taqueria MenudoMe: Oh yes, you're open today!Lady: *Laughing* Yes, we are. Me: Thank you, thank you!Having had one too much cups of Vodka, I woke up feeling like crap with only one thing in my mind. . . MENUDOO! I was so happy that they were open, I thought everyone would be closed. I called in an order of Menudo & a super chicken burrito.  I love their Super Burritos, the meat is always freshly grilled & just all around tasty.  The Menudo was a lot different than I ever had, but then again I've always had my grandma's with harmony & not the squishy pork part lol which I just swallowed cause it was weird. Menudo overall was good, a large can be for   people, comes with a lemon, onions, tortillas, & oregano which mixed in perfectly.  Took my hangover oozy feeling away. Burritos have always been good here, one of my fave spots. & they're open til am! YES! Ok happy to report that their tacos are good too! Happy New Year everyone! My first review of twentyten and it started the morning after nye!Woke up with a hangover and a headache and what else helps it but some good hot menudo and a burrito!They are not stingy on they menudo, I always got it from here once my sister told me about it. The give you all the condiments you need to help fill your belly and they do it just right. Most taquerias only make menudo on certain days esp Saturdays. But this place does it around the clock. And I also had half of a chicken burrito which i had to admit was so good, so plus points for doing both well! Pick up is fast and ready in mins!One of my resolutions this year is to get more involved with the Yelp community and finally get to my bookmarked spots! GO ! How stoked was I to find a great taquiera right down the street from me upon moving to the Excelsior?Of course, the barometer for all of my taqueria ratings is the quality of their carnitas taco and La Taqueria Menudo's stacks up realy nicely.  The carnitas were really crispy, not too moist, but i'd take crispy and drier over soggy and wetter any day. Their tacos are cheap, covered in onions and cilantro and they come with half a lime, which is a nice touch.  They have a killer salsa verde too (another test passed). I got a burrito another time, and it was HUGEE.  Couldn't even finish it.  Good stuff. in my opinion, this place has one of the BEST HORCHATAS EVER! their homemade horchatas are made fresh daily of course. ;)walking along on a sunny saturday afternoon on a mad hunt for horchata, i stumbled into this taqueria. it was not too overbearing, and u have the best of both worlds with the milky creamy taste and the spice as well. the man working there insisted i try some of their food, but since i ate already i told them ""next time"", and he was nice enough to give me a discount card since im from around the hood ;). when u guys try this place, i suggest you get the card as well, everytime u go u can choose to get $ super burritos, free drink, or $.  tacos. thanking him, and saying hasta luego, i vowed to come back. the next few times, keeping my word, i did return and tried their yummy carne asada burrito with the choice of wheat tortilla bread. it was very fresh, filling, and the salsa was good. my friend tried the fish tacos, and said those were bomb too. if your in the hood i highly recommend this taqueria, just cuz vallarta chain is everywhere. I had a struggle with four stars or five, but I am judging based on what a good taqueria should do for its customers. This place is more than just a serviceable taqueria, because the food, service, value and ambiance all add up to  stars. Let me get this out of the way: Some items are to be strictly avoided like those things they are trying to pass off as fish tacos but are really fish sticks with a tortilla wrapped around it. (I think the coffee stuff another yelper referred to might be in this category as well. )That said, we can move on to the good stuff: I love the baby burritos (just the right size) and the carne asada, the chicken, al pastor, tripa, etc  it's all good. The salsa bar is great too, with all the usual suspects done to perfection. The menudo and posole are excellent  they really know how to do it. The ambiance is pleasant & clean. The service is great and the employees are very friendly and helpful. There is usually a futbol game or telenovela on the big screen for your pleasure. So, despite the faux fish tacos, everything else is more than you could ask for at a taqueria  so five stars it is. When I git a cravin for a burrito near my house dis is d place.  Burritos are good but the super quesidilla is better. Get the barbacoa, tasty and tender, they used to have a good chicken mole, its on d menu but they dont have it anymore tasty The beef soup and super nachos I usually share with my girl while she feeds on the salsa bar and the free chips. The soup was piping hot with condiments of dried chiles, oregano, chopped onions, and limes. Good for a cold night.  Last time i was there they had the coronitas on sale, fist size in a bucket with ice, i think u get five, my girl drank one while i finished off the other . I love this place! This is my favorite Taqueria to go to if ever I'm craving any Burritos, Quesadillas or just good authentic Mexican food. They open really late as well. The quality, service and preparation of food is second to none. You can watch the chef cook as your order is being done too. Ever since I was introduced to this place by my cousin, I have been going back ever since for my regular super steak quesadilla. I never really like burritos until I tried this place.  It made me a believer.  Decently priced and pretty big stuff there.  The shrimp burritos are mean as hell!  Real tasty and juicy stuff.  The carnitas are pretty bomb too.  I think this will be my regular burrito place.  They're open late too.  That's always a plus! Just moved to San Francisco and this place is RIGHT down the street from me!  I figured I should try all the Mexican food in the mission area, and why not start with that which is closet?  Damn did I luck out!  I loved everything about this place!  From the happy service to the delicious chips with salsa bar to the homemade horchata all the way to the perfectly scrumptious and HUGE chicken super burrito this place has me HOOKED!  The atmosphere inside was also fun with zany seats that are a cross between leather bar stools, miniature benches, and regular chairs  pretty comfortable too! Back in the days when I hated, yes I repeat hated, mexican food my ex brought me here and since then have I been the convert.  If you go I definitely recommend the super good super quesadilla.  What a way to make the most of your buck.  And it's open late. i like this place and they like me which is good because i saw the chef beat up some guy on the buss once. anyways, i thought their super chicken burritos were the best but their al pastor  is the best for me now. the owner is good to his devoted customers but thinks offering cheapo cappuccino drinks at a taqueria is cool but it really sux but oh well at least he didn't change the delicious taste of my favorite super(b) burrito in the word burrito was not bad. really BIG and fillingquesidilla was my favoritefood is made right there in front of you so really freshplace was not so clean of course. but the staff was really friendly and worked fasttheir tomato mix for your chips is really hot! so be careful!! Like most of the restaurants in the Excelsior  I grew up on their food. They are open till about am, I believe. . . but I could be dead wrong. So, don't quote me on that. This place had a face lift, some years ago, because it was pretty funky looking, back in the 's 's. I'm all for the super prawns & steak burritos w/everything in it. Or, prawns & steak nachos. I docked off one star, because it seems to me, they've cut back on the portions. There's a shit load of Taqueria's over on Mission St, in the Excelsior  but out of all of 'em, I recommend stuffing your face w/their food. Best Al Pastor burrito in San Francisco. OMG it's so good. They have terrific salsas too! I live in Glen Park and La Corneta sucks compared to Menudo. La Corneta is stingy with its salsa and the staff is rude. At Menduo, you can get as many of the best red salsas you want and they are smiling at you while you ask for more plastic containers. LOVE MENUDO! I'm in this area of Mission a lot and I've tried several different Mexican restaurants, but this one is by far my favorite one. The steak is just so full of flavor! I usually order the Super Burrito or Super Nachos, but occasionally I'll get the Enchilada. The employees are extremely nice. The Horchata is YUMY! This place is the ish. $.  for a super taco that puts La Corneta's super taco to shame. It was the size of a mini canoe in a good way. Comes with the works, salsa, pico de gallo, pollo en roja, beans, guacamole, sour cream, and cheese. Also got a quesidilla and Mexican coke for under $Plus they throw in free chips and have a homeade salsa bar with  different types. go for the one on the right with peppers and onionsDelicioso Being that I live right around the corner, I eat here all the time.  This taqueria never disappoints. Now everyone knows that Mission Street is peppered with taco shops of all sorts.  Some better than others, and others better than the rest.  If you're looking for the best quesadilla suizas, the ones my friends make here are at LTM are top notch. Pick a protein.  Any protein.  Pollo Asado, Tripas, Carnitas, Lengua, Al Pastor. . . it's all really, really good.  For my money, you really can't go wrong with their Carne Asada.  It's never too salty, never too greasy, and always moist and tender.  Add to that two fist fulls of mozarella cheese (there's all the grease you need right there), and a little pico de gallo, then melt it all together over a fluffy, flour tortilla.  BAM!  Simple and delicious.  It's good eats /  for lunch, dinner, and at am.  Or have it for breakfast the following morning after a night filled with shots of Cazadores and Jager bombs. mM!! Hangover. Gone. My Advice:I'm also a huge fan of tripas (aka, tripe  inner stomach lining of beef or pork).  Sounds a little unappetizing, I know.  But if you've never had it, you're TOTALLY missing out on one of God's greatest gifts to mankind.  It's right up there with football, the sun, and Dave Chapelle! I introduced Tammy's virgin lips to a tripe taco with a little lime, some diced onion, cilantro and salsa.  She's now converted, and a fellow tripe lover.  So go out on a limb and live a little.  At $, it's not a huge investment.  But it might just open your eyes to something new and exciting for you and your tastebuds.  You can  thank me later. . . I've only eaten here twice, and both times I got super nachos, the first time your standard carne asada and the other day al pastor. AL PASTOR! That's BBQ pork. On nachos! It's hard to find terrific al pastor at a price I can afford. A lot of places charge extra if they carry it at all. I loved theirs. Perfectly juicy and crispy both, a hard combo to pull off, which they do. As for the nachos, you will run out of chips before you run out of goop. They're almost a little too goopy, and the meat is buried under all the goop. By goop I mean a lot more guac than I'm used to seeing in SF, and way too much sour cream  ask them to go easy. There was very little cheese by comparison. They tried to offer me free chips and salsa, and I had to remind the lady I was already eating nachos. She seemed cheerful and had a sense of humor, and I always like places where the workers seem to be treated well. Tip: This is an order at the reg taqueria, not an order at the meat taqueria. I'm giving three stars at this point because the last time I ate there was unmemorable. I will update my review when I try other dishes here, and I definitely plan on doing so. The staff here were very friendly to me. I was in the mood for some pesole and then saw they also offer a goat soup. They were nice enough to let me try the two soups before making a decision. The goat soup was good but I was craving the sourness of pesole so I decided on that instead. The soup wasn't full bodied enough nor was it sour enough for my liking. It tasted as if it wasn't cooked long enough in order for the spices and flavors to really stand out. I also ordered the atole which is a sweet hot drink, my grandmother definitely makes this better then La Taqueria but that's a given. Grande Caldo de Res y Posole por favor! (thats beef soup and pork stew w/ hominy if ya dont know) I think I had these for breakfast, lunch or dinner about  days straight a few years ago. One time i ate half of it out of the bag cause it was so hot it melted the lid off and half of it spilledand since i was at work with no bowls or anything I jus made due. I like it that much. The soups are on hit here, The Menudo and Shrimp soup are real tasty too. Dont know about the Chicken soup, never ordered it. The rest of the food is ranges from standard to real good depending on whos working the grill, which is kinda wierd because its all the same food. I guess some people just got ""the touch"". They also make a dish i think its ""sarape"" (which doesnt make sense since a sarape is a colorful pancho) which is chorizo, bacon, ham, peppers and onions all mixed up w/ rice & beans and believe me its way better than it sounds or looks. Its a must after a dozen beers or appetite enhancer or to cure a hangover. Oh yeah Beers too, Bohemia goes well with the entire menu the girlfriend and i came here after a party nearby at around midnight while waiting for the bus to come take us home. we agreed on a super beef burrito with everything except hot sauce to share. it was about a five minute wait and we had to pay with cash ($ minimum on credit card), but were immediately pleasantly surprised with the first bite. normally we go to an organic no msg no transfat type of mexican place in the mission (which i try to push on my greasy, fast food loving girlfriend), so this proved to be a complete delight in comparison. i could hardly get my half when eating it on the bus. i haven't heard the girlfriend moan so loudly since. . . definitely will be coming back (at the girlfriend's demand). One of my favorite places to get mexican food.  They always make my burrito super fast and this place is a bargain bite. Taqueria menudo has the best posole in town.  My mom, who makes the best posole in town, even agrees. And the great thing is it's available every day, along with their other soups.  Tacos and burritos depend on who's cooking at the grill. Salsas are pretty good. Good juke box filled with lots of Mexican music. Very Mexican decor, but the chairs are not the most comfortable. But they are open late on weekend nights and a couple of tacos (they sell beer too) on the way home after a night of dancing is great. Menudo! THis place is legendary! I live at a party house and after a wild night, in the morning everybody left over from the party always wants menudo!! Their Chicken Super burritos are the best IN THE WORLD! MANN!! THE SUPER STEAK QUESADILLA IS THE BEST!I've gone here for years and have to say that no matter what, I always find myself craving La Taq Menudo everytime!To me there is no better super steak quesadilla. . . and did i mention free chips and salsa with each order! YES! I went to La Taqueria Menudo based on the Four Star rating.  I dine on  burritos from the Mission on a regular basis and thought I'd venture out to the Excelsior.  I ordered a baby pastor (barbeque pork burrito) that was about "" long and  /"" wide (the cook actually trims off about half of the regular burrito sized flour tortilla)  resulting in a real tiny baby burrito.  A regular burrito would have been an additional  cents.  The pastor was greasy and full of fatty pieces, chewy gristle, and pieces of skin. . . the worst pastor I've ever had.  The burrito was so greasy that the grease soaked through the tortilla, leaked out of the foil wrapper and soaked through the paper bag.  In summary, a really petite sized terrible pastor burrito for $.  plus tax goes to the worms in the compost bin. I took notice of Taqueria Menudo while passing by on my way to Walgreen's. I thought it must be a good place if all the local Excelsior viejitos are enjoying themselves with a big bowl of caldo verdura, pozole, or menudo. Let me say this: try the Menudo at Taqueria Menudo, nothing is better than a big bowl of menudo on a Sunday mid morning. I am a BIG fan of the carne asada baby burritos, which don't seem baby sized at all, I can only imagine that the regular sized burritos have to be wheeled out on a cart. The salsas are super yummy so pile up. Overall the place is clean and relaxed. I must admit that I have become such a regular they recognize me when I come in and start getting my order ready. I live in LA and where are my mostest favoritest burritos and quesadillas in the world?  Back home in good ol' San Francisco.  I miss this place like CRAZY when I go back to LA and wish with all my heart that I could find a place that has carne asada like this place.  Maybe I have no idea what a good Mexican food is supposed to taste like, but damn if I don't know what I like and know what tastes good. I always make an effort to stop by whenever I'm home in SF, maybe sometimes more than once, even in the same day. This is one of my all time favorite place to get a burrito. Their burritos are always huge and juicy. I've been eating at this taqueria for years and always try to stop by whenever I'm in the neighborhood. Their alhambres  and other breakfast type dishes on their menu are also good. One of many great burritos places in the Mission/Excelsior District. this place was the gateway to me eating mexican food at all, so it definitely holds a special place in my heartI've been eating here for years and keep in mind I used to not like mexican food, and somehow their carne asada super suiza hits the spot perfectly.  Its marinated just right and its full of flavor, but not too much where i cant take it.  But like all mexican places i can only eat here at times when i can go home right after to take care of the business. Eat here! There are four Taqueria's near my house that I can think of off the top of my head, and this one is usually the least crowded.  This place has a rural feel with the cross hatch stools, and ceramic tile floor.  I must tell you that I am not a big fan of a burrito.  I would rather have a quesadilla suiza.  Just meat and cheese.  The suiza here is no better or worse than any other place nearby.  The pastor is pretty good, but needs more of a kick.  I usually get carne asada, unless I want the grease from the pastor.  But from the burritos I have had, they are good, but not great. Other plates are available,like enchiladas, and various other carne's.  You will likely see a soccer (or is it futbol?) on the big screen TV.  It's actually much brighter now than in the past.  It used to be dark and dank, just like a Taqueria should be. This joint holds it own right up there with La Taqueria and Cancun.   The only reason why it took me  years of living in SF to make it to this place is because its way out there in the Excelsior neighborhood where few city dwellers ever go.  Why I love this place: ) awesome fresh made salsas that are the absolute best in the city.  ) The meat is above average.  ) This place is as consistent as a taqueria can possibly be.  So I returned   more times. Recommendations:  Skip the platos and stick with simple carne asada tacos and burritos.  The chicken and pork are great as well. I love the super chicken burrito here. My friend introduced this place to me back in  when I first moved out to SF. I've brought other friends there to this place who say it's pretty damn good. This is one of the taquerias I would think of when someone says, ""Let's go eat taqueria. "" Forreals. But don't take my word for it, try it for yourself. If you don't like it. . . no harm done! The most amazing burritos in the City. Hands down. I love this burrito place. The only thing I ever really order is the super burrito with no beans.  My sisters have ordered the tacos and I wasn't very impressed with it. I love their salsa. They prepare all the sauces and salsas and you get to scoop it up yourself.  I like it that it's fresh (most of that time). I've only had one or two bad experiences here, when I ordered chicken.  I've come to the conclusion that chicken doesn't taste good with burrito. This is my preferred choice for a burrito I've been coming here since my college days when the carnitas quesadilla was only like $ or $.  Lots of gooping cheese & meat grilled to perfection!  Now my favorite is the barilla (goat  spell?) soup.  Lots of meat choices for your burrito/quesadilla/taco.  My favorites are cabeza (beef cheek/head meat) and the chicken mole.  Carnitas there is also pretty good. So, my girlfriend and I dropped into this place between a double header of films, The Bourne Ultimatum (does the cameraman for the action sequences actually have epilepsy or do they just think the constant shaking looks good?) and Sunshine (Her: Ugh, Me: quite good although, the comparisons to  are really unavoidable). I got nachos she got a quesadilla. Good. Lord. I know that mexican places tend toward big portions, but on a scale of small to huge the portions were freakin' ginormous. Not only that, they were Pretty Damn Tasty as well. The nachos were loaded, and good, the quesadilla had an insane amount of cheese and tortilla was really good. Suffice it to say we could only eat roughly half of each. I haven't tried the burrito (which for me is the ultimate decision maker) so for now they're getting  stars, with the potential for  with a good burrito. If you crave some good old Mexican food during the late night or early hangover Sunday  mornings this is the spot. Everything seems so freah here and it is good. F. Y. I It helps if you live in the neighborhood or you are crashing at a friends house and you stumble upon this place because parking could be a pain. my favorite taqueria at the moment. . . The steak quesadilla is crazy!  Grilled chicken super burrito is crazy!your mom is CRAZY!  update //  Something weird is going on at Menudo.  Maybe they changed owners? Anyway, I've been back three times in the last three months.  Got sick once and the other times have been meh at best.  The staff seems different, and some of the dishes (esp. serape & carne asada ) are actually made differently. Downgrading from  to  stars :( By far one of my favorites Taqueria's in all of San Francisco. Without fail the steak and grilled chicken are some of the best meats they have to offer.  I don't really care for their shredded chicken, but some like it stringy and spicy.  Please refrain from any ""Moma"" jokes. The staff has some slight rotation with a new cook periodically, but for the most part they keep the same staff who you can always count on. My staple meal is a regular size burrito with guac and the ever important addition of a coke.  Not any coke though.  The Mexican coke that comes in a glass bottle.  I feel that many people of my complexion are missing out on.  While I don't really care for soda, this other bread of coke as a smoother and less biting flavor than the US standard.  I highly recommend it with any of their meals. Their salsa bar is extensive enough that you will indubitably find the salsa of your liking or be able to mix and create the correct blend of your choice. While the chips are neither miraculous, nor terrible. . . they serve their purpose as a quick snack as you watch the chiefs work the magic on the hot plate, and make a fine vessel for your custom salsa concoction. While the location is not terribly central for most San Franciscans (is that a real name, or did I just make that up?), it is accessible by bus.  Likewise it is in proximity of two banks (WaMu and BofA), some small fish and vegetable markets, and other inexpensive shopping adventures.  Not to mention, it is terribly close to one of my other favorite eateries. . . DELI WORLD!  I have also reviewed this other fine establishment. Notes from the experienced.  The ""baby burrito"" must be named after a baby gnu, as it is only vaguely smaller than the ""regular"".  The Veggie burrito is about the same size as the ""Super"" burrito.  The ""Super"" burrito is always equivalent to . x the size of your stomach, so suffer on in total enjoyment.  None of the chairs are comfortable.  There is not a flat eating surface in the joint.  The two TVs are always showing soccer or Mexican soap operas, as if they should be playing anything else.  Lastly, the smell of the fish market next door does not enter inside the restaurant, but will make you wish you didn't have to walk past it to get inside. I need to familiarize myself a little more with the various post am dining options in the city, since I only know of about five non diner/non Denny's/non Jack in the Box options.  Of these five, Menudo is easily my favorite, and is probably the only one I would happily patronize at a regular time of day as well. I almost always get the sopa de res (a hearty beef soup with veggies, served with warm corn tortillas) and sometimes the shrimp ceviche tostada as well.  For a total of $, this is a wonderful combination, and is the kind of late night meal that won't have you waking up the next day regretting your :am indulgence. Nachos don't get much better than they do at La Taqueria Menudo!  I have been eating at this spot for at least  years now. . . if not longer.  Not once have I been dissatisfied with the service or the food.  the place is ALWAYS clean and the staff is ALWAYS cool and ALWAYS watching soccer!  They truly serve great food with a smile and they are open late. . . LOVE THAT! A great taqueria in the Excelsior district! They serve the best carne asada tacos and carne asada super suizas. When I come out to visit my parents, this is always one of the choices we have in mind for dinner or lunch! OMG!  The chipotle chicken enchiladas were like heaven.  This place rocks!  I was craving some good Mexican food and this place totally hit the spot!Oh yeah, killer salsa too!Update (//):Went back here last night and the best I can say is ""Meh"".  The food was so so and all the tables were sticky. OK. . . . . now this has got to be good food. I mean who in their right mind would drive from Pacific Heights to the Excelsior to grab a bite to eat on a one hour lunch break?Prices are great and food is ever better! Hangover central! This is the place I go after a rough night. They have fresh aguas frescas, wait isn't that redundant? Er, they also have a fabulous salsa bar that ranges from pico de gallo to HOT. The people there are really nice and get your food out to you quickly. You can also get some beer here to make that hangover feel better. Oh, I almost forgot the food. It's pretty tasty, and this comes from a real, live Mexican that cooks her own stuff. So try it out! If you happen to be in Excelsior late at night for whatever reason, this place has got decent Mexican food.  Parking will be an issue during the day and perhaps at night as well because it's quite popular at night as well. I've only ordered the super burritoes and the tacos. Carne asada, pollo in salsa roja, or carnitas. I like the self serve salsa and condiments bar in the back. The salsa is the best and oh so fresh! The chips are free but in the past year they've been stale. Parking is a pain in the butt. Great food, cheap prices.  The best thing on the menu is definitely the super suiza with pollo en chipotle.  Split it between two people, and you've only set yourself back a little more than two bucks. Edit:  I've found that the super burrito with carnitas verde is my new favorite.  Also, in response to the stale chips, I find this to be an inconsistant dilemma.  If you get it to go, you have a higher chance of getting the stale ones, but if you eat there, you've got a good chance of getting decent chips."|3|91|2|Routine| High risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 4/1/2013 ] Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 1/7/2014 ]

The coffee was excellent as well.  I walked by several coffee shops on my  mile trek to get my lox, but it was well worth the wait (and the walk).  I'm far from a Starbucks fan (burnt, overpriced, and way too commercial), and this brew was just right.  I will definitely be coming back here on my next trip!|5|94|3|Routine| Improperly washed fruits and vegetables  [ date violation corrected: 7/29/2013 ] Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 2/5/2014 ] Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 2/5/2014 ]

First Cup 4|4.0|Coffee & Tea in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|35|4|4.07692307692|" I would usually come here for a Korean BBQ or Spicy Chicken over rice. I would have to say the rice here is a bit hard and the meat in the rice is not that good either with too much sauce. I would come here only because the food is better than Galileo's school lunch. I come here every morning. Monday  Friday right before school starts. Its a great place honestly. The Korean Bbq sandwich is the best sandwich known to man kind! Starving and in a rush, but needing me some protein in the morning, I dashed down the block to First Cup after noticing a small sign in the window advertising breakfast sandwiches. Got a simple egg sandwich on a french roll (granted, I wanted an English muffin but they didn't have any). Added avocado for $. Nothing to shout about. Anyone could make this sandwich anywhere. The sandwich could've benefited from a healthy dose of seasoning (which I subsequently added with a sprinkle of salt and pepper). But the only saving grace was that the sandwich was freshly made (and the avocado nice and creamy) and toasted by the Korean lady owner right there (and well, the shop was completely empty). Doubtful I would return again, but at least filled up my stomach for the day of acting touristy!! great place to buy lunch and snacks but the food doesn't satisfy my taste buds. I'm confused.  Rave reviews?  The only redeeming quality was the lovely owner.  Everything was microwaved  eggs, bacon. . . reheated?!  I gave it a second chance at lunch and the Korean BBQ sandwich was a sad sight.  Again, rubbery microwaved meat, old canned jalapenos?  And cheese?  On a Korean sandwich?  Too many question marks and just not my vision of a fresh sammie.  First cup is sadly, second class. Nice and very friendly couple that work there, the egg sandwich I ordered was pretty good. O the memories I have with this place!I attended Galileo HS years ago and this was one of the few places in the area, luckily for me, they were actually good too! They served lunch boxes with entrees like spaghetti, teriyaki chicken, and other goods. If i remember correctly, i think they were only priced at about $? Their sandwiches were also good and I use to get their croissants a lot with ham and cheese! The people here are very friendly, which is surprising since they get overwhelmed with impatient, hungry students during the school year. Really good Korean BBQ and avocado sandwiches. A little on the small side for $ , but oh well, it's SF, and now that I think about it, larger sandwiches have cost me close to $ before. I really like both the dutch crunch and french roll. Well toasted. great sandwiches.  Fresh ingredients!  The only down side is the price.  which is a bit more than other places, but it is San Francisco and they are worth it.  Don't be afraid of the pastries (which are made fresh) and other goodies too. . .  The people are always very friendly and gladly help you decide which sandwich is the best for the day (although they are all good).  Do not go when the kids from the high school are out or its a zoo. I'm a meat monger.  Me, love a vegetarian sandwich? Only here!First Cup is a gem in the rough, a tiny little place that almost doesn't exist except for a bustling bus stop that helps people discover it.  If you blink while driving down Van Ness and Chestnut you'll totally miss it.  It's also closed on Sundays (aggro!) but that's a different story.  Come for the avocado sandwich and feel what it is to live!On my first visit I whoofed down a loaded  and I mean loaded  french roll with mayo, jalapeno, lettuce, and all the veggiefixins.  It was so good that my associate (who also inhaled his) threwdown for another one which I'm lucky to have split.  I washed it downwith delicious french roast priced at a bargain buck fifty plus fivefor the sandwich.  We felt like we robbed them. Nice folks run it, modest interiors, packed with school kids duringlunchtime and walk ins from the bus stop.  Limited seating within,smallish menu, and lychee juice.  They also sell cantina style meats and rice on the left side of the store which I must try next time I return. Oh, and credit cards are accepted by there's a .  surcharge and the minimum is $.  Note the various quirky signs about outside food and extra $ charges if you dare enter this establishment with external nutrition.  I'm almost tempted to try it to see how many days I can do it with a smile until they kick me out. I think I'm the only person that will find humor in this. Best Avocado sandwich I've ever had. Wow. A really hearty sandwich!  I was quite surprised with the really delicious sandwich that came from a very low key place.  I ordered the turkey sandwich with avocado and got dutch crunch bread.  Yummy.  I can see why so many people like this place so much. Gave this place more of a chance. After a hard workout. . . I'm hungry. . . always. Great place for sandwiches. No fail, I always get the veggie sandwich with avocado and jalapeno chips. Yum. Go there before the high school kids come out for lunch because they swarm in. Otherwise, good place to chill. this place is the best!! the owner is just the nicest. she always knew what i'd be having. Turkey avocado w/ everythin on it! I go there once in awhile when im aroudn the area, and she still knows who i am after graduatin from gal yrs ago. . and who check this place out and you'll see why all its always busy! Give me a pastrami everything on it! Though this place changed owners, it still has the same quality tasting sandwiches. They have many sandwiches to choose from and all the sandwiches (upon request) come out hot and toasty! Yum! As your trusted healthy yelper, I feel it's my duty to yelp whenever a place has the elusive wheat rolls. Hurray, First Cup does. And inside of that roll was a pretty good sandwich. Further bonus points for being open the day after Christmas, enabling me to check another off the ""only open on weekdays"" list. good service, great sandwiches (nice and toasty warm), great price! First Cup is one of the best sandwich places out there! yum! For less than $ you can have the ingredients you want (not counting the meat). . . . they are made for perfection. . :P. . . .  i suggest the pastrami :P. . . its very yum!o and its owned by koreans. . . muffins are made fresh everyday by the korean lady! :D don't miss out! x shells I love First Cup. Haha I used to cut class just to come and buy a Turkey Avocado sandwich or the Chicken Teriyaki sandwich. Its really good. I also love the All dress bagel with everything. I really miss that place. Yup I admit I use to skip class to come here to get lunch. Galileo was just a block away so since I had TA before lunch I get an extra hour to eat. This place had very good beef over rice. I believe it was under $. Yup that was my usual whenever I come here. Beef over rice and a can of Arizona Honey Green Tea. Wow I should go back to get that, that's if they still sell it. I haven't been here since I've graduated from Galileo which was like  years ago. Whoa has it really been that long?They also sell snacks, drinks, ice cream, and sandwiches. Used to come here because my school was a block away . The bagels here are pretty good . Definitely better than Noah's ! You can put turkey and stuff in your bagel as well which is also good . This place is usually pretty crowded during lunch because of the high school students . What they serve for lunch is good but their food is too salty so I would prefer Cafe Le which is across the street if I was hoping to get something for lunch . This is one of those smaller places you just have to support.  It's close to my home and close to my office so how can i go wrong??  Great toasted sandwiches and they're under  bones!  They are super nice there too.  Only thing is that there is a minimum for your debit card so it's sometimes hard when i don't have cash.  When I do happen to have cash though, it makes for a delicious cheap lunch. Tasty submarine sandwiches for $.  Korean bbq beef sandwich is a favorite amongst the boys. best chicken teriyaki sandwich i have ever had! I love this place since it's close to a school and they have the nicest people running it. They serve breakfast and lunch along with snacks and drinks. Sometimes if you go in enough and order the same thing over and over again. . . . they would usually pre order your order. Like today, I went to go get something to eat. . . and the lady asked me if I was going to get a Blueberry bagel with cream cheese and jam; and I told her yes. So she had put in the order for my food to be made. Their smoothies are the second greatest in my book but they are pretty good. But here's a little advice, if you're planning on going there for lunch. . . get it before the High School students come. If not. . then you're in for a long wait as well as some pushing and maybe yelling going around you. First Cup is a little whole in the wall deli owned by the nicest couple ever! They serve breakfast and lunch and everything I've tried has been delicious. Whether it's an almond croissant, a bagel and egg sandwich or one of their lunch sandwiches, it's all good. They even have Falafel and Korean BBQ sandwiches. Choose from a long list of teas, coffee drinks, Snapples, etc. I wouldn't travel far to come here because you can find this stuff anywhere, but because it's in my hood, I frequent it quite often."|5|92|3|Routine| Improper storage use or identification of toxic substances  [ date violation corrected: 4/10/2012 ] Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 10/19/2012 ] Inadequately cleaned or sanitized food contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 10/19/2012 ]
Tacos El Paisano 0|4.0|Food Stands in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|27|0|4.15384615385|" Also, I've become mildly obsessed with their suadero tacos (brisket goodness). They are incredible. Who knew tacos from a taco truck could be so good?! Cause I didn't. . . but maybe because I shy'ed away after eating those fake stuff. . This place is a hidden gem. Located on the corner of Valencia and Cesar Chavez, behind a fence with some mismatched chairs and tables. I came on a beautiful, perfect day. . . . for a car wash next door. (yelp. com/biz/mr ecowash …) Not knowing what to do while by baby was getting cleaned, I decided to go for a stroll. That's when I stumbled upon Tacos El Paisano! I didn't think much of it and just walked past it  heading straight for the Salvation Army next door. (It's because I don't normally buy street food because they're usually overpriced. .  sad face #BrokeCollegeStudent). Coming back, I began to get a bit hungry. My friends always told me that taco trucks were the best, so I decided to try a Pollo (chicken) Taco. I always thought one order of taco came in a set of , but boy, was I wrong? Wondered why the guy gave me a bit of an odd look. . and now I know. The Pollo Taco smelled delicious! Added a few condiments on it and m, my tummy wanted more! After seeing that my car wasn't finished washing yet, I decided to make a second order! While waiting for my first order, I read a few yelp reviews and I thought I would try the Al Pastor this time! (Some reviews said other places don't usually offer this). Omg. . . before I even got the tacos in my hand, my mouth was already drooling inside. It just smelled SO, SO GOOD. I couldn't wait to have the taste in my mouth. I quickly added some condiments, snapped a few photos for friends (Instagram & Snapchat, haha), and stuffed it all down! Thinking about it is currently making my mouth drool. . . sigh. I admit I was also thinking about a third purchase, but by then, my car was done. Party for my belly over. . . :( Some little side notes, I came on a Saturday and the atmosphere was great! A band called Hipsteria was playing right by the taco truck, and it was just a beautiful day to chill there. You may hear the noisy cars and buses pass by, but the food was good, and the weather was great. Got a nice breeze coming in once in awhile :) I would definitely come back again if I'm in the area! Can't resist those tacos! Mm. $ for snack size tacos served on the underside of a frisbee. I had a steak and a carnitas taco. Fresh ingredients and the friendly service. You can't beat this place.  I really like tacos de lengua and you gotta be careful to make sure that it's fresh and not reheated. They're very fresh and tender here. The jazz music is great on the weekends. It's a taco stand. I KNOW it's a taco stand. I have had the tacos, which are good. Fresh, tasty, quick, cheap. But today I was wanting a burger. Go figure. What kind of moron has a burger at a taco truck? But, when I asked, he said he could do one rare if I wanted it that way. Ok, fire up one rare burger please. Mom had the pork tamale. She gave it a thumbs up. The nephew had a chicken burrito. Said it was tasty. But my burger? Excellent. Juicy, rare, well dressed with cheese, lettuce, avocado, some bacon, tomato. The meat was not typical hamburger. The guy had taken meat and just chopped it up and made a patty and cooked it fresh. really really good. Next time my mom is jonsing for Mexican and I am not? Down the block to Paisanos we go!Did I mention it was the best  buck burger I have ever had? Gives Joe's Cable Car Burger a run for the money. And the jazz is good on the weekends. One star off because even on a nice sunny day it's windy and really noisy with the traffic, but hey, it's a taco truck. Or a burger truck. Or something. Good, that's what it is, good! I've become a regular here: Everything is freshly cooked, nothing stewing forever. Tasty and inexpensive. Maybe the Yelp set in SF just isn't down for taco carts on the corner of Chavez? (Re:  reviews). That seems odd as Off The Grid gets incredible amounts of attention while this family owned authentic taco cart is what the original mobile food looked like. You can marvel as much as you'd like at that carrot julienne teetering atop beef braised beer on a tortilla, but nothing, I mean nothing, will ever top chopped cilantro & onion on a bed of traditional Mexican cabeza. Each taco is $. , and there's some mighty remarkable traditional al pastor off the spit with pineapple here. And for whatever reason. . . al pastor on the spit isn't as common as you'd think. In the parking lot of a car wash, accessible off Chavez, they've set up a shaded area with picnic tables, and the standard salsa bar. I walked up here on a Saturday afternoon and a jazz trio named Hipsteria was playing on the corner. I'd imagine that some might think of my love of this place as yet another example of the Hipsteria of white dudes who like street tacos. I just love tacos, love authentic meat shacks like this and the fine dining experience of being street side using the top of my car as a table. Perfect ambiance on the corner of Valencia & Cesar Chavez, behind a chain link fence. Noisy from passing cars & muni. You order from a truck & take a seat at one of the mismatched tables & chairs (this joint's got more seating than some sf brick & mortar restaurants!) On a sunny spring day like today, you can't beat this outdoor lunch excursion. Tacos are on the small side (think street tacos. ) Bf ordered an al pastor & a carne asada. Add toppings (cilantro, onions, salsas, radishes, etc) from a makeshift bar. My carne asada huaraches (thin fried corn pocket filled with mashed black beans, oblong shape) was surprisingly awesome. Meat consisted of medium sized pieces of crisp fried steak (an acceptable amount of grease was involved. ) Topped with tomatoes, lettuce, avocado, & cotija cheese. Large enough to share. Total: $.  (includes a bottle of Mexican coke & a bottle of fanta)Order taker/cook was a super friendly guy! Only issue we've had  the random hours this dude keeps! We've come by several times (such stalkers!) during regular business hours to find the truck shut up. They're elusive, but if you can get 'em while they're open, you're in for some truly tasty eats. Fowl play. Starts and stops with the chicken. Delicious. Grilled with minimal oil. Hint of lime. It's excellent. So is the staff. Friendly. Welcoming. Sense of pride for their little corner of the Mission. So why two stars? It stops with the chicken too. As in the $ taco and $ torta had almost nothing else. No beans. No salsa. OK for the taco. Way below average compared to others on the torta. Four stars for the chicken. Four stars for the people. An unfortunate two ""I've experienced better"" stars overall. Without  a doubt, some of the best mexican you can get in SF. They cook the meat right in front of you when you order it (they don't scoop if out of a vat like a lot of taco shops). The al pastor is my favorite, but the pollo is also quite good. Beyond the food, this place is excellent because it is run by one of the nicest families around. On more than one occasion I came up a dollar or two short (it is cash only, of course), and they just told me to pay them next time around. I know it is a small thing, but it means a lot to me. Get there early if you want nopales in your burrito, they run out! Decent. Ordered a cecina and al pastor taco. Both lacked char and the tortilla was a bit raw as well. Gotta heat those puppies through!! Street tacos  people! Yum!  I wanted something quick and filling while on my lunch break, so I used my Yelp app to help me find something.  This little truck got great ratings, so I decided to make a stop.  $.  for a taco sounded like a decent deal, so I ordered a carne asada one.  The guy running it sauteed the meat right in front of me, placed it on top of two little corn tortillas, then had me fill it with ingredients at the front of the truck: green salsa, spicy red salsa, peppers, cilantro, and onions.  Pretty awesome!  It was a tad bit salty, but satisfying.  Since I ordered it to go, after I finished filling it, he covered it with foil, but there is a little seating area next to the truck.  Definitely plan on returning!"|3|94|3|Routine Inspection| Inadequate dressing rooms or improper storage of personal items Other low risk violation Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils

(how long does it take to eat a taco anyway?!) parking is tough as of right now. . . they;'re doing work on cesar chavez. . . but across the street from here on valencia there seems to be parking. this place is all outdoors except for the llittle truck they do the cooking. okay.  the food tastes great.  the service was great.  the location sucks. . . and again, its outdoors. . so its kind of cold in this area.  don't get me wrong.  the food itself, well, the papusas.  can give it a star or two higher. the price for the papusa is .  each, which isn't a lot. . . but its more than  dollars which is how much it normally costs. it was quick and fast, and fresh.  she made it right there on the spot too.  she didn't take a long time and like i said before she's quick and friendly. the only other thing that dropped a star off. . . . they give this tiny little container, like you use for ketchup, or for salsa at most restaurants. . . its much too small a cup of the cabbage that goes on top of the papusa.  maybe if i had asked for the food to stay and eat there. . . but i don't want to eat where all the cars are driving by. . . as its windy. . . and i'm assuming i'm eating lots of particulates in the air. but this is a good place.  give it a try!  they have LOTS of things on the MENU. the burritos were cheaper. . . well, compared to some burrito places that is. These guys are awesome.  Tried their tripe taco, which was excellent, and their pork papusa, which was also great. They made the papusa on the spot.  Owner is very friendly and enthusiastic, their menu was pretty interesting, and they had some beautiful looking meat stewing that I will definitely try next time. yummy!  easy! quick!  love the tacos tripas.  love the food quality.  love the people.  a great little gem.  support it!  eat there! would hate to see this little taco truck leave the mission. Summary below:* Cheap  %  % cheaper than than the rest of taquerias in the mission* Variety  Tacos, Burritos, Huraches, Pupupas, etc.  I had the tacos and they were worth the $.  I paid for them.

Good place for cheap eats in the area. . . . . . . . . . Tacos El Paisano is owned and operated by a friendly gent whose cooking style is that of the street tacos found in Mexico City.  While all the varieties we ordered were flavorful, we especially enjoyed the al pastor, as itmwas the juiciest.  Inexpensive and a large variety of burritos and tacos somehow all fit into a small, clean trailer on the corner of Cesar Chavez and Valencia.|3|100|0|Routine|This inspection has no violations.
Tacos El Paisano 2|4.0|Food Stands in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|27|2|5.0| A hidden gem deep in the heart of the Mission!Last night, on my way to a dinner party in the Haight, I stumbled across the Tacos El Paisano Truck.  I must have driven past that intersection a hundred times and did a double take when I saw the word 'Papusas' enblazened across the back of the truck.  I have been looking for a good Papusaria for years and every place I have visited in the Mission has fallen far short of my expectations until now. I have found most papusas to be overcooked, overly greasy, or deflated after having been related to the heat lamp for god knows how long.  El Paisano bucks this trend by making everything fresh on the spot.  As soon as I ordered, the Woman behind the counter immediately started rolling the raw dough for the Papusas. . What?!?!?!  I have NEVER seen this process before, especially in a truck!  As I sat waiting, in eager anticipation, the Gentleman behind the counter offered me two free carnita tacos.  YUM!I took  cheese and bean and  cheese and pork Papusas to my dinner party and they were an immediate hit.  Light and fluffy with just the right cheese to grease ratio.   was more than enough to feed our dinner party for under $ ($.  per Papusa).  I would HIGHLY recommend the Tacos El Paisano Truck for lunch, dinner, or after bar late night snack.  It is a unique family owned business and I would like to see them succeed.  They also have a small side area with tables and chairs if you choose to to dine in.  Go get a Papusa at El Paisano today, you will not be disappointed!|3|80|4|Routine| Mobile food facility with unapproved operating conditions  [ date violation corrected: 1/30/2013 ] Unclean hands or improper use of gloves  [ date violation corrected: 1/30/2013 ] Inadequately cleaned or sanitized food contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 1/30/2013 ] Improper food storage  [ date violation corrected: 1/30/2013 ]

Wontons were soft and actually had shrimp in it! I wasn't a big fan of the wide flat noodles (ho fun). The pieces were either too big or too small  like someone Fruit Ninja ed the noodles for real. . . but you don't need to get those kinds of noodles; that's just one thing out of their decent sized menu. The Sesame Dumplings though! I'd come back for those for sure! DELICIOUS!A hidden gem on Vicente, I tell you! We were back again Friday evening.  As usual, we had the wor won ton soup as a starter and finished the entire bowl. I had the tomato beef over rice which was excellent.  There was so much, I took home half of it for lunch. This place is a real find. What is there not to like here?! Food is beyond delicious if that's even possible. . . And the portion is more than generous. My god brother took my family here when he first moved into the neighborhood and I have been coming here whenever I get the chance to. I love their won tons, potstickers, their scrambled eggs with beef over noodles, and that sauce yumy. My dad would make excuses to pick me up from school just to eat here haha good times. I don't know why I never wrote a review but here it is! It's the worst when you're craving their food and their closed. . . . . . :,( Really? Only .  stars?I really liked this place! I went on a Sunday morning with my aunt and we had a wait a few minutes, but not too too long. It's REALLY REALLY small inside. We ordered shrimp and egg (to go for my mom and brother), Singaporean noodles, wor wonton soup, and beef and egg over ho fun. The ho fun was DELISH, def my favorite. Very well made, I would def order again. The wonton was ehh, it was good, but I mean not my favorite ever. As other reviewers have said, do yourself a favor and order egg and shrimp/beef/whatever over rice or ho fun. THE BEST. I love this place. I have been coming here since i was in elementary school. small and family like the food is always delicious i recommend the scrambled egg and shrimp over ho fun and their friend wontons are actual won tons with shrimp inside not just the wrappers place is tiny but worth it. Awesome tiny hole in the wall in the Richmond but great if you beat the early morning rush.  I had the fish juk, slippery egg with steak and chow fun, and gai lans with oystah sauce.  The women that work there are very nice too and thought my cantonese was cute.  :) One of my favorite places to eat. I remember my aunt would bring me here to eat lunch multiple times when I was just a kid. Food is good for the price and I love ordering the Friend Won Ton. HANGRY post.  I really like Just Won Ton's wet scrambled egg with beef chow fun, but I did not appreciate the FORTY FIVE MINUTE WAIT for my to go order.  Yes, the restaurant was busy (all seats taken, in fact), but this was no excuse, especially when a couple who came in and sat down  minutes AFTER I already placed my order not only got their food before I did, but they got their food AND finished eating as I stood off to the side and watched, hangry.  And when you do not appease my hangry ness, you lose Yelp stars.  Sorry, Just Won Ton.  Otherwise you'd have been a solid  star establishment. P. S. I did feel bad for another couple who looked to be on the verge of hangry.  They had actually places their to go order just before mine, but were still waiting when my food finally arrived!  I guess at least it wasn't just me.  Because just like misery, hangry loves company. I was very disappointed. I remember this place to have delicious won ton and dumpling soup and side dishes that I loved. Oh ok so it's been more than  years. . .  The same soup is now lukewarm and tasteless.  No more little side dishes so we ordered dry chow fun an a chow mein. They were oily and burnt. Yes burnt!  All I could taste was soy sauce. The reason they got a one is because of the server. She was friendly and attentive. Something has changed here.  New owner?   The quality and quantity if the food has gone downhill.  Here is what I noticed:  shrimp in the wonton has gone from giant to very small.  The shrimp in shrimp/egg over rice or fun has also been reduced down to just bigger than bay shrimp (the number has also gone down. . . maybe I got ?).  Quantity of food has also reduced to be non filling. Seated right at noon, the place is empty.  Throughout our dining,   tables started filling up.  We ordered the wonton noodle soup and the beef brisket/wonton noodle soup. Noodle is good/chewy.  Wonton are ok, looks home made/wrapped.  Soup is flavorful.  Portion is huge, loads of noodles and wontons.  Service is good. We have been going to Just Won Ton for decades. My parents would pick me up from basketball practice at Hoover and we would drive down the hill, all looking forward to piping hot ho fun and won ton. My favorite was the giant zhongzi, but their zhongzi maker quit years ago and they were never able to replicate her delicious recipe. Nonetheless, the ho fun steels the show, and is always worth a trip out to Vicente. The food is consistently ""pretty good"".  I haven't had a dish I didn't like yet.  When you consider the dirt cheap prices, that's worth  stars."|4|90|3|Routine Inspection| Unclean nonfood contact surfaces Foods not protected from contamination Moderate risk food holding temperature

Definitely the spicy chicken recommendable  if someone take just it he or she must provide for this place at least four from the stock of five. The hot full black sauce bean with radish yummy. The waitress from where I got my service  was really efficient and friendly too to provide service and speech ok for coming in the next time. I was a little skeptical about trying this place because of  its appearance, but I'm glad I gave it a try after reading the Yelp reviews.  This place looks a little shady from the outside, once you walk in, you'd be surpirsed by its cleanness.  We ordered roasted duck wonton noodle soup and soft scrambled egg shrimp over ho fun, both dishes were amazing.  The food here reminds me of my childhood food from China, very simple and authentic.  Once again, never judge a book by its cover!  Another hidden gem is found! I have been coming here for over  years and this is the first time I have been disappointed and my wife too. She had the soft scrambled egg with shrimp over rice. The shrimp in the past were closer to prawns which was great but now the shrimp is closer to Bay Shrimp size! The rice was dry and hard. My wife asked for Hoi Sin Sauce and waiter brought Oyster sauce. Shouldnt he know the difference? I ordered the Dumplings with noodles and duck. The broth was not like before, kind of bland. The Dumplings were over cooked because it fell apart in the soup while the bamboo shoots were chewy inside the dumplings. The potstickers were ok but the skin seemed thicker than in the past and the bottom of the potstickers was not crispy. The last thing was they ran out of Coke. This is the first time the food was sub par and service was bad in over  years which isnt a bad track record really. I think the owners are getting tired as anybody would being in business that long. I will try again though. Good hole in the wall place for wonton noodle soup!  I have been here a couple of times.  The first time I had beef wonton noodle soup and the second time I had the rib wonton noodle soup.  The flavor is authentic, but not as enjoyable or my americanized tongue. . .  My daughter had the dumpling soup and didn't care for it.  Gailon is good.  I'd like to come back and try the soft scrambled egg dish everyone seems to rave about! Soft scrambled egg and shrimp chow fun. That's it. I don't understand why this place doesn't get better reviews. Their food is cheap, tasty, and just down home moms cooking. I really love their broth for their won ton soups and their won tons are packed with meaty flavor. Their soft boiled egg over their ho fun noodles are delicious. I asked for the noodles to be slightly burnt for that wok flavor and it was just perfect!! This is a must go back for me. Good price, good food. . . good to go. As an Asian American growing up in San Francisco, I strive for tasty Chinese food. Just Won Ton is definitely a go to spot for good ol' Chinese comfort food. Whenever I come here, I am greeted by the friendly waitress and seated immediately. I order my ""Usual"" the Egg/Ho Fun/Beef. I come here so often, that the waitress would already know what I want. That already deserves  star for the service! I wait no longer than  minutes for my food to arrive, and I am presented with a work of art. The amount of food is ridiculous. It's literally a giant mountain full of food for less than $! Just Won Ton is a hidden gem in San Francisco. Make sure you guys visit this spot for good Chinese comfort food in a friendly, family environment. You would leave satisfied, and a stomach full of happiness. Convinced friends to stop here on our way out of town to try the recommended ho fun with soft scrambled eggs and beef (modernluxury. com/san fra…) and it was exactly as described. Nice chewy ho fun noodles with yummy scrambled eggs and tender beef. Not too greasy or over sauced. I just about put away the entire platter. Another friend ordered the ho fun with soft scrambled eggs and shrimp. I didn't try it but she seemed really happy with it. Others ordered the wonton soup instead. The noodles were okay and so were the won tons. The broth was light. I found the soup a little bland compared to the ho fun. Between the four girls we ordered two plats of ho fun and two bowls of the won ton soup. It was pretty optimistic. I suggest you stick to less than  dish per person if you want to finish it all. It was only $ per person including tax and tip. The place is pretty basic but it's clean and not divey. Not much ambiance but that's not why you come here. I've only tried a few dishes from here so far, but I have to say, they are really good!  The soft scrambled eggs and beef ho fun is really tasty along with the tomato beef chow mein.  On top of that, the service here is really good and the waitresses are a lot nicer than those at other Chinese restaurants in the area. Take out was great. They're best known for the Ho Fun dishes (see back of the menu) so i went with the scrambled egg with beef Ho Fun for about $. . Very good, very friendly service. Food looked simple, but very tasty, and had great comfort. Very large proportion for takeout size. The lady gave extra fried won ton which was tasted great. Coming back for more. . . hopefully. This is my go to place for take out won ton soup. It's fresh and the won ton dumplings are great. The actual premises smell and most every surface is sticky, namely  the vinyl tablecloths and the floor. I can't really say it's dirty as much as everything is so cheap (even for a cheap Chinese joint). But it's always filled with local Chinese who seem to enjoy the food. So, the ambiance is abominable but the won ton soup is solid. Love, love, love the sui gow and won ton soup. This place feels nice and homey and way cleaner than the other won ton joints in the Sunset. Review only for the porridge. Bleh! Get your porridge jook somewhere else. Awful. It's not good. Should've just stick to the reviews and go with the wonton noodle soup or beef scramble eggs. Better yet, Cheung Hing has better porridge. Go there instead. Beef hor fun w soft scrambled. Would have liked a bit more 'wok hei' but the scramble was packed with umami and the portion size was rite. $. . Good service. Tasty tea. I had the spicy chicken won ton noodle soup yesterday and it was really good! I'd come back again for it. The bf had the potstickers, which he said were bomb! He also had the BBQ pork noodle plate and finished it all before I even finished my soup! A much deserved  stars from my previous review. I definitely recommend the spicy chicken won ton noodle soup! The prices are really affordable too. Everything came out to $.  before tip. Wonton noodle was the best I've ever had. Place was clean and quiet, with very polite staff. My friend ordered the soft scrambled egg with beef and hofun, which tasted amazing. The price of the food was cheap in contrast to the high quality. We also ordered the potstickers, which was also very delicious. Overall, a good place to eat with lots of parking around the area. Just Won Ton just offers cheap food, no ambience, no decor. the walls are bare. no tv. the usual rice plates, chow fun/mein, won ton, stir fry entrees. almost everything is ish. eats: won ton soup (. ) about  large sized won tons with crunchy fresh, tasty shrimp within. one piece of fresh bok choy broth was just msg enhanced, didn't drink the kool aid.  stars for won ton, ish for the broth. leftovers:  stars for cheap eats. minus.  for the excess msg fast. friendly service. should be  stars. Good Service, my waitress was very nice. The egg noodles used were kind of bland for my taste, the soup used was really good( i could tell that they really put the time and effort into making it), wontons and dumpings were on point :) I'm surprised this place is still open , I've been coming here since I was  with my grandma and grandpa , and I'm  right now , I always loved this place! Always come here to eat won ton noodle soup or beef stew noodle soup with flat noodles ! The prices increased over the years and is about the same as a bowl of pho on irving now   , however I always love this little place and the noodle soups here are spot on delicious! Much better than the noodle soups you would order at a larger chinese restaurant and the portions aren't too bad! , overall / stars! Your typical hidden gem hole in the wall.  Expect a nice meal for cheap. Not a first date kind of place unless you really don't want the second date.  The have generous portions of won tons with woodear, pork, and shrimp in the.  The pot stickers are also really good and crispy.  Their house specialty would be the fun noodles with egg beef gravy topping  I've never had that before, and it was really good.  Again, not much in the way of ambiance, but great grub. Comfort Food a couple blocks away from me? WIN.  I've gone here since I was in Pre school!Soft Scrambled Egg and Beef Ho Fun (Like Chow Fun)Won ton soup with noodle and beef stewBeef with tofu and blackbean sauce over riceHong Kong style (Pan Fried) House noodlesTheir hot sauce is full black bean with radish and spices.  Not exactly the spiciest, but definitely a more flavorful approach to hot saucesTotal mom and pop dive.  Every so often, I see the owner pop out of the kitchen to see how busy it is.  I remember him when I was  or .  He was kinda scary to me then, and now he's just adorable.  If you need extra broth, ask.  I think it's on the house.  Oohwe oh deamn. a couple weeks ago, a couple of my friends and I woke up at the ass crack of dawn, set out to SF, and then ran  goddamn miles. needless to say, we were starved after the marathon. Since the finish line was by ocean beach, we ended up passing through the sunset on our way back and my friend exclaimed there was a place that had the best won ton soup and ho fun noodles nearby. this place is a serious hole in the wall, but I've found that usually means some tasty grub is about to get in my belleh. we ordered the won ton soup, and the scrambled eggs over ho fun. I had mine with shrimp, and my friend had her usual with beef. one of my other friends is allergic to shellfish, and the server offered her won tons without shrimp. I'm not sure if they had these premade, or if they made them to order, but either way it was a very nice gesture. the soup hit the spot! I don't know if it's because it was cold outside, or I was feeling like I was near death, or a combination of both, but the broth was nice and clean and the won tons are tasty. the ho fun dish is some serious comfort food. a big ass plate full of noodles, topped with very soft scrambled eggs, meat, and sauce. ask for their hot sauce! the pickled whatever it is on the table is yummy too. if I was still at SFSU/lived nearby, I would probably be here at least once a week. Delicious:Soft scrambled egg & beef over ho funWontons Good value ($ $ / dish)Not Delicious:Fried tofu  dry If you don't like Christmas music, avoid this during the holidays :)  It's the aesthetic definition of a hole in the wall restaurant, a local neighborhood no frills place to eat. What it lacks in aesthetics, it makes up for in food quality. If you like Fried Won Ton, and are tired of other restaurants definition as being either just the fried wrapping skin, or the fried wrapping skin with a morsel of dried ground meat the size of a pea, then look no further than Just Won Ton's version, which is a robust full, juicy fried won ton, similar in size to what you get in the soup, so it's a delicious meal rather than a disappointing appetizer. The spicy chicken in the won ton or noodles makes the soup very flavorful and zesty, so I'd recommend those. Good, cheap food.  Awesome won ton noodle soup, and if you're feeling indulgent, definitely try the soft scrambled egg with beef or shrimp over ho fun.  The staff has always been very attentive and friendly. . Local Restaurant (   minutes drive from home). My Favorite dish  Soft Scrambled Eggs & Beef over Rice. I come and dine in once a month at least. Spicy pickles. Quiet (it may not be good for the biz owner). Food is cheap. able to take to go as well. Restaurant is always quite (business is slow) so most of the time, there's only the lady with her son possibly that will be taking orders from customers in the front. They're always nice and paid attention to whatever you need. Very briefly. . . We love this place. Low key. Good prices. Great service. Homestyle Chinese basics. Best dishes so far:Soft Scrambled Egg & Shrimp Over Ho FunWor Won Ton SoupCurry Pot StickersSesame Dumpling (desert)They also have a beef version of the Ho Chow Fun: Soft Scrambled Egg & Beef Over Ho Fun. Beef is bigtime chewy. Suggest steering clear of anything with beef for that reason.

Just Won Ton 2|3.5|Chinese in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|190|2|3.125|" We found this place on whim when i was craving wontons. A hole in the wall but definitely our new go to place when the wonton cravings attack! Would have gave them  stars but they're liars. They serve more than just won ton. Satisfying food is all I care about. Flavors are on hit at this spot, and satisfies time and time again. . . except when they ran out of BBQ beef. This place is a little dirty on the outside and blends in with the fog, easy to miss. *looks like is best to eat in, rather than take because their portions are smaller Like other reviewers have commented, Just Won Ton's Soft Scrambled Egg & Beef or Shrimp Over Ho Fun (that's chow fun to most) is their strong point ( stars): it is simple and tasty, focusing on the main ingredients and forgetting the (much needed) flavoring garnishments. The ""wet"" scrambled eggs, beef/shrimp, and flat rice noodles dressed in oyster sauce do most of the work to bring taste to your tongue. Any sweet yellow onions, green onions, garlic or parsley were noticeably absent. The noodles were oily but not greasy, if that makes sense. The other entrees my family tried were underwhelming and proportionately small for the price. Noodles in the Beef Brisket & Won Ton with Noodle Soup and Shanghai Chow Mein didn't have that fresh, housemade quality (more like packaged instant noodles). Some were undercooked and clung together from not being stirred in boiling water. The wontons were small and the filling is a tad bit better than dim sum quality. The Shanghai Chow Mein also left much to be desired: flavor tasted like Americanized microwaveable packaged chow mein and the cabbage was quite bitter. Spicy chicken won ton noodle soup after watching the US OPEN on a cold and foggy night just warmed up my bones. Also a big hit is the scrambled egg with beef over ho fun noodles. I read about this place online, and I decided to try it out with my gf. We had to wait for a table because it was a smaller establishment. The food was good, so it seemed worth it at the time. A few months later, it was my best friend's birthday and we decided to take him out. This was nearby and so we dropped by. Of course the restaurant was packed, and once again we waited at the entry for  minutes. Another lady comes in and asks for a table for . I was thinking ""good luck with that"". Well, another  min goes by, and a few people are getting up to leave. So, we were finally going to sit down for lunch after waiting nearly half an hour. The table gets cleaned, and another table clears out.  I was waiting for the restaurant staff to seat us, when they called in the other lady and asks them to sit down. I was not pleased since we'd been waiting there much longer than she was. I stopped the manager and asked why they were being seated first, and they replied that they had to seat the bigger party first. I objected and indicated that we arrived before and they knew it. Well, I decided to make a scene because I was really upset at this restaurant, and they didn't apologize for their actions. Clearly, it's more important to make a buck than to have good customer service. This place sucks. The staff was rude. And the food was just average. Nothing fancy about this place.  In fact, it's pretty much your hole in the wall, but those are also some of the best places to eat.  Now, ""the best"" wouldn't be something I would use to describe this place, but I definitely think it does a good job.  My friend has been coming here for over  years and it has been consistent.  This little neighborhood joint has definitely lasted the times and it's just nice to support the mom and pop's.  Bottom line: Do it! Very good prices, very small. Twice I've ordered a dish with eggplant and the eggplant was undercooked. Stick with the wonton and noodles and you'll be OK."|4|83|4|Routine| High risk vermin infestation  [ date violation corrected: 8/31/2012 ] Improper storage of equipment utensils or linens  [ date violation corrected: 8/31/2012 ] Inadequate food safety knowledge or lack of certified food safety manager  [ date violation corrected: 8/31/2012 ] Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities  [ date violation corrected: 8/31/2012 ]
Just Won Ton 3|3.5|Chinese in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|190|3|3.65891472868|" bomb dot com If you've ever tried authentic wontons in China, you'll know that nothing else outside of the country can taste just as good. (If so, let me know) Luckily, I found this place. I've been coming here since high school and this is the only restaurant I would even bother ordering wonton. Anyways, as everyone else stated, the must try dish is the soft scrambled egg and beef over ho fun. IN FACT, it doesn't even matter if it's shrimp, rice or whatever. All of which will be completely filling and satisfying. The portions they give you are more than generous (Trust me, I eat a lot). Sometimes, I can't even finish the entire plate and have to resort to putting it in a box. But WHATEVER. That just means I get to experience the explosion of flavor in my mouth again. If you're feeling lazy and want to eat home or even need to grab a quick bite before work, just order to go. Quick, fast, easy, great tasting, what more can you ask for? I leave this restaurant every time happy and with no regrets. Scrambled egg and shrimp/beef over 'ho' fun. Best in town guaranteed. Been eating there as a kid since an elementary school classmate's mom worked there. They should rename this place 'just scrambled egg and shrimp ho fun'. It's been a while since I had been here so I was not sure if it was still there. It is!! I was so happy. I ordered the beef tendon won ton noodle soup. It's delicious as it always was. The won tons are decent sized and very fresh. You can tell that they just cooked it and it had not been sitting out all day long. It was the perfect lunch for a cool day in SF.  Prices are good and service is decent.   I'll be back for more. Great wontons, both fried and in soup. The waitress also recommended a chow fun that had egg in it. Never seen that before but it was a good addition. Prices are definitely reasonable and parking is easy with no meters. I've been a few times now and always the same waitress. She is very nice and easy to talk to. It's pretty quite the times I went, which is a good thing as the food comes faster. Oh, the spicy pickled vegetables they have are pretty good to add to any dish or just eat while waiting for your food. Why do people even come here?  It's in the middle of nowhere.  Unless you live in walking distance, why would anyone trek across town, get lost in the fog, and have to dodge bullets for a bowl of wontons?  Really.  Don't come here.  This place is too small for the rush of foodie tourist.  We don't want the lines out the door, and the  hour wait, for simple dumplings like @ Shanghai Dumpling King on Taraval.  Leave this neighborhood spot for people actually in the neighborhood.  We don't need you to take up all the parking.  The old ladies that work here do not need the added stress of a bunch of hipster dufus foodies taking pictures of the food.  Hearty.  Filling.  Soup, noodles, dumplings, and assorted toppings like beef & duck.  Pretty decent rice dishes.  A must have is the chow fun with scrambled eggs & shrimp.  Try the black sesame glutinous rice balls for desert.  And their house made condiment in the jar of pickled turnip, garlic, black beans, and chili oil goes on just about everything.  Everything except the sweet black sesame glutinous rice balls, and your cup of tea. I've been coming here for a number of years and must say that the won ton is still plump and juicy, which means there is enough fat to make it tasty.  The woh won ton mien is plentyful with a little bit of everything.  The cha sew pieces are sometimes a hit and miss (too fatty) but that's the roll of the dice.  Love the broth and it's not too salty.  I don't think they use MSG since I didn't have an attack after eating their food.  A bit of a disappointment was the pot stickers which my friend ordered as an appetizer.  Why would anyone order pot stickers at a won ton joint?  But he did and it came out rather dry and hard.  That said, just stick to the won ton. The place is starting to show its age and perhaps time for a bit of a make over.  I remember when there was a write up in the newspapers highlighting this place and you couldn't get in without a wait.  No waiting now and maybe time to change the plastic on the tables.  But come for the food.  The won ton is great. beef and scrambled egg over rice w/ lots and lots of the radish/black bean sauce! my bf and i ALWAYS order that! ^^ :) best in town. I have been coming to this place for more than  years now and each time I receive friendly service. The roast duck and wor won ton noodle soup are a must try and their chow fun is the best in town! They use fresh wide ""fun"" noodles and its always cooked to perfection. I love coming here as its casual and a nice homey feeling. This is the only place I know that has curry potstickers and the taste is incredible. If you have not tried this place you must at least go once. I come here all the time and the owner is so nice and friendly! My favorite dishes is the won ton noodle soup with thick noodle, fried rice, and chow mein. They do tend to add a little too much oil, but besides that, I always crave this place! Fast, comfort food like, hole in the wall/mom&pop place. It was my first time eating there, but i got the fish ball wonton noodle soup. With some chilli oil, it hit the spot! On a friday night, it was pretty packed for a small place. The woman working there was sweet too! I've been eating a lot of won ton soups lately, well twice in two weeks is a lot for me.  Naturally, I'm going to compare the two places.  Just Won Ton's wontons are a lot smaller than the ones at Ming Tai Wun Tun Noodle.  But they give you, I think  wontons compared to  super large ones.  The broth at JWT wasn't as good but they have bok choy instead of a piece of iceburg lettuce submerged in it.  So, it's a toss up for me but I think the flavor at Ming Tai Wun Tun was much better. If you're coming to Just Won Ton I suggest not getting won tons.  Try some of their noodles dishes everyone is raving about.  We ordered the soft scrambled egg with beef over ho fun and it was pretty darn good.  Look at everyone's pics and you'll get an idea of how simple but yummy this dish is.  It's basically pan fried fun noodles topped with lightly scrambled eggs mixed with some beef and oyster sauce drizzled over the whole dish.  Mix the toppings in with the noodles before you serve or else you'll run out of toppings and end up just eating pan fried noodles.  Last but not least, I have to comment on their hot sauce.  I remember back in the days when I used to come with my parents they had this amazing hot sauce I could just eat out of the jar.  Now they have something I could still eat out of the jar but it's slightly different.  I think they're pickled turnip pieces mixed with some hot chili oil and black beans.  Still yummy but not as good as I remembered it from years back.  star MUST get dish: Shrimp and scrambled egg over ho fun noodles. It's amazing. I'd go back for more monthly easily. Oyster sauce, the perfectly cooked, melted egg over thick noodles and about  pieces of shrimp. I loved, loved it! I ordered it based on about  other Yelp reviews saying to get it. But it was hidden on the last page of the menu and when I asked the server about it, she was just ""whatever"" about it and said everything on the menu is good. They need to up their selling skills!.  star: Won Ton Noodle soup w/Beef Brisket $. ). The brisket was more meaty and less fat than other Chinese noodle places, but the won tons were nothing special. A very average dish that is overpriced compared to the same at numerous other Chinese cafe's. I am from out of town and my cousin brought & introduced me to this small, quiet 'hole in the wall' place. I really enjoyed the Chinese 'comfort' home style food they serve. The wontons are freshly made, crispy & flakey which melt in your mouth (you can never eat enough of them!), and the dumpling & wonton soup is great!! Their dish with flat noodles, scrambled eggs & shrimp w/ginger sauce is a dish you must try, if you can finish it all! Mom & pop joint with plain decor. I usually go for their savory salted beef and egg over rice, but the quality has been wavering as of late. Meh. . Won ton is not the easiest thing to cook. If your broth is plain, it kills the rest of the meal. I came in here one day soaked from the rain and was up for a steaming hot bowl of wontons. Minimum to charge your credit card is $. , not sure why the $.  but can't really complain I suppose. I ordered the Roast Duck Won Ton Ho Fun Noodle Soup. The owner was really friendly and attentive. My food came out not too long after placing my order, and I dove right in. I tried the black bean sauce that everyone was talking about and I personally could do without it. I love sticking to the hot sauce instead. I don't even like black bean too much, but figured I'd give it a shot. The wonton was filled with pork and shrimp. It didn't quite capture the fresh taste I was hoping for. The shrimp and pork was pretty bland and the broth did little to complement it too. My noodles were stuck together but it didn't bother me too much. The roast duck was meat and I was glad to not be stuck with all fat. I'll likely be back, but maybe only if I'm in the area. I'll have to try something new next time! This is another one of my fav spots to go to. They don't have the best wontons, but it sure hits the spot when I want wontons. Simple and to the point. Nice clean broth, crunchy noodles, and lets not forget the side sauce they have! It's this daikon black bean sauce. It really makes you come back. The daikon is crunchy and the sauce is chili oil. It goes great with the wonton noodle soup. The other thing I come here for is the soft scrambled egg with beef over noodle. It is the best I have ever had. On a quiet night, me and my husband come here and order these  things for dinner. We get a good simple dinner in less than half an hour. Can't beat that It is definitely a hole in the wall, nothing fancy. Of course we had to order the Noodle Soup with Wonton, we actually ordered it with Beef Brisket too.  Growing up, I really enjoyed Wonton Noodle Soup, it was one of my favorites. But as I got older, I realized that restaurants no longer made it with the noodles perfectly crunchy so I rarely order it now. Sadly, the only time I get really good Wonton Noodle Soup is in Hong Kong.  So as I tasted this at Just Wonton, I was skeptical. The first few bites were good, but I had to eat it fast so that the noodles wouldn't get soggy. I thought the wontons were only okay, I thought the beef brisket was not bad. But, what I really liked was adding the hot sauce they made to complement the dishes, it was made with preserved turnips and black beans.   I also read that they had the best Soft Scrambled Egg and Shrimp Over Ho Fun (thick rice noodles), and yes, I was definitely not disappointed with this dish! It was really good, the eggs and rice noodles tasted silky smooth.  If I ever feel like having this dish, I will definitely come here! service is decent for a chinese place, but the Wonton noodle soup with stewed beef is killer with their hot sauce and vinegar.  also love the chow fun. How could this place survive all these years in the same neighborhood that Riverside Seafood Restaurant (one of the better Chinese choices in the Southern half of the city) runs their business?I've had ""dumplings & noodle in soup"" in HK, Chinatowns around the world (London, Toronto, NY), and you can't fool me with the crap of this level. If I ever wanted to have a bawl of Cantonese style ""noodle in soup"" again, I'd drive across Chinatown and go here (the shop is not the cutest, but tastes are guaranteed to be satisfying)yelp. com/biz/hons wun tu… craving won ton soup so i found the closest place to me. . . . . def not the best place.  they use this dried shrimp stuff and the soup had this fishy, caca smell to it and the noodles were real thin and just not good. . . i didnt enjoy and now i feel like i smell like dried shrimp caca.  no bueno. . . . maybe this place is a little too authentic for me, i dunno.  not feelin it at all This unassuming, small and cozy restaurant makes an outstanding dumpling soup.  The wonton soup is okay but I prefer the dumpling soup.  Their fried wonton appetizers are delightful and the yung chow fried rice is prepared the way that all fried rice should be prepared!  Not greasy, not loaded with MSG, and oh so delicious! on a cold winter night, i stumbled in to escape the rain and had a bowl of hot, surprisingly delicious wonton soup! surprising only because i had never heard of or been in this teeny tiny establishment before. the wontons were delicate with wonderful flavor, (they tasted homemade) and the broth and noodles were wholesome and tasty. it was cheap, nourishing and warmed me right up. what more can you ask for on a night like that? I saw a review in the SF Examiner in April, and have been trying to find an excuse to go eat there. I live downtown, and i was not about to travel all the way down there for soup. I should of because this place is really good. The place is small, and is out of place from the neighborhood meaning that there aren't many store around just really only houses. It didn't matter the food was well worth it. I ordered Dumplings & Won Ton Soup it came out extremely hot (warning) so, wait a few minutes. There was enough of everything in the soup to fill you up. There are many dishes to choose from, and are not expensive at all. The waitress are extremely nice, and if you look at them they will race to your table to see if you would anything else. If you are in the Sunset you should really stop by, and get something! It has odd hours so, check Yelp or the Yelp app. for hours. Yummy wontons and noodle soup!  Simply the best!  Especially with their special hot sauce mixed with preserved veg!  The other dish I would crave for sometimes is the spicy chicken rice plate!  Their price is reasonable not as cheap as Wonton House on Noriega but food is better, I think.  Didn't like their potstickers though, seemed too plain, didn't come with any dipping sauce.  If you are in the area, a bowl of good wonton soup on a cold night is best! Small mom & pops place. Really nice waitresses (i believe that they are the owners) & the price isn't too bad. The Spicy Chicken is  of my favorite dishes here while my bf always get the Mongolian Beef! ;P All you need to know is soft scrambled egg and shrimp over chow fun. And excellent gai lan with oyster sauce that is not on the menu. I love the way this place makes their Tomato Beef Chowmein.   It's really saucy yummy and I also enjoy their Pickled Vegetables w/ Black bean Spicy Sauce that they provide as a condiment. The spicy rib with wonton is so good! I am very lucky to have this place in my neighborhood! I came here after I read an article about it's wonton on the free examiner. Boy was I disappointed. The min I looked at the menu I became skeptical as it didn't specialize on anything. But I went ahead and ordered the wonton in soup, and made the mistake of adding more vegetable for paying a whopping $. . When I found that for $.  I got like  more pieces of tiny bokchoi I couldn't believe it. That's a huge rip off!!  Let's just say I won't be coming back ever. I've been coming here since the early s. I've turned several people onto it as well. I can't speak to how it stacks up against other noodle/won ton/dumpling places  all I have to say is that it tastes great, the service is friendly and it *truly* hits the spot on cold, foggy nights.  This is the type of place that has you for life once you find the magic item on the menu that you love. For me and my family, that's spicy chicken won ton with noodles.  The often overlooked beauty of San Francisco is that even though there are horrible problems with the cost of living, infrastructure and deficits, you can eat like a king for so little cash. There are far too many places where you can't eat as well at ANY price.  Comfort food indeed. It's called ""just won ton"". In fact, it has only one type of Won Ton: The shrimp won ton. And the menu is so odd: it's full of noodles, chow mein, and fried rice. There are over  total combinations. Yet, no dish. Well, some appetizers. I understand most people go there are for lunch but at least you can consolidate the by only listing the top sellers. We ordered the only Won Ton, number one item on the menu, the soft scrambled egg and beef over rice and a side dish of beef intestine. The Won ton could be great if they put less MSG. The soft scrambled egg is not soft because the did it wrong. They didn't use starch. The beef intestine is the most disgusting dish that both of us almost puked with first bite. Years ago I came here more often because I really enjoyed some of their rice plates and their wonton noodles.  That stopped for a while but recently I found myself going there again on occasions.  I guess the reason I stopped before in the first place was because the server (usually a past mid age lady, could be the ""owner's wife"") gives a greeting (or, as it may have been, a non greeting) that got on my nerves.  It was also like that when giviing my order.  The waittress that has been there the past year or so is much more pleasant, so I feel good about going again. It's been years since I been to this place but I remember it use to be very good & really cheap. I decided to stop in when I drove by. Food is not so good anymore, prices are more expensive, and the lady was a bit rude. I'm sorry for the  stars but this place isn't what it use to be. Yum yum yum! The food here are delicious. If you want legit Chinese food, you should definitely go over here! They do NOT jip you at all! They give you a legit portion of food. And for under $ bucks?! LOVE IT! Their won ton are soo good! I'll definitely come here again! This is the place to come if you're looking for comfort food.  My family and I have been coming here for + years. As the name suggests, the signature dish is the won ton soup.  Each dumpling contains the right proportion of meat with a whole shrimp. Other great dishes include the soft scrambled egg over ho fun or rice, the chicken vegetable chow mein, the tomato beef chow mein, and the diced chicken with salted fish fried rice. Holy mother of Christ! After reading Earl G's review of this restaurant, I decided to stray from my usual Chinese spaghetti and ordered the shrimp and scrambled egg over ho fun, a variation of Earl's ""Shrimps and scrambled egg over rice"", or as I like to call it, ""Scrambled Crack over Ho Fun"". I don't believe my taste buds have ever been so pleasantly assaulted with that much deliciousness. Bumped up one extra star. Tip o the hat to Earl G and Just Won Ton's chef. Just Won Ton? try Just DELICIOUSI always come here for the soft scrambled egg and beef over rice. It's like a party in my mouth with each bite! Costs about $ and well worth it. You always get a generous, hearty portion that will keep you satisfied. This is a small place, with good food, and a TON of flavor (pun intended). You MUST try it out. Been living on Vicente Street since I was  so that means I've been living on Vicente for almost  years now. My mom has told me that Just Won Ton opened up not too long after we moved here which you know is a good thing if a restaurant can survive for that long! Mommy and I have been loyal customers ever since we moved here. Their won tons are delish and is extremely satisfying on a cold, foggy day (which is pretty much almost every day out here! ;) ). Their beef brisket noodles are a must try as well and those too are orgasmic. I love, love, love their fried won tons as! Crispy and filling! What I love about them the most is that the owner knows my mom so well that everytime I get take out they know exactly what my wants and how she wants it. It's a small place out in quiet Vicente street but believe me it'll keep you coming back for more! I've heard many good things about this place and been wanting to try it for the longest time. Last night, my bf and i couldn't decide where to eat for dinner and it was getting pretty late. . . like pm. Most restaurants close around that time. We were cruising around sunset and he mentioned maybe we can go to Just Won Ton. I honestly was expecting it to be closed. . . (we tried going there one night. . . think a Sunday. . . . they were closed. . so i figured they might close early too)BUT! Luckily, when i called to check, the nice lady said they close at . YESS! i was super duper hungry and was on the verge of passing out. When we walked in, we were the only customers. We took a quick look at the menu and decided on the Spicy Chicken with won ton soup, Soft Egg and Shrimp ho fun, and Curry potstickers! (i heart curry and never seen this on any menu, so i had to have it). My spicy chicken thing came first. . . . tried the soup and it was decent. . . not spicy like i love all my food. . . . so i went straight to the hot sauce tray. . . . . now folks, this is prolly another reason why this spot is getting  stars from me. . . the hot sauce here is soo unique! i think they have the usual hot oil, pepper flakes, AND they have some sort of black bean and pickled veggie in it. . . . it was yumy tho. I wouldve ganked a jar if the place was packed haha jk. . . . . i wouldve asked for a to go thing. Alright, so the chicken was ehh. . . . mediocre. . . the wonton was pretty bomb. . . it tasted fresh and the meat was tender and it also had shrimp inside. Add some of that hot sauce and red vinegar, u got yourself one hella tasty wonton!!The shrimp and egg ho fun thing came. . . . the egg wasnt over cooked. . . still juicy and very soft. The shrimp was good. . . . one thing about it i didnt care for the the super oily ness. It would've tasted better if they hadn't added so much oil! At this time, the curry potstickers arrive to the table. . . . . i have been anticipating this moment since i saw it on the menu. . . . . they looked very much so like a regular potsticker anywhere. . . . but, when u take a bite of it. . . . u suddenly have a hint of curry in your mouth. Wow,. . . it wasnt over bearing and it wasnt like the curry was spilling out. I think they might have marinated the stuffing in curry powder or something. Anyways, i thought it was pretty delish! i would def recommend a potsticker or curry lover to give it a try. definitely not any ordinary potsticker out there. Overall, this place is just another hole in the wall spot to try out. . . prices are good and u can guarantee coming out of this restaurant happy and full!*it's not bad for take out too! Surprisingly enough, it's not JUST Won Ton. . . . and good thing too. They were good. . . but I've had better.  I ordered the Won Ton and Beef Brisket noodle soup. For a little over $, it came with about   little sized won tons and a couple pieces of beef brisket. The beef was not that tender. . . found it a little too hard and chewy. The won ton tasted okay, but the ones at Ming Tai on Noriega are much better in my opinion.  The service was not good nor bad. . . just there to do their job.  I thought that it was a little too pricey based on what you get. My brother had a plate of chow fun for $+. Not really worth it in my opinion. I really wanted to like Just Won Ton. The moment I stepped in, I already entertained the idea of coming back again and again. I like the idea of hole in the wall joints that are good and cheap. I found this place not THAT good and not very cheap. I might come back again at some point. . . but it won't be high on my list with places like Ming Tai just a few blocks away from home. OK so this place used to be  stars the extra star for the BEST hot sauce! Yes the free hot sauce on the table, I can eat that alone it has yummy crunchy turnips in it. But rumors are the husband and wife team broke up and the cook who is the wife is no longer there to make the food! That's why it doesn't taste as good anymore. I absolutely love the won ton soups here.  I used to go here and take out soup for lunch or dinner when I was taking education classes at the school across the street.  Those classes are now no more, but still sometimes, I go by and take out.  The restaurant is pretty easy to miss and probably one of the most low key hole in the walls I go to, but I can't deny how much I love their won ton soup.  The place itself is kind of depressing because of its awful decor, so only go there to eat there with people who are really good friends and, like you, can ignore the decor.  I have eaten there and I don't really recommend it but, if you want some yummy authentic won ton soup, I really recommend this place.  YUM!  As for the other dishes, I have tried and do like their beef chow fun.  The noodles in that were yummy too. This is some of my favorite chinese food.  Superb dumplings with shrimp & chicken.  We got a Shanghai Street Style noodle dish.  We got BBQ pork.  Soup.  And their brown tea is really good.  They are super friendly but make sure you got cash.  They don't take card! A hole in the wall place that is consistent in their food and service.  The scrambled eggs with shrimp over rice is great.  As is the fried wonton, chinese broccoli and the braised noodle dishes.  My go to place when I want a quick and satisfying meal. I read about their wontons and its authenticity, so I decided to check it out.  The place is small and it's a major hole in the wall.  It's definitely not the cleanest place.  It's dark and cavernous.  I think this place could take the crown for have the worst decor and atmosphere SF!  I ordered a shrimp wonton and was very disappointed with it. . . . this was  supposed the best wontons in SF?  It didn't taste at all fresh (most likley pre made and frozen for days), the filling was very basic, the skin was hard and chewy and the soup was not very good.  It was actually kind of bad.  If I were basing the review on these Wontons alone, this place would get   stars from me, but the Chow Fun (He Fen or Ho Fun) was quite good. The Ho Fun was cooked with meat, egg and g onions.  When it arrived, I was hesitant as it looked bad.  It didn't look like anything I've seen in Hong Kong or Taiwan.  I took a bite and was surprised by the texture, which was amazingly soft but not mushy.  It was so fresh.  The sauce was very flavorful. I'm not getting why people like their wontons, but  I would come back to get the Chow Fun to go as the environment is just too unpleasant. Wontons   starsChow Fun   starsDecor & service  non existent you can find your authentic won ton here.  it's a small hole in the wall, but the food is good and simple. i love to come here whenever i get that craving for won ton.  been coming here since i was a kid and still coming. took my mom there after a visit to the emergency room recently and it was the best medicine. this little ""hole in the wall"" is one of those best kept secret places that treated us like family and the food was good too. i had the namesake won ton as i tried to get mom fed. she couldn't stay conscious enough to really eat her fish ball/cake noodle soup so our server suggested jook/congee. we didn't even know they made jook. it hit the spot. just won ton's owner/cook seems to keep odd hours so you might want to scope out the joint for a while to see when they're open  at least until you become a regular. the yeung chow fried rice is unlike any other and something of a staple on my menu. when you go, try the pot stickers  a good way to gauge your like or dislike before you become more adventurous with other things on the menu (not just the won ton). I'm a sucker for little hole in the wall restaurants, especially if it brings back memories of family. I've been eating here since I was younger with my family. Whenever my family comes to visit me in the city now, we often eat here. It seems like everyone else here agrees with me about the chow fun. My mom and I are also big fans of the young chow fried rice. This restaurant isn't anything fancy and it's your treat to greasy but yummy Chinese food. Nevertheless, we never forget this spot and I always walk out looking pregnant =). Just Won Ton can easily be missed as it is a tiny restaurant on Vicente and th Avenue. Grabbing a late lunch/early dinner with the family, I ordered the Vegetarian Chow Fun, wet style.  (Of course, you think that with a place that has 'won ton' in the name, you'd order just that.  I just wasn't craving little dumplings at the time. )  Their version is pretty decent because there's actual veggies in there!  We're talking about mushrooms, bok choy, cabbage, and bean sprouts.  But what makes this place special is their pickled black bean dipping oil sauce sitting at each table. We were slathering this yummy goodness all over our food.  It's not something I recall seeing at other restaurants, and this tasty sauce just makes the dish. Other than that, Just Won Ton is pretty bare bones.  They serve up chow mein, chow ho fun, won ton noodle soup, porridge, fried rice, braised noodles, and rice dishes. Cheap good Chinese comfort food. What's there not to like? The wontons are not too shabbythe fried wontons are actually one of my favorites here, but then again I dont really order that when I go out. . . . just that when I do order them, most places dont put in much meat and all you end up eating is just wonton skin. Just wonton really packs the meat for these suckers. Their bbq pork wonton soup is good, but the bbq pork was a pink color. A bit different from the usual but it was still good. Overall this place is Ok, nothing too bad and nothing extremely good. I dont have high expectations for places like this. . . so i guess thats why i am not disappointed haha My bf & I were having trouble on deciding what to eat for dinner and didn't want to stick to our usual places.  We also wanted somewhere nearby so we could do take out.  I yelped & yelped some more & stumbled upon Just Won Ton & read some of the reviews of their shrimp & egg chow fun which I haven't had in awhile!  SOLD!  Upon our arrival we noticed that this place was really a hole in the wall.  We looked over the sticky menus for about five minutes trying to decide what two dishes to share to go back home with.  We went with the shrimp & egg chow fun ($. ) & the Lap Chong (Chinese sausage) with veggies, which really was just bok choy over rice (under $ I believe).  We waited about   minutes for our food and were off.  I opened the non traditional boxes up (they look like the ones you'd get at the deli section of a supermarket).  The portions were kinda stingy to what I'm used to seeing in the peninsula!  On to the taste. . . the shrimp & egg chow fun was not the best I've had but was still tasty. . they used some kind of sauce to make it taste different than what I'm used to.  The lap chong & bok choy were okay. . we probably should've went with another noodle dish or rice plate though.  No frills just steamed lap chong that's been stir fried with the bok choy (I had some scrambled egg on a piece of lap chong. . chinese secret same wok for everything!). This place is probably just best for wonton or braised noodle dishes, though I've noticed prices are cheaper at other wonton restaurants.  Service was minimal but fine.  I noticed food would only come out one at a time & there would be like a  minute wait or so between dishes. . I sense one cook and minimal burners?  Maybe a go to choice if you're around Vicente and don't want to really venture out to Irving or Noriega. Amazing food. Big portions. Reasonable prices. I really like the scrambled egg with shrimp over ho fun ($. ), or the chicken and bell peppers with black bean sauce over ho fun ($. ). It makes my taste buds sing. I order all my dishes wet instead of dry. It can taste a little oily but I wouldn't mind splurging on my diet at this place. I mean, which Chinese restaurant doesn't serve oily food anyway?Enough said. You must try this place! Came here with some friends for dinner.  High marks for the soft egg over chow fun, it was the best I have ever tasted.  However, we also ordered the won ton noodle since well, that's the name of the restaurant.  I was disappointed though because for $, I expected more than just  wontons.  The texture of the noodle wasn't too bad and the broth flavor was light, so I am assuming not too much MSG. The food turnaround was REALLY slow.  We waited for at least   min for our order.  I was thinking won ton and noodles should already be pre made and ready to go, all they needed to do was cook it in broth right?  If I make another trip out there, it will be for the chow fun. Just Won Ton is actually more than won tons.  in fact I almost always go for the ho fun with scramble eggs!  very yummy.  actually all their ""scramble eggs over _"" are good.  small little place, but good comfort food.  nothing like a nice hot plate of ho fun after a cold day in the Sunset. Uh. . . you just have to go here. I've been eating here since I was a little kid. First thing you must order: soft scrambled egg with shrimp over ho fun or rice. It doesn't matter which starch you choose. . . either way, you'll feel like you just died and went to foodie heaven. I also love their wor won ton, their won ton noodle, and their congee. Man. . . just yelping about the food makes my mouth water! Their spicy black bean pickle thing is also the BEST hot sauce I've ever had. EVER! Wow. . . I'm hungry now. Just Won Ton. The name says it all, mostly. They actually have  full menu w/ noodles, appitizers, rice dishes, etc. But their specialty & emphasis is on Won Tons, whether in a soup or dry. By specializing in just these delicious Asian dumplings, this tiny eatery has perfected the shrimp &  pork stuffed treat to a degree that would be hard to match elsewhere. You can have them in soup swimming in beef, chicken, or pork & served w/ or w/out noodles. I had mine w/ chicken & noodles. it was most yummy & filling. The service was friendly & the tableware & chopsticks were amusingly in random colours & shapes. If you want to feast on delicious, no frills won tons, I heartily recommend Just Won Ton!Santa's Yelper sez: Nothing. He's busy slurping away on his won tons! :Slurp, slurp, slurp!: Been here a number of times through the years but not until recently did I return so I'll base my review on just my last visit here.  We were in the mood for some Won Ton Soup so we decided to come here since it was on our route to whatever we were doing that day and we hadn't been here in a while. . .  So we ordered one of the Won Ton Noodles at $.  a pop and a Won Ton Noodle with Beef Stew for approximately $.  or so. . .  They were not bad for the price.  I do have to admit I don't like paying more than $ for a regular bowl of Won Ton Noodles like King of Won Ton on Irving so that's definitely a plus.  The Noodles were a little too soggy in my book.  The Won Tons were solid though and they had some pickled radishes with chili oil and black beans at the table which were on the house and we definitely ate alot of those.  The service was very average.  There were only  other tables and maybe  or  togo orders when we arrived but the waitress was so. . . . . . slow. . . . . .  We were ready to order for at least  mins but she disappeared for awhile. . .  I mean it wasn't really busy but she was going at a snail's pace. . . .    Ordering took awhile. . . .  Even the food took awhile and that was kinda unusual to me cause first off, this is Won Ton Noodles folks. . . .  and it wasn't busy at all. . . .  I have heard that their Scrambled Egg with Shrimp over Chow Fun is Kick Ass though but we just weren't in the mood for that on the night we visited but I will definitely return at some point to try that here. . . .  I'll still be back numerous times I'm sure cause:. It's in a convenient location for me. It's the right type of food I like to eat. The price is right. The food is pretty decentSo I know the vibe of this review is a little negative but don't let it fool you, I know for sure I will be visiting Just Won Ton once again. . . . .  We can put it this way, I still think this is one of the better Won Ton Houses in the Sunset for sure. . . I do not rate it anything special, but I would not give it something horrendous. I ordered the roast duck, wonton ho fun soup. It was actually pretty good, I would come back for it, but see I go to school near it. I've not much of a choice at PM. The duck did not have enough flavor, the noodles were a little bland because they were stuck together. It could be because I came during closing hour, but I have experienced better. The wontons were good. I liked them a good deal. However everything else was sorta meh. Passable. Mmph. I would come back here again and until then, this is my review for now. And yes, the owner is very sweet. She's wonderful. I usually order the shanghai noodles and potstickers to go.  Don't forget the house made hot sauce.  It's one of a kind. ive been a few times and ive only tried  dishes, so if you wanna try this place out you can't go wrong with beef/soft scrambled egg over chow fun noodles and the curry pot stickers One of my favorite Chinese rice plates is, ""Shrimps with scrambled egg over rice"" ($).  Over here they have a bunch of rice plates on their menu but they make their shrimp/egg rice plate really good. The eggs aren't fully scrambled breakfast style so they're still a little runny but that's how it's supposed to be. Plus they give you a good amount of shrimps. You must have it with their pickled vegetable black bean hot chili oil sauce which is on each table. It's definitely comforting in the Sunset fog. Came here and wasn't really impressed with . . . well. . . anything. The food was okay, but my dish didn't exactly leave me wanting more. And this is after my first bite. My girlfriend had something too, but it looked a little undercooked. She didn't finish her meal. What irritated me, was the fact that we got served dead last, after  other parties got seated, got their food, and pretty much finished their food before we had a chance to order any food. If you're going to serve me unsatisfying food, at least serve me in the order that we came in. I'm not going back, even if the gf insists that I should give it another try. We've been coming here for as long as I can remember, and my parents probably a lot longer than I've been alive. Simple, uncomplicated food with great flavor, served in a friendly, casual atmosphere. The owner and her family are wonderful people who recognize us and know our orders by heart  even if we only make it in once a year. And we're obviously not the only ones who come back again and again. I recommend the soups here and, somewhat obviously, the wontons. They serve some of the best Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce I've ever had. Don't forget to try the pickled something or other with black beans in hot chili oil that sits on every table. Crunchy, spicy, and delicious. I brought a soup tureen of it with me when I went to college, I love it that much. This is your quintessential neighborhood place, where families go for generations. Seriously outdated decor, but who cares? Just Won Ton. Just a cute place. You can chat with friends here for a long time or grab a quick lunch or dinner. Just great service  Yanna is the owner and she has a lot of loyal customers  she's very sweet. Just Delicious. Yesterday I came here and ordered roasted duck with noodles and wonton with soup & tomato and beef with rice. It hit the spot. [For my fellow Chinese Yelpers  look under their ""Miscellaneous food items""  you WILL not be dissapointed. ]Just Recession proof. No more than $ for a plate of good old Chinese comfort food  whether you're in the mood for soup, wonton, rice, noodles  anything. Just for lunch  they close at  p. m. Or just for dinner  they open again at . Just for take out.  This place never fails you. Just a great location  a lot of parking around in this hood. Just go here. Dirty lookin' Asian place must have KickAss food. ""Oh I wish I got a Preparation H. ""I know it's a ad for hemorrhoid. But the ad popped in my head when i got in the place. i've never got it. But my dad had p r e t t y bad hemorrhoid. So,. . . . . He did some strange funkky Asian herb testament for it. ""Garlic moxa cautery right on his butthole?""That's what I said to my mom when she told me that that was what's gonna happen to dod. I was small, about . . . . . I remember that there was a herb lady in my house making the girlic moxa with mom & I, .  inch diameter round thing mixed with minced girlic and some herbs. Sticky Shit. I thought .  inch is too big. By the way, hemorrhoid is sounds like ""G' in Japanese. But you gotto say it short. it's an ONE word for hemorrhoid in Japanese. when I start taking English class, I thought the English name hemorrhoid is too long for ""G"". I thought G string is named after Japanese hemorrhoid. Whatever. I had a Wonton noodle soup and Curry potstickers. So, why O why the hemorrhoid ad popped into my head?I think because i have a dirty mind. NO!I always wondering how to use the medicine. Don't you have to get cleaned the area before put the stuff on?So, How can you sure the area is % clean?So, my dirty mind has been questioned how clean you can get the area. Well,. . . This place is a butthole dirty place. the place was really strangely dark, all fluorescent lights are dying, sticky tables. The place isn't clean like butthole no matter how much you try to clean. So, I got really excited, Dirty Asian place got GREAT Food sometimes. I know it doesn't make any sense but what I trying say is that . . . . dirty restaurant gotto have KickAss Flavored Food. So, GIVE ME an KickAss WonTon, GODDAMN!Don't give me the YoYo wonton shit. That's why Panda X press is pretty clean because they make YoYo Fxed up Chinese food. Dirty Lookin' Asian place MUST have KickAss food, period!I don't know. I like to go to a dirty lookin' butthole like Asian restaurant because sometimes you'll get a great food cheap. But, No, not here. Please see Ken K. 's review for more detail. Btw,Akiko T. said, ""Nobu san, anone, don't you remember the Japanese hemmoroid medicine called, ""G ""?  Don't you think that's the best name?  My dad had them too!""G ? Japanese hemmoroid medicine?OMG!WhatTheFX?What'sWrongWith Japanese? Way back in  when I first got off the boat. . . er I meant PLANE from Hong Kong and stepped foot back in the USA (oxymoronic statement yes?), one of the things I missed the most (in addition to EVERYTHING) was the commoner's comfort food. You know, like won ton noodle soup,  the small dishes you get on the side at those typical noodle, rice, congee, rice noodle joints (jook fun meen fan). Cheap, Fast, God. I was too young to get behind the wheel, so tagged along with my folks to whereever they went at the time. For some reason we had an errand to run in the outer Sunset, and next thing you know, it was lunch time. And guess what was around back in that pre internet heyday? Yup, Just Won Ton, which literally in Cantonese is Wun Tun Nguk, or Won Ton House translated in English. However despite the similarities of the menu at the time, and the type of offerings, Just Won Ton has very little or practically nothing to do with Won Ton House on Noriega (Wun Tun Siu Goon is the Chinese name) that back + years, were thought to be twins separated from birth. But bottom line, whether it's Just Won Ton, or Won Ton House, both are typical late night haunts for back there and then, before there was ABC Bakery Cafe or other places open past midnight. In other words, perfect for late night snackers, munchie stoners or stoner munchies (especially if you're drunk out of your mind and need a Ho' Ko' snack fix before you head back to your parents to meet a : to  am curfew), and maybe those older high school or City College age kids who just got their Honda Civics or CRXs and think they're Sega Rally/Grand Turissimo experts by simply adhering a MUGEN sticker on their windshield, lowering the car's suspension as if to pick up cabbage, and having a non factory PHAT exhaust tailpipe that does no more than breaking loud wind. Either way you would find A$Ns from all walks of life here at one point, high from speed or alcohol, or just hankering for a piece of that lost Hong Kong. The food here   years ago was considered decent at best, for lack of variety and choices (unless you headed straight into Chinatown). It was far from hitting the spot, but well better than nothing. Fast forward so many years, nothing much has changed (or improved). Me thinks the food is still the same, if not worse,  while the culinary landscape in the 'Set has jumped by leaps and bounds. Perhaps this place just isn't competitive at all, or it just decided to stay in ""getting by"" mode. You can arguably find similar or better fare elsewhere. The potstickers and soupy pork dumplings are the best! The skin is thin and bouncy while the filling is juicy. I go here when I want the comfort and feeling of a home style cooking. Wonton soup.  Nothing is more comforting on cold, foggy San Francisco days.  I'll go back to this place when the urge for pure comfort food arises! The menu has a lot of choices for won tons, just has little to none sweet desserts.  Their rice soup as they call it could be better.  The pot stickers are kind of on the small side and drier that I would like but still pleasant.  The place is small, has  and very cold on cold days and hot on hot days.  Parking is the only problem one does not have to deal with here. False advertising!  They don't have just won tons!  In fact, they have an extensive list of chinese homestyle favorites. Now, I'm not the biggest fan of Chinese food in America because it is just not done right.  I'm biased b/c I have been to Hong Kong so many times over the years and have been spoiled by the Grandma's cooking.  My favorite things to get here are the soft scrambled egg and shrimp over rice noodles.  I love the light drizzle of oyster sauce on top.  This is a great appetizer; don't think you can eat the entire plate b/c it is so rich, it'll make you sick. The other thing I love here is the fermented tofu braised trotters.  I know two things that people avoid eating in one dish but, it is delicious I tell you. Lastly, I love the seasame dumplings in the ginger brown sugar broth.  Perfect on a freezing cold day, like yesterday! For a restaurant with a name like ""Just Wonton"", I'd expect to find a good version of the namesake dish. But the wonton soup we ordered was mediocre. It was certainly edible; it just lacked the extra something that makes it memorable. Fortunately, we had much better luck with our order of soft eggs and beef over rice. It was done perfectly  think of it as a Chinese version of oyako don except it's beef. It's a must try if you're looking for comfort food. I wish the same could be said for the wontons, but I guess for now, the hunt for the best wonton soup continues. This is my favorite won ton noodle place in the city.  The won tons are always fresh and have the special crisp taste often lacking.  The menu has lots of pick from but the won tons are what one goes here for.  Their congee is pretty good as well I must say.  The pot stickers are great here and the service is always pleasant.  The place is very small, has about  tables or so.  Parking is usually pretty easy here, which is a plus.  Most highly recommended! I've been eating here with my parents since I was a baby. It looks like just a hole in the wall, but insides lies delicious chinese food. Food: I love the scrambled egg with shrimp over ho fun. So good. The Shanghai chow mein, wonton mein, and flat oval noodles (not sure what they are called, but damn they are GOOD) are also my favorites. Service: In the past few years a new owner has taken over, which was sad because the old owner was a good family friend, but the waitress is always sweet, polite, and efficient. Parking: This is the downside. It's all street parking and since it's next to a school, a big asian restaurant, and an asian church, you can be circling the block for ages before getting a spot. As I walked in, a slight whiff of dust and old rags filled my olfactory sensory neurons. Not a good sign. The tea came from a  year old coffee pot it tasted like that too. I guess I shouldn't expect much from a hole in the wall. We ordered:Fried wontons  came with this orange sauce. Absolutely delicious to the core. Could eat about  of those. Made me feel very warm and homey  inside. Beef and egg chow fun (essentially ask for beef and egg with thick rice noodles)  I think I could have had the whole plate to myself. The veins of brown sauce strewn over the top complemented the beef very well. Service was excellent. Overall, this place is clean. The lady with thick glasses was attentive. I will definitely come again. After when I tried the Kingdom Of Dumpling last week. . . I went to try another new Dumpling place this time I went to try Just Won Ton for lunch on a cloudy wednesday it maybe a small place. . . But I have to say that they make one of the best Won Ton Noodle Soup that, I have ever tasted! The Won Ton Soup Noodle that, I have ordered from Just Won Ton was a Beef & Shrimp Won Ton and also had some extra beef w/ thin noodles & soup which really tasted really god when I was done eating the Beef & Shrimp Won Ton Noodle Soup! Before coming to this place, I remember reading alot great reviews from alot of yelpers andthats what made me wanna try Just Won Ton! As my boyfriend and I always say. . . the best Chinese places are always the hole in the wall places. See a fancy Chinese restaurant? Great decor? Probably sub par or inauthentic food. I have been going here for probably ten years  the waitress knows my entire family's order before we sit down (yes we are boring people). Pretty much everything on the menu is great, I personally go for the scrambled egg, shrimp over rice or noodles, lo mein, or even chow mein. Great prices, great food. . . parking is easy  what more can you ask for? I have been going here off and on for at least  years. In the early days, it was great. My favorite dish was their Singapore rice noodles. Whenever the owner knew that it was me who ordered it, he would make it ""extra hot"" because he knew that I liked it that way. So I have fond memories of coming here with my friends and family over the years, and I still come here based on those good memories. It disappoints me that I have to give this restaurant only  stars based o my recent experiences. For whatever reason, the food is no longer as good as before. The service is still very friendly and attentive, and this hole in the wall is still quaint, but yesterday I came here with my best friend for some wonton noodles. I had the beef brisket wonton noodle soup. Maybe it was a bad batch, but the beef brisket was quite possible the worst that I've ever had. It was extremely dry, tough, tasteless, and chewy. The wonton and noodles were adequate. Whatever else you order here, DO NOT ORDER anything with beef brisket!After a couple of recent tries at their Singapore rice noodles, I found that it was nowhere as good as how I remembered it from the early days. Maybe my tastes have changed, but I really don't think so. I think the dish is made differently nowadays. In general, their chow mein, chow fun, and other noodle dishes have a very homey, specific style that you either like or not because it's not the same as your typical Chinese restaurant. Having said all that, I know that I'll probably go again, well, just because I've been going there for ages. I'll just have to remember to order the things that they make adequately.  W yeah, try just ""won ton"". . . . . . nothing else I love this place! I've been coming here since I was a little girl. I love how I can substitute any meat I want with any dish. Good food at a good price.  All the classics: Wonton noodle soup, braised beef, lo mein.  All of it is pretty good. Relaxed atmosphere.  Service could have been a little better but I'm a sucker for places like this.  Family business.  Soup noodles.  Price efficient.  Never too busy.  Just walk in, order some soup noodles, pay the bill, done.   My kind of place. Yummy wontons! Talk about obscure location! The food was pretty tasty. I got the braised noodle with beef brisket and my friends got the scrambled egg over ho fun, which is the dish to get here. Their potstickers were good but wouldn't recommend the curry potstickers. It's just mild curry flavoring on the meat. I was expecting an explosion of curry sauce with my bite. I was sorely disappointed. No real complaints, other than the price could've been $ .  cheaper per dish to satisfy my chinaman ways. It's a little hard to give a place that's not exactly super clean and with questionable service  stars, but the prices and the food make up for it!  This place almost defines hole in the wall eating.  Make sure to bring cash as this place doesn't take credit cards. I was in the congee mood.  I didn't think the congee would be that good here, but I thought it would be decent.  I had my usual pork and preserved egg congee ($. ).  The congee looked brownish (when it should look white).  Not only was it bland, despite being topped with green onions and sesame oil, but they used the rotten meat.  The pork was fatty, too salty and it also tasted well past its prime.  They use lower quality preserved eggs and there was no hint of ginger to be found.  The congee was too thin as well.  Pretty bad congee (the second worst I've had in SF).  Won Ton House doesn't have great congee either but it's definitely better than Just Won Ton's.  I think I ordered the wrong thing at both places but my love for congee overwhelms my better judgment. The service was slow but very pleasant.  I like the space and the abundance of plants.  It feels homey inside and the tables are nice and sticky.  I dined here years ago and remember not being too impressed (I might have had the won ton soup.  I'm pretty sure I did not have congee.  I would remember really awful congee. ).  I gave them another chance and was disappointed again.  The prices seem a bit high for this type of food (Tak Kee Lee on Noreiga is much cheaper and better).  Rice plates average $. .  They have  kinds of congee for $.   . .  They also offer chow mein, chow fun, braised noodles and noodle soups. i have to say,  i simply love this place.   the wonton soup is deelicious. .  the curry potsticker is my dad's fav dish here.  i almost visit this place everytime im in the city. . . . now, im calling sf, the city.  just too funny.  i pretty much go here every time i visit sf.  its cheap, its good and its a block from my parents place.  i always order wonton soup, the egg beef chow fun, and the curry pot stickers for my dad.  another hole in the wall that is a neighborhood fav. Yes, it's a dive. No, it's not cheap. I agree with most of the reviews here, except for the exceptionally glowing ones. I was the only one there for an early Sunday evening dinner, around  pm, so the service was adequately friendly and attentive, no rudeness. But the place was f'g cold. I should have taken note, when upon entry, I was greeted by the waitress who said ""Sit anywhere. "" while rubbing her hands together and blowing into them. I think they were being pake and didn't turn the heat on. So, no, the place ain't cheap. I had the dishes Yelpers rave about: one order of Peking ravioli ( pieces), one order of the fried tofu ( pieces) and one order of the beef / fried egg ho fun (a large, generous plate). After taxes and % tip, it came to $. Not cheap in my mind, for essentially two appetizers and one noodle dish. Totally reasonable, but not a steal. OK, it is cheap in the ""this could be a cheap meal out with a date"" kinda way. But in terms of value, I think it's only average, certainly considering the only OK quality of the food. And yes, the hot sauce is super it's the jar with the red gunk and black beans in it, not to be confused with the jar of clear red vinegar. ok, now THIS is a whole in the wall. my boy Hen A, not to be confused with hen a, brought me here once for the soft scrambled eggs over ho fun. damn good cheap eats. dont expect much for decor, its a hole in the wall. I like their soft scrambled egg with beef over ho fun.  Its the only place i go to get this.  And if you do order this eat it with the chili sauce  that they make. Anytime I am passing through Sunset, I consider stopping by for some soft scrambled eggs w/ shrimp over rice.  This is one of those comfort foods that you'd think would be easy enough to make at home, yet never turns out quite the same.  Oh, and by the way, their wonton soup isn't bad either. . . I finally noticed this place after  years of driving by it. The won tons are okay. It's not bad. It's also inexpensive. Parking is easy. Fantastic pot stickers, everything else. . eck. We ordered the wonton soup and some pork fried rice, like someone said before it just had the funkiest smell that we could not eat it.  If you asked me to describe the smell,  would say like decaying meat  just a rotting smell.  But the wontons were delicious.  On my way to the bathroom, I saw  pigs heads disgusting out on the counter that the cooks were literally chopping into.  I noticed too, that they serve a lot of organ meet hereon the menu  such as heart, kidney, etc  no thanks, that is just nasty! ""I can't believe you spent $ for THIS food. "" So said Mom about our lunch today at Just Won Ton. I'm loath to listen to dining out critiques from anyone who would eat three meals a day at the Costco food court (it doesn't serve breakfast yet), so it pains me all the more to agree with her. Quite simply, the food here sucks. Our plate of oyster beef over braised noodles tasted bland and looked dull. The Shanghai noodles were straight up burned. A side order of crispy stuffed tofu wasn't bad, but we didn't get much of it for $. Perhaps we should have taken the restaurant's name to heart and ordered just won tons. The worst part at least the one my mom didn't stop bitching about is the prices. The noodle dishes are $ above most other Chinese quick serve restaurants in the Sunset. For a ""bargain bite"", that's a lot. What does the $ per dish premium give you? It certainly doesn't buy space; Just Won Ton can seat  people and the largest table holds six. I will concede that the interior surpasses many other Chinese restaurants because it is clean, calm and cutely decorated. Just come early if you want to eat in. Today the customers were mostly well to do Asians but all English speakers (except for a pair of contractors), if that tells you anything. As I was poking at a flabby braised noodle, I found myself thinking about Lime Tree Kitchen on Irving. LTK, like Just Won Ton, is small and simple, and it serves the same market. For my money I would take the noodles and roti at Lime Tree over Just Won Ton any day. This place gets the ""nod"" for me over Won Ton House. . . . Know what ""seasoned wok"" means?Their wok(s) taste(s) better. Really. Well, and their portions are larger. Fat guys like lots of food.  (i think)I like lots of food. I'm fat. Well, kind of. JWT is a favorite of my partner and a couple of his friends, so I go to make them happy. If left up to me, I always choose someplace else, but we all take a hit for the team now and then. After more than  years, I've finally begun to find ways to negotiate my way around the hit and miss menu. The ho fun with shrimp or beef is tasty, and probably the best dish. The slippery noodles slide right down, along with the giant mound of soft scrambled egg. Really the most flavorful item on the menu. The Singapore rice noodles have a nice texture and I love the BBQ pork in them (and the egg on top is fried crisp, just how I like it), but there's not enough curry, so soy sauce is needed to boost the flavor. The Hong Kong style crispy noodle chow mein is pretty yuck  not a fan of the brown sauce, though the noodles themselves weren't bad. I even remember disliking the fried rice. It's been awhile since I ordered it, but I remember it being pretty flavorless and laden with peas and carrots. Blech. The pot stickers are pretty great, so at least I can always make a meal out of those. But I just do not like their soups. I'm sad, because I love won ton soup and wish JWT's version excited me the way it does my friends, but I just don't like it. First of all, though the won ton wrappers are excellent, I'm just not a big fan of the filling, which is blasphemy to my friends. But, more than anything else, the broth tastes like dishwater to me. I think that's a big reason I don't like the filling. It's taken on the flavor of the dishwater in which the won tons soak. Today I tried the dumplings with the same conclusion  good wrappers, and the filling might have been good before they entered the broth, but that broth just ruins it all. Musty dishwater. I keep trying it, hoping it will grow on me, but so far it's just not won me over. Maybe I could douse it with soy sauce and see if it masks the yuckiness, but it just doesn't seem worth it. It really makes me wonder if the reason everyone else can stomach this soup is because they all add incredibly large doses of red chili pepper sauce, to which I'm allergic. Maybe they just can't taste it under all that spicy cover up. Overall, there are some good dishes, but none of them my favorites. And it just makes me too darn sad to go someplace named after a food I love, and then to hate the namesake dish. Some items deserve  stars, others , but I gotta say  star for the soup. I rated JWT  stars because with experimentation you can find something that works for you. I just wish it didn't take so much work to get there. Yes the won ton is really good. . . . . . but the service sucks here. Came here with my bf a little after they opened for lunch. There was already another table of two seated, but no waitress was in sight, so we just seated ourselves. I'm surprised they do not have chimes on the door so they know when they actually have customers when they come in, but since there are menus already at the table, I suppose they do not feel the need for that. The waitress didn't say one word to us the whole time we were in the restaurant. We sat and looked at the menu, she came up to us right away to take our order and serve us tea, I didn't know what I wanted and asked for a couple of minutes and she just walked away. So, I finally decided and she walked over and we told her what we wanted and she just walked away. Ok. . . . . not even a smile. I ordered the spicy chicken won ton fun and my bf ordered the beef stew won ton fun. This is the first time that I thought that I didn't have enough ho fun in my won ton soup. That's how much won ton was in my bowl. The won tons are also fairly larger than most of the won tons at any other restaurant. . . . . still doesn't beat my mom's won ton soup though. When we were done with our food, the check came and we paid the bill and like I said, not a word came out the waitresses mouth, not one. Of course an older elderly couple came in while we received our bill and the waitress was chopping it up with them, what's up with that? Whatever, I would still come here again. . . . possibly to try their rice dishes.  stars for the food and  star for the service. This place is pretty bomb.  I can really appreciated the ""home style"" cooking that you don't really find at a lot of restaurants.  All the dishes are very flavorful.  The Won ton soup is a must, the chow mein is real good, and the shrimp and egg over noodles is ridiculous.  Don't sleep on the picklely, peppery hot sauce they got on all the tables too. . . I can damn near eat a whole bottle of that stuff.  They didn't have a Coke for me last time I went, but JWTizzle is definitely in the hizzle. Went there yesterday for the first time and the won tons were really good.  The roasted duck won ton noodles were good along with their fried won tons.  They serve great food! Best Won ton Soup ever. Super hole in the wall place. When my friend and I got there, we got parking right in front and hardly anyone was in there. We sat ourselves since it looked like no one was even working. The waitress was this super cute Chinese woman. She was softspoken and so nice (maybe cuz it was slow). Their portions were just enough. We left there feeling good, not stuffed and not hungry. . . but content. Will come back often! Great Won Ton Soup. And they are close to Marco Polo Ice Cream!! I love this small restaurant. . food there are always good. . should try the beef and egg over ho fun. . or shanghi noodles and say spicy. . that gives it a kick of flavor. . waitress is always nice. . doesnt get that busy. . so no wait time. . I like this place though we have learned to just order to go and take it home (it is a really small space). The fried rice is my favorite but the chow mein is good too. Simple but well priced. Oh and of course the Won Ton soup. . . . anytime i feel a cold comin' on i stop by here and get my quick fix of Won Ton soup. . . cold be gone! .  Stars ( for service,  for the broth,  for the wontons)I've been going here for years since they used to be really cheap and decent. On my last visit I noticed the prices went up about % since everything used to be around $ , this isn't that much nominally. The broth is very bland, but the wontons and dumplings are pretty good. The noodles are like al dente ramen noodles. The place is usually full, so be prepared to wait for one of the  or so tables. The potstickers are good as are the fried wontons and fried stuffed tofu. Never tried anything else though. Nothing of a destination, but if you're in the area, it's worth the stop. Can I write more than one review on this place?  I want to write one after every time I go talking about how fabulous it is.  This restaurant is where I'd go with my friends and eat so much that I had to roll down the window in the back seat of their car and hang my head out to get some fresh air on the ride home. Hands down the best potstickers in the city.  The best hot chili sauce on the table.  And the best won ton noodle soup!  Many other excellent dishes, including the beef ho fun, chow mein, and fried rice, but the standard order for us is a double order of potstickers, spicy chicken won ton noodle, and perhaps a bonus dish of some sort.  They have an egg flower soup that is quite good as well. My brother went a month or so ago and ate something like  won tons and was a little over full, so it's been hard to get him to go back lately but that just means I want it even more. This is my first five star review, so that must mean something. Wonton soup is one of my favorite foods so I was excited to check out someplace that declared itself ""just won tons. "" I tried their basic wonton soup shrimp and pork and it was fine.  Nothing more, nothing less.  It only cost $. , which is incredible in and of itself.  It was clean, and received a  on the sanitation report.  I point this out because I used to love the Shanghai Dumpling shop until the smell of disinfectant became overwhelming and I found out they received a very poor score. I like won ton. No, i really like won ton. Just won ton?hmm. . . . if they have good won ton, then i'm sold. They do have good won ton!?i'm sold I came here yesterday and I don't intend to be their regular customer. Ordered the beef tripe and dumpling noodle soup (switched the won ton to dumpling) and beef hor fun. The noodle soup is bland but the dumplings are good. Not too much of a fan of their noodle soup. I think I prefer the Beef Hor Fun. At least the Beef Hor Fun is quite tasty. It could have been just a bad day. . . BUT I moved in to SF on a Saturday and decided to try the joint thats three doors away.  Yes. . . THAT CLOSE.  I mean seriously. . . it had a number of people for being pm in the afternoon on a Saturday in Parkside. . . So my Mom orders as usual and we get pretty standard dishes. The noodles were oily, the soup wasn't that great, and frankly. . . nothing stood out.  So I say. . . no to Just Won Ton.  I really wanted it to work out between us since you're so close.  But. . . no. just won ton isn't just won ton, i ordered a plate on shang high noodles and it overwhelm me with such wonderful flavors. The things that made me give them only  stars is the price for the food. I think its too over priced for a hole in the wall. I wouldn't really recomend coming down to this place unless your a local Sunset regular. I am definately not a regular and don't plan on being one. The restaurant was empty when my crew entered but afterawhile business picked up. I'm assuming they are die hard loyalists but I don't really think roast duck over rice is over  bucks. The duck itself was plain lacking the juicy fat that gives the animals it's deliciounes. The rice was bland and some pieces were actually hard as if it wasn't cooked long enough. Even I can cook rice properly and all I can cook is a grilled cheese sandwich. I didn't try their won tons which is their namesake but thats due to the fact that I am extremely allergic to shrimp and mediocrity. Best won ton noodle soup in town. Nice quite place to enjoy a lunch or dinner. Perfect for takeout in the sunset and easy parking. Service is wonderful with a smile and the menu is straight forward with reasonable prices. Just Won Ton is the quintessential hole in the wall. . . they are literally tucked between two cleaners and their decor consists of a faded Mickey and Friends jigsaw puzzle that someone completed and framed.  My boyfriend and I used to come here religiously every friday afternoon when we were students at SF State and the staff always treated us great, remembering our usual order and occasionally the cook would pop his head out to say hi. Now that we live in San Jose, we stop in whenever we get the chance, which ends up being once every few months, and they still treat us like we never left. . . they still remember our usual order AND the special way we like it.  Now I wouldn't typically do this. . . but I'm going to share our special secret order. . . get the soft scrambled egg with beef over ho fun, but have them burn the noodles just a little bit so that theyre a little crispy on the outside and they've got that yummy burnt taste from the pan. . . so good!I miss you JWT. JWT. I have been coming here with my family since they first opened their doors probably  years ago and I still have not tried everything on their menu. Now dont misunderstand this, this is not because they have a thousand different items. But, because every item I try is so good and I just get stuck on that item for a year or longer. Currently, I am stuck on their scrambled egg over fried rice and the fried wonton. I know not the healthiest thing in the world but who cares. Last time I checked Iam not the healthiest person in the world. One note that must be added. Currently the service sucks, their full time waitress is the rudest person I have ever met (she is lucky that they dont put peas in their fried rice or I would catapult them at her with my spoon everytime she turned around). But, the food more than compensates for the rude waitress. So give them a shot. On a blustery, foggy Sunday morning, when searching for a bowl of rice porridge, I called my friend J in the sunset for a recommendation. . .  He pointed me here. . For a place that is named ""Just Won Ton"". . . they sure do have a lot of stuff that isn't Won Tons.  And actually, the Non Won Ton is the most tasty stuff. .  Their rice porridge is delicious, warming, comforting and cheap.  All things that point to goodness.  I tried some Won Tons (since the name of the place suggested it), but honestly, I didn't like them very much. . . or maybe they were just cowering in the shadow of the awesome rice porridge.  Mm. Oh, and the table next to us had a really delicious looking plate of noodles with soft scrambled eggs and shrimp that I must try next time I go back.  (I've been there  Sunday mornings in a row now, so I think I'll be back soon, very soon. )Anyway. . yah, good stuff.  And I'm really happy that I didn't get flashbacks back to the time when I went into ""Just Tires"" looking for a car battery:(Scene: I enter the store, ""Just Tires"")Me: Hey. . do you guys have batteries?Store dude:  Uh.  We're ""Just Tires. ""Me: So. . . do you guys have batteries?Store dude:  You're kidding right?  No. Me: Really?  Why Not?Store dude:  Uh.  We're ""Just Tires. ""Me: Oh. So yah. . thanks ""Just Won Ton"" for not having just won tons, cuz I don't think people should be so literal.  I mean, ""House of Stools"" doesn't just have stools, do they?Oh yah. . . if this point was lost in this whole review. .  Go there, try the rice porridge.  It's tasty. * Updated // *Actually, it's not *just* won tons. In fact, Yelp seems to have algorithmically teased out the big secret about this tiny (though bright and charming) hole in the wall: namely, that the scrambled egg and shrimp ho fun is the true star dish.  It's amazing how the noodles seem to be worth their weight in both carbs and grease at the same time, and somehow (I don't really want to know, honestly) they managed to flavor the shrimp like breakfast sausage.  I could shovel that stuff up all night long.  Needless to say it earns JWT an easy  stars. Of course, I dutifully ordered a bowl of wonton & duck soup as well.  The won tons are fine, but the broth is a bit dull and the duck kinda drab.  You'd probably be better off getting Pho somewhere, dumping in some of Win's Peking Duck, and swinging by here to pick up, well, just the won tons. After unsuccessfully trying to eat at the Shanghai Dumpling King (didn't know they were closed on Tuesdays) and then trying to find that Islamic Mandarin place I've heard so much about (left the house without my Q) my friend Helmut and I had lunch here today. I've been eating here for years. Tasty broth, a heap of noodles and no shortage of delectable won tons make this the place for the best won ton soup in the city IMO. The rest of the menu is good standard authentic Cantonese/Hong Kong style food. All they need is warm Coke with lemon and ginger! (I thought it sounded gross too until I tried it. I've never seen it outside of HK) I really like the Shanghai New Years Cake, curry potstickers and soft scrambled egg with beef over rice. Decor and atmosphere is next to non existant but the service is friendly. Helmut gave it the thumbs up too, Hole in the wall homemade won ton joint. Ngow naam ho fun won ton with a side order of Chinese broccoli my favorite at this place. The only sucky thing is that they sometimes run out of ho fun =(Sure the tables are a bit sticky and sometimes there's a wait. . But the food is good and really cheap so I can't complain. Okay one thing I will complain about is the hot sauce. They don't have the chili garlic one that most Chinese restaurants carry. =( You know, this place used to be a bit odd to me. I would drive by randomly just to see if they're open, and most of the time they would be closed. This was a few years ago, but I believe they are open more now. Another good hole in the wall! The food is fresh and authentic. My dad is a native of Hong Kong and Macau, and tells me that these are some of the most authentic home style won tons ever. I mean, I trust his tongue, and I tried it myself. I would have to say, TWO THUMBS UP! Oh wait, I meant to say  stars!The fried rice is good too! Ah Just Won Ton. . . This restaurant holds a special place in my heart. I've eaten here since I was  and remember when the place opened up, circa . When I was a scappy young pup, I used to order Won Ton and Noodles with exta Won Ton. Whenever I'm back in the Sunset district, I stop by this little neighorhood Chinese restaurant.  The place is small, perhaps seven table or so. The decor hasn't changed since the day they opened. Last time I was there, the same faded tiger poster was still up on the wall.  Don't let the name fool you though. They serve many dishes besides Won Ton, though why anyone would go to a Just Won Ton and not order a Won Ton dish is beyond me.  Served in soup or out of soup; with vegetables, or with pork, this is Won Ton they are supposed to be made.   Definately the best Chinese food  in San Francisco south of Taravel. small mom and pop place that serves won ton noodles.  haven't been there in awhile though, but suspect it's still the same decor from  years ago. hehe. Very good restaurant. My favorite dish. Soft Scramble egg with beef and shrimp over ho fun. Please try this one, you will like it. Reasonable prices for the large proportions of food.  Its a small hole in the wall place but has really cute simple decor inside the restaurant.  I had the chicken satay with vegetables and my boyfriend had the beef with bell pepper and black bean sauce. The dishes were not oily, MSG, or filled with starch like some other Chinese restaurants I've been too in Sunnyvale.  At this place, its fresh, tasty, and really yummy! Lots of fat won tons in a big steaming bowl of noodle soup for  bucks.  Respectable potstickers, fried rice etc too.  We used to go here all the time, calling it our best kept secret in SF, until we realized three things: ) We'd get woozy after our meal, which made us suspect MSG to be a key ingredient. ) After being semi regulars for three years, we'd still get curt, borderline rude service.  I know nobody goes to JWT to feel like family, but c'mon.  ) You can get the same food elsewhere, made better, for about the same price. Just like their name says, they do Won Ton soup, and good Won Ton soup. The noodle dishes there are pretty good, especially their Chow Funs. The restaurant if deffinately small, there's only a few tables, and they lack decore; but that's okay. They more than make up for it with their cheap prices. Anyways, Just Won Ton's not about the flashy paintings on the wall, and high end lighting fixtures. It's more like going to someone's house for good, home cooked food. I'll take good food over good decore any day! . . . BTW, most of their businees is take out. try the spicy chicken wonton noodle. it's not spicy but it is good. they pan fry the chicken and then serve it on top of the standard wonton noodle. the Chinese tamale (joong) is also good here. A misnomer, considering the menu includes braised noodles, fried rice, chow mein, and chow fun, in addition to the meat and veggie dumplings served in a somewhat weak broth lacking flavor. The adventurous can indulge in pig's feet or broiled pork kidney with liver. If you live in the area, it's passable, but to come here from anywhere else in the city isn't worth the schlep. Just  Won Ton is just ok. I was expecting a lot more from JWT, a little hole in the wall that I hoped contained savory, perfect, porky shrimp dumplings in rich broth. Instead I found a hole in the wall with  star dumplings in mediocre broth. Tried some deep fried appetizer which was also ok. Much better wontons to be had in town. JWT and Golden Deer are bringing up the rear in the wonton/phofest . The name of the restaurant tells it all.  JUST WON TON.  Inexpensive but fresh.  Some of the best won ton you will find in the Sunset."|4|86|4|Routine| Moderate risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 8/30/2012 ] Improper storage use or identification of toxic substances  [ date violation corrected: 8/30/2012 ] Improper thawing methods   [ date violation corrected: 8/30/2012 ] Inadequate food safety knowledge or lack of certified food safety manager  [ date violation corrected: 8/30/2012 ]
Chico’s Pizza 0|3.5|Pizza in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|200|0|3.28125|" Delivery guys are THE nicest I've had in the entire city. Food is good, prices are cheap, delivery is fairly quick. the wings, is on point! addicting! Delicious, fast, and friendly. Pizza, salad, and garlic bread were all wonderful. The perfect alternative to room service! I thought Fat Slice in Berkeley or Nazarrios in the Castro was good, but OMG if you want a fresh pizza by the slice, without paying an arm and a leg for it (combo slice $. ), come here. The slices are thick and nicely topped. Yum This place is literally the worst. I ordered a sandwich and a side of cheesy bread and they gave me an estimate of  minute wait time. After an hour passed, I called to see if my order would be here soon and the guy on the phone said the driver was a couple of minutes away. After another  minutes passed I called again and he said the driver was down stairs.  minutes later, the doorbell rang and the driver was there with my food. I open it up, and SHOCK, my food is cold and stale. I take a bite of the sandwich to see if its any better than the bread which you can see right off the bat is disgusting and it was just as bad. I call the restaurant and ask them to refund the food, and he says he can only refund it if it is untouched. I was shocked! I had just waited TWICE as long as they had told me, and then they brought me ice cold and stale food and refused to refund it since I had tried it. DO NOT EAT HERE! Delivery was a little shady. . . Guy in unmarked SUV. But what else do you expect when you order a pizza at midnight? Pizza itself wasn't bad. . . But not something we would eat sober. . . . Nonetheless a medium veggie pizza was $.   that includes free delivery. Chico! Late night pizza up in the TL! It was pretty good taste wise but it's just a normal pizza. Quality is on the low end but decent food. Don't be out too late and just deliver man. We stayed at a Hotel and had delivery from this place. They delivered in  minutes as promised right to our hotel room. The pizza was average and crust had cardboard texture. I won't recommend based about the crust. $ for a slice of cheese and a can of coke. You really can't beat that when you're craving something greasy and quick. A drunk homeless guy came in and bothered me while I ate asking for money, so I probably won't come back to sit down, but I'll definitely order something for delivery. This used to be one of my favorite pizza spots. They knew my address and everything. Tonight I called for a pizza. One hour later I called again, but no one picked up. Then I called  more times to try to reach someone  minutes later. Finally, someone picked up and told me my order wasn't taken. Pretty terrible service if they can't take orders into account. Never depend on their service. That's all I say. This place is terrible. Food is not even ""just okay"" and the service is phenomenally dumpy. Add an hour to the estimated delivery time too. I heard they had a serious rat problem too, and the owner cant read well. Uhmm, nothing much. I only ordered from this place because first We were very hungry, pizza place near home and it was a deal of  pizzas plus coke for twenty something dollars. We ordered and the phone guy said that would take  minutes to one hour delivery. Okay, past : and I think they forgot to make the order, so I talked to the phone guy and he said pay only $, the pizza will be deliver in minutes. Okay, the pepperoni pizza is okay, very cheesy (good), little pepperoni and thick crust (don't like). I loved the great pizza and delicious buffalo wings ! I was at work and ordered for delivery. Delivery person very good service and over the phone they where very helpful thank you Chicos ! Next time I think of pizza at work will think of Chicos Pizza was really good every time I order from them i order a small veggie pizza and it be great an there open late! Pizza which was so awesome to have and very perfect to think that this is one of the busy pizza servicing place. It was friendly experience at this loction for some great and awesome setting as well. The charge is fair and very great here. Would you like to be the place but I will be here. They were on time, pizza was still warm and delicious. Hand tossed pizza that reminds me of my favorite pizza place from my hometown.  Have a few pizza places in my neighborhood, but found my new go to :) seriously?? an hour and a half for delivery?  min late? and rude on the phone!! never again. Had a late night craving and this place hit the spot. Cheap and tasty! Delivered at estimated time and delivery person was in and out. This is my go to pizza spot whenever I'm wanting some. They also have fast delivery, great service and very reasonable prices. When every other locally owned pizza place is over charging you because you're in San Francisco, make sure to get Chico's. You won't find better pizza at their great prices. Definitely recommend. Awesome pizza.  Awesome price.  Well rounded deal. Don't let the neighborhood scare you away. Rather than contribute, I normally only consume information on Yelp. But, I had to brush the dust off my keyboard for this place. I was in San Francisco for the MacIT conference, and ate Chico's  times. The service was wonderful, the delivery guys were quick and friendly, and the Pizza was Awesome. Thick crust, lots of cheese, and they don't hold back on toppings. I walked by the storefront one night on the way to a conference event, and it is in a very sketchy area of the city. Do yourself a favor and get it delivered. Found them on Eat, this is now my ""regular"" place for pizza. Good portions and fresh ingredients. . . no fake Italian sausage.  Their prices is the best part!  I'm a satisfied customer.  Thank you! I hate walking here but their pizza is so good and the walk from my bfs house isn't far. Anyway, their pizza. Love it. So good so cheesy! I love how the bread sauce cheese ratio is so balanced. My bf said they had a price increase but so we don't go as much but when we do, it's so worth it. ""Perfect drunk food"" is a phrase we often use for Chico's slices. Hot slices, large toppings, cheap prices  one of the best simple slice joints in my hometown. We ordered online and they have taken an hour and a half. We still havent received our food. I called in a half an hour ago and they said it would be  to  minutes. I would NOT recommend this restaurant. I really enjoyed this pizza. Good flavor. Good chew to the crust. Good smell. And the price was right. Great jorb. For what it is Chico's is great. They make a great simple pizza, if you want bone marrow I think you should look elsewhere but if you want a basic pizza with sausage and pepperoni this is the spot. The neighborhood isn't great, call in your order if you want a whole pizza this is not the place you want to stand around at for  minutes. And be ready for random people on the street to ask you for a slice on your walk home or car. The pizza is what I am used to from the midwest, not fancy but good. Lots of cheese and toppings and a low amount of sauce compared to most pizza places in SF. The crust/dough isn't to die for but it's decent. Overall this is a superb late night pizza to go place. Three stars because the pizza is good. But it takes forever! I live a littleOver  blocks away and it's been over  minutes. That is ridiculous. Crust is very good. Wings are pretty good but stick to the foil too much. Definite room to improve on delivery times. Edit.  star. I called to ask where the pizza was and they didn't seem to care. ZERO STARS! Terrible service! Over an HOUR late. Pizza was cold and I refused it. Driver was so angry. He called my cell and left a message filled with profanity. I will continue to tell me friends about the terrible ETA and customer service. Don't get me wrong, the little slice of crackdown that Chico's located in is and has been my home for sometime. Chico's though. . it tastes like the cheese is plastic based. Enough said. Go to tulan. Purchased a Pesto Salad form their location on Eddy St around :pm, right before my shift.  As i am eating the salad, I noticed a fly on top of my lettuce.  I quickly called them to explain my situation and the guy was adamant about me not telling the truth. ( really, would i go through the trouble to lie to u about having a fly on my $ salad) This place kinda grew on me. Had a friend back in ' who introduced me to Chico's. At first for some reason, wasn't very impressed. It was okay the first time I tried it but nothing special. Tonight I just ordered an extra large pepperoni for my roommate and I,and gotta say it's really hitting the spot. Got here very fast. . . The dough tastes kinda odd/interesting at first(kinda soggy yet crispy? lol) but it's not bad combining  it with the consistancy of the sauce they use which is actually pretty good. The quality tastes kinda like Cybelle's but maybe a little better. Not the best I've ever had but definitely good for those  late night munchies. Excellent fast delivery(although personally I wouldn't ever go there. . th street not my favorite part of town). . I would order from here again."|4|86|0|Routine Inspection|This inspection has no violations.
Chico’s Pizza 1|3.5|Pizza in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|200|1|4.0|" Do you remember the end of ""The Blair Witch Project"" when the pushy girl keeps screaming and follows Mike downstairs. Then we see Mike standing in the corner, and she drops her camera and it keeps rolling. Remember that classic freak out scene? I think that would be a typical evening at Chico's Pizza, only nobody would pay attention since you're more than likely to hear somebody screaming on that adventuresome block of th Street anyway. I guess I must be Mike in this allegory since I took my life into my own hands, walked briskly from Mission and decided to get a $ slice of anything. I pointed at the Pepperoni Pizza (photo: bit. ly/bdFOw) and smiled nervously, even though the staff here is amazingly cordial. What I thought was semi amusing is that I didn't ask for it to go, but they packaged it up in a box anyway figuring I wanted to get the hell out of Dodge. No, I like to live on the edge and decided to eat it at the empty counter toward the back wall. That was me standing in the corner. Did the Blair Witch possess me and make me wait to be murdered? Not really. The pizza was searingly hot and pretty good really. Thin crust, plenty of pepperoni and cheese. Four star good? Well, I wouldn't go that far, a tad greasy for my faux epicurean taste, but kudos to the server who gave me an extra half slice (photo: bit. ly/VeFAI). But of course, that meant I had to stand in the corner that much longer. Will this movie never end? (cue for a high pitched movie scream) Oh wait, was that me?FOOD   stars. . . generous slices, kinda greasy but you can't beat the priceAMBIANCE  .  stars. . . you're kidding, right?SERVICE   stars. . . courageously great attitudes from the staffTOTAL   stars. . . run, Ed, run! It's a small spot without much room, but it's worth a visit. They sell by the slice (which really appeals to me since that's the Jersey way) or by the pie, so you can get dinner to go or just have a snack while walking down the street. The fellow behind the counter was friendly and the service was quick.  I had the combination pizza and really enjoyed it.  Being from the Northeast, I tend to prefer thin crust so I can fold my slice in half, but this slightly thicker crust was tasty.  The fellow described it as Chicago Style, but I would put it closer to a Chicago / New York fusion. If you're walking down the street and need a bite to eat, I suggest stopping in for a slice. Facts are: I'm lazy. I work late at night. Same with the boyfriend. So we have often settled for mediocre late night delivery places because we get home after am, and if there's nothing in the fridge, what else can you do?But Chico's! I'm not sure when exactly they started appearing on my options for Eat, but it has changed our lives. We are happier, kinder to each other, better looking, and our libidos are out of control!. . . I mean  this place is magic. The pizza is excellent. Their sandwiches are delicious and piled HIGH with everything you want (particularly the Big Daddy sandwich  omnomnom). They have Snapple. They are incredibly obliging about special requests. Sometimes they run out of the Snapple you asked for, but what does Fernando (the most wonderful delivery guy EVER) do? He apologizes for the lack of, say, Peach Snapple, and presents you with a *BAG* of ice cold drinks to choose from. Actually, I assumed he was ""Chico"" himself until I asked his name last night, just because his customer service is outstanding and he truly seems to appreciate our patronage in a way that you generally only get from an owner or manager. Love this place. Fast delivery very good sandwiches (( pizza yummy )) I love this place (: Ordered the Calif Pizza, great but would have been  stars if they had remembered the mushrooms I ordered on the pizza. Salads were fresh and tasty. We got delivery and the order showed up on time which is great.   But everythinh was room temperature and they forgot all the extras. Major bummer. You only have one chance to make a first impression. I ate there the best cheeseburger in SF i'd love to go back there again. . very nice stuff and very clean kitchen which is not usual for Tenderloin area. . . These guys are awesomely fast for delivery.  Even their basic cheese pizza does it for me.  Very well priced, friendly and very accommodating. Definitely, suggest for a busy parents with  crazed children seeking pizza.  They are my kid's favs. I grew up in the neighborhood so this was the only pizza place around. For a $ slice of pizza it's really not that bad! Not too thin, not too much sauce, and just enough cheese. I love their sandwiches though! And they open until am on weekends for the drunkies. The only reason why I gave them  stars is because there's a lot of crack heads and bums in the area, but that's nothing new on sixth street! After I left Mezzanine around ish, everybody was kind of marching down the alley like Zombies. . . turn the corner and march down th the street past Monarch and people are going into Chico's, so I'm like, yeah, I'll go. It's /, which is great. . . because I. WAS. HUNGRY!  I was pissed off because  guys walking in before me and one of them was one of those indecisive mofos that sits there going ""uh. . . um. . . "" for like  minutes. So his friends ordered real quick. This gave me time to decide want I wanted: Pepperoni, and the Supreme one with bell peppers sausage, pepperoni, and all that. So Now I'm hungry and even this guy's friends are like ""Come one man just decide. . . . "" and the two guys behind the counter are like ""Just decide. . . . please we have other customers waiting. . . "" So finally it was my turn and I ordered and I got the pizza slices (which are huge by the way), and a Snapple. I like the fact all the drinks are in the fridge and they are ICE COLD.  It came out to a little under $, so the young man said, I' going to add the $ cents to make it an even $. At first I was ""Huh?"", but then I was like whatever. . . plus I understand and most places have limits anyways. . . and businesses get charged for every card transaction so. . . whatever.  If that bothers you, pay cash. :) But I brought $ with me on this whole trip, lol. The pizza was hot and I could've even stayed to eat and watch tv on a booth but I just decided to take my food and enjoy it in my room across the street. :)It came in a cute little pizza box and when I got back to my room and sat on the bed and ate that pizza, and drank that ice cold Snapple I was in heaven. The cheese was very gooey and good. It is not the healthiest. . . I mean it is pizza! But it really hit the spot, so thank you Chico's pizza. And. . . why are people complaining about the neighborhood. I'm getting tired of it on every page that belongs to a SOMA business. Ok. . . the Tenderloin is close by; there are homeless people in every state in every city. They never bother me or even beg. Get over yourselves please. . . They added extra mozzarella cheese on my slice of pepperoni :DThe only con is that the bathroom is yucky because Chico's seems to be an establishment oft visited by homeless folk. LOVE LOVE LOVE! I've been in SF for a year now, and have continuously been unimpressed with the pizza I've tried. That has just changed! Chico's Pizza has fantastic crust, they overload their pizza with tons of fresh cheese and delicious toppings (finally, a place that doesn't skimp) and the guys who work there are super friendly! I wish I had known about this place sooner. Don't judge this establishment on it's location. It's not that bad, and once you've tasted that slice of heaven, you'll know it was so worth it :) This is the best pizza place in the soma that i have ordered from. These guys are fast. I ordered online and they had my pizza here in less then  mins from  blocks away. They have much better pricing then most other places. All the different types of pizza cost the same no matter which one you order. Adding toppings cost extra like normal. The pizza is good and hot. I have ordered from other places that the pizza didn't taste good. I used to order from SF Pizza. SF Pizza was  block away and took almost an hour. Chicos is  blocks away and took under  mins.  Highly recommended. I haven't been inside but i do order take out. It's nice to see the history Chico's has with the community posted on their walls (yes, including the surveillance camera photo of Jay Leno! LOL) . Whether your eating it for lunch, dinner, or a highly focused sober session; This is the place to be! to all the people complaining about ambience: it's at th and mission. what did you expect? gary danko?the pizza here is AMAZING. they're open late, so i like to stop there on my way back from a night out. they have the best veggie slice in sf. veggie is my favorite, and they do it well. the crust is great, and they have all the stuff i like on it. they're one of the few places that has figured out how to put fresh tomatoes on a pizza without making it soggy. i've never had delivery, but i've heard that this is one of the few places that will deliver to treasure island, which is convenient if you live out there. the only thing is. . . yeah, it's at th and mission. there are some interesting characters there. i only go after dark if i'm with people, or able to park right out front. but there's nothing the restaurant can do about the people on the street. The absolute BEST BBQ Chicken Pizza ever!

Chico’s Pizza 2|3.5|Pizza in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|200|2|3.16666666667| With a living social deal,  slices are $. The crust was crisp and the service was fast. In a sketchy area though its worth a try. Stopped in on Saturday November th,  before the Red Bull event. Ordered the $ slice and drink combo. The pesto slice was a cheese slice that was already made  and then had the toppings added to it when you ordered and then recooked in the oven before being served. As I attempted to eat the slice  one of the most disgusting homeless people I have ever seen in my life with no shoes on entered the facility and stood next to me. I nearly threw up  and walked out unable to finish the / of slice that was left. Overall, this might have been one of the worse slices of pizza I have ever ate in my life and I doubt I will ever be back. The best pizza in SOMA  i just get cheese & pineapple, but the crust is phe nom nom nom enal. & a large single topping for just $ AND free delivery?! Chico has got my back  thanks Cheeks! Ordered an XL cheese from Eat at :PM on a Monday night.  Arrived at :AM.  Literally**the worst**pizza I have ever eaten.  the cheese inspired product masquerading as dairy is this dry, salty, unmelted (unmeltable?) substance, which retains the outlines of each and every shredded piece.  I seriously question whether there is any real food, anything that once came in a package with nutrition facts on it, anywhere in this absolute f*cking sacrilege of a pizza.  Half eaten Chuckie Cheese pizza left on a toddler spit covered table for four hours would be cuisine up against this nonsense.  The wet tasteless in flight circular sodium nugget, served  on an off season red eye TWA flight to Orlando just before the company went belly up, would be a marked improvement.  I would rather get hepatitis than eat this sh*t again.  Am I getting through to you?  Chico's, you should be so, so ashamed of yourself.  Whoever made this should be fired and dragged by an angry mob to Times Square for a public execution. /spitsoh, and it was cold. HANDS DOWN, BEST PIZZA BY THE SLICE IN SF!  I have been a fan of this place for over  years even back when they were located on Mission street.  I believe that they might have changed owners since then but the quality of the pizza remains the same.  I always order the Vegetarian with grilled chicken stripes.  They never skimp on the chicken and they slice is so massive that one slice is always enough.  A slice of pizza with a drink is less than $.  Yes, the location is in a very sketchy neighborhood,  so I never come alone.   However, every time I bring someone new to this place, they are always impress with the pizza. I don't know why I have waited do long to write a review for Chico's Pizza but here it is. The food itself is fantastic to say the least. The pizza is nicely priced and the size is very fair. The toppings are great. You get big chunks of veggies and sausage, and the cheese runneth over. . . it's perfect! They also have some side options like chicken, bread and salad with some desert options but I rarely get anything other than the pizza. As soon as you walk through the door the pies are on display for all to see and smell and I love it! The only reason this place gets such an okay score from me is because of the location. It is in the tenderloin district and in the middle of several back alleys and single occupancy rooms. You see all types there! Even though the service is great, the people are friendly I wouldn't linger at this establishment because I have been going here for about  years and it never fails, I can never get done with my slice before someone comes and asks me for change.

Chico’s Pizza 3|3.5|Pizza in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|200|3|3.59689922481|" This pizza was awesome ate there  times in three nights. Dudes were awesome good prices and slices were so big had to cut into half. Got pizza delivered to our hotel for a quick bite before we all headed out to the clubs. The pizza here is okay. Not the best, but not the worst. The thickness of the pizza was good and it was crispy. We got the cheese, supreme and pesto chicken. I liked the cheese the most, because it had a good consistency of cheese to sauce. Overall, the pizza was decent. I'd order from here again. The regular pizza was too doughey/sweet for my tastes. Sauce had potential, but needed more. Kind of like Papa Johns. Nice delivery guy  a real booster of the organization. Really want to try the thin crust next time. Have faith it will be improved. Good prices, decent pizza. Not a huge fan of the dough they use here. In my experience, the crust has always had a good crunch on the outside and was really soft and airy on the inside. However, i'm choosing to use 'airy' to also describe the fact that the crust actually tastes like air. Not much flavor at all. The stuff on the top was yummy, though. The th Street Crackheads™ don't really help raise the rating for this place, either. chico special and pesto special are both pretty good. the neighborhood definitely really sucks and takes it down a star. =/ I used to live in the scary residential motel right next door, and I ate here every day. I have since lived in Sacramento, Los Angeles, Humboldt, Shasta, and Ventura Counties, and I still crave Chico's! That makes Chico's the tastiest and best deal on pizza in the state! Chico's Special: a LARGE combination pizza style for just $.  Fresh, delicious, and cheap pizza  just the kind you search for in these hole in walls! Staff is very friendly as they are working late hours. Plus: free ranch, can't argue with that. Although the pizza was decent by the slice, I am not recommending you ever come here. This is th Street and this place was swarming with crackheads at : a. m. This place is so real, you should really stay away. After leaving a downtown club and parking on th Street, we headed back to the car when our french guests were hungry.  I really didn't want to go in, but we did. There was a line, but all you need to do to get service is act like a fool. They shuffled two customers through the line before us, so we let them go. This guy was short . , so we took care of that too. He walks outside and two seconds later is back in and done with his pizza. One of my friends made the remark that he must have been hungry. That's when he mentions that he had not eaten in days and shared the slice with two other guys. My friend felt bad for him and gave him $ for another slice and a drink. After we left, my friends were left with the feeling that we left ""New Jack City"".  I was pretty embarrassed to have brought them here, but they wanted to go. The pizza just aint worth the effort, unless you enjoy the entertainment. The pizza was tasty and had a perfect crispy crust.  Also, a large is HUGE and much cheaper than other pizza places. Perfect for late night delivery. . . although one star off for coming a whole hour later. . . I live like  blocks away! .  Stars  Tip  Leave your valuables at home and bring cash.  Chico's was a block from the hotel and my friend and I wanted to put some heavy food in the stomach before a concert at the Warfield and a night of excessive drinking.  $ pepperoni slice  Neither NY or Chicago style, more of a Costco esque crust with decent flavor and texture.  The pizza itself was okay, possibly warranting three stars.  However, I probably would not return, as much because of the shady ass people lurking around this establishment.  th and Mission is intense. This pizza is just so tasty and fresh off the grill. I ordered the veggie and it was amazing! Chico's is my favorite pizza in SF. If you are willing to brave 'th street and the clientele that it brings, you will not be sorry for trying Chico's. Staff is friendly and recognizes me every time. Slices come out fast and hot, with the crust just the slightest bit doughy. Great prices. I'm basing this review on a turkey sandwich, which all things in life should be measured by anyway. Turkey sandwich was really good. It's warm and toasted, had layers and layers of turkey, and doused in flavorful sauce. Plus, it was only $. Worth it. I've had pizza from here before, too, and was thoroughly satisfied from it. I'm not a pizza connoisseur, so I can't say it was the best or worst pizza out there, but it was definitely good and didn't dissuade me from returning to get more. I can't really describe how the pizza tasted (guess it wasn't memorable), so my / is pretty much about the turkey sandwich. I called up for delivery, and was impressed how quickly the pizza arrived. I was even more impressed with the pizza! My new favorite delivery place. Note to self: Next time, don't eat an entire med. pizza all by yourself! For me, the standard at which all other pizza is measured.  Keep it simple and go with their sausage pizza.  I still remember my first bite of their pizza + years ago and it still tastes just as good every time.  A San Francisco institution and I hope it never changes. Sixth and Mission is not really a place you should consider as a late night destination (unless your late night plans involve crack and street hookers). If you do end up in the area though (mistakes happen) and you want hot, cheap, greasy pizza, Chico's is there for you. The staff is nice, they stay open late, and the slices are big enough that I can get stuffed off just two of them. Is it stellar pizza? No. Will your arteries thank you? No. Is it still a great value at a low cost? Hell yes! Even though Chico's can still be enjoyed sober, all of the above make it quintessential drunk food. Let's face it, if you can stomach making the walk to Chico's, you'll probably enjoy stomaching some of their pizza. First time ordering today  did it online  pretty easy. But that's when the ease stopped. I ordered mild wings, a large pizza and a  liter of diet coke. Food came cold. Wings were very hot (spice)Pizza was OK  not great, but OK (after heating it up in the microwave) Wings were NOT GOOD. The diet coke was was actually a regular pepsi when it arrived. I told the delivery guy that and his response was SORRY. Called the store and let them know that they should fix the website to show pepsi instead of coke  person I spoke to clearly could care less. . . Won't be back. . . . Friend Janis took me here and I've been hook ever since. I make a point to come out here when Im in the city. The big plus is that I dont eat pork so the pepperoni is actually beef. . So that the kicker!. . We ordered a large simple pizza with mushrooms and olives and I believe it cost around $ even with delivery. So it was cheap and it was good for being cheap. The pizza was not too greasy and clean tasting. I liked the oregano and garlic flavors. It was also filling so it was a value for the money. Tried a slice of  their supreme pizza today. Yum. $.  for loads of toppings on a thick, huge slice. Definitely not New York Style but not Chicago either. Just thick, rib stickin' pizza. The pizzas were all under lamps and they toasted it up in the oven when I ordered. It still tasted fresh to me. It's in a crap area so I wouldn't recommend going there after dark but if you find yourself in the area under sunlight it's a great alternative to braving the neighboring shady convenience stores. I am not usually a very picky or overly critical person for pizza, but I have to draw the line with Chico's. I spent today probably  minutes going through Yelp trying to decide on a good tasty pizza joint around the soma/mission street area for super bowl sunday.  I concluded on Chico's as the reviews were decent and nothing popped out to say they were a low class pizza spot.  Boy was I ever wrong. The pizza dough was horribly dense and soggy, completely taking over the taste of the rest of the pizza.  And the cheese was absolutely disgusting, I'm pretty sure it was some sort of nasty processed cheese.  I mean when I took bites of a slice the cheese didn't even get stringy like normal pizza does it just broke off in clumps.  Sick. Never in my  years of eating pizza have I actually thrown a whole pizza away in the trash after one slice.  This was disgusting and I would of had a better experience at Domino's or Pizza Hut. Beware of Chico's Pizza! We had a get together at my friend's place down in SOMA and it was  in the morning. Lucky us we had Chico's to save us. We had a Extra Large Pizza and it fed  hungry drunk people. WIN! Chico's pizza is not terrible but the clientele is. (You may count me in that number if you desire) It's a decent, yeasty crust with very passable sauce and (to my knowledge) real Mozzarella. I stop by sometimes because of all the restaurants in the  area, save Tu Lan, Chico's is consistent, neighborly (and if they can be that they have my respect) and they serve it up fast and hot. If you can stomach sixth street, you can stomach Chico's. Great food, very bad at quoting a delivery time.  My  min quote was  / hrs.  I had to call several times to find out where my food was. Meat calzones are good. Was my favorite neighborhood pizza spot. Wow haha I ordered a calzone and a two liter coke easy order right what would you expect mins to an hour delivery? Wrong! How about two hours! Though the food was good the delivery was just unacceptable. Great pizza. As others have mentioned, this joint is in the middle of the ghetto and these guys deserve a medal of honor just for the trash and bull they put up with on a daily basis. But aside from that. the pizza is very good, good sauce n good taste. Yum. I used to be excited about this place, now. . . . . meh?The last three times I ordered for delivery here, there have been problems. ) I asked for a large combo with no onions and there were onions on it. ) See number one. ) Last night I ordered a large / cheese / pepperoni and mushroom, three pieces of cheesecake, a  liter root beer, and a caesar salad. They said it would be   min. an hour and twenty minutes later, I called. ""Be there in   min"" I get in reply. Another  minutes later, I am litterally picking up my phone to cancel the order and it starts to ring with the pizza. About an hour late and no courtesey call. I had to hunt them down to get information. No discount or ""sorry"" even. Screw this, I'm calling a different pizza place. Oh yeah, and if you walk in, watch out for the crack heads! YIPES! Pizza tasted good. Crust had a nice crispy bottom and a not too doughy top. I would've preferred more sauce. Garlic bread was surprisingly pretty good! Fluffy bread, crisp crust. More garlic flavor would've been preferred. The grease was overpowering though and hurt my stomach later. Hence,  stars. Saturday night is usually a busy night, this I understand, however my brief experience this weekend was far more frustrating than it could have been. I called Chico's from Yerba Buena island and asked for a delivery to which they replied, ""Please call back at pm. "". That was all they had to say.  So, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and called back at pm,  hours later. Thankfully the friends I was with had some snacks.  The same Chico's employee answered the phone, somehow immediately recognized my number and told me they were not delivering to the island any longer that night.  I guess that was all he had to tell me so he hung up. I've heard that their calzones are great, just not on Saturday nights when you're on the island.  They could have been pleasant about their busy night, but just didn't care. Is this the last place in SF with a $ cheese slice? Nothing fancy going on here, just some old Joe Montana posters and cheap pizza. Bonus points for having a customer bathroom so you don't have to witness the bum sex going on in the alleys. Can't beat it for pizza! I never cared for a classy pizza joint. . . pizza's the food of the proletariat! and what better place for it than in a shit ass crack ghetto surrounded by (street) hookers, addicts, dealers, and the mentally ill? Word. Best cheese ever. trans firendly yea? the employees were great!  the clientelle and neighborhood no, not at all. there are some ts street hookers around too. keep your fucking guard up mija. Wow. My choices for a quick, cheap lunch were: Chico's Pizza and some sandwich place that purportedly caused one of it's customers to have a mid meal seizure. I went with the veggie pizza because mystery veggies strike me as far less threatening than mystery meats. It was thick, bready, and had been sitting there for who knows how long.  The guy behind the counter was nice enough to heat it up before giving it to me, but it was still pretty awful. It pretty much lived up to my expectations. I KNEW KNEW KNEW that a greasy pizza (greazza) was likely not to be up to the standards of a serious pizza snob. But hey, I wanted to be one of the boys, it was my first lunch out on the job, and I was nervous.  Cut me some slack. Next time I'll sample the seizure sando. Great prices, huge slices, and the garlic bread is amazing. Best of all you get to experience the th street crazies while you wait. I have been coming to Chico's for the better part of  years and I am still in love with their pizza. The first time I had my Chico's cherry popped I ordered  slices of pizza thinking I could easily demolish them both. Boy was I mistaken. I always order their combo pizza. Thick, chewy crust that has the perfect crunch to it, packed with toppings perfectly made. The only other pizzeria that stands a chance is Amicis. . . but when you factor in price and service Chico's reigns supreme. Chico's Pizza resides in a somewhat sketch neighborhood on th street between Mission and Howard. Prepare to be asked for change and cigarettes constantly. Some people use this street as their personal toilet, beware. To me, dodging pee puddles and crack fiends only makes my pizza taste better.  stars! Alright, as a recent newcomer to Sixth Street, I'm ok with Chico's. It's nothing special mind you, pizza wise  it's pretty ok pizza, but nothing at all special.  It's middle of the road,  / star pizza.   It's quick, it's clean and it's cheap.  But the guys are really nice  the service is always pretty good and they do it with a smile and politeness.  Considering the crowd they deal with day to day, they probably deserve all three stars just for the service. Without a question, best pizza by the slice in San Francisco.  Pepperoni.  It tastes different when you get it delivered.  Not in a bad way.  Just different. Chicos has a thin slice, when bitten, crunches gently beneath a thick but delicate layer of cheese. The slices are huge but by far manageable. The flavor of their sauce, exceptional; zesty. Almost a  star pizza but nonetheless perfect. The place is in a rough area of soma, nom with caution and stuff. I didn't think it was possible for me to hate pizza until I ate here. Really, really gross. (Too bad Split Pea Seduction across the street was closed. That place is bomb!) Best inexpensive delivery Pizza in downtown SF Sketchy neighborhood aside, I had probably the worst slice of pizza ever in SF at Chico's! The crust was oily like it was fried and the dough on parts of the slice was not cooked all the way. Who wants to eat raw pizza dough? Gross. i dunno wtf other ppl are talkin about. acidic sauce, or too thick crust or some shit. CHICOS is LEGIT. Chico's is the Blondie's of the SOMA. This place is bomb and their calzones are to DIE FOR. ppl comin here at  am and complaining about RANDOM ASS SHIT dunno wtf they're talkin about. you don't fault this place for it's location, you're supposed to give it ALL THE MORE cred. at least they stay OPEN as late as they do round here, which says they put up with a lot of mad crazy bullshit just so you can have a late night slice. now THAT'S dedication and service. this place brings it hard AND the service is boss. i love cheeseboard in Berkeley (arizmendi if ur in SF or o town), blondie's, nizario's, and escape from new york. they heat up every slice when you order it so it's nice, hot, and crispy. they also cut every slice into two pieces so you don't have to maneuver a giant slice. come here if you want some REAL pizza. CAN'T BELIEVE they're at .  stars. THAT'S a fuckin travesty and proves that ppl are lame. If you want some legit slices or calzones, come here. otherwise, go to ur lame ass extreme pizza and get some shit that's lame as fuck. peace out. edit: i wrote this while mad shwasted. my bad. still. . .  stars!! Lively clientele provide inadvertent entertainment for those waiting for their cheese slices.  Cheese slices can be had in exchange for $. .  This is a thickish slice and par for the area.  See Alley C. 's review for an excellent description of the area. So Chico's gets one star just for being open late, in a city where there ain't sh** to eat after midnight. Another star for the buckets of character building opportunities you may encounter on your way there as you navigate the crack cocaine and piss riddled phenomenon that is th street. The third star is for the pesto laden slices of pizza that I always order from Chico's. The fourth star is for the simple friendliness of the staff. For all the freaks and motherf*s that they must surely deal with, those guys are pretty damn nice. Sure, it ain't fine dining, but it don't get much better at three in the morning after a night of swillin' beer. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but the pizza here is like the place looks: drab and unexceptional. It tastes like the pizza you get at a corner store or bowling alley that has been sitting under the heat lamp for a little too long. It's edible and cheap, but you get what you pay for. Chicos. Hit or Miss kinda of place. If you order pesto, make sure to mention that you want Just pesto sauce and cheese . Not over old cheese and red sauce. yuck. But if you order right and you get them on the right night, them they are really really good. Yeah the area sucks so unless you want to witness a crack deal, give some change or watch a drug bust just have them deliver. Decent Pizza.  At :pm the slices were generally fresh.  Service was quick and friendly.  Pizza crust & toppings decent.  Sauce & cheese could be better.  Not bad & fresh, I would return if I am in the area. I absolutely love their service and their pizza NEVER disappoints me, my favorite (I order this on a regular basis, they know me by this order) Medium Meat Lovers with Jalapenos & Pineapple and a side of ranch dressing. . Chico's pizza is like the closest pizza joint near my place, so i've been a couple of times.  I like their pizza. . . despite finding a hair in it one time. I also like how it's not thin crust (because i've never been a fan of thin crust), and when you order by the slice, your pizza is nice a crunchy instead of soft & soggy like a lot of places. Chico's is a great spot for a quick slice.  The employees are really cool and friendly.  The area is one of the worst parts of town, but they don't let that get to them.  They simply cater to your needs and give a great slice of pizza.  The Pepperoni and Vegetarian are great.  Even better is the crust, nice and toasty and thick.  The slices are of generous size and barely fit in the box.  The turkey sandwich is great as well.  If you're in the area for whatever reason (buying stolen goods, cracks, etc. ) stop at Chico's for a bite. ""I work for the FBI"" announced a well fed young lady wearing a not so well chosen outfit as she stumbled into this establishment after me, earlier this evening. As she searched for her badge to validate her claim, the gentleman behind the counter asked me what I'd have. A slice of pepperoni and sausage, please. And that's what I'd recommend to you, too, if (a) it looks as fresh out tha oven as this slice's pie did, and (b) if you are planning, as I was, to consume alcohol shortly thereafter, and (c) you haven't eaten anything since lunch. The other pies reminded me of those that we ate for free every other Thursday for lunch in middle school; fresh out tha microwave. The cheese was just showing that slight curdle that happens when demand drops off  after lunch and hasn't yet picked up again before dinner (and the pie has seen the hours that have passed, in between). ""I'm a Pimp"" said the former FBI agent, who, failing to produce her badge, earlier, had attempted a second take. . . and a second take of pie is only recommended if you are really tying one on. Otherwise, this is good for pre (or even post ) bar visit, and not a regular patronage. This place is great if you're drunk. . . not so great if you're sober.  I mean, it's okay, but not something I would go out of my way to order. The tomato sauce is particularly acidic and the miniscule amount of cheese they use means sausage pieces were flying all over the box on our delivery order.  Chico's uses a medium thickness crust.  It's definitely something you want to eat while it's hot, because it turns into rubber once it's cold. The buffalo wings are more like BBQ wings than anything else. . . not really sure how to make heads or tails of them.  Very meh, though. $ for a large  topping pizza and an order of buffalo wings ( wings).  Free delivery. * .  stars * Definitely good pizza by the slice here. Not remarkable, but good. I think of fat veggies practically falling off a juicy big slice. Fair prices, smaller inside but you can sit (at the window on a stool too). . . just don't loiter around outside for long [especially at night] because you're likely to get harassed by who knows who. Basically if I was hungry & in the area again I'd definitely swing by. Good stuff. Chico's is good quality, medium crust pizza, at a good value.  Our order was complicated but was fullfilled % accurately.  Delivery was quick  we're only a block away though  and our delivery guy was friendly. Definitely recommended for med crust, by the slice pizza. Why would you ever go to any food establishment off of th and mission?? Because the pizza is damn good, you know the kind that's great for hangovers? Also, it's cheap. But not a lot of seats. Chico's Pizza is a fine establishment in the South of Market district (SOMA) of San Francisco. I admit that I only order from them via delivery but I have entered the place at least once or twice. The first time was when they still had the arcades. I remember losing all of my quarters from Street Fighter. The employees are nice and they're really committed to giving their customers a quality pizza. One slice and I was hooked. A second time was when they moved to a much cleaner place, albeit, smaller than the last one. It was also not too far from where they originally where. I mean, literally, they were like a crosswalk away from each other. The pizza is still fresh and delicious. Now, ordering from them is simple. They have a website up and you can pretty much pick out what you like and make a list of what you want to order. Just give them a call and they'll prepare it for you just the way you like it. I've tried their pizzas and calzones and I never get tired of it. But you must try their wings! That's the kicker of this review. I enjoy their hot wings and they don't kid about that stuff. It's seriously THAT good. I must have ordered from them at least a dozen times within the past two years. I believe that they keep track of their phone orders so that it could be quicker to process. The employees are friendly and courteous. It also helps that their delivery time is right on the spot, sometimes maybe even earlier. Pros:* Variety of pizza selections and other menu items (calzones, salad, sandwiches)* HOT WINGS* Friendly employees* Convenient pricesCons:* Might be a difficulty for those not nearby Downtown* Small place to eat and chillSo if you're looking for a quick bite to eat, try this place out. You won't be disappointed. I've never actually eaten at Chico's, but the delivery has always been fast,  very friendly and accurate (it always seems like my orders are half of this, light on that etc. , but they always get it right). The pizza is great, especially for the price. I have never stepped foot inside this place.  I have only ever ordered from them on the phone, and then they deliever to me.  First time I ordered from them, I think i foudn them on google, or the yellow pages.  It was my intention to order pizza in my area until i found a good one.  I had ordered from some other places before and they weren't that good, but when i ordered from Chico's. . . THAT WAS IT!their pizza is AWESOME and so is their dough!  And its by FAR better than Blondies pizza, not to mention cheaper!  With free delivery, Awesome pizza, and cheap prices in downtown san francisco, what more do you want?  this is THE place!  get some! The location is pretty ghetto considering it is nearby a porn shop but at my own convenience, their pizza slices are filling, pretty good, and not too pricey at all! The staff is friendly, quick, and on top of everything! Great place to go for a quick and affordable eat while on your lunch! Chico's is a very generous establishment.  My mouth was watering as soon as I saw the thickness of the slices.  The taste was great.  Some of the best pizza in the area. Pretty great pizza.  The two times I've gone there, got my slices off of pizzas straight out of the oven  very fresh :)  I am a fan of the traditional and savory, so my fav as of right now the pepperoni~I have never had to wait in, and the pizza man is very nice,  always offers the fresh pizzas instead of trying to get rid of the ones that have been sitting out  big plus! At first, I thought the pizzas were cut a little funny just because there was always a large slice, and then a sliver of a slice~ but now that I think of it, I kinda like it because it's less of a maneuver to eat a huge slice of pizza! This place officially gets my  star rating because they deliver to Treasure Island at all times, any $ amount for the order. I love their thin crust, and one day, while feeling particularly hungry, I topped one with pepperoni, sausage, bell peppers and mushrooms.  DELICIOUS. Even though the poor delivery man got lost, my pizza was still hot when he finally made it out to Treasure Island.  They're extremely, extremely nice there, so of course I tipped them extra. Congratulations, Chico's  you officially are my new go to pizza delivery. Yep, that's right  stars.  Most people would deduct a star for location, but I'm adding a star since a place that handily beats Blondie's for taste & texture, prices & portions, crispiness & chewiness, all while managing to stay in business at th & Mission well, they deserve a little extra credit.  Besides, it's not like you're going to eat it here, are you?  Just stuff a couple (boxed) slices in your Chrome bag and pedal on up to Yerba Buena gardens.  Then you can bask in sweet smelling sunshine (and the satisfaction of having braved the darkest depths of SOMA in the name of almighty pizza). I live around the corner from Chico's, so it's a cool place to go if I'm craving fast pizza.  The slices are big and they warm it in the oven after you get there.  You can also order online, but i think it might be more expensive. Workers are friendly, they always spark up conversation while i wait for my pizza. The location sucks, but if you're in the neighborhood craving pretty good pizza, go for it. A little disappointed after last night. A Wednesday night! I order around ish for my late night grub with me and my boy. I've been painting and running all day and pizza sounded so good. I ordered my usual and was told   minutes. . . one hour goes by and I call asking where my pizza is. The guy was nice and said it'd be  mins and apologized. .  mins later my pizza came, but they gave me the wrong drinks. WTF. It was around : once we got our food and I had been fattying it out on a bag of potato chips while waiting. . an attractive scene I'm sure for the boy. Blergh. I'll give you one more chance. . . after that if not satisfied we are officially fighting. nothing better than being hassled by a crack addict and the owner coming around to forcefully remove them. . . If that's not great customer service, i don't know what is. The pizza and service is always great and the prices are cheap. . .  Sure, I've had better pizza, but if you're on Sixth and are starving, it gets no better.  Living only a block away doesn't hurt either. Nothing ends a night like ending a night eating Chicos. Served up so hot at whatever am in the morning, your drunk self will burn your mouth over a hot slice. But relish the fact that it was Chicos fault. I remember the first time I had Chicos, one of the bouncers at the bar next door asked if I wanted pizza. I was like *OK* thinking he was kidding.  mins later a small peperoni pizza popped up in front of me! THEY DELIVER TO A BAR!? (oh,lol, they are next door? HAHA)When I go out with my friend Danielle, its always ""Chicos, Chicos!"" at some point when someone asks ""where to now""This place doesn't have the same magic during the day, but its a whole lot of MAGIC at night As a true fan of Pizza, I would have to say you have gotta love Pizza to truely enjoy this place! I have wondered all over the city and tried endless corner pizza places, but Nothing and I mean NOTHING compares to the satisfaction you have from just eating one slice! There pizza has a thick crusted New York Style with lots of toppings. They might not be located in the best neighbor hood, but that should not stop you from enjoy this savoy Pizza Joint! I frequent the place at least twice a week and the owner and employees know me by name. As a compete side note, this pizza even reheats extremely well! So dont be shy and grab yourself a whole pie! I highly recommend grabbing the Chico's Special Slice if you like meat and green peppers! I live a block away and I've been here twice in the last week, oddly they nights seem to coincide with other activities the precede the pizza visit. I was expecting really bad pizza, but was pleasantly surprised, it was pretty darn good. It was $ a slice and that constituted a lot of pizza, not a bad deal. The pizza, both times, was definitely heavy on the dough (confirming the comments of ""more bread than pizza), but it wasn't that extreme, the toppings were good and plenty. In the end, I LOVE the crust and it worked out fine for me. Yes the place is in the heart of th street, but it should be  or  reasons you are there: () you live in the area, or () you're drunk. If the former, you should be used to th street, so get over it. If it's the latter, you're drunk, you shouldn't really care and you'll be fine, get over. If I'm gonna order in pizza, it'll be more designer ish pizza, and if I'm gonna travel for it, I'm going to Haight to feast on Fat Slice. All in all, can't complain with it being a block away. Slice of Pizza at : after a night of shots, laughs and a good time. . Good for pizza on the later night but I wouldn't opt for it during the day. Okay, so in my opinion my reviews are always spot on because they cater to the layman.  Yes, of 'layman's terms'.  I don't give a FUCK if the delivery takes over an hour, nope, don't give a shit if the service is bad.  Just give me my food  my kingdom for some good food!Chico's is . . . interesting.  I call and talk to the same dude with a crazysexycool accent, and he almost always tells me to ""okajy, hold on one sjecond. . . one sjecond. ""  Ah, I will always treasure these fleeting exchanges. My order arrives usually over an hour after the promised time, but I DO live on The Island (ScarJo, where are you?) so I don't complain.  The service is pretty friendly and last time they recognized my roommate (awkward). On to the food.  My faves are the salad which is pretty typical, but they have Ken's brand thousand island dressing.  The salami sandwich is awesome!  The meat is so that it curls up at the ends and is crispy, and the dressing on there is rad, and they pile it on. Embarrassing, yes, but I have no clue what the actual pizza tastes like, but according to roommates, it's not bad. Straight up set in the heart of th street. No parking, just wait in your car and hope no one tries to knock on your window and ask for some change while you hope the person who's picking up the pizza is hurrying up. Not that I feel in total danger, but when there's cops all around and all this traffic trying to get on Market St, it's hard to not panic for someone tells you to get out the red zone. Is it worth it? Not really. The pizza dough is too thick and the toppings with the cheese don't really measure up to how thick the dough is. More bread than pizza, if you ask me. It's open late, so that's good. The pizza changed, it used to be thinner and they used to give you huge ole slices. No more of that. So. . . first let me say that my preference would never be Chico's. I like NY style thin crust pizza, this is not that. So it starts off very low in my book. I actually live two blocks away and would rather go up the street to Mythic, sometimes. I hear you can order thin crust to be delivered but not in the shop to go. Sauce is cool, service is great, open late too (that's my only reason for having eaten there several times). If you like NY pizza no dice, go somewhere else. Tasty, big slices, in a sketchy part of town.  Nice staff.  I would definitely go back! This little hole in the wall pizza place is surprisingly good for a by the slice place. My pizza was loaded but I wasn't. . . I went there BEFORE going to clubsix so I was completely sober. Pizza was hot, filling, not too greasy, didn't cost too much dough and the service was friendly. There's not much room to dine in and the area is a bit sketchy as others have said, but I'm basing my review on the place itself and not the surrounding area. It wouldn't replace a sit down, dine in pizza place, but it's still pretty decent in my opinion. More like a three and a half star. Better than mythic down the street. Being one of the few people who have eaten this pizza sober I can say, with some objectivity, that it kinda sucks. I don't really understand all the good reviews its getting. Of course, its pizza, so its still kind of good, but compared to other pizzas, its not so good. If you are drunk, and its  am, of course its good. Its like Wolfgang fucking Puck jacked your face with a mouthgasm of salty cheese ecstasy. But try it sober. Or don't. . . thats the point of my review I guess. Its right by my house and every time I see it I get faked out. . . Like, ""oh sweet, a slice of pizza"" then I remember its Chico's, not Arinell's or Serrano's or even Mythic. Hell, even Cable car is better. The crust is way too thick. Why so thick? The pepperoni tastes like freeze dried rubber. Its full of skeezy scuzzy shady people and shit, lets face it, its on th st. (I live there, so talking shit on th is my right). I would sooner call Pronto's for delivery than eat Chico's again. Sorry Chico's, and sorry drinkers of the th street area, but no. I disagree. This was surprisingly good pizza; don't be fooled by their location.  For $. , you can get a big slice of pizza that's tasty, fast and filling.  I was going to a show at the Mezzanine and needed to grab a bite to eat before the show and this place hit the spot.  The owner was nice, the place was clean and I would definitely go back if I was in the area. Best pizza in the ghetto. But watch your back when you're leaving. Walking back to BART from watching a Presidential Debate in the area, I needed something to settle my queasy stomach and pizza sounded like just the thing. Given the neighborhood and the evening hour, I was skeptical about stopping anywhere, but Chico's was brightly lit, friendly looking, and had a couple awards posted in the window. Stepping inside, it was a different world. This place is a classic little pizza shop the kitchen takes up over half the space, leaving only a few counter seats. An overhead TV shows sports, while the pizza guys quickly and efficiently sling pies in and out of the industrial ovens. Several different pizzas by the slice are available, or you can order from the extensive and reasonably priced menu. The pizza itself was excellent and the garlic bread was fairly good. I'll have to swing back through for lunch sometime soon. I hope to see you there! i was surprised to see so many  and  start reviews, but was also happy to see them becasue i thought i was crazy. Even though Chico's is on the worst block in SF. . . they have some of the biggest, tastiest slices in SF. if you want a great slice. . . check it out. Really, really good med crust, cheesy, crispy, and yummy pizza. Especially when you're really tanked. $.  for a HUGE hot slice of pepperoni and meatball!!  PLUS they deliver!  What more can you ask for?!  They also have a few stools for you to people watch and a unisex bathroom.  The only complaint I have is that it's in the shady side of town with all types of interesting characters.  But you know what, I used to live in Seattle so I should just shut up right now. . . . chicos is pretty damn delicious and you get a good sized piece of pie for the price. the only seating room is a few stools in front of bars, but at least you can rest your legs while you munch. all the pizza condiments (pepper, parmesan, garlic. . . ) are chained to the wall. i suppose chicos got sick of crackheads bolting out the door with their container of cheese or something. oh, and theres a tv. if you like sports and good, cheap pizza go to chicos. Chico's makes good dependable pizza, the prices are decent, and they get your pie to you steamin' hot. However, were it for the pizza alone I might give them three stars. You see, the gem of the menu is the fantabulous Chico's Calzone. OMG good. Some pals and I had one delivered to a bar  a random guy sitting next to us watched us eat for a while, then gave me ten bucks for one little section. That's sayin' something. Pile on the provided chopped garlic and it's chow city. At a former startup we had lunches delivered on Wednesdays. The office manager would pick something, which would then meet with a broad range of acceptance from the mutinous employees. Then, she discovered Chico's and their wonderful calzones. After that, every Wednesday was Chico's day. It got a little old after a couple of months but anyway it's good pie. The best pizza in SOMA.  Always deliver crisp and hot pizza, with decent toppings, on time and the hotwings are pretty good too.  And we don't have to walk through crack alley with a steaming pizza box 'cause they deliver. Everyday, nearly, for lunch. It's so good, convenient, and cheap. I can't pass it up and it's worth being the butt of a few jokes at work. The staff is friendly and respectful. Lunch and entertainment, the window show is always worth a good thirty minutes. . . It is th St after all. San Francisco has got some great pizza joints. There's nothing better than pizza by the slice when you're in the middle of an all night binge. Chico's might just be the best pizza by the slice, in San Francisco. Unfortunately, no one knows this because it's on th street. On th, you just don't know what may happen to you. There are ""street vendors"" aplenty, so while on your way to and from Chico's, walk with authority, don't make eye contact, and be aware of your surroundings. Chico is a pretty cool family man type guy, so it's too bad he has to put up with the th street riff raff everday. I love Chico's! They've been in the 'hood since forever ever. Great family that runs the joint, they got generations running the place. Affordable, fast, and the best part. . . it's on th Street. For alot of you choads who come to the city and party hard but are always quick to badmouth th Street, EAT A FAT ONE! It's the 'hood man. People from all walks of life live & breathe this neighborhood. If you don't like it, don't come here!That's why WE love Chico's!P. S. Hani's the man! You'll see some pretty random people here. . . bums and what not hahah but that is what makes this place so great. . . and of course the pizza. It was so big! I couldn't even finish it! The people that come here are so friendly! Good place to go after the club. I have to give them some love because DAMG got a little drunk and A vomited all over the place. . . and the guys working here were so nice about it. The pizza was pretty good, too. I don't remember much from that night (like how we got from the club to this pizza place), but I remember the wonderful pizza. It really hit the spot after a night of drinking and dancing. I don't think A had such fond memories, though. She didn't get a chance to have any of the pizza. Batman and Robin (our bf's) came to our rescue, and that was the end of another fun filled DAMG night. If you find yourself on th at am, it's worth stopping by. They make a fat slice from what I remember  perfect for soaking up whatever you got drunk on. Consistently the best pizza that delivers to T. I. (Treasure Island). They have great sauce.  Order extra sauce, but their sausage has the consistency of rubber.  But they are also consistently late with their deliveries  sometimes by more than one hour after the stated delivery time when they're driving to T. I. (Also, don't bother trying to order right before they close, because they won't bother. ) Chico's is awesome  it's there for you  open relatively late, and has wonderful window watching if you eat inside. The cops seem to go there somewhat regularly too if you are sketched by Sixth Street, but then why would you even be there.  The perfect spot for a pre emptive salve against a hangover if you've been to Arrow (or Matador now I guess), Anu, Club Six or whatever Pow! is now called. . . not the fanciest place but good pizza and watching the bums kina give you something to do and the liquor store down the street has tall cans for $.  so you can wash your pizza down. big slices at a moderate price $.  and up Decent unmemorable pizza. . . not AMAZING (cause I've lived in NY and Chicago and I've tasted amazing pizza).  The slice is big tho and will fill you up, if that is all you require in life.  Area sucks as evidenced by a revolving door of drug addicts and bums. You all know that I love pizza. . . and that's odd because I'm not a huge fan of most cheeses. . . . but good pizza is still one of my favorite things to eat. . . ok. Chicos Pizza is a hidden jewel in a sea of pee pee, crap and dilapidation. I'm talking about the surrounding area (which is slowly changing. . . for the better. . . kind of) and the ""dining room"". I would suggest you order online and sample one of the pies. You will NOT be disappointed. I used to be a fan of goathill. . . they just got bumped down a notch. if you still have an appetite after making your way up (or down) th street, a hot slice of chico's pizza is delicious.  the service is pretty friendly, the crust is crunchy on the outside but thick and fluffy on the inside, the toppings are fresh, and the sauce is flavorful.  the slices are big (they usually cut them in half for you), and best of all they come in a little box so you can keep the cooties out as you make your way back up (or down) th.  chico's also makes giant, fresh calzones that look terrific.  please, patronize chico's  we need thriving, non liquor driven business on th street! For $.  exactly I got  huge slice of pizza that the guy cut in half for me (without asking. . . it was that big) and a Snapple. Could it get any better than this?Aside from the fact that I had to pass by piss stained sidewalks and bums whistling at me, I will totally come down here on my lunch break if I am having a hankerin' for some pizza. I'd give .  if I could. By now you know that I'm a pizza snob and I think the only decent pizza in the city is Arinell. With that caveat, I will say that our company switched its monthly lunch order to Chico's from Amici's, and the pizza is far, far better. The Chico's ""calezone"" is quite tasty, though it looks nothing like what anyone in NY would call a calezone.  It looks more like a stromboli to me. The area is sketchy, so unless you're drunk and lost (as noted in other reviews) stick to take out  they deliver! I am so lucky this marvelous place is near my house.  No matter what time of day or night I always find entertainment from the customers and street dwellers of the neighborhood.  People never fail to blow my mind with the shit they say.  This place is like a comedy club. P. S.  I have gone to this place sober and the pizza is still good. Better option than Taqueria Cancun when you're drunk looking for food on th Street. Great salads & pizza.  I'd give it a """" if it weren't for the location in the hood on th St.  The prices are some of the best in the City.  The staff is very, very cool also.  Feel free to pick up some liquor on the corner, and check out any of the SOMA dance places & bars that are nearby.  When some poor person (rich jerks don't come here) hits you up for cash just say ""I don't have any money on me, but if you want you can have a hit on my crack pipe. ""  Or say ""give me a million dollars"" or say ""grease my palm"" or just shake your head sideways or say ""look it's .  the cops are coming"" or say ""I only give $ to my friends"" or NEG them right back or best thing to say is prove your a human being by saying ""hi. ""th St. is like a Circus. Pizza thick and relatively cheap for SF. Get delivery only tho, the block (and surrounding blocks) that is on are about as unsavory as you can get (th st is SF's skid row). I mean, I am from NYC and I was looking over my shoulder. This is all unless you are some sort of hipster thinking it's cool to put urself in in an enviroment where ppl in arms length could easily reach out and give you some of the diseases that they are dying from. Props to the owner for having enuf balls to have a business it such a shitty area. Some ppl mentioned it is clean, as compared to what? Market St? decent pizza.  when you're jonsing for something to eat on the late night creep while partying on th street, chico's is your place. We got some delivery from this place. Not worth it. Even though I prefer thin crust pizza, and their crust is too thick and ""bready"" for me, I still like it.  The price is also very good.  We order from them once a week or so from work, and they are reliable and friendly.  They have coupons with special offers, and good specialty pizzas like Chico's Special (salami, pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, sausage, and onions) and Pesto Special (pesto sauce, olives, mushrooms, garlic, and mozzarella cheese). On a monthly basis and about three weeks into the new month, I face these horrific episodic vampiric like hunger for pizza.  And I am not speaking of the thin anorexic crusted scantily dairy clad versions of this Italian favorite.  I'm speaking fondly of the thick Chicago style, robust and Pavarotti powered with a crisp and crunchy crust, prim on the outside, but busty and loud on the inside with a slightly sweet and fluffy consistency in the bread.  The toppings here are large and not handed out with the Capitalist anal conservatism in mind.  Quite the opposite. I usually order the combination, which comes loaded with pepperoni, thick clusters of Italian sausage, mushrooms, red onions, green peppers, and black olives.  This large slice comes with the easily affordable price of $. .  I usually then sprinkle red chili pepper flakes and a lot of Parmesan cheese.  My boyfriend has tried their Hawaiian slice and it was a gooey but lovely mess of melting cheese, thick slices of Canadian bacon and the entire savory piece rounded by the sweet chunks of pineapple. The counter staff have been the same persons for the past several months and each time, service has been quick and friendly.  I always ask for a knife and fork since these pieces are too thick and bulky for the Victorian priss in me to not open my mouth like a basking shark walking down the street the Off Market theater, but then again, not much needs to be shaped by table side courtesies since I walk by an Adult video store on th and the Thai massage parlor on Mission. Questionable neighborhood once the light fades, so if you can make it there before :, grab your cheap but tasty slice by the crust.  I'm definitely making my runs there as my boyfriend does his recording session every Sunday. You must go here during the day to be safe,unless your a cop. On weekends its open til am. Awesome HUGE slices of pizza. If you like a thick doughy slice ,this is your joint. (No pun intended, considering the location) Nothing too fancy, good grubs. Just watch yourself when you leave. Get in, get out. Despite the lingering drug addicts and the occasional siren going by my meal here was quite plesant.  Rephrase  the pizza was fuckin delicious.  I'm still not sure if it's worth the trouble over parking, or sidestepping bums who are sleeping in their own filth in my Kenneth Cole's but, I'd take my chances again just to taste another slice of  that ""California"" specialty pizza. Just a block away from Club , this will quench your late night munchies. I went  here last night after a night of getting all Ultimate Warrior on the dance floor at Club .  We ordered a medium San Fransisco, which consists of Pepperoni, bacon, sausage, olives and feta cheese.  And if this pizza is any indication of how their pizza is, then I would highly recommend this place. The pizza crust  was very fluffy and not dry like I was eating French bread straight out of the oven.  Rather than disposing of it like I do with other pizza crusts from other pizza places (*cough* Little Caesar's *cough*), I had to eat the whole thing. The blend of the ingredients is a good look if you like those ingredients. The prices of a slices range from $.  for cheese and $.  for the other ones. The prices or a whole pizza seems the same as in any other pizza place. The owner of the place seems pretty amicable even if the place closes late night and the location is in a place rampant with crackheads. That would be my only complaint is that there are too many homeless crackheads on th street, which might make your dining experience a hesitant one. But that's SF's homeless problem for ya. . . In general, if you got the munchies and you just left the Mezzanine or Club , this late night eatery will definitely quench your appetite. Nothing beats Chico's!!. . . . . . at am when you are drunk off your ass. It's quite an adventure trekking two blocks up th to this place from a friend's apartment. On the way up, you see homeless people sleeping in every nook and cranny to stay warm and people doing lines off cocaine off garbage cans in the alleyway. You grab a couple huge slices that can be split into two for the ladies or you can even take one of the whole XL pies on display. The crust is is awesome, right balance of cruch and chewyness. The service is awesome and usually not too crowded, even though its the only place open nearby. Sal is the man, always risking his life by working this late, he'll hook you up. Last night, I walked right in and took one of the XL pepperoni's to go, turned out to be $, but it fed  people with  more slices left for breakfast the next day! As I carried it back, we ran into the same compendium (matty, i learned) of people, except add to that,  cars on the street honking at us yelling, ""Where's the pizza?!?"" Chico's should pay me a referral fee. As I turned into the alleyway, I see two guys hittin a bong and they offered me a hit, to which i politely declined. Before entering the apartment, I was startled by a raccoon rummaging around the litter on the street. Man, this was almost like a Harold and Kumar adventure. I should have taken a hit. . . . . For a pizza place, Chico's does it right. I live a half block away, but it's mere coincidence that it also happens to be my favorite pizza place. The slices are huge and very inexpensive. You can get a loaded veggie pizza with fresh made veggies if you ask, but I prefer the combo with pepperoni and sausage. It's probably got enough calories in it to feed a developing nation for a week, but we all get to have one or two guilt foods, right?Their wings are a little bleh, but I notice that all wings in SF are more or less marinated for too long which make them soggy and squishy. I guess if west coasters like their Buffalo wings soggy then that's just how its got to be. I still order these every now and then though :) Can't help it. If you find yourself on th street while clubbing at Anu or Six, and can deal with the neighborhood minglers , then def check this place out for a slice.  stars for being the OG pizza place on th street, brave enough to stay open until all hours of night and. . . . um. . . . carrying gatorade. . . Thats about it. No reason to go here now that Mythic opened up  unless you really want gatorade. . . I am not eating the pizza here just because if I am here on this block, I am clearly only buying drugs. Why anyone would ever eat anything that was made on this block is beyond me. You should go, and you should go right now. Head for The Sun. Keep it over your shoulder and begone with you. On your bike. Scoot!The pizza here reminds me of that movie Threesome, which is bad enough. In it Stephen Baldwin's character is mumbling like he has just been lobotomized about how ""sex is like pizza, even when it's bad it's still pretty good"". Then why is it Steve when I eat this pizza I'm like, ""Hey, this feels pretty good!"" and then afterwards I'm all, ""Now I'm just lonelier than before I ate the pizza. "". Which is a good thing after all because thinking about crazy ass Stephen Baldwin just put me off of my feed for reals. Oh sweet jesus what a find this was. At my former place of employment we were buried deep in the bowels of Hayes Valley.  Now don't get me wrong, I love this location, but the food selection is kinda of slim there. After suffering uncountable gastro intestinal tragedies from the $ hamburgers at Flippers or realizing that living for  years off of food bought from the corner store, one tends to turn to delivery for their at work dining options. So one day I wander in to work and find a Chico's menu sitting on the door. I ignore it. I don't know who Chico is, but I'm betting he can't make pizza for shit. Weeks later a co worker finds the same menu that someone had brought inside and orders up a pizza. Two hours later the pizza arrives. I'm starving by this time so when I taste the luke warm pizza it doesn't really surprise me that it's good. I had been eating paper  minutes earlier to try to leech some vitamins out of it and that tasted great too. We order again a few days later. Or maybe it was the next day. We like pizza a lot and we're don't care about our health. Anyways. This time it shows up in about an hour but it's still hot. This is when I realize that this pizza is just like I like my women  never showing up on time, comes for under $ and is covered in warm cheese. After ordering from this place tons of times I realized that I only ever see one guy delivering the food. So I ask him about it and it turns out that they only have one delivery person. Yes, one. So that explains the taking for fucking ever to get there thing. Good, cheap pizza delivery. Sometimes it takes a while to get there but I have yet to find better delivery in the area. They make some good grubbin' pizza here.  It's no place to fight over whether it's authentic *insert city/country* pizza.  You just get yourself some Chico's when you want a good pizza that doesn't need a home other than your belly.  I love their website too. Two hours after ordering, my pizza hasn't arrived. When I called  minutes ago, they assured me it was on its way. Now they're not answering their phone at all. Good luck. Drunkenness and Proximity make this a regular favorite. . . Damn, this seems to be a theme in my reviews  oh well. . . The true test of a good pizza joint is that you go back and order a pie when you're sober  I definitely recommend Chico's. . . Good pizza and fast delivery. Sober or drunk, this place hits the spot for under $. .  Their slices are so big that they cut them in half. . . kind of like a buy one get one free deal.  Nothing like a th street pizza joint that has to fasten their pepper shakers to the wall so that no one steals 'em. Chico and the Man? No Chico is the man! I live near th and Valencia and it's beyond me how this spot will deliver to my house (cross street ) on average  to  minutes faster than Deja vu (th) or Serrano's (nd). I am not from NYC so I have no ""questionable"" loyalties to some pizza ideal but I do know what I like and I like Chico's. They make a great pie. Before you dump oregano, parm, or red pepper flakes on that slice, taste it. You won't need them. The real draw is the calzone. It's huge (Medium size pizza box huge), served up with a heaping helping of chopped garlic! For pizza, this neighborhood is a crap shoot but if you like moderate thick crust, good amounts of sauce, cheese and toppings, this place is just about as good as it gets around here. It's also a good place to watch the crackheads march by, or stand in front of you, or come in and ask you for change. The deal though is something like a slice (which is huge) and a soda for $. . Best pizza delivered out to Treasure Island. It takes a while, but is usually worth the wait, and they deliver till almost  in the morning. Can't beat that!This pizza is genuinely tasty. Nice thick crusty pizza with good sauce. The staff is always friendly and seem to genuinely appreciate the business. We always come here prior to or after going to the Mezzanine or Arrow.  Last time after getting way too tanked at the Mezzanine we went here for a little sobering up food before the long trek home only to find that they were closed!  No other sobering salvation in sight.  We stand in front of the place looking dismayed, desparate & drunk.  The owner (Chico?) and workers inside saw us looking sad and pitiful & decided to re open just for us to get some slices!  THERE IS A GOD!The quickly prepare us  sliced of pepperoni & we tip them genoursly for their troubles.  They hand over the little white boxes of doughy goodness & our eyes light up like  year olds on christmas day.  I quickly begin to doctor up my slice with all the fixins.  Paremesean, red chilli, salt, pepper.  I see the jar of oregano & think, what the heck, just a dash!  And when I tip the jar, the cap fell off & my pizza was quickly buried under a mountain of oregano!  My friends & the guys that worked there saw it & everyone began to laugh hysterically.  It was pretty funny, I guess, If you werent me.  But the guys were nice enough to give me anotehr one.  & I still ate the oregano slice too.  it's was like a weed covered pizza, but good nontheless. This place is great. Not my style of pizza  crust is too thick.  th Street isn't THAT bad.  Adds to the excitement. This place has THE best pizza for delivery (and I am guessing by the slice as well).  We order in at my work at least once a week,  and it never fails to be piping hot and delicious.  Try the pesto  it is AMAZING.  They lose one star for the occasionally long delivery time.  BUT the delivery guy pretty much makes up for it:  he is always super sweet and chatty. So I know th street can be scary to some, but since those crackheads don't bite, you might want to troop through the beauty that is th and Mission for Chico's. If you know you're going, call ahead and your slice will be waiting. The calzone's are to die for, and all the guys that work there are great. Any slice is good, but you can;t beat a good slice of plain cheese. Pimps? yes. Police? yes. Pizza? Eventually.  Once you wade through the sketchiness of the th and Mission hood, you will come across a tiny little pizza shop.  Chico's pizza, one of the only honest businesses in the area, serves it up right, and Chico, the owner is pretty cool.  My only area of dissatisfaction is not knowing how long those pies have been sitting under the heat lamp.  Whatever the case, my slice of combo was still pretty good. It's a bit of a hike from the office, and you could get shot, but that's the chance you have to take to get some good pizza in this city. I'd like to thank Chico for making my day infinitely better with his wheels of deliciousness. The restaurant is kind of in shambles with dust covered shirts, unfinished walls where you can see the duct work and a crappy old pizza box tacked to the wall autographed by Jay Leno. The hawaiin slice was delicious with thick crust and good sauce. Want some good 'za? Bring yo' gat. No reviews? Chico is the MAN. . . Excellent pizza here, and don't let the ambience of the block scare you away excellent the way he makes a pizza crust something of real substance, not like those flat pancakes at Dominos & Round Table, and it's not the most expensive place either. I'll take a slice of cheese with mushroom &  bell peppers any day. . .

El Sol Taqueria 0|3.5|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|128|0|3.53846153846|" Tried a burrito and a quesadilla on separate occasions, and walked away happy. My favorite in my proxy! Never too greasy and the salsas are fresh! Love the service fast and friendly. . . . Chile verde chicken burrito and the flautas are my go to indulgences. Breakfast burritos are tasty and filling:) Nice tacos, burritos in tenderloin/union square. Good taste, there is better places like pancho villa but was happy after my visit. The burritos and tacos are decent. Avoid the nachos as they always come out soggy after they microwave it. Coming down from the Seattle area, this place was calling to me from the moment I noticed it,  across from our hotel!  For $.  I got ALL of the food in the picture!   It's excellent value for all this deliciousness! This is a small taqueria downtown. It does what I need it to do  it gives me fast, quick, pretty hot burritos for relatively (SF prices) cheap. Obviously it would be better if the ingredients were made to order rather than buffet style, but then again that would take away from the ""fast"" aspect that I so desire. So overall, this place is legit. If they eliminated their minimum for credit card processing so I could get points on my dining rewards I would go there even more often. Great place, authentic food. Fastly made, lost of choises to make. Whether you want chicken or beef and so on. . . The tables were clean and the floor was suprisingly clean. The only thing is that they don t have a lot of tables for . Was around the area looking for something to eat and we came across this place. Small location , few tables. The variety of burrito sizes varies from regular to super to baby burrito. Wasn't sure exactly what the size difference was from super to baby because they both had the same contents. The burrito was good, they had a variety of meats like al pastor, asada, chicken. Very good burrito. Their horchata drink was bomb! Visit Date //Great place with great food. Authentic Mexican food. Not a bad place, though not exactly the best burrito I've ever had either. It was flavorful and filling though, so that's above average food in my book. Considering the place looks like a hole in the wall and is located in a notoriously seedy section of San Francisco, I went in with tempered expectations, but went away without any complaints. I particularly appreciated the sizable amount of chicken they added to my ""Regular"" burrito. I often find that a lot of other burrito joints will skimp on the meat and are a bit too heavy handed with the cheaper fillings (rice, lettuce, beans), but El Sol did it right. I also appreciated that I was able to save a bit of dough by opting to hold the sour cream and guacamole (neither of which I care for and never eat, but which are normally included in the price a burrito). And the fact that they provide you with complementary chips and salsa is a real nice touch. The main negative is the $.  credit card minimum, which is just barely higher than the price of most of their dishes (I literally think my burrito was $. ) that you end up having to buy a drink or a side dish if you aren't carrying cash. I'm sorry, but that's pretty shameless extortion, so I had to dock some points. Good overall, though. I would return if I ever found myself back in the Tenderloin district looking for a quick meal (though not sure if / when that will happen again. . ) I read lotsa reviews before trying it, and yelpers seemed to like it! I got the vegetarian nachos and here was process: Chips on plate. Shredded cheese on chips. Microwave. I paid  bucks for microwaved nachos. Nuh uh. Nuh uh. Maybe their other stuff is good, but I can eat rubbery chips for free at home. Overall the food was good; nothing to write home about, but good. I had a Flautas dinner. I was a bit taken back when the plate came with black beans, but was a cool mix up. My only negative comment was in watching them prepare my plate, they had to throw the rice and beans into the microwave; I'm sure plenty of places do this but I can see them doing it. Would be nice if they had the rice and beans on the stove slow cooking and soaking up more flavor. I wouldn't plan to come back as there are just too many great Mexican places around. First I am a little biased. Raised in San Diego and spent a lot of time in Mexico. SD/ LA I have a spoiled pallet. My bar in SF is Pancho Villas so this place had a lot to compete with. _I live above this spot so I thought I would try it out one night. Affordable but still not worth the price. The tortilla on my burrito was cold, which to me is a no no. Chips are not made fresh, and the meat was dry. Spicy salsa was mildy spicy. This is a spot you go to LATE and night if you are starving or drunk. Not disgusting, but there are better spots around the corner."|5|83|5|Routine Inspection| Wiping cloths not clean or properly stored or inadequate sanitizer Improper cooling methods Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities Low risk vermin infestation Unclean nonfood contact surfaces
El Sol Taqueria 1|3.5|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|128|1|3.875|" I read dozens of reviews before getting a vegetarian burrito tonight. Let's keep this in perspective  this is generic Mexican food. You can only do so many things with rice, beans, tortillas, etc. It can't be less than  stars if you like Mexican food, nor more than  stars unless you haven't eaten for a month. My burrito was $. , rather a lot for a RBC burrito, but it was freshly prepared in front of me, large, and as tasty as RBC can be.  I may eat here again, but not worthy of a special trip.  A solid . I have been a big fan of Iguanas in San Jose. Beside the mediocre Chipotle, I hadn't been able to find another good place to get burritos until I found El Sol! Their pollo asado is lean and not cooked greasy. Their regular burrito can fill me up all day. It's $. . My favorite burrito is rice, black beans, pollo asado, lettuce, and salsa. Simple and yummy! The staff is nice :)Small place. They also asked if I wanted chips and salsa. I said no. I didn't know if they were free. If they are, too bad I didn't get them. But, I will cause I am going to go back for sure! I really enjoyed my food but my boyfriend didn't care too much for his. I got a vegetarian burrito with pinto beans and green salsa and without sour cream or cheese. The salsa was really tangy and the burrito was warm and delicious and super filling. He got a beef burrito and said that it wasn't bad but he wasn't impressed. The chips were not good though, stale and bland and kinda squished in a weird little plastic bag. We were really tired and hungry and were ready to eat pretty much whatever, but I actually liked my food and I wouldn't mind going back and eating there again. I have to say I'm extremely disappointed! This place held me down my first yr of law school living in the TL. The prawns burrito was EVERYTHING  I went last week for Fat Tuesday and it was such a waste of calories, it didn't have its usual freshness to it. It also lacked the unique flavors it once had. Also, they raised the price by ALOT. AND the store was pretty dirty from past patrons. El Sol is my favorite taqueria in this part of the Tenderloin. I prefer it over El Tesoro and La Rosa, which are both nearby. El Tesoro is decent and I know some folks who go there plenty. As for La Rosa, I'd rather eat whatever I can find strewn about on the streets. So naturally, you'll find me ordering a chicken burrito or some nachos at El Sol Taqueria. I usually order to go since the taqueria doesn't have much seating. Sometimes when it's not busy, I'll dine in and watch the show outside that is our beloved Tenderloin. This is your standard taqueria. I give them  stars because I come in here a lot and their service is always awesome. ¡Me encanta! Really great regular burrito! It's huge and the meat/rice is seasoned perfectly. Good price too considering the size. Would be giving five stars but for the disappointing chips and salsa. Chips are just generic mission tortilla chips  not warm or cooked in house. Portion of chips is also really paltry (small sandwich bag). The ""hot"" salsa is pretty mild as well. Excellent highly recommend plenty of food we were down on our luck and had to panhandle for our food but this was well spent money the best hear Union Square Food was okay.  Had the super burrito al pastor.  Truth be told have had better.  Not too much flavor.  The salsa for the chips was good.  .

El Sol Taqueria 2|3.5|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|128|2|3.71428571429| Besides being able to practice my Spanish with the workers, they also have an amazing burrito that was both huge and very affordable (especially in SF). One thing I didn't like was the fact that their salsa wasn't really spicy enough for me. The quesadilla was alright but I'd definitely recommend the burrito any day Ordered the carnitas and beef tacos from El Sol. The tortillas were so soggy I couldn't pick up the tacos, which were really too huge for tacos. My friend got the nachos, which actually looked much more appetizing. Given the amount of delicious, authentic Mexican food in the Bay Area, I doubt I'll try this place again. Tasty food and friendly staff. I get my lunch here every couple of days. I'm not a connoisseur, I just like burritos!NB: there's not much seating space. This place is less than a block from me and when I was craving Mexican, I decided to give this place a try.  It was good Mexican for decent price!  I ordered the dinner chicken enchiladas and it came with  enchiladas, refried beans, rice, lettuce, salsa, guac (didn't charge extra for this), and sour cream.  It ran me around $ with tax, which is pretty pricey for one person but since the entree was so large, it made sense.  They also give you free chips & salsa which adds a nice touch to things.  This place is quick and has the option for you to sit down or carry out.  They take credit cards ($ minimum) which is nice and has about  varieties of Jarritos drinks (which I found out, Mango, is officially the best one now lol)Overall, I've had better enchiladas in my life but given the location, speediness of orders and quality of food, I'd give this place  stars. I seriously love this place. I have a pepper allergy, but love mexican food, which is a problem. They go out of their way to make sure I can eat what I want. Went in last night for a shrimp burrito, and it was incredible. All it was was shrimp, cilantro, onions, refried beans, guac, sour cream, and cheese and it was unreal. Each ingredient is so flavorful you don't need to get all crazy. Tired of bridesmaid dress shopping, we almost went to Colibri down the street. Thank GOD we walked out of there before paying $ for an empanada because El Sol has delicious meat, a variety of it, and I think the four of us payed $ for all our food. Which left more money for beer. . . . and a dollar for the homeless man that poked his head in. AMAZING prawn burrito (my husband and I make a point to visit their Dos Amigos location on Brannan every time we're in SF. . tried this location for the first time last week  burrito tastes identical).  Kind of pricey ($) if you can finish one by yourself. . . but they're big so we always manage to split one.  A handful of small tables inside.  Complimentary chips & salsa (teeny tiny portion).|5|88|5|Routine| Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 8/26/2013 ] Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities  [ date violation corrected: 8/26/2013 ] Improper storage of equipment utensils or linens  [ date violation corrected: 8/26/2013 ] Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 8/26/2013 ] Wiping cloths not clean or properly stored or inadequate sanitizer  [ date violation corrected: 8/26/2013 ]
El Sol Taqueria 3|3.5|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|128|3|3.41666666667|" Once in a while, I'd order their super quesadilla, which I used to love. Well, i still do, but it shrinked in size almost double and this fact I don't really like. And I want to think it depends on who is cooking, coz last  times there was a lady, taking my order and cooking and it is really smaller than the one I used to get from the man. It's still enough to get really full, but before it made  meals for me ; ))And if comparing pricing: it's $ or $ more expensive than in major taquerias. Ok for me since it's tasty. Not familiar with any other items. So, taking off  star for shrinking in size and I also was charged $ for  extra small conteiners of  salsa (minus nd star), even though I didn't want their chips, so they might 've given it to me just instead. . . . I decided to walk to work today instead of getting the bus and passed by this place. They had a sign outside advertising breakfast burritos, so I decided to give it a try. There was actually no sign of a breakfast burrito on the menu board, but they do have it. I must say it was one of the tastiest breakfast burritos I've had in a long time. Fried potatoes, freshly cracked eggs (not from a carton like some other places), a generous helping of cheese and a sizeable amount of salsa made this a fantastic breakfast. I asked for it without meat, but it seems you can get it with chorizo also. It cost under $, which was a lot less than I was expecting. I will definitely be back to try their other options. Disappointing. I got the super quesadilla, which was small and not all that tasty. And it was quite expensive. food is pretty good, but what I really like about that place is that they see to have the nicest customer service I seen in any food place I am not an expert on Mexican food, and know nothing about the standards in San Francisco since I am just a tourist, but I just came back from this place and the  food was great. I had a delicious Super Quesadilla and a very refreshing Horchata. The only reason I am not giving this place  stars is because the service wasn't the ""friendliest"". Awesome hole in the wall. Only four tables to sit at but we didn't have a problem walking in and snagging one. Truly authentic mexican food. Corona or Modela to choose from. My cousin let my mom have a bite of her burrito and from then on my mom has been asking me to get her one. I came here with her and ordered the Super Burrito. I thought the super burrito would be bigger than the regular but it just comes with cheese, sour cream, and guc which the regular doesn't come with. Seeing how I know I can't finish a burrito and its technically my mom's first time we ordered one to share. The lady who took made our burrito was very nice. We asked her to cut our super burrito in half. She wrapped each again in foil so it looked like we ordered two really small burritos. The burrito was good but nothing amazing. This is a good place if you are hungry and want a place to sit where people will leave you alone. Although the place is small I think there is always a place to sit if you need. I once randomly walked by around pm and saw my friend sitting there enjoying a burrito. He got off work really late and this was the only place where he could get something hearty and where he can dine by himself. This isn't the taqueria you go out of your way to dine at. El Sol taqueria is small about four tables and there food is edible while the service comes with a smile. The best thing about their standard taqueria menu is the baby burrito, a small burrito for those of us who watch their manly physiques or people with small stomachs. They offer chips and salsa with their meals and  have some horchata or agua fresca. I've had the quesadilla  and their tacos; they were filling but something totally awesome seemed to be missing from the food. This place has really grown on me.  Consistent and tender, they're always there for me (well, except for before  am). Food poisoning. . . . . Do I need to say more? How do you soak up a dozen free colonial punches and ginger snaps?  Tacos.  For best results with the friendly staff use your Spanish.  In the hungry future I'm very interested in trying the nopale (cactus) and goat cheese burrito.  This visit I split half a dozen tacos with my dining companion.  She ordered a chile relleño, because she's a little peppery.  She  shared a few bites with me.  The chile wasn't spicy or fried to death and the queso was flavorful.  The presentation was classic but efficient.  Some shredded lettuce, crema, and guacamole with fresh pico de gallo.  Now for the meaty details on the carnita tacos and the al pastor tacos.  The carnitas weren't dried out, crusty or all fatty.  They were not heavily seasoned so you could spice up your taco as much as you like. The al pastor did not satisfy my desire to find and devour the best al pastor in California.  It was just ok. I absolutely love the fish tacos here."|5|92|3|Routine| Inadequate food safety knowledge or lack of certified food safety manager  [ date violation corrected: 1/7/2013 ] Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils  [ date violation corrected: 1/7/2013 ] Wiping cloths not clean or properly stored or inadequate sanitizer  [ date violation corrected: 1/7/2013 ]
El Sol Taqueria 4|3.5|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|128|4|3.70930232558|" It's your average burrito place, but nowhere near what you can expect in the Mission.  For my money I'd rather go to Chipotle, which is only a few blocks away. The quesadillas & the burritos are awesome! Great inexpensive Mexican food. Definitely a hole in the wall but well worth it. Great portion sizes. I can't believe I haven't written a review yet especially since I'm a regular here.   It's always consistent and on every level  food and customer service.  The staff is here is very nice, friendly, and you can tell they work hard.  They're flexible to catering to whatever type of burrito you want  love that.  They're pretty swift with service  you're in & outta there in no time.  LOVE! Good food! I love everything you do for me. Thank you. This place is pretty good. I usually stop by here on my way back from school or work sometimes. Although, I think the chips that come with the meal can be a little stale sometimes. The guacamole portions are great if you're just buying that alone. This is the best hole in the wall, bang for your buck restaurant in DT San Fran. I visit every time I'm in town. The home made burritos are HUGE and CHEAP. I'm from Texas and love Mexican food and I love this place. Be advised as its more for take out than sitting in, but you can buy beer to go too. Love the tortas at this place:D Yummy mexican sandwich ""Meh"" is the word.   Had the chicken enchilada plate, rellano and veggie tacos.  Everything was microwaved, right in front of us.  Meh.  I'm writing this review because I think the place was OK, but doesn't deserve the  stars it is getting. . . microwaved. . really. Message to the owner: dude, you want  Cents for an extra tiny cup of salsa? That is rediculous. I have plenty of other options for mexican food in this city. Your food is good, but you guys wanted to charge me for that. I expect that kind of lameness from chipolte not you folks. Please change you stupid policy. You just lots $ in business from me. Change your policy and I will return. I stopped in here before the Das Racist concert at Ruby Skye the other night. I was trying to find quick veggie/vegan food. I ordered the veggie burrito. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it actually comes with vegetables. They threw in cauliflower, broccoli, peppers and zucchini. I also got black beans and rice and lettuce and salsa all up in my tortilla. I like how they didn't just heat up the tortilla. They let some parts get a little golden and slightly crispy. I have a little crush on this burrito now. Whenever I start to feel lost in the sea of endless yuppies San Francisco has to offer, I can always count on the lady server with a gold tooth to make me feel like I'm in back at home in Oakland. Nothing beats authenticity. . . Plus, she always gives me two FULL scoops of chicken on my super burrito. She knows how to keep me coming back for more. . . Pancho Villa who? My husband and I were dedicated to this place for the last year before we moved away from our beloved city. We only lived a block away, and seriously, the amount of GOOD food you get for the price is enough to keep you. I would get the baby burrito and still have some left over.  We live in Southern California now, with Mexican restaurants on every corner, but it's just not the same. Kirkland brand guacamole oozes from your burritos here. I miss my chunky avocado pieces. I miss you, El Sol. We will definitely be back again. You don't always have to go to The Mission for an amazing burrito.  And this is an amazing example of that simple fact. I really want to drag this story out.  I feel like it deserves a really unique one, with a twist ending.  I just realized I'm calling my reviews stories now though.  Anyway, back on track. . . Simply put, they make great burritos.  They even offer what is now my personal menu favorite, ""The Baby Burrito. ""  This is exactly the same as a ""Super Burrito,"" just smaller. And believe me, it's plenty big.  But the bonus is that you don't feel terrible about yourself if you eat the entire thing.  Unless the only thing you fill it with is sour cream and chorizo.  Then you should feel bad. Twist ending.  San Francisco is considering extending the cut off point of The Mission to Geary and Jones just because of this place, and so they can name it ""Mission Burrito of the Year. ""  You're welcome. i thought this place was pretty good until today.  usually i get a (spicy) chicken quesadilla and it's always been surprisingly good.  the service was pretty friendly as well even though it seems like they have been starting to nickle and dime you for anything and everything.  typically chips come with anything you order.  however today i was just told that they now charge  cents for chips. . that's still pretty cheap but it's just sad.  the service was full of impatience even though there was no one in there waiting and i told them exactly what i wanted without hesitation.  i got a super chicken burrito this time and the ""super"" part was a quarter size cream and guacamole drop of which the woman proceeded to smoosh around to spread it out.  again, there was NO other customers so i was wondering why they were being so incredibly stingy. . . when only a few months ago they weren't.  their food is pretty good and i would go back again seeing as how it's the only decent place of it's kind in the area that i've found.  still, the skimping and waning customer service has my visits down for sure. When you go to this place, don't get the traditional burrito you'd get at Chipotle or in the Mission. Get the super quesadilla, and here's why:Most taquerias make their quesadillas with only the meat and cheese inside, leaving the guacamole, sour cream and salsa on the side for dipping. El Sol doesn't force you to make this mess. They cook everything inside the quesadilla in one massive, sturdy tortilla, and will make it extra crispy for no charge. It's a great balance of ingredients, too, making each bite a burst of unforgettable flavor. I used to live a block away, and during that year I frequented this little place at least once or twice a week. I'm not a snobby ""mission district only"" type or a SoCal boy, so I'm not going to brag about how much better everything is in SD, the Mission or LA and refuse to be satisfied with anything outside of my selfish bubble. I don't care about how ""authentic"" it is. It's all about the taste, and this place hits the spot. It's so yummy. A few other good things to note: They serve beer. They are very friendly and even know my order. They even start making it the moment I walk in. They are efficient, even for newcomers, and reasonably priced. My only nitpick is that it's so small. There's seating for maybe eight people, but it's never really too crowded. Disclaimer:  Moving from southern California where there is a burrito and taco place on every corner and where the traditional fish taco got it start my review may be a bit jaded. I ordered the vegetarian burrito and a fish taco.  Every part of both were  dull and flavorless.  No spice or taste to the guacamole.  It seems if they had just combined blended avocado with some mayo and left it at that.  The beans looked like they had just came straight out of the can watery and runny.  The fish was actually  grilled to order which I surprised about.  But it just came out greasy and the breading simply did not exist.  The best part of the entire meal was the horchata which was light creamy with out being overly sweet.  The prices were a bit high for this type of establishment especially how close to the loin it is located but then again this is San Francisco. I do not see my self coming back to El Sol unless I am very very drunk and just cant resist my craving for burrito Looking forward to the day when declining rice and chips is seen as a fair trade for lettuce and a wheat tortilla instead. Today was not that day. El Sol did pile on the grilled chicken and friendly service, the slab was quite good, but can't quite call it a deal at $ and change, which included an extra charge for the aforementioned wheat tortilla. Think they slid the lettuce in there. Thanks for that. A strong three star burrito. Although I don't live in the TL, I am there quite often so I think I know what's up when it comes to legit burrito places in the area. El Sol is BY FAR the most delicious, the other taquerias in the area really don't compare. Everything is perfection. From the tortilla to the juicy meat to the delicious chips n salsa. I love it all! And if you're a cilantro freak like I am, they have a special bowl of freshly chopped cilantro right before your eyes! I can't get enough! Don't let the small hole in the wall facade deter you this is one tasty taqueria. Had the chicken quesadilla and veggie burrito: fresh ingredients + SUPER friendly staff +reasonable prices = happy me. Giddyup! I was so pleased that I could order my quesadilla the way I wanted it.  I ordered a quesadilla with half al pastor and half carne asada.  You must try the freshly made horchata it is like drinking a blended arroz con leche. The food is great! Very authentic Mexican food. I ordered the combination of a quezadilla, a taco and an enchilada along with beans and rice. The food was great, my friends ordered burritos and they loved them! I would highly recommend! best breakfast burrito i've ever eaten. what put it over the edge was the care and technique put into rolling the burrito. the ingredients were evenly mixed, dispersed, and  the tinfoil was tight to keep the whole thing together so there wasn't any mess. it may seem like a weird thing to be so impressed by, but i hate messy burritos, and i'd never seen one like it before. The boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place during our weekend trip to the city recently. This place has THE BEST vegetarian breakfast burrito I have ever eaten! Potatoes, black beans, egg, cheese, and spicy ass salsa. What more could I ask for? Oh yeah, some ridiculously good Horchata. EXCELLENT. On my way home Wed night, cruised up Geary Blvd towards J Town looking for a taqueria and noticed a tiny shop ""Taqueria El Sol"".  The staff of two was friendly took my order generous portions, tasty super burritos & quesadillas  a little on the salty side (steak).  Best of all they fry fresh chips as I was waiting for my order.  I've found a new taqueria and street parking at pm. I eat here at least once a week and love it. It's fast, convenient and delicious. The people are nice and friendly, the burritos are huge, and it's cheap! I'm not saying this is the best Mexican food I've ever had, but it's pretty damn close. PS. the quesadillas are yummy and greasy as well! This is an excellent taqueria and my husband and I frequently have their burritos on weekends when we want to be lazy and are less inclined to cook.  Personally, I love the veggie supreme baby burrito the best!  It's so yummy and I like that this taqueria is open on Sundays.  We also go to Taqueria Mana in Union Square on occasion, but it's never open on Sundays. El Sol Taqueria is consistently tasty and my husband and I always receive warm service here.  I highly recommend this taqueria, but the location is definitely not for everyone.  This is the TenderNob at its most ""interesting,"" so if you're not up for the sometimes unappetizing events that go on outside, you'll probably want to get your food to go! Well, my days of eating at Taqueria El Sol went out with a bang: the microwave they used to cook my $ enchiladas broke. (Yes, cook. Not reheat. ) We go here for work all the time and I've finally had it with this place.  Consistently lukewarm food and the only flavor is salt. The place is clean, but by any other measure, not good. Huge burritos, great prices. As a Bay Area lifer, I can say without hesitation that el Sol makes the best damn veggie burrito I've had. I'm not saying there isn't stiff competition from the other joints (nod to La Victoria). But el Sol just gets it all right. From the taste of the ingredients to the quantity mashed into your choice of tortilla to the tight, easy to eat wrapping to the Mexican Coke. The folks that work there are super nice, too, so dig deep when you tip. Only nit I have is the size. Place is tiny. Oh. . . and it's not in San Jose. Ok food, burritos are big but  bucks is a little much! . , actually. I pass this place every day and finally tried it out. Green chicken super quesadilla. Filling? Yes. Taste. Meh. Relatively cheap. VERY fast service. I probably won't be back though. This place is really really really really god, just not great! It is a fantastic late night place to go a grab a few more beers and stuff your face full of tacos at the end of the night. I'm from Manhattan so we don't get the true authentic mexican food ever, all it is is hyped up mexican food made for tourists, so I really enjoyed my experience at El Sol. Like a lot of reviews said already the green chicken is the way to go so definitely grab some of that. The prices are low the taste is very very good so I gotta put this place on my recommendation list. Mmm. . . I highly recommend one of their giant quesadillas They're incredibly filling, delicious, and flavorful. My friend and I shared a beef and a pork quesadilla and could only finish / of each. Customer service was quick and friendly. Their flan however was bland. The Hubby and I, new to the neighborhood, started eating here fairly frequently over the course of a few months. At first, the service was decent, the food was plentiful for the price, and we were happy with the service. Fast forward a few weeks, we went in one day and asked for two veggie burritos. The lady gave me MUCH attitude, slamming the tortilla shell and the contents together, making it insanely small, and actually thought we would pay for full price for a large burrito. We simply walked out and left the burrito there. I will NEVER return. I am addicted to the green chicken. I don't know what it's called, but it's the only chicken that is green. I highly suggest getting it in a quesadilla. So amazing! Cheap, fast, and delicious! Simple, tasty, fresh, cheap, fast. Great! Solid carne asada burrito. Well. . . more like .  Stars. Was running around Union Square before a Bday get together and decided to grab a quick bite. Not the best super burrito I've had but it still was pretty good. Actually, the best part was the lengua. Yes, the tongue. It was done very well here. VERY tender (like fall apart tender) and stewed in a very good sauce. Plus, they pack the burritos up with meat and cheese! (could of used less sour cream, however). . . add in the Mexican Coke with extra sugar. . . and it was pretty tasty. The prices are slightly higher than the joints down on Mission or the Oakland taco trucks. . . but it's still worth the price. It's cheap, close, and. . . . delicious! what more can I ask for? Sometimes on my way back, if I'm too hungry and impatient to cook or order delivery food, I'd pick up a burrito here. delicious burritos, really.  i'm very specific, they get it right every time. I was reluctant to try them as the previous mexican restaurant at this location wasn't too good but this place is acceptable.  they always wash their hands before making my food, i like seeing this and greatly appreciate it.  the food has tasted fresh, the restaurant is fairly clean, i keep coming back.  i have them make me my own customized vegetarian burrito as i don't like it soggy.  open until :! Contrary to popular belief there IS an authentic and inexpensive Taqueria close to Union Square and El Sol is it!  I've found this little place very convenient for a quick bite before catching a show at the Geary or Curran Theatre. You won't be dissapointed, it's like a trip to The Mission without even having to pay for a Bart ticket! This place is where it's at for a burrito from carne asada to chicken verde!  Great for an after drinks meal and chat (and/or more beer).  Kind of small inside but let's call it ""cozy"".  And the people are nice! One of the BEST Burritos I have ever had!Their Mojado Burrito is amazing! I loved it!Definitely one of the best places for Quick and Fast Mexican food in the neighborhood. . . DELICIOUS!! (and I'm picky with mexican food) Coming from LA, I think I can say I've had so many good mexican food around me until I came to SF. HOWEVER, when my lovely bf found out about this place, we came here atleast twice a week. (we just moved so now it's only once a week) This place seriously has the BEST shrimp burritos I have ever had in my entire life. I went to Cozumel, Mexico this summer and although the gaucamole is better in Cozumel, I was actually craving El Sol Taqueria's shrimp burrito. That's how good it is. The main guy who works here is super kind which makes my ordering experience better. SERIOUSLY PEOPLE! if u want good mexican food, u HAVE to eat here. I've tried at least a dozen mexican restaurants in SF and no one can compete. now I'm craving a shrimp burrito. damn it Nope, still not sick of burritos. I was enticed by the cactus and goat cheese burrito on the otherwise no nonsense menu but when I tried to order it my request was declined. Instead, I enjoyed a vegetarian burrito here and I loaded it up with tomatoes, black beans, rice, and enough guacamole to fill an Olympic sized swimming pool. I devoured the little bromigo so quickly that I didn't even notice that I had also swallowed more than a few square inches of tinfoil. Oh, and one of them was conveniently affixed to a few of my teeth  homemade grillz, anyone? So it's pm PST, I'm tired and very hawngry. All I want is some grub and my hotel pillow. Some of my colleagues step into a Mediterranean place around the corner, but I'm in no mood for tabbouleh and gyros. I need some hearty stuff. . . the kind that will put me to sleep with happy dreams. I spotted El Sol Taq while rounding the corner. . . all it took was the neon ""TACOS BURRITOS"" in the window to get me to stop in. While I was making my decision from the extensive menu (considering the small joint that it is), some dude came in and ordered up some tacos and quesadillas. I was torn between the two myself but I after I saw the shiz they piled on those tacos, I knew it was the only way to go. I got one chicken taco, one veggie. Holy crow Batman. . . they pile them high! Cheese, beans, rice, meat, lettuce, sour cream, guac and salsa. Bring it on! I was salivating on my shirt by the time he closed the wimpy to go container. By the time that I got back to my room though, the paper container had given out and the goodness within had started to seep out. Boo. Another loss? It was going cold by the time I dug in. I couldn't tell if I scarfed it because it was that good, or because I was just that hungry. I think it was the latter. A few of the chicken pieces and some rice was hard which made for an unpleasant crunch every few bites. The guac wasn't housemade (or at least it didn't taste like it), but the salsa was top notch. All in all, a decent quickie stop if you're low on choices. I would recommend eating it there or within a few minutes. . . otherwise, you'll be whipping out the Tide pen to take care of the bean juice dripping on your clothes. this is for sure one of my favorite places to get a burrito. they're always super cool and friendly. the only downside is that it can only seat about four people without getting crowded. i don't care that it's in the tl and the're a % chance a crackhead is going to be standing outside. i just want a place to sit while i scarf down this yummy burrito. This place is great! I go here quite often for the super burrito. The staff is very nice, and the food is delicious!Before I found this place I was HOOKED on Cancun. But I honestly think El Sol is better! The four stars is for the super nachos.  I once had a super burrito here and it was mediocre.  The super nachos though, were amazing.  I got the grilled chicken with the hot salsa and had them put some cilantro on it. Regular Nachos With Meat was a steal for $. !Chunks of spicy, marinated chicken the size of a baby's fist!Everything from the pico de gallo to the chips were high quality and tasty!Don't worry about the small dining area, just sit next to the mirrored wall and contemplate the universe as you watch people on the street approach their own double, then collide and vanish! This place is right around the corner from me, I go here twice a week. The quesadillas & the burritos are awesome! I try not to ever go five stars, but screw it. this place was a wicked half drunk find. i was headed home after drinks with my girlfriend and my brother, wondering what crap food i was going to eat once i got back to the haight, then i saw this place, it kinda reminded me of mexico and i was hungry, so i dove in. the place is tiny. just a hole in the wall. don't let that detract anything. i got a couple of tacos carne and spoke in my broken spanish to the very nice senor on the other side of hte counter. he was patient with my poor spanish and said that he was happy to talk to a gringo en espanol. so that was cool. very nice people working there, food was awesome and cheap and it's always fun to watch the fishbowl that is geary st. so eff it, five stars. as an aside, brittany a. likely doesn't eat in the city very often. are you even from here? $ for a burrito is under the average.  sheesh. ""Hell hath no fury as a woman's scorn. "" **shakes fist at El Sol**I ordered  burritos: a vegetarian and a carne asada super burrito w/out sour cream. Veggie = rice + beans (your choice): BLAND! How do you make something so greasy taste like nothing?!?Carne asada burrito: Can best be described in the words of my bf, ""I can taste all the ingredients SEPARATELY. "" No bueno. It's sounds weird, but every bite you could taste the rice. . . and then the beans. . . and then the meat, etc. ONE star for the friendly customer service. Needless to say, it was an odd experience and I am still perterbed whenever I pass by. I've been traumatized enough to stay away. . . for the time being. . . I'm currently hooked on the El Veggie burrito here. In case anyone is wondering, I like it with:black beansguaccheeseboth salsasgreen sauce to goSomeone mentioned frozen veggies I don't think so. Their deluxe veggie nachos are also a lot of fun when you're working from home. They're always extremely nice here. I think they probably get a wacky crowd, but I also think this tiny place must be more pleasant to work in than one of the assembly line places in the Mission. People are always sitting in and eating here  the street outside can be pretty gnarly so it's not for the people watching. Well or maybe it is. : ) My boyfriend and I thought we'd try a new taqueria in our neighborhood, but after taking our first bite, we immediately regretted our flippant decision. Actually, it was before the first bite.  The prices are outrageous. Seven+ bucks for a burrito stuffed with frozen vegetables! And six+ dollars for the usual beaner veggie burrito? That's really uncool. Plus, what's going on with the burrito names? One is labeled vegetarian burrito, and the other is el veggie? Totally confusing! The burrito maker got confused too, and after she realized the mistake, she cooked the frozen veggies for about .  and slopped it onto my rice n bean mix, then I guess she rolled it into what you could call a burrito. And, who doesn't drain the friggin beans before dropping them into the tortilla? I don't want bogged down, soggy rice. But really, what's the point when the rice is HARD. Not very good. But, they were nice and friendly, so no harm done really. A workmanlike burrito, it just keeps its head down and gets the job done. It has everything you need and nothing you don't; a real meat and potatoes, lunchbox variety burrito, only it doesn't have potatoes in it and people generally don't carry lunchboxes anymore. You know what I'm getting at. I probably wouldn't make a special trip if I had to drive here, but it is the best spot within a reasonable walking distance of my house (the GF thinks it's one of the best burritos she's ever had but she's from Kansas so what the hell would she know?). I don't even bother walking the extra block and a half to El Tesoro anymore because El Sol has it locked down, and they have Squirt in a glass bottle. Most mexican places have Coke in glass, but Squirt? That's rare. I've eaten burritos from here two days in a row before, which is pretty much the highest compliment I could ever pay a taqueria. The younger lady who works there rolls her burritos big and tight, like the tightest I've ever had. She could get a job as a hand roller at a cigar factory in a Cuba with her skills. The jury is out on whether that would be better or worse than working at a Tenderloin taco shop. Yeah you might get hit by cars when crossing the street.  Yeah crackheads might try to mess with you.  But yeah. . . this place is worth it, especially when it comes to the super chicken burrito.  Nothing fancy, but very well put together in terms of everything you're looking for in a burrito to make you fat again right after you get out of the gym.  Delicious. We had a super beef quesadilla and a super vegetarian burrito. Both dishes were tasty, I will definitely go back. The two people behind the counter were very nice! Minus one for the prices. HOORAY for the baby burrito! I always find myself paying   bucks for a burrito and chips and never seem to finish the whole thing (i'm a little girl, I can't handle so much food!). The baby burrito is PERFECT for me and is always fulfilling. ALSO a huge fan because I did not have the right amount of change (total came to $ and I only had  on me), the lady was nice enough to make it a total of $. . I felt horrible but the next time I went in I gave them an extra tip :)Ingredients are def. more fresh in the early afternoon. After a night class a friend and I walked down to get in our burrito fix and although i was hungry enough to eat almost anything, the ingredients (veggies) didnt look as appealing. May I also add some of the BEST salsa verde I've had in a while :) This is the worst taqueria I've been to in the city.  I've been there twice, and both times the burrito just wasn't fulfilling the way that burritos are from Taqueria Mana, El Castillito, or any of the wonderous Mission Taquerias.  Even Chipotle is better than El Sol. That said, it's a cheap filling meal and I didn't get sick. Order something  p or earlier. The ingredients are fresher in the morning where it first gets sliced and diced (including the pork, red meat and poultry), so thats usually when I step through the doors. I've been there plenty of times. Its a small little space with just a hand full of employees. The guys and gals there are always smiling and nothing seems to get them down. Too bad it isnt owned and operated. It came to a point where I dont even have to say what I want anymore, even though Im super picky with the things I want. I guess you can say Im a regular. Minus  for the high prices :( YES, YES, YES.  Everytime I go here I get the baby burrito and it is heaven in a tortilla.  Not only is the food bangin', but the way they wrap up those burritos in foil is nothing short of Mexican genius.  I go here weekly. This place is pretty crappy, but I've been a bunch of times since it's a block away. The ingredients are not fresh (they use cheap Kirkland cheese), and the burritos are a bit overpriced.  Their nachos suck. Not bad for a late night snack, but don't expect too much. We love their regular and super burritos. The guy with the moustache and who seems to manage the Taqueria makes the best burritos. He constantly monitors the meats and mixes them. He packs those burritos as much as he can and he does so with care. There was a weird lady who worked behind the counter made the worst burritos. Every time she made it both ends of the burrito burst out in a mess and she tries to roll it again and again.  Horrible.  We are regulars and when she started working there we didn't go back for  months. Thank goodness we haven't seen her lately. This place is good for a quick meal under $. I get the regular burrito with chicken and green salsa. Salty and to the point. I'd pass on the bagged chips unless they give them to you. They are always stale. I believe there is a minimum purchase to use a credit card, so use cash if you can. i'm a fan of the nachos, not the burritos or taco's.  when i come im, i want nachos.  besides, they always hook me up with more meat after i tip them.  :) I was all set to give a resounding thumbs up to El Sol based on a gigantic burrito I got there, hungover a few days ago. The thing was so big that the woman making it wasn't sure how to roll it. It took her a couple of attempts, but she got it and nothing came out the sides once I started it. Sure, it was a prices (super burrito and a Mexican coke in a bottle=. ,) but it comes with the territory, and for the girth and taste, I was ok with it. But then my buddy showed up at Rug Jones with an El Sol burrito (based on my recommendation) and the thing was minuscule. I felt like an idiot. This taqueria is nearby from my crib. As a result, I came here for lunch and dinner. For lunch, I had a Carnitas (Grilled Pork) Super Burrito for $. . That Burrito has rice, choice of beans, sour cream, rice, cilantro, onions, cheese, and lettuce (an item I didn't want in my burrito, but was given to me) blanketed in a flour tortilla. The Super burrito's size is smaller than some of the burrito I've had, but wrapped tightly.  The filling was fresh and stored properly, but the rice tasted kind of dried. A mediocre burrito, wishing I should have gone to Mission St. instead. This place is small with only five tables, as a result for lunch; I was forced to take my lunch home. Luckily I paid my lunch with cash, because minimum credit card purchase is $. . For Dinner, I took my wife here after she got off work and ate in the restaurant. She had two Super Grilled Steak Tacos. Each taco costing $.  had the choice of meat, lettuce, salsa, cheese, sour cream and guacamole on top of a corn tortilla. She also bought a bottle of Negro Modelo beer and enjoyed her meal. I had the Grilled Steak and Prawn Combination Dinner (#). My $.  meal has the meat and two sets of prawns on skewers with rice, beans salsa, sour cream and guacamole in a plate. The seafood was good and the rice was fresher than my midday visit, but the meat was tad too burnt and salty. Even my $.  can of Diet Coke could not extinguish the saltiness from the meat. My subpar meal has forced me to tell my wife to charge our meal. Eventhough this taqueria is close to my house, I still have questionable thoughts about coming here again. I love nachos more than anything in this world. I have my favorite places to get nachos but decided to try this place as it was close to my apartment. The nachos were decent. They'd be better if the chips were homemade. What really sold me on this place was the day I decided to get a burrito. I got the super burrito with carnitas. I got to wash it down with a Mexican Coke and all was right with the world again. I've been tempted to try their other offerings but every time I go back the carnitas seduce me once again. El Sol lives up to its name, as in a shimmering beacon of light in the tenderest of loins. The folks who run this place are so nice they didn't even give the swift kick to a ditz girl for wishing them a happy cinco de mayo. I, however, made sure she tripped over a er of Corona on the way out. This joint brings it Subway style without the hideous cutout of that fat ass. All the ingredients are neatly laid out for your choosing, so if you like cheese you just keep telling them more cheese, more cheese, more cheese. Any place that doesn't pretend their s* don't smell and let's you be in charge of the burrito ingredients is a place I want to take home to mom. Only bad thing: Their chips really, to put it plainly, suck. Sorry, guys, but I love you anyway. My favorite burrito place in Union Square.  I absolutley love the super burrito.   They have awesome salsa's and great prices. . . . extremely clean fast service, I love it!Whatever you do try not to eat the entire super burrito in one sitting. . . . I almost died of an overdose.  I couldn't stop!. . its that good. the burritos are huge and super tasty!futbols on the screen and spanish flies between workers and locals. . . only way youre not in mexico is the prices are still SF high! This is currently my favorite burrito place in my neighborhood.  They make a mini burrito which I love. . . regular size burritos are always way too much but I eat usually end up with an empty wrapper anyway.  I've had the chicken and the shrimp.  I recommend the shrimp  I think it is worth the extra $.  The hot salsa is quite tasty and adds a lot of flavor to the burrito.  The prices are good and the place looks cleaner than most in the TL.  Sure, I've had better burritos but Taqueria El Sol is my first choice when I want a burrito and don't want to make my way to the mission. Not bad late at night and when you are hungry.  Super burrito is big and filling.  Price is good.  Quality could be better, but it is an authentic place. I just have to say that I eat here because it's right across the street from my apt.  It's convenient, quick, and just a hair over what I consider to be edible.  As Yoda would say. . over priced and underwhelming, the food is. Solid little place.  We got a super burrito and super nachos and they were both delicious.  Prices were very reasonable if I remember correctly.  There's only room for about  people to sit in the store, so plan on getting it to go.  The menu doesn't contain anything out of the ordinary for taquerias.  Standard goodness. They might be a  star taqueria.  I'm not going to stand around and argue about it.  I got better things to do, like draw pictures of wierd people walking around outside this loaf slinger. So about their food.  I have eaten tortas, tacos and loafs and they are all good albeit a tad pricey ($ loaf, fully stacked, tightly wrapped, in a foil tomb to warm up your lap).  Rather than drone on and on about all of the good and bad aspects of the place, I will concentrate on one good because I do like these people and what they do, while genuinely wishing the best to them and theirs.  So here goes; They take pork, perhaps some shoulder or butt, and the boil then bejesus out of it.  Next they take these savory chunks of hog and throw them in the deep fryer.  This produces a material that is crisp on the outside but oh so juicy in the middle.  Properly seasoned and loaded into a stainless steel trough and what we got are some muy bueno carnitas.  I highly recommend masticating some of these to fill your hungry tummy.  Tell them to twist those up with some black beans, cheez, guacamole, salsa, onions, rice and jalepenos, and you have a mighty delicious loaf.  Eat that bashful beaver and sit back to let the heartburn take control. Worst  veggie burrito ever. No taste. Beans were tasteless, salsa was tasteless, frozen veggies were tasteless, ""minute rice"" was tasteless, chips were tasteless. . guac was gross. . . I could go on. im feelin their burrito. i got a black bean and chicken with the green sauce. the chicken was plump and delicious. the prices were a bit high. over  dollars for a burrito is not ok in my book. their chips and salsa was nothing special. i got a nice glass of cool water to chill my taste buds and hydrate myself while i ate the burrito. Went here for convenience the other evening. got myself a super taco and it was HUGE. meat was stacked upon other pieces of meat! don't even try to eat this with your hands. . . it was good. in fact, quite good.  star good. but it is WTF expensive! i paid  or  bucks for this taco and a coke (which btw is the mexican coke).  star knocked off for these prices. ridick. We were wandering endlessly in the union square neighborhood, looking for food.  We'd walked down market from th Street to union square, just crappy fast food on market.  We thought we could find food in union square, but no.  All we could find was expensive food and starbucks.  Lots of starbucks.  We found a diner on a corner, but not one vegetarian thing on the menu except breakfast (pancakes).  We found another place with $ sandwiches  too expensive. Walking west, we finally found Taqueria El Sol at Jones & Geary, right across from Millenium.  If we were rich, we'd have lunched at Millenium, of course.  But we were looking more for something in the $ range.  This place fit the bill.  We each got the vegetarian burrito, which was $.  plus tax = $. .  They had other vegetarian options like nachos, quesadillas, tacos.  And the usual meat options in those forms, plus extra. One thing I really liked about this place, is that our burritos were made to order, customized right in front of our eyes.  I picked which beans I wanted, how much of lettuce, cheese, etc. , I wanted, and I could see each step.  Everything seemed clean.  And I got my burrito the way I wanted it. Maybe I was just really thirsty, but the glass of tap water I got was great.  No ice, but nice and cold, but not too cold, just cool and refreshing.  Ah.  And free.  My BF got a bottled beverage. There are only four tables in this tiny place, but it was nice enough  no wobbly table, no stickyness.  The burrito was among the best I've had.  It was longer and slimmer than most  same total size as usual, but a much easier shape to handle.  And the ingredients were throughout, as opposed to those burritos where you get bites of beans, and then later big bites of guac, etc. The burrito came with a little cup of salsa and a little plastic baggie of chips.  The baggie looked small, but I think there were as many chips as you usually get at this type of place.  Or almost. Overall, I recommend. I asked for a super burrito, I got a ""regular"" without the good fatty sour cream & guac. I paid in cash, so they didn't believe me when I went up to get the stuff that was supposed to be included in the super burrito price so I paid twice for my sour cream & guac. There's a definite language barrier. The guacamole is good but I can make better. The salsa (pico de gallo) is very liquified. If you get anything in a tortilla, it'll be soggy. The meat and cheese is pretty safe no bad incidents later during the day after eating here. Solid burrito (super, carne asada) and taquitos. Gotta try the shrimpHits the spot Lady behind the steam counter bosses las jovenes.  ""Come with frijoles?"" they ask, pan juice dripping from spoon to styrofoam.  ""Mmgh,"" she points. ""Tomates?""""Mmgh. ""A tiny cellophane baggy of chips, a fork, a napkin and a stray rubber band in the sack.  Truth be told portions are stingy, tortillas few and brittle, meat  bland, prices fairly high.  But nothing diminishes the cheer of opening night.  With luck staff will figure out how to make a taco in a few weeks once she's not around to give them grief. Simplified taqueria menu plus beer and wine.  Prawns and nachos yes, agua fresca, cabeza and brains no.  Two tables and a counter.  $ to $ for a burrito or $ for una plata to give a point of reference."|5|88|5|Routine| Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils  [ date violation corrected: 5/17/2012 ] No thermometers or uncalibrated thermometers   [ date violation corrected: 5/17/2012 ] Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 5/17/2012 ] Improper thawing methods   [ date violation corrected: 5/17/2012 ] Improper food storage  [ date violation corrected: 5/17/2012 ]
El Norteno Taco Truck 0|4.0|Food Stands in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|125|0|3.77777777778| Food was good, but beware the will make up prices depending on how drunk or an easy target they suspect the buyer will be. None of the prices were listed and we ordered guac and chips, a water and a coke. $! as the guy just made it up right there. At that point it was already made so had to accept it. El Norteño is pretty decent for a taco truck. In my opinion, nothing spectacular and nothing lack luster. . . just decent. I've had all of the meats in both tacos and burritos, they do them okay. If I do Mexican it's usually in a restaurant not from a truck. The fact that I went here today was strictly based on convenience. $.  for a Mexi Coke & $.  for an al pastor/camaron burrito sans frijoles. I just love this truck. The price is right. The portion is right. The tortilla they use surpasses a taqueria restaurant in the mission. Why I say that is because it's soft and not dry. A lot of places on mission I've been to well I guess they wanna toast it. But here everything is like wrapped in a warm tortilla blanket ready to be eaten. Pretty big burrito to. A great, quick place to grab tacos if you're in the area for jury duty. They do offer veggie tacos  they're good but nothing special. For instance, it includes rice, beans (your choice of refried, black, and something else I couldn't make out), lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, etc. The tacos are served Northern California style, meaning way over filled for a taco. They also offer a choice between mild and spicy; the spicy is actually spicy, which is a nice change of pace from the terribly mild Mexican food found here. Not the best veggie taco you'll find, but a perfectly satisfying (and cheap  $. /taco) lunch. Credit cards accepted and there didn't seem to be a minimum. First note: I am not a food truck fan. I like to sit relax and eat, not stand in the hot sun and get my food in a rush. Don't try to convince me of those food truck malls. Nothing compares to a good cozy neighborhood location. But there are those days you are hungry and time is precious. I also work in a food desert. If I liked Subway or McDolands I would be in heaven, but I don't. So El Norteno is my next best option. As my friends know, if they don't have real toritalla chips I will never be a huge fan. Having a truck, I'm sure this is not an easy task. I give a little break for this. Nice people though,  pretty good burritos.  If you want extra hot sauce you have to beg for it. ;)The husband and wife that run this truck are so nice so it keeps me coming back. Best Taco Truck on the  strip! The tacos Al Pastor and Carnita burritos are the bomb! randomly walked by here on my way to the flower market. i had never had a non greasy, fatless yet still authentic burrito until i came here. nothing drips from the ends. their rice was perfect and they accept credit cards. i had tripe. no one ever offers that unless they really know how to cook it. plus points! they also have lengua, chorizo and tortas. So I'm stuck on jury duty and super thankful  that this little truck is across the street. I've tried the al pastor and crane asada tacos and the chicken burrito. All we're really tasty, full of flavor and quality ingredients. I'll be back even after I'm excused from wasting my life away across the street in court. I've been eating here at least twice a week since January. No joke. The carne asada and carnitas tacos are delish! Meat is moist and they have super spicy sauce! Also, their nachos are really good and come in a half order or full order. They're loaded with your normal toppings like cheese, sour cream, guac, jalapenos, beans?, and meat if you'd like it. I don't know what I'm going to do when I'm no longer near this truck. There will be tears. Service is quick and good too! I believe they also accept cards. + points.|12|84|5|Routine Inspection| Permit license or inspection report not posted Inadequately cleaned or sanitized food contact surfaces Foods not protected from contamination Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils Moderate risk food holding temperature
El Norteno Taco Truck 1|4.0|Food Stands in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|125|1|3.66666666667| Food trucks ftw! This place is killer. The carnitas are the best I've had anywhere in SF. The people who run the food truck are friendly as well. Service is quick, food is amazing, people are friendly. Doesn't get much better than that. Haven't had burritos as I'm GF, but I hear they're pretty darn incredible. Update: Amazing food. But, the nachos. . . don't order if you are not a fan of cheese sauce. I'm personally not a fan, so I didn't find the nachos very good. I do however, love everything else I've ever had from here. I got the carne asada burrito and was disappointed.  The meat was chewy, like rubber from a tire.  Everything including the rice was equally bad.  I'm not sure if I ordered the wrong thing at this place?Not sure what the hype is all about. Last week I worked a  hour shift and got off work at am, had to go to  Bryant Street to file a police report, took  hours, I was already irritated because I was getting the runaround, finally got it handled, afterwards I was so tired but also starving because I had not eaten since the night before, the scents and aromas from this Taco Truck were amazing and I saw  guys already buying their lunch there, all of whom were Latino (no  rule, if you want good Mexican food, go where you see lots of Latino customers, Chinese Food , asian customers) i order a Super burrito with carnitas y carne asada, no frijoles, extra crema, extra savoia!This burrito was AMAZING! I will definitely patronize them again and I highly recommend them!

Wo ha!Was feeling like tacos for lunch today, so I decided to walk on over to the El Norteno Taco Truck. Ordered a steak and a chicken taco and I was asked if I'd like them mild or spicy.  I'm sure you can figure out which one I opted for. Ss (ohh! that burns so good!). I have a pretty high tolerance for heat; for me it was borderline  intolerable. I'd recommend getting the tacos mild but asking for the spicy sauce on the side.  Spicy sauce/salsa: they definitely use orange habanero peppers and if you know what habanero peppers are, you would know that these lil babies not only pack a lot of great flavor, but are near the top of the list of having the highest levels of capsaicin. Pretty much the hottest pepper you can find at your local grocer.  This sauce is addicting, but definitely needs to be consumed with precaution! You will sweat, cry, go numb and possibly blind. . . But it's so good you will ache for more.  Remember. . . ORDER MILD  SPICY SAUCE ON THE SIDE!   Now excuse me while I go chug another gallon of water. This place is, THE BOMB! The tacos are super delicious, I haven't found another great taco place in San Francisco as good as this truck for tacos.  Its cheap, fast, and they are really nice.  Its pretty fresh as well.  They have a constant and steady traffic flow for lunch because its that good. I usually get only tacos Al Pastor, Carne Asada, and Carnitas. I've also had the lengua tacos there and it is pretty delicious as well.

El Norteno Taco Truck 6|4.0|Food Stands in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|125|6|2.5| I don't think I've ever had a torta until I've been to this place. My coworker, who's Mexican, told me he was going to get tortas from this place last week and I decided to join him. The torta's come in either  piece or  pieces, no  pieces. Very weird. It worked in our favor cuz I only wanted  and my coworker wanted . The entire thing comes wrapped in its original bread loaf package. It's basically like all the contents of a burrito, but in between a loaf of bread. It's delicious, hearty, and for  pieces, it was only $! What a steal. I absolutely loved every bite! There's always a line here and you know its good when there's a bunch of Mexican people waiting in line! I will definitely be back many times! Well, I hate that my first review is a negative one, but I must let the people know. Yesterday (Friday) I got a super burrito (chicken, black beans) from the truck for lunch. It has given me food poisoning. The burrito was tasty, and it's the second time I've eaten here. But sadly, my quality time with the toilet and entire Saturday of non functionality, terrible stomach pains and inability to eat are telling me that I wont be back.

And I love that when I ask for hot sauce, they actually put hot hot sauce on it. The al pastor super burrito is my personal favourite: I usually cut it in half because it's so big. Coming back from TechCrunch Disrupt, I walked past el Norteno and given I have trouble turning down Taco/Burrito trucks, I decided to give it a try. El Norteno is similar to most other taco trucks. I had the al pastor burrito, supreme, with red sauce. The burrito was ok, but my big complaint was how dry the burrito was. There was an incredible amount of rice, leading to an off tilt Rice to Meat ratio. Additionally, the pork, which is normally a pretty moist meat in burritos, was dry to the level of dog food. It was grisly, had very little flavor and the incredibly dry texture left a lot to be desired. Even for a restaurant on wheels, I expect more than what I got at this trip to el Norteno. I hope others have enjoyed a better experience.|12|96|2|Routine| Wiping cloths not clean or properly stored or inadequate sanitizer  [ date violation corrected: 1/12/2013 ] Improper storage use or identification of toxic substances  [ date violation corrected: 1/12/2013 ]
El Norteno Taco Truck 10|4.0|Food Stands in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|125|10|4.0| This truck has the best burrito I've had yet. Sure it's a little 'pricey' for a truck. But what you're paying for is the consistency and the quality of this delicious food. Just one of these burritos is like two meals. Cut it in half and save it for later. My point is, if you want to complain about the price, don't go out at all! Pack your lunch! Everything around SOMA is likely to be $+. This truck is better than most of those places anyway. I'm super serial. P. S. Best breakfast burrito you've ever had in your life son! They charged me $ for a pinto and rice burrito.  Dry as hell.  NO! This is my favorite taco truck ever; we go there at least once a week and can't resist the camarones sandwich which they smother in some kind of amazing crack sauce. They've also got tripe, tongue, brain and some other specialties but I can only vouch for the shrimp. It's a little pricey but the portions are big. They're friendly, fast, and have a good selection of imported drinks too. A tasty haven from Jury Duty!  I sat through a long but interesting jury selection process during which I almost exclusively thought about where I would eat for lunch.  Enter El Norteno with its tasty burritos for all!  I had the shrimp (camarones) burrito which was excellent, one of the better shrimp burritos that I've had in the city. . . tasty fire grilled shrimp, excellent sauce, and a pretty decent sized burrito.  It was a bit pricey for a taco truck ($!) but I guess that's what the $ daily juror pay is for. . . I have been frequenting this place about once a week for a year, so it's a travesty that I haven't raved about it yet. It's the place to go if you want a standard taco truck taco or burrito, or a ginormous torta (the small is the size of my head). The gentleman who takes your order is super friendly, and the food is consistent, without fail.

El Norteno Taco Truck 11|4.0|Food Stands in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|125|11|4.16161616162|" Dang, I knew I should have ordered more prudently. Wifey and I had bought some KGB deals and finally were able to make their very limited hours since we do not live or work that close to the trucks. It is a shame because we are often in the area of the trucks at night, but they are not open. Anyhow, we ordered somewhat redundantly, which might have screwed us. By virtue of that, what is truly a .  star review gets the benefit of the doubt as a  star review. Also keep in mind that I just got back from San Diego and ate nothing but Mexican food while there, so my standards are very inflated since they have the best style Mx food in the US there. Wifey got the carnitas quesadilla and a buche taco for $. ! and I had the buche burrito (all meat AKA SD style for $. ) and the carnitas taco ($). The burrito was a reasonable size, but still much smaller than the ones I was getting in SD last week for $, but I digress. I'll start with the good. The carnitas were actually pretty good. They were mostly very soft, not that deep fried crap that they try to pass off as carnitas in places like, oh say, Texas. They had a decent smokey flavor and a little bit of crispness on the outside from the roasting. I liked them overall in the taco. The quesadilla, however, just didn't come together. I did not like the cheese that they used, not sure what type it was, but it did not really melt all that well. That being said, I think I prefer cheddar and colby blends of cheese over authentic Mexican cheese in my quesadillas, so they shouldn't lose points for my lack of authenticity. The tortillas that they used, however, were not very good, as is the case with most places that I have been up here. Very rubbery and they do not have the nice flower y powder on them that always gets on your hands from really good flower tortillas. The major issue here was the buche. It was terrible. I have never had buche that was this bad, or even bad at all, so I am clearly not a very critical customer when it comes to my organ meats. This version was completely bland, absolutely no flavor, and was so chewy that it was almost inedible. I have never been to a place that had good carnitas and bad buche because I think they usually get cooked similarly and come out with a similar smokey flavor. This was not the case and it was horrible. Why didn't I get the pollo asado burrito like I planned and just a buche taco? I mean, really, who orders buche from a truck where they have never eaten before? A guy who gets really excited about eating the stomach of a cow, that's who. Anyway, I can't complain about the price because we had our / off coupons, but otherwise I would complain quite a bit! Unfortunately, we will not be able to give them another shot because of the price, the inconvenience of the location and hours, and the fact that we would rather have the option of sitting inside and enjoying our food rather than waiting until we get home or eating at picnic tables in a grimey side street. BTW, I did not ding them for the fellow we passed who was shooting up into his leg in broad daylight on our way back to our car with our food. This place can't be beat. . the taco's are cheap and of very high quality. . the al pastor and camerones are the best I have found in the city so far. i love the pickled chili's and caqrrot that comes on the tacos too!  I've had the super burrito here a few times and it never disappoints, especially the carnitas. . so juicy and flavorful.

You gotta do what you gotta do and serve the city you live in.  So happy to do my part (actually not but whatever).  Stopped by here during one of the breaks and got a carne asada burrito.  Food isn't bad for a ""non gourmet"" food truck and they make your food very fast so you can get back to the courtroom and scarf down a meal during the break. I was starving and was tired of all of the other options, so it's a good change of pace.  Had to slam a diet coke to ensure I stayed awake though. Simple and perfect that is all you need when describing an authentic taco truck.  Carnitas and Pastor are stellar although everything is fresh and a total bargain compared to some of their competitors. I have also been fortunate enough to have used them for catering and they are even better at your house than they are at th and Bryant!!Love these folks, a great family operation!  A++ Friendly staff. I do not catch them at off the grid, just because its too busy and they are by my work M F, no wait and take phone orders. Different staff for the last few years since I've worked nearby for almost  years. I've tried the other meats and so far I love this place for their Super Tacos Carnitas which they always serve with beans and rice to the side. I just don't get it.  Everyone raves about this truck.  I ate there a year ago and it was forgetful.  Then all these people start telling me how ""this is the one"".  The best taco truck in San Francisco.  Ah, yeah. . . NOT.  I want there again last week.  Just so so.  I think this is an example of hipsters believing hipsters and not really judging for themselves. * CASH ONLY *I came in search of the Chivo (goat) taco (# in sF Foodie's top  things to eat in SF blogs. sfweekly. com/foodi…) and was told didn't have it today. Got the fall back  al pastor &  lengua, no cilantro. $.  each. They came with salsa verde, some onions, a sliver of pickled jalapeno, lime wedge, and a bit of cilantro on two of the tacos (yelp. com/biz_photos/Zgn…) The meats were tender and flavorful, especially the lengua and the salsa verde had a nice kick. I had two issues: Tortillas needed more time on the grill. By the time I got to my car (/ block), the tortillas were soggy and starting to fall apart.  Inconsistent amount of meat. The tacos on the left and top of my picture had a good amount that lasted through the life of the taco, but the ones on the bottom & right had about a bite of meat for the whole taco.  stars for flavor. loses a star for execution I really like their steak taco's. When i was working for Prisoner Legal Services, I use to walk to this Taco Truck when i was in need of a quick bite. Delicious delicious tacos! Yes. . . it's heart attack food but their Chorizos and carne asada are just delicious. It really tickled my tongue since I am such a fan of Mexican food. I caught up with these guys at off the grid. I made my typical order skeptical as to what I would get:Al Pastor burrito, no rice, pinto beans and hot sauceWhat did I get? A monstrous meat burrito with a little bit of pinto beans, and great hot sauce. San Francisco Mexican is notorious for filling their burritos with % rice and beans because they are either cheap or rent is expensive. Not this family owned and operated truck In addition the Al Pastor was amazing! I really like their tortas. I went for the Chorizo torta. I usually judge how good a burrito or taco place is based on their chorizo meat.  Their service was fast and friendly. Their tortas come in two sizes, large and extremely large. The torta I had was warm and toasted. They did not skimp on the toppings. It was fresh, flavorful, and filling. You can add eggs to your chorizo meat in case you feel like having breakfast at  pm. The chorizo meat was delicious. It was finely grounded, not chewy, very moist, and oozing with the famous red dye no.  color oil that all good chorizo meat have. Conveniently located next to the jail at  Bryant.  Hence, if you work at or near  Bryant, or you expect to go to jail, or you  have been bailed out of jail, or possibility acquitted, you should try this place out, instead of the MacDonald's.  El Norteno Taco Truck also participates in the San Francisco Off the Grid roaming mobile food extravaganza on Saturdays (midday) at the end of McCoppin street. I've tried many Mexican places in SF, and I must say, this is my favorite. It's priced fairly, the food quality is great and authentic, and their health inspection card score is . Try the el pastor, it's the best. Frankly, this is probably the best Mexican food I've had in SF. I tried their new ""Take it or leave it"" burrito. It had hot links, beef, seasoned rice, and habanero and no beans. It was one of the best burritos I had in a long while. It was just the right size and packed a good amount of heat. I didn't feel comfortable eating food made in a truck, but based on all the good reviews I decided to try it. I am glad I did. They have one of the best burritos I have ever had and at a good price.  It seems clean, they are friendly, and pretty fast. I love this place. I have eaten here for almost  years, and they have never let me down. I've tried everything from a taco to a torta and it's all delicious. I've become quite a fan of their carnitas and al pastor, and that's not the only yummy foods available. Even three tacos i consider a good filling meal because they put so many different things to make it delicious from hot sauce, rice, cream, you name it they have it fresh and satisfying!They're usually on th and bryant but you can also find them throughout many corners of the city like off the grid on the upper haight and many more to come. I'd highly recommend them for caterings for any sort of gathering. Authentic Mexican food at it's finest. I've never been to a taco truck that served breakfast burritos with more than just eggs, meat and maybe some salsa. I guess that's how ""gourmet"" trucks are doing it to surplus filler. I'm making a safe inference that the folks running this truck were of Latino descent, I know they don't eat guacamole with their damn chorizo and egg burritos, so why are you offering me that shit?!The burrito was lackluster. Nothing shined, there were about  papa cubes in it, a little bit of salsa and a TON of rice. And there were beans, which were also a shock. I asked for papas in my burrito, that's potatoes for you gringos, because I didn't know there would be rice in it. I suppose those who get the guacamole, crema, beans, rice, chorizo, eggs, salsa  and the fucking anchor hanging off the Queen Mary  don't notice a flavor lack because there's so many ingredients going on. But, that's not how I role, folks. And the next morning, I made me lad a real chorizo, egg and papa breakfast and he saw the light. And it didn't cost $ either. The family that owns the El Norteno Taco Truck also run a catering company called El Norteno Catering Service.  The catering company provided the incredible food for my office Christmas party.  The food, set up and service was fantastic.  I will be using El Norteno Catering again. they're so nice. . .  FREE burrito & soda and the burrito was good! i got the chicken and it was not a bit dry. . Merry Christmas to the taco truck! ;) Love the Tacos and best Cheese Quesdilla. . . . . keep up the good fight. . . . . randomly found this taco truck walking on the way to SO. . . i tried  tacos:  chicken, al pastor, carne asada, and carnitas. . . it comes with fresh lime wedges, jalepenos, sliced radishes, and extra salsa if you ask for it. . . yelp. com/user_local_phot…yelp. com/biz_photos/Zgn…yelp. com/biz_photos/Zgn…yelp. com/biz_photos/Zgn…the tacos were decent. . . i wouldn't come out of my way just for the tacos. . . but. . . i would for the eye candy. . . i'm not that desperate. . . well, maybe a little ; ) So I was reading reviews for this on my way to Off The Grid in Upper Haight. There were some great, some okay, and some eh wasn't that great causing me to look forward to it. I was trying really hard not to get my hopes up, but looking forward to it nonetheless. I asked my friend to order (because he speaks Spanish and it's just easier that way) two carne asada super tacos. He got a carne asada super burrito. We both bit into this & looked at each other & said, ""WHAT THE HECK. THIS CAME FROM A FREAKING TRUCK?"" Maybe I'm just a naive taco truck noob (seeing as this was my first time), but this was probably the one of the (if not THE) best taco/burrito I've ever tasted. We both shared our goods & agreed it was pretty dang awesome. My friend absolutely found it amazing, and he was born & raised on this stuff so I trust him %! As said before, the super tacos are $ & something cents for the first one, then $ for everyone after. $ for a super burrito, which is a little expensive for a taco truck. . . so I've heard. . . BUT IT'S WELL WORTH IT. I promise you!Can't wait to hit this place up again! It's amazing! I have eaten at every taco truck from stockton to modesto to every inch of oakland and frisco, this is by far the best truck in cali.   The food is always fresh and flavorful, the carnitas super burrito is the best score. .  And the taco's never go wrong.   Im not sure what soured the bad reviewers day , It doesnt get much beter than this! Mm. . . those nachos were SCREAMIN'  and so was I after eating those super hot jalapenos!  It was all worth it ; ). Still the best lengua tacos ever! Recently tried another truck.  The poor lengua's flavor had been boiled out of it. I reminded my GF that I though El Norteno had the best lengua taco. Last week they came back to McCoppin Hub, so were there just after they opened for business. Proved my point. She agreed. El Norteno has the best lengua taco we've tasted thus far in SF! We both walked back home with our smiles on! after waiting in line at traffic court in the Hall of Justice with the lowest forms of human criminal life, i go back to my car to go to work. whoa! there is a taco truck here!  and after the first bite of my carnitas soft taco, i knew that this was the real deal holyfield! after beto the stylish young man inside the taco truck saw me photographing my carnitas soft taco, he knew that i was a yelper. hahaha. the good news is that this taco truck also parks at a gourmet food truck called ""off the grid"" at  different parts of town  upper haight THURS pm dusk, the Fort Mason center FRI pm pm, and civic center plaza on FRI am :.  tinyurl. com/woothis taco truck is worth it! Burrito was OK but price was too high. Not worth it. Go elsewhere. I tried the Al Pastor as suggested. I asked them to grill it and for no rice. . . pretty god. Everything in this neighborhood is overpriced. So i guess a forgettable regular carne asada burrtio for $.   no chips or salsa is to be expected. I suppose based on reviews the thing to do is tacos al pastor, I MIGHT try once more, but the more I try the more I realize you cannot get a decent burrito in SOMA. These tacos are made much in the same way that they are in Mexico City.  That being said, their tacos al pastor, while good, were no match for real Mexican street food in Mexico.  Real al pastor is roasted on and carved from a spit like a gyro.  I do like the traditional style though.  .  out of  stars. Scored!  I stopped by here for a quick lunch with some coworkers and really enjoyed my meal.  The prices aren't posted, so you have to ask.  Tacos are $.  each and they have quite a good variety of meats to choose from.  I decided on the super taco for $. , $ each for every taco after.  I had the pastor and chorizo, which was piled on with generous amounts of guacamole, sour cream, and cheese, and then topped off with jalapenos and radishes.  It also came with a side of rice and beans.  Their green and red hot sauces had lots of flavor.  Overall, it was a delicious, filling, & cheap meal!  I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in the area. Popped by for lunch with my coworkers today.  $.  Al Pastor Tacos.  YUM!! Plus I added guac & sour cream to both my tacos. WHERE was this effing truck at :pm today?  Where?  Not where it usually sits in the parking lot.  It wasn't there when I needed it.  When I needed a small, snacky, non chip type snack.  I WAS ALL ALONE!But usually, it has some terrific tacos for a lovely decent price.  They are $.  each and have loads of stuff in them.   will fill you up for under $.  The quesadilla smells delicious too.  And they have the pickled jalapenos that I always forget to add.  BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE WHEN I NEEDED MY PRE GYM SNACK.  I hate you taco truck. Yay! They are yummy, cheap, clean, and those boys running the show are hot. makes for great tacos. Thanks  El Norteno!  stars!This taco truck s media. px. yelpcdn. com… parked on the corner of Smart Parking lot next to the  Star Parking lot, is often my first stop when doing jury duty service at the Hall of Justice on Bryant street. s media. px. yelpcdn. com… Now less often, since the latest surge of registered voters has reduced the chances of getting called for jury service (normally once every  months). On my latest visit earlier this year, i got some carnitas and lengua tacos ($.  each). s media. px. yelpcdn. com… The extensive menu also includes burritos, quesadillas, tortas (sandwiches), nachos, and rice plates, everything priced under $. The owner is super friendly and helpful. CASH only. Hours: M F am pm Got a few carna asada tacos today that meet my expectations. And included pickled carrots and radish without asking. Delicious and a good price. Plus the dude taking my order was nice. When I was a carnivore, I came here for the best Chorizo tacos in the world. Now that I'm a vegetarian, I come here for the best black bean tacos in the world! Seriously, you don't get better than this out of a taco truck! It's a weekly ritual for my group of friends. So today at work, a poem is passed to me:""n  I went to the burrito truckand I got a super carnitas burritoit isthe greatest burrito of my life fact. ""A poem like that is a call to action. I walked over immediately and can confirm that today was Burrito Star Alignment Day at the El Norteno taco truck. The carnitas was blackened on the edges and the tortilla was grilled. There was no salsa but burritos this good do not need salsa! Salsa here would only get in the way. Every taste complemented every other taste, to form a perfectly interlocking, ultimate burrito flavor profile. Yes I have eaten at every burrito place in this damn town. We have a winner. This place is so popular with my coworkers, that when we moved our old office into a new neighborhood, we named one of our new conference rooms after this.  Seriously. This is easily my favorite taco truck in the city.  I always get the Burrito Supreme.  Nom.  It can be a tad pricey in my opinion for truck food, but since its so good, and so big, I always shell out. There is no parking in this area of the city, so when we take a field trip from work to the old hood its always a bitch.  But once we take a bite or bring back our bounty to the office and eat it in front of others jealous we went with out them, its worth it. $ for a mediocre super al pastor burrito +  jarritos, no chips, no salsa?  I guess it's ok if you're just in it to rip off the local bail bondsman  they seem to be the only authentic mexican within quite a few blocks  but I really wanted more for my money. The al pastor itself was decent and the tortilla was grilled, but I think maybe they had it pre made and were just keeping it warm.  Not sure, but there was a real dryness to the burrito that made me suspect that. I had high expectations because it's a .  stars. I had  carnitas tacos with hot salsa.  What I usually get at a taco truck.  It was definitely tasty, but the carnitas was a bit dry (dryer than I'm used to).  The tortillas were good, and the salsa was decent. They were very fast and no wait for the line. One of the people I went with had a hair in their burrito.  A long one. Maybe I'll give the Al Pastor a shot if I go again. OVERALL: . FOOD: . SERVICE: AMBIANCE: n/aVALUE: . Round  of SFMOMA . . . went for an Al Pastor Quesadilla based purely on Yelps.  Gimongous grilled, flaky tortilla stuffed with melted cheese & pork, avocados, pico & sour cream on the side.  Never had al pastor anything, and am now a convert. . . spicy chile mix w/cumin (?) and something deliciously reminiscent of Middle Eastern shawerma meets Chinese CharSiu pork. . . . I know, right?As I was contemplating my last wedge of porky cheese heaven, I got a major case of taco envy watching the people around me scarf down their carnitas, but there was no way anything else was fitting down the hatch. Great first taco truck experience! I guess i should have tried the tacos, but I'm a huge egg and chorizo burrito fan, so I tried theirs. There was way too much rice and beans in it. I could barely taste the eggs or chorizo and it costs $. . Yes, I shouldn't judge the entire menu by this experience, but they missed the mark so badly, that's all the chance they'll get from me. Besides, it's a truck, $. ?? And that's for a regular, not a grande!  There are too many food carts struggling to get my hard earned dineros for me to make that trek again. These taco are addictive! Let me begin by saying I just moved from back east and never ate these type of soft taco's. I went to  other taco places then to El Norteno. . . I struck gold. The other places were double or triple the price and not as flavorful. . The staff was extremely pleasant. I had  the chicken, beef, and chorizo . I am looking forward to Monday to go back!! whats a nice warm hug after getting slapped around at ?a couple of tacos at el norteno. . . . just wished they grilled them toritillas a bit longer Please stop honking that god AWFUL mexican tune right outside my window every Saturday morning around FOUR A. M,, it's driving me insane. Perfect!Only a buck fifty per taco, and totally delicious. They're the traditional small taco, with two five inch tortillas and a heap of filling. I had pretty tame meats (chicken, beef, lamb), but they also have brains, stomach, tripe, and more for the adventurous eaters. And the service was quite nice, too a friendly guy who's apparently lived in SF for  years, and owned the taco truck for half of that. Outstanding. Worth a special trip I read through the reviews here, and decided to have a selection of tacos rather than a burrito for my first visit. I got to the truck at noon on a Tuesday, anticipating at least a ten minute wait, but there was only one other person near the truck and he had already ordered. I was planning on getting a carne asada, carnitas, lengua and fish taco, but apparently they don't have fish tacos, so I got an al pastor instead. Grand total of six dollars. In less than five minutes, I had my order bagged up and ready to go, so I hustled back to the office and found a spot to eat. My first impression upon opening the box was that there was not that much meat. Also, they only include  lime wedge and  napkin, which for an order of four tacos is not enough. However, they do include a few slices of carrot, radishes and jalapeno. The tacos come with chopped cilantro, chopped onions, and a green salsa that is definitely legit spicy. My favorite of the tacos had to be the al pastor, as the meat was perfectly spiced, tender, juicy, flavorful and cooked just right. The carne asada was solid, but not amazing; it was tender, but it lacked flavor. The carnitas falls into the same category, cooked well but just not that flavorful. And to round out the taco feast, I had my first experience with lengua, and I found it similar to the carne asada except much softer (imagine a cow's tongue. . . yep). All in all, I was a tiny bit disappointed. I was hoping to fall in love, but I did not. If I could give this place .  stars, I would. Their burritos are awesome and huge.  Way better than the ones from the tonayense in my opinion, but they are a bit different in flavors. Yes it's cheap and they seem to only be around during the weekdays from the lunch/afternoon hours. How in the world did you get That into a burrito?  Bleh. .  Don't go to this place.  I ordered a burrito from this place a while ago.  I was thinking: for  bucks this burrito better be pretty good.   It wasn't.  I mean it was alright.  It was lukewarm, sorta like you would expect a burrito to be after sitting there on the shelf of a taco truck. not only that, but while I was eating, I found a small pebble/rock in the burrito.  It was rough, and probably slightly smaller than the size of a marble.  My question is, how in the world do you get something like that into a burrito?  Maybe I don't really want to know the answer to that. Let's start off by saying I don't eat at taco trucks. Or Korean bbq trucks. Or any type of trucks.  So of course, on a rare afternoon around lunchtime where my husband and I are both free, he decides to take me to ""one of his favorite hidden gems""  and voila, the Taco Truck across from the Hall of Justice.  I am skeptical, but my love for burritos won.  After my husband rattles off his four tacos order like a regular, I nudge him and he orders me a carne asada burrito.  Fifteen minutes later, alone in the parking lot of Bed Bath and Beyond (don't ask), I eat the burrito.  Delicious.   Perfectly cooked to order carne asada, non soggy beans, fluffy rice.  I am the biggest fan of what I call dry burritos (no creepy sauce on top to make the burrito all soggy).  My only regret was that I forgot to order cheese and guacamole.  Plus the fact that, for a regular burrito, it was pretty damn huge.  In hindsight, best not eaten ghetto style in the parking lot of Bed Bath and Beyond. He now wants me to try the Korean BBQ truck.  We'll see. Breakfast burrito  real good. my only issue is $.  for one? The guy was real nice and the burrito came with egg, chorizo, beans, rice, guac, salsa. basically the kitchen sink but. . . . . . $. ? Maybe more like $. I'd go no beans and rice if i had to do it over. Get the lengua. I know, I was a little turned off by the idea of eating tongue. Never again will I doubt how amazing tongue is when it's prepared properly, as they do here. It is so tender I don't know what to do about it. Foodgasm at first bite. The lengua is definitely the best thing I have tried here. I like the carne asada burrito as well, but the lengua! Why aren't you eating here already? this is a good one if you're in the area, the asada is good, carnitas solid, the chivo (which is goat and not lamb, as folks here have been writing) is nice and best eaten on a taco, the chorizo and pastor style pork are also tasty.  i've tried almost all of it and my favorite here is the gallina taco. Lamb burrito was bursting with flavor and somehow managed to be even better than the carnitas one. I'd bump the rating up but .  stars isn't possible. I only leave the last half star off because of the pricing. El Norteno raises their four star lunch game to five for breakfast. I was starved. Late of dancing. Ravenous stomach. Needed food. Saw the truck, hoped that they were still serving breakfast. Affirmative. The guy staffing the truck told me, his newest amigo, I could have whatever I wanted. What about an egg whites, shrimp, black beans and mild sauce taco? Done. A few minutes later hunger was satisfied. Heart and soul replenished by the combo of Cosmic Gate and breakfast taco euphoria. My favorite carnitas tacos. The carnitas tacos were excellent.   Yay!   I'm looking forward to trying other things. ohh taco truck of nom nom nom LOVE. . . I would eat you every day but that would result in me getting as big as a taco truck (not good!). Try the carnitas super tacos, they are delish! Holy carne asada, the tacos at this place are muy bueno! The carne asada steak is cooked to perfection  packed with juicy flavor, tasty seasoning, and generously heaped upon delectable corn tortillas. What's great is that the tacos here taste fresher and far less greasy than those I've had at other taco carts. And at only $.  a piece, three of these bad boys is enough to make a satisfying meal that your wallet can enjoy, too! Each taco is topped with salsa, a couple additional veggies, and not much else, but I have no qualms with that.  I still think the tacos here rival some of the best I've had in SOMA""s friendly neighborhood to the southwest. The same cannot be said for the chicken tacos, my only . They were pretty good, yes, but certainly not spectacular. I thought the chicken was a little dry and didn't have much flavor. Next time I will be sure to order  carne asada tacos instead. Next time I visit this taco truck again (and bring with me a bigger appetite) I will definitely need to try the tortas, which I heard are huge and incredibly tasty. My favorite taco truck in SF if I am in the mood for being naughty (for eating high caloried food). Definitely the best carnitas.  I usually get just one torta with carnitas, which is very big and puts me in a serious food coma afterwards. Delicious and cheap tacos! This place (or rather truck) gets pretty hopping during lunch time for the Hall of Justice folks. I usually order   tacos, each with a different main ingredient. I love the carnitas and fish. Although their tacos are super awesome, I can't say the same thing about their burrito. I thought they were on the dry side. But if you like that, then it can definitely fill you up AND give you a super comfortable food coma afterwards, because the burrito is pretty hefty. Their pricing on the menu is hard to see, even when you are up close. I speculate it's just worn out from the years, but the owners should definitely make it clearer. Highly recommended this taco truck! I'm giving this  start because you can't bet better mexican food anywhere in the neighborhood. After reading the last dozen reviews, I'm shocked that no one has mentioned the gi normous tortas! Try a super torta with whatever meat you fancy  i  like it al pastor and with chivo when they have it. . . they use like a whole loaf of bread, and hollow it out to make room for the filling! You won't eat dinner if you finish one of these for lunch. And yes the tacos are also bomb here. . they serve them with some radishes and odd pickled vegetable if I remember correctly. So after you get that ticket dismissed, or even if you don't, just remember you're still free. . . . and go celebrate at el Norteño taco truck. I've only eaten here once so far, so take this as a preview or an underinformed comment. I was overwhelmed by the number of options on the menu, but decided to try a torta, which is a typical choice for me for a working lunch.  I asked the truck staffer what he thought of the camarones, and he countersuggested the lamb. I went with his suggestion and was not at all disappointed. The lamb was textured cooked to a point where it came apart readily but still had significant texture.  It was hard for my untutorted palate to pick out the flavors, espeiclaly writing this weeks later, but the lamb had obviously been marinated beforehand.  The torta was packed with peppers though, so I'm not sure what elements of the spicy, heady flavors were done ahead of time and what came with the assembling of the torta.  A lightest dash of sour cream rather than what i consider the traditional layer of soft mexican cheese rounded it out nicely with the usual vegetable mix of some lettuce and other sundries. Easily the best torta I've had in the bay area so far, but not at all cheap, it was around  dollars.  I'll be back anyway. I had a delicious carnitas quesadilla rectangular looking thing from here. Just right not too spicy but enough to have a tingle on my tongue for about  minutes afterward. I was craving something fresh like this and it was just what I wanted and for $ right around the corner from work that made it that much better. I was told that the burritos are even better so I'll have to have one of those next week. This is the best Mexican in SOMA that I've found, and I eat about  burritos a week.  My suggestion, the LENGUA.  Best I've had in San Francisco.  The carnitas are also top notch, and they are not stingy with the quantities.  Note this is not a cheap taco truck.  But it is the same price as all the other Mexican places near the hall of justice and so much tastier so it's a winner in my book.  One note though:  Don't waste your money on putting avocado in your burrito.  They really do skimp on that.  But for $.  an avocado portion, if you ask for double avocado you'll be pleasantly surprised. I usually come here with my boyfriend when he needs to come down this way. The tacos from this place are really good and spicy too! gosh i love tacos. . . =) all I can say for other's miserable experiences. . . . . EL PASTOR BURRITO SUPER. . . Can't get enough. . . . . .  bucks. . . . tastes somehow better than most taqurias that almost lost the spicy flavourful taste in their food. . . . maybe cause the taco truck doesn't  cater to their marina crowds. . . . like other places. . . keeping stuff vary blan in tasteThey have juicy good mex food. . . . A very auspicious first couple of bites faded into a bit of a flavorless burrito.  I don't really know how to explain except that while the meat (I had carne asada) was good, there wasn't enough of it.  And it wasn't particularly cheap, which for a taco truck was surprising. Extra points for the pickled veggies. Oh El Norteno man, thank you for re awakening my taste buds. El Norteno man, you have recently been consistently getting my order and change right, and I wonder if you were just testing me in the beginning until I became a regular. I feel so privileged, and so satisfied with the lamb supreme burrito you gave me in replacement of a chivo one! Then, as per my request, filled it with delicious tangy jalapeno peppers and gave me the really good hot sauce, the good stuff that makes you tear with its awesome mixture of vinegar, japalapeno seeds, carrots and celery. . . no more green or regular red hot sauce, the real stuff is in my hands!And, that lamb. . . ? No wonder it's so popular. You went out of your way to give me the last lamb burrito and I thank you for that! Stewed slow, soft and melting, savory and just a tinge of that yummy game flavor, paired so well with the fresh guac and peppers. And those portions. . . ? Amazing. And, for the $.  as it always is, it was so, so worth it. Big thanks for another awesome lunch. Heard about this taco truck from this magazine that came in the Guardian claiming they make a bomb Breakfast Burrito.  Since I work in the area I made my down towards the court houseNote:The Taco truck is hard to spot.  Harriet St is a small alley and if your not paying attention you could pass it. Food:I ordered the Potato, Bacon & Egg Burrito which came with whole pinto beans, rice, and fresh salsa.  Dang this burrito is huge! The flour tortilla was surprisingly tasty compared to most burrito shops. The lady before ordered some Carne Asada taco's that really looked good. I also heard the Carne Asada Quesadilla is off the hook.  I think I'll try that next. This a legit truck.  They proudly display the health code score which is .  I dropped  something for a burrito and Jarrito's soda.  A little pricey, but I will come back Very yummy! I love the breakfast burrito. It's large and tasty. I can't wait to taste other menu items. First of all. . . This ain't the roach coach. It gets perfect health inspection scores regularly. Check the SF gov site and the postings on their windows. Second of all. . . Pastor tacos. Carnitas burrito. Holy mierda. Muy effing awesomeo. This taco truck is so full of win I have a hard time expressing it. Killer, killer tripas tacos. Very nomlicious burritos. They could take the exact same items, open a fixed restaurant (to allay the suspicions of those afraid of roach coaches), and own that part of SOMA. OWN IT. THE BEST BURRITO I HAVE EVER HAD! Perfect balance of ingredients. Crispy carnitas. Ughughguhgughughug I came here to seek out the famous chivo (goat) burrito.  But as Wes M encountered, they were out.  It makes me wonder if they put these items on the menu for authenticity (brains, tripe) but don't carry them at lunch for all us gringos?So no chivo burrito, but the owner really lit up when I seemed disappointed and convinced me to get their pepper stewed pork special instead.  Okay, it didn't really take a lot of convincing.  I winced a little at the price ($.  instead of the $.  for a super burrito) and hoped I really really liked it and wasn't about to be ripped off.  Hanging around the truck, waiting for my meal, I came to the conclusion that they were happy to have someone order something other than a carne asada burrito and were therefore whipping up something good. After   minutes my food was ready to load up on my bike to take back to work. Well, for $.  I really got a meal.  A little bit of pinto beans, a little bit of rice, and a lot of pork.  Really tender on the bone pork.  Stewed in a really bright orange/red spicy sauce with green peppers.  I knew it was more than I should be eating for lunch (when you get older portion control becomes a huge thing) but couldn't help eating everything.  Also got a hot bundle of  thick corn tortillas.  Not sure what I was supposed to do, make a wrap?  But just tore them up and dipped them into the sauce like naan bread.  De lish. Will have to go back and try the chivo again.  Next time I'll call ahead of time. Haven't had that much taco truck experience, but their burrito was as good as (or even better than some of) restaurant made burritos. Their facility was clean and organized, and you could tell they were serious about the quality. I forgot to ask for salsa in my regular burrito but it was still tasty and filling. The carnitas was a little bit crunchy than I'd prefer. This was my old go to lunch spot when I worked at th and Brannan. They're on the pricey side, but worth it when considering the competition in the neighborhood. Also, I don't really know where else in the area you can get al pastor or chorizo. They also fry up the carnitas before putting it in your food (unlike Chavo's). Plus they have breakfast burritos. MmMmm thats a pretty damned good lengua super burrito. But at $ something, it's a little steep. . . but a closer walk than El Tonayense from work. They're a little stingy with their sauces. And somehow, when I order a lengua burrito, it means a chicken one. They're quick to fix your order though! Some pieces of their carnitas is a little tough, chorizo is pretty tasty but also has some crunchier pieces; both make for a pretty good taco. If you're looking for a good, quick bite, and you're in the area, do it. It'll fill you up and likely make you happy. Holy crap that's a good burrito. $.  for a carne asada super burrito and ml of Hecho en Mexico Coca Cola. Today was my first visit and I found them at Harriet and Brannan, not on Bryant like my fellow yelpers found. I guess they move around?I'll definitely be back again the next time I'm in the neighborhood. I've been an El Norteno fan since they used to be located at the turnaround at Henry Adams and th Sts.  When they moved, I panicked!  Then a friend hipped me to their new spot.  The parking isn't as easy as it used to be (I guess that's always the case, ain't it?), but I can't knock any stars off the rating, because the parking attendant at Bryant & Harriet is cool, especially if you buy him a soda.  The carne asada and pastor tacos are my fave.  Simple, satisfying, fresh, and no nonsense.  Best of all, they respect my love for their food; they don't even bat an eye when I ask for my usual SIX tacos.  I wash that down with nothing other than those super sweet Mexican bottles of CocaCola, and I'm in Heaven.  They've recently doubled up on the small corn tortillas for easy handling, but I still love them. Wow.  After a day long burrito tour of SF when my sister in law was visiting, I can confirm that they make one of the best, if not the best carnitas burrito in the city.  I thought it was much better quality and flavor  than the usual suspects in the Mission, with the bonus of such charming proprietors!I LOVE this place so much that I can't go on with the review. . .  Will let the  star rating speak for itself and fellow Yelpers describe the pure bliss after a meal here. . . M Breakfast Burrito. . . . . When I used to work on Townsend (employer need not be mentioned) My Old roomie and I would stop for breakfast there every couple of mornings and Oh god how I looked forward to those blissful moments. . . . . . The walk in the rain, the crackhead who just got out of jail that mornin or the plethora of greasy men grabbin crotch and makin kissy faces at me couldnt slow me down. Not only was it huge ( again I reference size does matter) but a taste explosion for my usually bland tastebuds. SInce I havent worked down there in three years I have been saddened many a time thinkin I could just jaunt down there and arrive at heaven. *SIGH* Ive been makin everyone around me crazy lately talking about it and I think I may just have to call in late to work one day Hell I might even get one for my pops and head back so as not to get into trouble. . . . . Yeah sounds good breakfast goodness here i come! There's a party in my mouth and this taco truck is invited. I have a big mouth. Recommendations: carne asada quesadillas, getting there before Noon or after  PM, letting the  health rating pacify your fears, remembering to breath between inhaling tasty Mexican food. Disrecommendations: fashion from . The  block of Bryant is not exactly the happiest place on earth.  In fact, I bet it's pretty close to the classic city image that those timid suburbanites always conjure up, from that bleak gray courthouse to the grimy industrial setting to the seedy looking Bail Bonds shops and the not so smiling faces of the passersby.  But El Norteno will put all that out of your mind. I have to say El Norteno is even better then El Tonayense, my last experience with a Taco Truck.  They're well known for their burritos de chivo (goat), but alas, they were all out when I came by, so I had to settle for a carnitas.  Still, it was a perfect burrito: gigantic, of course, with a flaky tortilla and plenty of sour cream to moisten the well proportioned (and well heated) meat, rice, and beans.  Amazingly, it didn't put me into a food coma either.  Truly, a must for any burrito fan, even if it's a bit off your beaten path.  I, for one, will be counting the days till I get my hands on that goat burrito. . . I used to work near here and it was recommended by a friend.  Here are some things I observed before I tried it:) It's parked across the street from the courthouse and police station every day, so a large number of their repeat customers are lawyers and police officers.  (AKA: extremely low chance of food poising!)) The good number of their repeat customers are brown skinned and speak mostly Spanish like my brethren down south. I tried it.  It was amazing.  I jones for their burritos, tacos, and tamales whenever I think of the place.  I've had everything from carne asada to their chivo (aka: goat).  Chivo is great in a taco, but a bit much in a burrito.  If you're feeling brave they stock very spicy jabanero peppers which they will happily Julienne and use to mine your burrito with if you request it.  If you're not into flaming hot chili bombs every other bite causing a natural opiate rush similar to one you would get after being thrown down a flight of concrete steps I recommend trying some on the side in a taco before having your burrito mined with them as they are not easy to pick out.  I personally enjoy that sort of food based pain/rush without the permanent damage or hospital bills. I also highly recommend getting sides of green sauce with your food, or red if you prefer.  Both are homemade and amazing. It's a bit inconvenient by car because there is no place to stop and park, and if you do you'll likely make one of the dozen or so police officers roaming the area leave you an expensive note about it on your windshield.  If you are on foot, like Mexican food and don't stop here, shame on you!By the way, an al pastor burrito with re fried beans and jabaneros is a great if not messy hangover cure.  Read my note above if you're not into flaming hot chilies. And yes, it is on Bryant, not Brannon. One final word:  I ate here every weekday for over a year and never got food poisoning. Don't be caught going to Luna this truck is right across the street.  If youre all guapo'ed out from victors head over here.  Norteno puts some hunky pieces of avocado in your burrito, and jalepenos.  I usually get carne asada super burritos, sin jalepenos, menos frijoles y mas aroz.  Hands down one of the best burritos in this area. When I went to find this li'l dude it was on Bryant, not Brannan.  Just FYI.  I took a page out of David P's book and got the  carnitas super tacos.  They were fantastic and filling and  bucks.  Pickled veggies is one of the things that gets overlooked so often in the taco world  either they don't have them or they're all slimy in a jar in the corner.  These were plopped right on top of my tacos,  carrots AND peppers, along with some radish slices and a lime wedge.  And the dudes are nice and cool and helpful, and the location is RIGHT by my new office, and I just wanna cry I'm so happy.  Next time I go I'll probably come back and change my review to  stars.  (I'm a hacker. ) yummy mexican food, especially the al pastor burrito, nachos, and tacos.  even the breakfast burrito is yummy.  why is it the best? it's juicy, right amount of sour cream, salsa, beans, and spice. In the mornings, going to work, as I make a right on brannan street, I get a craving of a burrito, and sometimes I make a detour to get one. This is the best taco truck I know of in the city.  Granted it's within walking distance from where I work, but it hasn't always been the closest, just the best.  The burritos here are excellent, full of flavor, never dry or suffering from cold sections. They toast the flour tortillas before rolling up the burrito, which makes a big difference than places which steam them.  The spicy salsa has a good kick. My favorite meats from this truck are the carnitas and the lengua.  Often, the carnitas meat is accompanied by a few bits of the crispy pork skin cracklings, which are oh so good in a burrito. The burrito size is also huge. Colleagues of mine has also enjoyed other items, including their tacos and the consumme soup. The truck also takes phone orders for pick up. This truck is always busy so their inventory obviously turns over a lot.  They serve police officers, sheriff deputies, prosecutors, and defense attorneys from the nearby Hall of Justice.  I have never had any problems eating the food from this truck.  They display a perfect  score from the health dept.  Despite another reviewer's claims, I have no hesitation recommending the food here in terms of safety and flavor. If you are in the area for lunch, run to the El Norteno taco truck immediately! I eat here a lot. The only thing that makes me sick is hearing you complain about this place. (bump:  stars!) No surprises here, and nothing that's going to blow your mind. Good carnitas & al pastor. Lately my favorite has been two 'super' tacos  for $ you get your choice of two tacos with with cheese, guac, sour cream, rice & beans, plus pickled carrots, jalapeno & radishes. And a lime wedge. A great lunch value! They also make hefty breakfast burritos for about $. One time I got the 'half' torta de camarones ($) and that thing was freaking awesome but about the size of a Gideon bible, way too much food. I pity the fool that tries to tackle the the 'full' ($). Last time around, they got a % from the health inspector:dph. sf. ca. us/eh/Violatio…But please note that if you want your food spicy, they will make it spicy. Usually the conversation goes:  I'll have a super carnitas burrito, spicy please.  You want that very spicy, right boss?I've only gotten ill once from eating at this place, and it was when I answered 'yes' to that question. There was nothing particularly wrong with it, mind you  I just couldn't handle it. Consider yourself warned. I can't drive past a taco truck and not stop to check it out. This one is by far the best in SF for carnitas.  I tried to get tacos on weekends a handful of times and the truck was not there. I've been going to this Taco Truck for years.  Excellent Al Pastor & Carne Asada.  Never gotten sick. Well thats not entirely true.  Its spicy and makes me sick all the time.  But never food poisoning sick.  Food poisoning makes you sick for  hours.   hours on the toilet is totally acceptable for a good burrito. Man up, previous reviewers. I also frequent said taco truck, and have *knock on wood* had better luck than the previous reviewer. I work a few blocks away, and tow a lunch train of about  people down here a few times a month. The food is cheap, greasy and substandard. . . . it's a TACO TRUCK! It's also authentic and delicious! And (here's the knock on wood part) none of us have had food poisoning from it yet! I won't vouch for the safety of the food so don't hold me to it, but I will say that the carne asada torta supreme hasn't done me wrong yet. Grab some carne, a half loaf of pan, guacamole, frijoles, un jarritos refresco y un chunk of curb for about $."|12|89|2|Routine| Moderate risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 9/16/2012 ] High risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 9/16/2012 ]

Angel Cafe 1|4.0|Coffee & Tea in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|184|1|4.09090909091|" My favorite vegetarian sandwich beyond a falafel can be found in this little, corner deli.  The balance of veggies and fresh mozzarella in the Heavenly Angel allows me to forget how healthy I'm eating  it just tastes that good.  Naturally, I also had to try the dolmas.  They don't look very appetizing and they taste as good as they look. We are on vacation, and were just looking for a savory snack in place of dinner and we wound up in the Angel Deli. The owner and his staff were exceptionally nice! The owner was simply genuine, in a way rarely seen  especially in  customer service.  The owner even slightly modified the ""format"" of one of his sandwiches so my friend could have a meat and cheese plate instead.  He took great care in making sure he made the orders just as we requested.  While we were in his shop  a customer of his who had moved out if town stopped by to say a quick hello as she was in the area and passing by.  I can see this is a place that people would gravitate to just for the service.  Wait  did I mention the food was fantastic!?! ""Great local coffee and bagel place for the morning caffeine fix""When I travel and when I'm at home, I like to find local coffee shops to support rather than always reverting to Starbucks. Although, Starbucks is sometimes the most convenient and only option. I was staying in the Hilton at Union Square and came across Angel Café. Since it was walking distance, it was worth checking out. Yes I do realize there is a Starbucks inside of the Hilton, and I do go there a couple of mornings when I was in a hurry. Be careful walking to Angel Café, bring a buddy, it definitely gets a little sketchy on your trek over there. I definitely wouldn't make the short journey at night, for safety purposes, but in the morning it was just fine. Angel café is very tiny where you order, only a couple of tables there, but there's a ""secret"" room/hangout area that you can reach from the back. They have a lot of bagel options, delicious espresso, mouth watering pastries, and sandwiches. The owners are very friendly and helpful. The bagels reminded me of being in Manhattan, they were fantastic! The coffee was also some of the best I had while I was in San Francisco. It's definitely worth the trip into Angel Café. Frist off when you walk into a cafe there shouldn't be a buzzer going off when you enter the place. That's just absurd. I walk in and the barista girl rudely asks if she can help me, basically ""what are you doing here?"" As I proceed to look around I ask her where the deserts are from, thinking they were prepared on location and she says, ""Italy. "" M FRESHLY DELIVERED FROM ITALY. Even with globalization tiramisu cannot be brought from Italy labeled as FRESH especially when being served in some random TL cafe. After I scoff at their weeks old deserts from across the world and order a coffee. As I sit down, I try looking around for the wifi password and some other bald barista guy tells me I can't use my computer where I'm sitting and I have to go to another seat. Really bro?? There's literally two other people in your cafe. This place is a joke. I love this place. Very clean and relaxing spot to get coffee and a light lunch. The owner here really takes care of the area near the cafe which also makes this corner a little bright spot here in the Lower Nob/Tenderloin area of Geary. I highly recommend this place. Plus they have free wi fi! Situation Sunday afternoon for lunch Ordered the Turkey Pesto Sandwich, Falafel, and Cheese CrispPros The people that work there are friendly The Turkey Pesto was decent They take credit cards The have a few tables outsideCons The Falafel and Cheese Crisp were bland $ credit card minimum Their bagels are the best! Super friendly owner chatted with me and even gave me a chai latte when I had already paid and wanted to add it to the order. Great fresh sandwiches. Almost makes up for the girl who was grabbed by a homeless guy on the tables outside and then her bf started a fight with him. Classy. Recommendation  take it to go or stay inside!! Feels like a genuine European Cafe, food and service are both authentic. This Deli is near my mom's house and she brought me here to have lunch.  The man was very nice and he had a lot of made from scratch food, such as hummus.  He carries a large amount of mouth watering desserts and he makes any kind of sandwich you can dream up, within reason of course.  You feel right at home and the food is great. Great corner cafe, I had the turkey pesto sandwich. . . huge fan of pesto and these guys got it good! Tastes like a splash of vinegar is in it. . . perfect.

Angel Cafe 2|4.0|Coffee & Tea in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|184|2|4.33333333333| Very friendly staff with a genuinely caring, sweet, and giving spirit. This is a neat spot to come have an evening chat if you happen to be in the TL. One of my favorite things about Angel cafe is their lounge area. In the left corner there is a small doorway that leads to a downstairs room with a unique atmosphere. The walls are lined with painted burlap sacs and they usually have a random movie from the s on that you probably forgot even existed very nostalgic. Their Chai Tea is very good which is important to me, so I will definitely be back! One of the best coffees in town. Great sandwiches. Awesome place. Angel, I love you! Delicious bites, the nicest and most wonderful people own this cafe. When I was thinking of moving to the Loin, I stumbled in here, drenched in rain and frustrated with the stressful search of apartment hunting. The moment I walked in, I was welcomed, warmed and fed. I go here nearly everyday now. Food is inexpensive and wonderful. Coffee is delicious! I love you Angel and I'll be sad if I ever move. I am just eating the best lox bagel on this planet ! Cheese bagel lox so good !! Also ordered a medium latte, very flavorful. I always go to Angel cafe, well whenever i have cash lol The  people who work there are super nice, smiling, make great food, smile at me, i mean come on what more can i ask for! Thanks guys, keep up the good work :) Fantastic service!  The wrap was very good.  The espresso was even better!  Took a canolli home and it was also delicious. I love this place! Super friendly and I'm in love with their Salmon Bagel!And don't miss their falafel wrap, it's also something that you will go back for. I go here to use their printer and they are always helpful. They were really nice when my friend and I walked in last week for coffee and some breakfast so we had high hopes.  The fresh squeezed oj hit the spot but the breakfast burritos were awful.  Potato and bacon were undercooked (seriously, the potatoes were still crunchy and the bacon was all flimsy light colored fat).  We each ate half of our burritos and then had to promptly leave because they had made us sick.  Probably wont stop here for any thing but coffee again. When my boyfriend happened across this unassuming corner cafe on a visit to San Francisco, we knew we'd found a gem. Not only are the hummus and veggie bagels delicious, but the family who runs this place is genuinely kind and friendly. Every time we're in the city, this is the first place we go for breakfast. Lovely place, friendly people. I had breakfast there x this week! Bagel sandwich is excellent, freshest bagels ever. Coffee is strong just the way I like it. Eat outside and people watch, it is fun.

Angel Cafe 3|4.0|Coffee & Tea in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|184|3|4.33333333333| I have only been living in the area that this fantastic little spot is located for a few months and already I am a regular customer here. The first time I visited I just needed a coffee because for some reason I am incapable of grocery shopping regularly. It was good not like specialty shop good but really tasty and did the trick. The reason I returned again was because I recalled how great all their pastries and other middle eastern foods looked in the big glass display cases they have surrounding the kitchen area. I wound up getting a bagel though because it wasn't quite lunchtime. This is where they really hooked me! Unlike a lot of cafes they really hook it up with the toppings which are always fresh (no sad brown sprouts here!) and flavorful. After discovering this delightful fact I have been working my way through their vegetarian sandwich selection even though I'm an omnivore! Also, besides the great food, the people who work here are some of the kindest folks on the block. They remembered me after my very first visit and wave even when I'm just walking to the bus, making every trip here just like visiting friends. Friends with delicious treats and drinks. This place is one of the more dependable and quality cafes in the area. The transformation they have made a few years back really has made them stand out on leav and Geary. The neat royal blue decor, sharp and clean, fit with an Internet cafe calmly situated in the back (sometimes with soccer or other sports on the tv). The family oriented, friendly staff have always been above and beyond friendly most of the time. The ladies making the sandwiches are hard workers and seem to be passionate and energetic. The owner. Pa and his wife are cordial and are regularly found working or buying local products in the area. The falafel sandwich is top notch. . giant perfectly crisped ground goodness with homemade tahini, hummus, and an oober fresh cucumber salad stuffing the warmed lavash bread (I like to add avocado). . with a traditional lebanese pre meal of dolma or the traditional spinach and cheese or cheese and parsley stuffed yum yums. Phat deviled eggs, quality coffee. . yes, minorly overpriced, a few numbers could be dropped a bit. . but overall this spot has served my senses well for years. do it Best. . . Falafel. . . EVER!!After my sad falafel experience at the more chain like Ayola, i almost felt like i had to find a better one. I've also have had a pregnant woman craving for Baklavah lol ^. ^ This is Sanfrancisco, shouldn't be that hard right?? I came across Angel Cafe. This bright blue corner cafe is really close to where i live. It's definetly family owned, clean, and everyone is so so sweet customer service spot on with added charm. It gets really busy at lunch and the place is alittle small to keep up with their hustling business. I wasn't the only one getting a Falafel wrap *which was promising* Someone infront of me was getting this sandwhich which was filled to the brim with meats and cheeses. It looked good if i ate that kind off stuff. The Falafel was perfect. Filled with vegetables i never expected. Zuccini, cherry tomatoes *you could tell they were locally grown*, thick chunks of cucumbers, onions, some homemade pickled vegetables, afew pieces of broccoli, grape leaves, fresh herbs, and some spicey peppers since i ordered it spicey. The yougurt sauce had good flavour. The hummus had a wonderful light earthyness to it. The wrap was soft, thin, and warm. It wasn't made with refined flour, and had an almost sweetness to it. The falafel itself was huge. I've never had falafels like this, it was not made with abunch of breadcrumbs. It was soft but had a slightly crunchy but not hard outerwhell. They were huge and filled throughout the whole wrap. It was wrapped tightly so everything was kept in place *which most wraps never are* so it was easier to eat, it was wrappy in parchment paper and then again in foil to keep it warm and in place. This is by far the best falafel i have literally ever fricken had. I have never had Baklavah that tasted this traditional either. It was good. The portion seemed small until i took it home and saw how thick it really was. Perfect portion. I paid $ even for a falafel wrap and piece of Baklavah. It seemed over priced to me until i went home and really looked at what i ordered. The falafel wrap was HUGE. I couldn't really finish it but i did just because it was that awesome. It essentially is the same price as Ayola, but the wrap its like /xs bigger. Plus Ayola is alot of bread and lettuce, Angels is little bread but tons of fresh local vegetables and huge falafels with just the right amount of sauces. The Baklavah was really good as well. The flavours was spot on. They have a pretty exclusive menu with alot of coffees, sandwiches, traditional greek foods with some pastries. I figured if i could not get traditional good greek food at a family owned/run traditional cafe, then there was no hope for good decent priced mediteranian in frisco this place did not disapoint. This place is AMAZING. Run with smiles and love. Everything is homemade and fresh. You can tell they are happy and love what they do. The area really isn't that bad. If you think this is in a bad area in SF u have no idea lol. The area is fine. Any area you can still text in without risk is not a bad area lol. So impressed, i look forward to coming here in the future to trying other things, however the Falafel is beyond perfect so it's hard  me  imagine getting something else.|5|94|2|Routine| Improper storage use or identification of toxic substances  [ date violation corrected: 9/26/2012 ] Moderate risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 9/26/2012 ]
Angel Cafe 4|4.0|Coffee & Tea in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|184|4|4.13970588235|" I love these guys!  It's my neighborhood cafe, and I go there every morning.  They're always friendly.  Their coffee and food selection are great!  Highly recommend checking them out. Great coffee and pastries.  Not the greatest neighborhood, but where else can you find authentic baklava than in a neighborhood you can get mugged in.  The owner of the place seems to take great pride in his little cafe.  It is impeccably clean and sparkly.  I wished I hadn't eaten before coming to this place, I would have love to sample more of his food.  Maybe for some other day. We liked the people working at the restaurant, but they completely messed up our order.  My girlfriend ordered the breakfast burrito with ham. They asked if she wanted jalepenos which she did not. She doesn't like food that's too hot. I ordered the breakfast burrito with sausage and jalepeno.  Guess what. They mixed up who got  the jalepeno. They also served the wrong burrito to the wrong person. We even asked which was which. Fortunately, the sausage wasn't too hot, so we basically swapped burritos. They both tasted good to me. Wonderful falafal & nice people. Not those overfried rocks you get some places, but moist yet crispy deliciousness with seeds on the outside! Pick up one sometime and you will be hooked. Because they are not overfried, they also reheat well in the microwave. They are very good but watch the old guy at the register.  He has a habit of overcharging.  He'll claim the added charge is tax but the tax on a $.  sandwich is not $. .  So ask for a receipt. A great neighborhood spot for coffee and pastries with consistently great service.  They also have a good selection of Mediterranean food. I just wanted to say thank you to the family who runs Angel Cafe. I was in here about three weeks ago for my Mandarin lesson with my teacher. I bought a pastry that had meat and onions in it. Unfortunately when I was moving my books and papers around, I dropped the / of the pastry that I had been eating. I shrugged it off but was happily surprised when the lady from behind the counter gave me a new one free of charge. This not only displays unexpected kindness but good business sense. If I'm in the Civic Center area again, I'll definitely go back for their tasty snacks/drinks! This is a great place to be, especially if you like desert.  My girlfriend and I really enjoy the ones made with limoncello.  Otherwise, it's a very clean, very reasonable bakery and deli. The TL is slowly but surely getting back on its feet with good cafe's.  One thing a cafe/coffee shop needs to be is OPEN EARLY!  Angel, usually is open by am, and the breakfast bagels are my favorite. Friendly staff, and the back downstairs is a great place to get some work done if you need some quiet or for that matter, privacy in the case of a meeting. I keep going back, and I will continue to go back. . Caprice sandwich is my fav at the moment. . and probably always will be! Cheesecake was not that great and they are cash only. Errand time called for a break. I needed sugar and caffeine fairly badly to cope with the day and various headaches. Yelp told me this little cafe was good and I should try it. I almost always listen to Yelp.   The last review said they make amazing sweets I figured I should test that theory. Language was a slight barrier between me and the woman working but she was very nice and seemed genuinely friendly. She made me a wonderful latte and I chose some sort of light, flakey pastry with a delicious cream filling. Sitting there I was in sugary heaven for about  minutes. The laid back atmosphere was just what I needed to decompress and balance out my glucose levels (I swear some days I push myself towards being a diabetic). I got the pesto/sprouts/tomato/turkey sandwich (on mini baguette), and it may be THE BEST SANDWICH I'VE EVER HAD.  And it was pretty cheap. Great service and food.  A great place to see all your peeps as well.  I love their tabouleh salad. I spilled part of my lovely espresso and the owner saw that i did this clutzy move and without even saying a word, he made me a fresh one.  What a sweet heart. The perfect place to escape from the rain or just from Geary St.  Grab yourself some Mediterranean fare, a sweet, an espresso and relax.  They have an Internet room in the back if you prefer to hide from the world for a bit. I cannot say enough great things about Angel Cafe.  I come here to work quite frequently and every time I go in I am treated as if I am a part of their family.  This place is ran by a Lithuanian family consisting of what I believe to be a dad, mom, son, and daughter. They are so nice, and they make a ridiculous amount of excellent Mediterranean food from scratch.  Try the falafel wrap, and ask for it extra toasted.  My friend says the veggie burger is incredible as well. They make a wide array of great coffee and tea drinks as well. If you come into Angel and are craving something sweet, well they make tons of sweets from scratch as well.  Pie, cake, cookies, parfaits, and basically every other dessert you could imagine. Their downstairs area is a beautiful atmosphere; dark, fun colored lights, burlap sacks covering the walls, random out of place decorations, and always more than enough seating. I could really go on and on about how much I enjoy this cafe, but I think you should  just give a try yourself.  Go there for an afternoon when you have a lot of work to do, and you will see how great of a place it is.  Grab a drink, order some of their great food, head downstairs, and watch your productivity increase %. ANGEL IS THE SHIT!seriously best cafe in town, and let me fucking tell you  reasons why. . The Family Angel is clearly a family run operation and that is awesome. Not  a bunch of punk ass hipsters scoffing at you behind their coke bottle glasses. The son who pretty much runs the show there is the shit; always in a good mood, willing to accomodate any need you may have. The pops, is the true boss though. Wandering around, meeting and greeting the patrons, treating you like one of his own, which can be somewhat awkward at times, but is nice and makes you feel welcome. The sister? who makes all the food, does so with care and consideration you aint gonna find anywhere else. . Internet at Angel its free, no janky need to pay to get a code bullshit like other places. They let you in and let you on the interwebs. nough said. . The atmosphere you want a place to chill out in the sun and relax, Angel has you covered. The outdoor sitting is relaxed and framed by white  fences, your on the seat but in your own space. This part of town is also warm and lacking the sometimes obnoxious SF gale force winds, so you can actually sit outside and not feel like a shcmuck with your hair blowing all over the place. AND if you wanna get some actual work done! Angel has you covered too. Their ""cave"" in the downstairs is the perfect work space. Dim lighting which can be booster in each section, if you personally require more light, and the cozy warm space is perfect for when you need to tuck in and get some shit finished. They even have news running on the T. V. so you can keep up with what the fuck is going on in your world, cause we all know you dont read the news !. THE FOOD. The food at Angel, is Angelic. They prepare pretty much every dish at this place by hand, you can see the mother in the back slaving away to make all the dishes with ingredients from scratch, I mean cmon! that is fucking epic. And if you want some upscale sweets, they got treats to treat. Mostly a mediterranean cuisine, which is bomb and healthy for you. No transfat in this place people. . Utilities. So I mentioned the internet, but did I also mention if your broke ass doesnt have your own PC you can use the ones they have there! Cheap access, and they have a printer, which is even wireless as well! Angel is on the cutting edge of tech, and they got an ATM, and take card as well, none of this cash only bull. If you havent been to Angel, do yourself a favor and go, its the perfect spot to work or kick it, and they will always server you with a smile. At Angel you get heavenly treatment. I love Angel! It's such a great place in my neighborhood! Wonderful coffee, food and friendly people. Always a smiling face. Very convenient and seems to be open til late. I think I ate an ossa here. Kind of a pastry filled with pork and rice. Super good. Lots of desert pastries as well. Coffee was tried on this day. Outside seating and a basement room that looked really cool. Super friendly and helpful staff. Neat little place. It's conveniently located right by the , L bus stop, I'd always stop by before getting on the bus to get a latte+a breakfast bagel. Their breakfast bagel is perfectly toasted, cheesy, and packed with fillings. It's really big, so I always save the other half for other. They also have the best sandwiches ever. Staff is really nice here, you go back the second time and they'll remember you. They have a nice collection of middle eastern foods, they make them fresh every morning. It's a nice place to sit on the tall chairs and people watch too. Great corner place, a lot of choices for such a small place. Great service and great tasting . This is the place to go if you live in the area and want to hang out and relax on a Sunday morning . Try their Latte. The lady that works there and makes the lattes is on it.  My tongue is never burned.  It is always the perfect temperature. Give this place a go! This place has saved my butt on several occasions. I somehow always find myself starving and slightly more buzzed than I'd like to be around : pm on Fridays. Luckily, I've been able to sneak in here last second and scarf down their tasty falafel goodness before returning to the delicious libations basically next door at Rye or down the street at Whiskey Thieves. While their falafel is tasty and, yeah I'll go there, somewhat life saving, I can't comment on any of their other food. Service is friendly enough. Atmosphere is slightly lacking and has an unspoken. . . hostility? or tension?. . . I can't quite place it. . . about it that made me want to eat and run. I went into the Angel Cafe yesterday.  Ordered the prosciutto and mozzarella panini.  IT WAS VERY GOOD!!  The bread was different and excellent!  They have an excellent assortment of items that look very well made.  I want to try the Grandmother cake . . .  looks like a lemon bar style pastry.  NO kidding this place is excellent.  And the prices are very very low. They were extremely nice and will be back repeatedly. I am truly disappointed because I asked if they had any VEGAN dishes and this guy gave me something with cheese. And when I paid he tried to skimp me my change.  Oh well I can't really complain lol. Good strong coffee and their baklava is to die for. No really, it's huge and like another reviewer suggester, you really should cut it in half and save half for later or share, but it's just too good to share. Their chocolate mousse cake it really good & rich. To top this off, the lady who works there is so sweet. Another gem in the TL =) Great Mocha, this is how i like mine: Creamy :) Very cool and calming place to use internet in the back, with the lovely smell of Middle eastern cooking and classical music i LOVE IT  and i will be back plus the folks are so very friendly I live a couple blocks away from Angel Cafe, have passed it a hundred times, and finally got the chance to give it a try tonight.  I am so glad I did.  My girlfriend and I shared the ozze, a piece of falafel, a piece of kebbeh, the hummus plate, and the chocolate raspberry cake for dessert.  Everything was amazingly delicious, and prepared beautifully. The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly, and I look forward to coming back again and again! DOLMA & BAKLAVAI love the DOLMAS at this place.  They are the best dolmas I have ever had.  Before eating Angel's dolmas, I thought all dolmas were the same and did not request nor crave them. Before Angel's dolmas, dolmas were just an item on a Mediterranean platter.  They are  cents!  Under a freaking dollar.  Ask them to warm it up. I think someone's mom  makes them.  Mom magic!The baklava here is so good.  I used to be addicted to them.   Lots of the baklava around the city found on the counters of markets are crap made in the midwest somewhere (seriously read the packages).  You can taste and smell the preservatives.  Ew.  This baklava is superfresh and huge.  You should (if you are not a pig) cut it in half and enjoy it twice.  I was told this baklava is different from most because its Lebanese. I like some of the bagels desserts too! Angel Cafe is a clean place in the area to get a healthy sandwich. They have falafel and vegetarian sandwiches, as well as pre made pastas and salads. They do have take out, which they wrap very well. I was very pleased with this easy solution to a healthy grab and go dinner, and happy to get off the seedy street! This place is located on a very busy street Geary & Leavenworth so, I am sure it takes in a good amount traffic during stores hours. They have a good selection of deserts to choose from. Now I am not against Costco I am ""Costaholic"", but thats another review. Some of the traditional pastries are from Costco namely the muffins. They plastic wrap the muffins, and charge a few dollar more than what it would cost for a tray at Costco. The other deserts are not from Costco, and are really good. I got a Napoleon which is a flaky pastry with creme layers. It held up well during transport home. I ended up getting  muffins,  Napoleon, and a Naked smoothie spending about  dollars. It's a good place for a quick desert! The pastrami on sourdough was pretty darn good here, nice clean cafe in the downtown area. Don't use the internet here. It doesn't work well and the owner won't be able to help you. He also won't refund your money. The hot chocolate is good, but I think my impression might have been tainted by the hot guy I was with. So, scratch that. Maybe the hot chocolate was just okay. We ate dinner across the street at the Asian restaurant (sorry can't remember what type of food right now). Anyhow, we originally came to city to go to the cheesecake factory but it was a long wait and I was like I can't believe they charge that much for cheesecake, haha. So we decided instead to eat at the Asian restaurant because it got good reviews on yelp and we were satisfied. I however still wanted cheesecake. Wouldn't you know it Angel Cafe was across the street and I said. . . . I wonder if they have cheesecake there?It was as if an Angel (pun) planned the day for us because, they did in fact have cheesecake!Not only that but it was the kind I wanted! A cheesecake that was firm, rich, and had powdered cocoa dusted all over it. Not too sweet and you felt like once slice satisfied you. I was really happy the day worked out like it did and ever since then when I'm in the city and if I'm in the area I want to stop by. I tend to be around the area more now that I know the cafe is here ;DI came by another time to make sure I didn't just imagine the cheesecake was good the first time I came and wouldn't you know it. . . The cheesecake was still good and the guys that helped us were just as cool and laid back as I remembered! Nice cafe. An outstanding five star grilled chicken and hummus sandwich in a very strong four star cafe. Let's talk about that sandwich:It's as if the super friendly lady making it took it as a personal challenge to load as much chicken and hummus between two slices of week as she possible could. Um, you succeeded. Epic goodness in each and every bite. I only wish there had been more bites. Sugar free vanilla Americano towards the end was good to too. I only wish I wasn't told I had to go downstairs to use the wifi. Downstairs wasn't bad, kind of charming actually with tables, relaxing music and another counter where no doubt brilliant food was being made. But I really wanted to sit by one of the windows on the ground floor. It was a sunny day. Chilling in a cafe is also about watching city life go by. Oh well. Breakfast looks good, as do all the house desserts. I'll be back, and there is a very strong chance four stars will get upgraded to five. They need to be more clear about their pricing. I bought a coffee. But, when I asked about a plug for my laptop, he added another  cents. I don't mind the money, but tell me in advance that there's a laptop surcharge. my official corner coffee shop. its pretty pricey. $.  for a small coffee. i think i got coffee and a breakfast bagel for like $. . . ouch. $ for small  coffee and tiramisu. . . double ouch. def not a balling on a budget type of place but very cute. Santacon stop #Johanna N. and I made a quick stop here between bar hopping because we both got really jolly early on in the day. Couldn't find any appetizing places around this block of Geary, so Angel Cafe was wearing a halo by default. It is a mom n pop establishment, and Pop took my order  caprice sandwich  while I oogled the dishes in the glass cases. Everything was Greek to me, even though most of the dishes seemed to be Italian/fusion. There's free wifi, but you have to sit in the back, which seemed kinda sketch. For my sandwich and a bag of chips, it came to $. . I'd try the place again, and when I do, I will be sure to be a little more coherent. It's important to replenish your body after strenuous activity, especially after a hard day of shopping and getting your makeup done! ;) I mean, it's not easy sitting in a chair getting fussed over and choosing a color palette! Black Plum or Sable? Sandy Biege or Medium Beige? My mind was racing and my stomach needed sustenance. I wanted something simple and quick. Thai? No, too fussy. Mexican always a good choice but already had that this week. Sandwiches were the obvious choice. I didn't want to walk my caked on face all the way up to Sutter from Geary to that sandwich shop so I prayed to the sandwich gods and when I opened my eyes I saw angels. . . er Angel Cafe. I actually heard fanfare. A no nonsense, no frills cafe perfect! The hot pastrami caught my eye but lettuce and tomato sounded like strange complements. No matter, I trusted the menu and didn't look back. Turns out there is a reason for the lettuce and tomato! The meat was scrumptious, but the jalapenos and mustard were what gave the sandwich some kick! The veggies also contributed nicely. Not bad for $! LOVE it! Went here several times during my trip to SF as it was located near my hostel. Angel is a nice little corner cafe with a super friendly owner and employees. They have absolutely delicious slices of cakes priced around $ $. I tried a chocolate raspberry mousse cake. Heaven. They also have a good selection of sandwiches, salads and mediterranean items (owner is Turkish or Lebanese). I had a falafel plate with hummus and tabouleh for lunch one day, it was $.   They have breakfast items too. Few tables inside and a few outside as well. With a halo. I was running a little early prior to meeting up with the Scapin group outing (apparently, walking does get me somewhere quick, unlike in the larger suburban areas) so I ducked into Angel Cafe, in addition to ducking from the impending rain showers. Fantastically cute and quaint corner cafe, right on the corner of Leavenworth and Geary.  Tall dark wooden stools and tables dominate the outer L shaped area while the warmly lit display shelves and coffee counter hold their rank against the other side.  Helpful and cheery staff (they know their regulars, right down from the senior locals to the men working across the street on repairs) and a great selection of desserts and baked goods.  I opted for black coffee (small) and a yummy sweet looking square of Baklava.  For the insane total of $. .  He gave me a discount on the sweet confection!Coffee is strong and bold, as it should be and paired with the Baklava, perfect to balance out the intense sweetness from the rose flavoured syrup and soaked sheets of phyllo. An older gentleman commented on my book and told me that it was uncommon for him to see someone reading Solzhenitsyn.  He nodded his approval when I showed him the cover. I miss this. I miss the random comments from total strangers who attempt to take their time in breaking the silence.  I appreciate hearing about their thoughts.  This one left a smile on my face. And set the tone for the rest of the day. Once my coffee cooled, I hurriedly gathered my belongings and ran back out into the slight showers. (See pics)I have walked by this place numerous times. Always wonder if it's just a coffee shop, until reading upon fellow Yelpers and know it's a full service Heavenly Angels with homemade pesto, hummus, mushrooms, tomatoes, sprouts and mozzarella was all chilled and great on a very warm day. They also do full serve coffees on different espresso drinks. The espresso shot iced coffee was excellent strong. An absolute pick me up from lunch. A big bonus point. It's hard to believe a Mediterranean style cafe has a full case of pastries, desserts like Tiramisu, AND a full fridge of imported Italian desserts such as Crema e pistachio, flute limoncello, coppa stracciatella, etc. They are so OMG deliciously fatty without the guilty nutrition label. I am already head over heels! All these to go(s) are in a full heavy glass. Beautiful and delicious. Super duper good Lebanese food amongst delicious dessert and pastries. Mmm. Family run and friendly. Friendly service, always with a smile. Yummy food and coffee. Cheap prices too! Gross breakfast burritos. Seriously tasted like low grade fast food. Decent coffee, really nice people and mildly clean. I'd go there for a bottle of juice and coffee to go only. Love this place! The staff is always friendly. Food is always great. The cave like decor downstairs is super funky. Definitely the best little cafe around the lower nob area!YOU HAVE TO TRY THE HOMEMADE DOLMAS. . . . . . AMAZING! I really want to like this place, because it sits on a nice spot a few steps from my apartment, with cozy seating around the perimeter of the cafe. But the couple of times I've tried it, the food is just terrible. I can't remember what I ordered the first time several months back, it was something sweet, like tiramisu. I remember it tasting old. I made a mental note not to go back. Well, last night, I've been craving for cheesecake, and I passed by this cafe from the gym. So I decided to give it another try. The cheesecake looked good, and so I bought one slice of NY cheesecake. Surprise, surprise. . . it tastes like it's been sitting there for days. Anyway, never going back. For $.  a slice, I want a fresh slice of cake. Best cafe in the Tender Nob hands down. Friendly people, family owned, clean place and awesome food. My favorite is the San Francisco Bagel (choice of bagel w/ cream cheese, tomato and BACON!) I always sub the tomato with sprouts. Perfect breakfast or lunch. Coffee is always hot and fresh. Prices are reasonable. Love this place. ps. gotta try the onion and spinach pie! Nice little cafe, eat here often.  The sandwiches are awesome and well priced.  I dinged 'em for a star since they're cash only, however. . . such a pain in the ass. Many days start here with a small coffee and a San Francisco bagel. Nice coffee shop with a good selection of sandwiches, i recommend breakfast burrito, very delicious. Another thing i like about this place is their pastries including cannoli, chocolate cakes and donuts. They also have some pre made food such as pastas and falafel, which might be a bit old but not that bad. Overall I think it's a good place for simple and quick bites with some quality. Had their yummy Napoleon cake and it was delish. Service is very friendly and seems family run.  One of the guys who worked there gave us free Coldstone ice cream cake (red velvet and strawberry ice cream) cause it was his brother's birthday! Needless to say, my boyfriend and I were very happy! this place is great. can't tell you how many times i've had a great sandwich here after awakening hungover on the weekend! for those of you who don't know this place. . . it's that outdoor cafe looking place that usually has some sketchy people sitting in the outdoors chairs while you're waiting for the  on geary & leav. trust me  the sketchy people are harmless, & the food is oh so good! This place is cool; it's really damn cool. I've seen this place for a while, walking past it while walking to work and what not and it never really looked like anything special. . . until I walked in. They have such excellent snacks! I should note that I don't drink coffee so I can't tell you how that it, but I can say some of their non coffee drinks are pretty damn good too. That explains all the people enjoying the sun outside of the place, what little sun SF offers anyway. It's a nice relaxing spot. The owner is cool; his daughter is cute; pretty girls drinking coffee all over the place. Let's not lie, that what counts right? Also, hot yummy food FTW. Be warned, it's cash only. There's an ATM inside, but it's one of those $.  use, sketchy looking TL jobs.  If you're like a lot of people that have a BofA cards, then you know that they'll naughty touch you for using ATM's that don't belong to them in the form of an additional free on top of the fee you already paid. Screw that! Walk with cash people and enjoy Angel Café. sitting here at angels while i write this.  found angel's while waiting for a car service.  what a cool surprise!  great b fast food and the baked kibbie, dolmas and lamb ball looked so enticing, i ordered a bunch of stuff to go.  cool people too, very nice and accommodating.  think i'll set up shop here for the am and get some work done. What a lovely lovely place. If you're a vegetarian or just love a delicious sandwich, you HAVE to try their Heavenly Angels sandwich! Cucumbers, mushrooms, tomatoes, alfalfa sprouts, hummus, and the freshest mozarella I've tasted  all on top of a dutch crunch roll. I know it sounds simple. . . but for whatever reason, the ingredients combined makes this sandwich perfection. I actually prefer this place over Ike's. Also recommended is the ozze. A HUGE lamb, rice, raisins, nuts filled filo dough concoction that is very yummy. Def a great alternative if the line at Dottie's is just too long. Nice place. Good sandwiches, good coffee, and free wifi. I'll definitely be back to try the falafel. Great place! Plentiful food options, desserts, coffee, and great service. If only I wasn't so lazy to walk down the block, I would be a reg. (It's the hill going back up that kills me) I've been here a few times and each time holds pleasant surprises. Have I ever told you how I love people watching? Is it just me who loves low key passersby type places? Well, my friend, if your anything like me, Angel Cafe is a PRIME LOCATION. Not only do they have the most interesting people walking by, their food is quite the devil. What more can a girl ask for? Cheap food and people watching next to the  Geary for under $. That's a steal to me! Consistently good and yums food. Convenient location for me and always friendly; if I could ask for anything more, I'd ask for a massage. But this is a café, so whatever. Solid sandwiches, nice deserts, decent bagels. FYI, there is an ATM in the joint, so don't sweat it, son. I like this place. OVERALL: . FOOD: SERVICE: AMBIANCE: . VALUE: Fallback breakfast plan after seeing the .  mile line at Dottie's True Blue.  Pretty starving after a morning race, so low key & fast was perfect. Family run, friendly, and ""neighborly"". . . . lots of local regulars streaming through good sign.  No real décor to speak of; could've been an autoshop for all I knew, but no biggie.  Handful of sidewalk tables, similar situation in the main room, and a dim backroom for internet (didn't make it that far, so not sure how it measured up).  Typical cafe fare, with some nice homemade Middle Eastern items (ozze, falafel, dips). Breakfast Bagel: ham, eggs, . . . toasty, savory. . . standard but tasty. Ozze: Giant calzone type creation filled with ground lamb, seasoned rice, raisins, peas, onions. . . . delish especially if you dig Middle Eastern flavors (all spice, cumin, etc).  Hungry as I was, I still only finished half. . . . YUM!Latte & Drip coffee were well brewed and frothed.  Good temperature, flavor, & quickly delivered to the table with a smile. I imagine I'd be a regular if I lived nearby. I have walked by here so many times. But finally came in a week or so ago. I love this place!Cheap eats, good eats, a cute little area downstairs that is decorated like a little. . cave? I guess? hahaCASH ONLY kills me every time! I never carry cash :( Bagels are great. The yogurt treats and desserts are amazing. The lattes are superb. The ozze is to die for. The handmade sandwiches are supper yummy. I just love this place. Outdoor seating is super convenient on those hot days and always fun to people watch. All in all, this place is great! I just wish it wasn't cash only : / I haven't tried the food yet  when I do, Ill revise my rating :) The iced coffee here is so good! Never better, always strong and smooth, just the way I like it. The staff is super nice, always welcomed with a smile  Star for being cash only, though there is an atm machine  i hate the fees! The guy screwed up my order. Otherwise it would have been good. Coffee and chai tea was good. Bagel with butter and jam  can't really screw that up but he managed to put peanut butter on it! Good for takeout, but don't come here if you want to do some work in an Internet cafe. The back room is dark with artificial water feature  not very attractive at all. Nice family restaurant. I hope they do well. Yummy fresh yoghurt. So thankful I found Angel Cafe on Yelp during my recent visit. It was a Sunday morning and all I wanted was a breakfast sandwich. Being that I was located in Union Square area my options were limited, and everyone that suggested Angel Cafe was right love this find! The interior of the small cafe is warm and inviting even though it is in a kind of sketch area. There are many breakfast sandwich options on the chalkboard on the wall. I selected a bacon, cheese, and egg bagel sandwich to go, and was asked to select what type of bagel I wanted. The sandwich was made fresh in front of me. The cafe is very much family run, and the staff is nice and pleasant tons of smiles and laughter. While I waited for my breakfast order, I observed many lunch food options like falafel and ethnic style salads in the display case. I wish I would have been in the city longer so that I could have come back and tried their lunch menu items. FYI's~ * Prices very reasonable it is under $ for a hearty breakfast sandwich * The breakfast sandwiches do not skimp on toppings I ended up taking half of my bacon off * Tables are available inside and out for sitting * Order at the counter and either receive your food to go or for eating in house As a cafe this place works; the coffee is good. It may not be luxury coffee, but it's plenty good. What distinguishes this joint from any neighborhood joint is the pride the staff take in the place. A glass case of sweets is offset with another of grandma style Lebanese dishes. (They have a particularly good kibbe). If you're looking for casual, bright, clean, friendly and tasty in the form of a Lebanese coffee shop you'll find it here. I was more than happy to find it for myself. Just got back from here.  Still slightly buzzed from Rye, but the food at Angel Cafe is friggin' good.  There were  of us and we kind of couldn't stop ordering dishes.  The flavors were dancing. I almost forgot about the cannoli in my backpack when I got home.  I was craving cannolis for almost  weeks now.  Once I saw that pastry behind the window, I had to have it.  Oh yeah, I should eat it. . . It was tasty and now it's gone and I'm really full. . . and I have to work tomorrow. Ugh. at first i thought that this place had way too few seats for a coffee shop with free wifi, then i discovered 'the cave' in the back. apparently laptops aren't allowed in the corner set sunlit upstairs portion of angel cafe, which sucks because the windows are perfect for people watching. initially i wanted to rate them  stars for this. on a nice sunny day you have to retreat to the cavernous back room for laptop usage. however, the no laptop rule made sense after a bit, as i noticed it kept the tables from long hour table squatters. rating at this point:  stars ""a ok""but then i realized just how sensitive the owners are for this ever so coveted table space when i walked two tables over to sit with a friend for   mins to chat.  an old lady owner walked to the table i was sitting at, picked up my bag, phone, headphones, and book and moved them to the table i was sitting at (my friend's table). i'm not so sure she spoke much english, but i tried to tell her to get her hands off my belongings, but she continued to move my stuff. then wiped my ex table down. the kicker here is that after she was finished wiping down my previous spot i counted  vacant tables (total of ). packed up and left. I just moved into the area a month ago, and looking around, it seemed bleak at first (pizza hut, sports bar, another pizza joint). But then I discovered Angel Cafe across the street and they are my official need a quick bite place. Sure, there's Osha Thai too, but you don't always want rich, rice heavy food for lunch. Especially if you've got work to do and can't just rub your belly and roll yourself home. Angel Cafe has great sandwiches and bagels. I haven't tried their fancier stuff but so far, I have never been disappointed. You can just call in and pick up your order or sit outside and people watch. It's a mom n pop place and they are extremely nice people. Been here a few times now. I regularly order a breakfast bagel and some kind of coffee drink. Every time I've gone in the food/drinks have been good. The prices are reasonable and the service is friendly. There is one thing that could make it even better. . . . . When it is busy in there I've always received some flaw in the service. One time they forgot one of my drinks and another time they gave us the wrong drink and said it was the right one. It seems they need a better system for ordering, expediting and paying for busier times. People order over the counter and at the register and then orders get backed up. An 'Order here' sign could easily solve this problem. I can't believe I'm so lucky as to live right down the street from this joint. I paid my very first visit last week and became completely smitten. Starbucks be gone, the Angel is flying high. The coffee here was totally yum but the egg bagel was SO GOOD. I'm used to the breakfast sandwiches from Starbucks which absolutely pale in comparison to these. I ordered the sausage, egg and cheese on a whole wheat bagel. I told myself I'd only eat half but after I got started there was no way that was happening. To. Good. I'll be back this weekend fo sho with my new pup Ru to sit outside and enjoy my precious time off. I love this place!  The owner guy is one of the friendliest people in the hood.  I've also noticed that he's basically there from open to close every day.  I would be a pissy bitch, but he's just super smiley and friendly (and kind of cute). I love the little outdoor seating area  a very risky venture for the Tenderloin, but it totally works there and is super cute.  There food is good too, but I think of them more as good stewards to the neighborhood.  I really appreciate that and enjoy supporting them. I love this place! It's one of only two places I know of in San Francisco that makes good falafel. All their standard dishes have a bit of unique flair that enhances the dish without making it into something froo froo or something else entirely. Some examples are the pepperoncinis in the falafel sammich or the sun dried tomatoes in the Dolmas. Delightful Falafel, definitely in the top  I have ever tasted. The rice in the dolma was a little over cooked but the flavor was distinctly unique & worthy of trying again, especially with the surprising addition of sun dried tomatoes. Quick, no frills breakfast? Yes. Yummy breakfast burrito? Not so much. I don't make many comparisons to food or food culture (especially since San Diego isn't exactly well known for culinary expertise outside of Mexican cuisine), but if there's one thing I know: it's a good breakfast burrito. I've never understood why some cafés try to be an eater's one stop shop. Though I'm sure everything behind the glass counter is tasty, I just don't understand how anyone can master the art of cous cous, falafel wraps, pancakes, Mexican breakfast burritos, various pastries and roughly  billion other options. I'm more of a KISS fan (acronym for Keep It Simple Stupid. . . an old radio term), so I'd rather see a place with fewer offerings done well than a gaggle of food stuffs ranging from great to blah. I met a few friends here last week for a quick breakfast before hanging out with naked fellows in Delores Park. Being a huge fan of burritos, I opted for their signature breakfast burrito, while my two amigas went with specialty bagels and pastries. Both of their meals were fab, but my order left a lot to be desired. Again, not to compare apples to oranges. . . but who the hell steams burritos on a panini press? I watched them fill my tortilla with eggs, avocado, bacon and some other goodies. . . then they essentially heated it up on a George Foreman Grill. While I love the lean, mean, grillin' machine. . . I'm not a fan of warming burritos on them. It's just weird. The taste reflected my suspicions  just way, way off. I ended up only eating a few bites, then nibbling on my friend's plates. Exactly why I think some outfits should just stick to what they do well, as opposed to trying to please everyone. The coffee drink I had was spot on, and the staff was really friendly. I'd totally go back another time, but it'll hot day in Antarctica before I order another breakfast burrito. One of the nicest little neighborhood places in all of San Francisco. THE COFFEE IS UNBELIEVABLY GOOD!! This place is just fantastic all the way around. ** Great location on the corner of Leavenworth and Geary. ** Outside seating on two sides, with awning all the way around, so you'll never be defeated by the sun. I even had a pleasant time outside with a friend during a drizzle. ** Nice people watching location. ** Fantastic owner, wonderful service, always relaxed and professional at the same time! Service is always very speedy and courteous. ** Some of the best coffee I have EVER had. Period! Very rich. Just delicious. I mean this: I used to depend on Starbucks for my coffee, but forget about it! If only Starbucks could make coffee like Angel!** A nice variety of fresh pastries, sandwiches, and other things. A lot of middle eastern things, but other stuff too. This place is special. I would go there every day, but I want to keep it special, so I space out my visits. Like all places, they go through employees. But the strange thing is: every single person that's worked there has been wonderful. Angel Cafe is one of those kinds of places that makes a neighborhood feel like a neighborhood, feel special. It is the first place I've felt that way about. And apparently I'm not alone; they have many regulars. Another great thing about this place: It is not trendy. You'll see all kinds of people there, young and old and in between, students, writers, unemployed (I presume), and so on. It is a neighborhood place and everyone feels welcome. Internet cafe in the back, separated from the rest of the place, although I guess they are WIFI ready, because I have seen people use laptops in the main part as well. This is my favorite place in San Francisco, and one of my favorites of all time (which includes plenty of time in Europe). Take your friend, take your kid, take your mom or dad, take your dog. You'll be pleased. Also very comfortable and accommodating if you are alone. Again: unbelievably good coffee. Best Americano I've EVER had! I can't say it enough. Decently drinkable espresso. Nice downstairs area w/ computers  cool on a hot day. . . This is a good place to go for a quick, cheap lunch if you're nearby. Probably you should get the falafel pita. Plus, they have organic coffee, so it's a good place to go in the morning, get some coffee and a bite, and sit outside and people watch, because it's right between Nob Hill and the Tenderloin and there are very few decent coffee shops in the area. once, i bought a piece of baklava here: flaky, dense. sugar high foodie delirium ensued. that was months ago and i'm still thinking about it. Great service, very clean, well merchandised. Falafel was very good. Hummus is amazing! I'm very picky about my middle eastern food (grew up in metro detroit) and i'd say that this place does it very well.  if they were a full restaurant i'd imagine they'd have to pass the shawarma wrap test; i think they'd be up to it. love the array of sweets, was unexpected. i believe the family is Lebanese; this is my favorite of the Mediterranean cuisines. glad i live nearby. Nice people, fresh food, good for lunch (lox bagel!), will come back. I love this place. Friendly employees and a friendly owner who knows what we went before we even speak. Great food and a great atmosphere. I love the outdoor seating, I wish there was a little more room  but a great place to meet new people and have nice conversation. I have some pretty specific criteria that I use to rate cafes. I'm a handicapped homeless drug addict with laptop so what I want is a place that is cheap, friendly, has pretty good food (edible protein, something other than just lox and doubtful pirogi's), free wifi, padded seats, and will let me hang out there all day for very little money.  This place scores in some really good ways. The food is great and cheap, the people are friendly, the chairs are padded and the wifi is not only free but incredibly fast. It's amazing how many places in this city can't get a reliable connection and when they do it crawls along at under k. Of course, since it's pretty small, it's not the kind of place that wants me to sit around for  or  hours at a stretch with just a small house coffee, hey, that's my problem not theirs. So, great food, very fast wifi. That makes this place special in my book. I've lived a block from here for  years now, and saw Angel Cafe go up about a year ago. It always looked clean and old world classy  there's often some older Greek men sitting outside and watching the world go by. Inside is a polite and attentive family staff, standing behind a counter of delicious and gourmet selection of cakes, muffins, and Greek deli items. The food and coffee is great. This is  stars because of the neighborhood feel and atmosphere. If you're a local, then stop in and get a taste of the beautiful side of the Tenderloin. really really really friendly place. . . i believe its a family owned restaurant/cafe? i needed a place to charge my phone for a bit and this place was right by our car so i came here hoping to find an outlet.  bought a drink except it was cash only and my water was .  and i only had my atm/credit card and .  but the owner had no problem with giving me my bottle of water for . . he was so friendly and really accommodating. i made sure my friends met me here & ordered a drink/food after they were done shopping because they were really nice to me and i love supporting family owned places. . I enjoyed the felafel sandwich here. I wanted to try the potato salad for a couple of times but didn't get a chance. The people are nice, the food is good, I recommend this café for everyone who wants to try felafel sandwich around nob hill. I'm changing the route I walk to school to stop by here.  It's super cheap, friendly and nice.  I think I might bring my computer there to study later this week.  They have a downstairs that seems like a good cave for studying. So I went to Angel Café on Sunday to order a lunch to go.  Had never been inside and wasn't familiar with the menu so I was lingering for a bit before I actually made it to the counter.  I had narrowed down my choices to a garden burger or the falafel sandwich when I walked up to the counter.  I asked the older Middle Eastern guy at the register if he recommended one over the other.  He stared at me blankly.  I then repeated myself and rephrased the question  ""What's more popular?  The garden burger or falafel sandwich?""  Still nothing.  I tried one more time with another version  ""What do you like  the garden burger or the falafel sandwich?"" Blank stare squared.  At this point I could feel my pulse racing and my irritation growing.  Was I asking a rocket science question?  Dude, come on!  Finally another guy in the back asked me what my question was and I repeated, and he said definitely the falafel sandwich.  So I turned to the man at the register and said, ""ok, can I get a falafel sandwich to go and two dolmas?'""  That's when I saw a complete turn around and he gave me a big smile and asked me if ""I was Indian?""  I said yes.  You could've thought we had just reunited after years apart b/c he totally became uber friendly and grinned at me while I paid and looked right in my eyes.  What happened between my asking which was better and stating that I was Indian, I don't know, but regardless I was treated so well!  It's still a puzzle!And the sandwich was delicious.  I am really glad I went to Angel Café and give it a yaay for anyone who is a falafel fan, it was yummy! I stopped here before a night of drinking to get some food to help absorb the drinks that were sure to follow. It's either Greek or Middle Eastern, I don't know enough to tell the difference. It's nice enough inside and the service was pretty friendly. There was a guy and girl working there and an older gentleman that seemed like a real character. He kept talking to me but I couldn't for the life of me understand what he was saying. I saw this big phyllo dough thing in the counter; I think it was called an osa, which looked interesting. I asked the girl behind the counter if it was dry and her answer was that it was very good, I took that to mean that it wasn't dry. I ordered it even though I really should have asked a few questions. I got it and it was very dry and sweet, full of as many golden raisins and nuts as there was rice and lamb. It reminded me of a dish they served at a Middle Eastern place I worked at years ago that was called a perdiplow; the main difference was that the perdiplow came with some sauce. What I got was the exact opposite of what I wanted to eat. I can't really blame the cafe, for all I know that was the ideal version of that dish. It isn't their fault I ordered something I don't like. If I'm in that area again I might try one of their sandwiches. I really like this place, although the seating isn't the most comfortable over time and the neighborhood can detract from the outside seating. I really really love the dolma he has.  Generally very tasty and tender aside from  time I got some late in the evening and they were a bit dry.  Cappuccino and Chai are both good, but nothing special above and beyond your standard well executed coffee shop drink.  Service is very friendly. I really like the falafel sandwich, the falafels are not dried out like at most places. The sandwich had the perfect mix of ingredients, just a few pepperoncinis gives it a little tang which makes it unique and delicious. The iced coffee was pretty good too. I'm definitely a fan for a lazy lunch at Angel sitting outside in the shade watching the crazies on the street be crazy. Once, I went there with my friend at morning. I ordered  a raw Salmon bagel. woo, it was really amazing!   After that, I have tried some other bagels. they were so good but i still like Salmon bagel and beef one! i always drink  coffee in Starbucks. And one day, I started trying to get a caramel latte. it was totally fabulous! PS. I like the owner. how a cute guy he is! I absolutely love this place!The service is awesome and the coffee is delicious.  They have great sandwiches too.  It is a perfect caffeine stop for your morning (or evening) cup of coffee :) This place is great. I joined yelp just to put up a review about this restaurant. I've had a lot of Greek and Middle Eastern food and have to say this place is fantastic. I had an ozze (flaky crust wrapping rice, lamb, nuts, raisins and more), two falafel with hummus and two fig cookies. Wow! The ozze was really fantastic and a must try if you're in the neighborhood. Eating outside was fun as well. My first trip to San Francisco for a show, and having eaten at a few great restaurants (including Roys m great lamb there too and Mel's for breakfast) I'd say Angel Cafe is the hand's down winner (and a fraction of the price even though Roys was scrumptious) :)LOL I see I'm contradicting the most recent review but, I stand firmly with my recommendations. Everything was quite tasty (and I'm not so easily won over). I used to come here almost everyday when my boyfriend lived right around the corner. Then we moved into a place a block away and I still came fairly often. The staff was really nice and they made my bagel just the way I like it. Then it happened. . . cockroaches. This was about  months ago, I gave the guy my usual order and was paying at the register when I saw it. A roach just waltzing on by right on the back counter! I took closer look and saw more on the counter where the food was!! I took my money right back and walked out. Haven't been back since. This is a cool little spot to drop by and grab a quick and cheap bite. I like that they have a little outdoor area to eat/drink/smoke. The place is really clean and the food that I had was good. I wanna try their pasta salad or lasagna next time I stop in. Bottom line is that you can go here with  bucks and get a nice little no nonsense lunch or breakfast. I've been coming to this location since before it was Angel Cafe.  Just a hole in the wall, literally, it had a hole in the exterior wall.  Anyway. . . After an awesome renovation and new ownership it is definitely angelic!  As far as TL cafe's go, this is the best.  Awesome staff, which have been like family since they moved in.  Great strong WiFi, coffee. . .  Really yummy mediteranean food that I never tire of.  The little outdoor seating on the sidewalk is cute, though can be weird as it is next to a busy geary bus stop and traffic is crazy around this area.  I LOVE Angel Cafe! I have been coming to this cafe for a few months now, usually for breakfast in the morning before going to work.  Their food is excellent, the coffee is very strong, and the Syrian family that runs the place is very friendly.  Also, despite being on the edge of the TL, the cafe is very clean.  I have nothing but affection for this cafe.  Also, their dolmas are excellent!  I think they use a unique recipe for it.  They are also open quite late, til pm.  If you go, be sure to check out the photos above the cash register.  They are of people in Syria, but both look very much like Popeye to me. The food is great, but still not the best Ive had. The service is friendly and fast. This is a great stop for a quick bite. They are the Mediterranean family I never had because I'm born here and oh so pale.  I recently moved from the neighborhood, but I used to live one block away and would start most days, either off to school or hungover, with their deviled eggs and a ginger soy latte.  Their food is wonderful for breakfast lunch or dinner. Get the lamb bun and slather hummus all over it, you won't be unhappy, less your vegetarian in which case use a falafel.  I wish she was my grandma and I could eat the leftovers.  I hope a new cutie moves into the neighborhood for dude to flirt with on the daily, but I try to make it over there just for the eggs and sweet service. the most divine deviled eggs I have ever had I like it, I like it!  I stopped by spontaneously today for lunch to try Angel Cafe as I passed by it a ton of times on the Muni  and was always curious.  I ordered the Pesto Turkey sandwich on sourdough bread.  It was very tasty with homemade pesto sauce, fresh alfalfa sprouts and toasted bread.  So good!  I enjoyed half of it in this cozy cafe and wrapped the other half to enjoy at home later for dinner.  I also ordered two falafel to go which I just snacked on and totally enjoyed. The deli case full of potato salad, deviled egg, dolma, falafel, and the dessert case with an assortment of cakes and pastries looked very interesting!  And I just read that they have organic coffee  hm!  Can't wait to bring my boyfriend back here for lunch very soon!P. S.  I also saw the ""Loved by Yelp!"" sign in the window  this review is another testament to their good business.  Keep it up! This is the ultimate neighborhood coffee shop. The owners are so friendly; we've been on a first name basis since I first moved across the street over a year ago. Everything I've tried there is so delicious. The lox bagels and soy lattes in the morning, to the turkey sandwiches and falafel and hummus pitas in the evening  everything is homemade and delish!! You will not be disappointed. Wow, I dig this place. Heart of the TL, which can be kinda shifty, but the organic brew was tasty, the wifi was free and fast (k down) and the bagel was as expected. Cool little internet cafe room down some stairs with arab news TV playing in the background, along with a fishtank burbling happily. If you live in the hood, this is the best coffee around! I wandered in after a walk from my hotel on a flippin' gorgeous day in San Francisco. The sun was shining, a faint breeze was keeping me cool and oh. . . my tummy was a growling! I needed some grub, and I needed it fast. I looked up to find a quaint little café with a certain round red sticker reading ""People Love Us On Yelp!"" Bullseye let's do this!The chalkboard read sandwiches hot and cold, while a glass case held goodies like fresh salads, fruit cups, spinach and onion pies and various pasta salads. I decided to order the falafel sandwich, and boy am I glad I did. The soft and flaky dough that held my sandwich together was delicate and thin. It hugged the other ingredients together like a burrito. Inside was a mixture of fresh cherry tomatoes, tangy cucumbers, perfectly textured falafel and hummus and spicy yogurt. I didn't mean to eat so much, but I could hardly tke a break from devouring the tasty sandwich. I didn't even open my can of diet coke until the last two bites. If I had anymore room left, I would order one of the croissants, chocolate tarts ro other baked goods. But I don't and I can't force myself! Next time, for sure. The environment makes me feel like I am in another land. An older woman sits outside at the small tables smoking cigarettes while a more than middle aged man holds a newspaper but watches the passersby. Classical music plays on the stereo creating a very comfortable setting. Walk through the hidden hallway past the register to find a small internet café complete with wifi, printing, scanning, copying and faxing services. You can even make digital photo prints. As for the bevies, this café offers organic fair trade coffee, iced Chais, Italian sodas, fresh carrot and orange juice, hot chocolate and even warm milk with flavor shots. If you are in the area and in need of a snack, full meal or shot of caffeine, you should definitely come here. But just a heads up: they don't take credit cards, but they do have an ATM if you're out of cash money. Organic coffee in the Tenderloin?!? Oh yeah, baby. This place is the reason I get out of bed in the morning, and the afternoons on days off. The people who work there are so nice and the food is great. They have a large selection of things to eat for such a small place, and you can fax and copy things there, too. My favorite thing to do is sit outside and watch all the different people walk by. Love Love Love this place and you will, too! I love Angel.  Good drinks and food.  When I moved into the neighborhood, I went there because it was just a block away and have been back since.  Once, I ordered a cappuccino in ceramic and after putting it on the table, I bumped the table and spilled the whole drink.  The owner rushed out with a rag and napkins and after helping to clean up, made me another, no charge. My local spot, if I do run out for a quick snack paired with a caffeinated beverage, I come here. I usually get a hot chocolate with vanilla and a lemon square, highly recommend though they don't make them. I like the outside area. True story The building on geary across from the seat area lives a guy on the nd floors who always pours tons of bird food/ grain outside his windows ledges and hundreds of pigeons flock, I've seen him disperse what looks like a  lb bag of grain outside  different windows.  Then as a cars go by they all take off,(like  hundred of them, no lie, even though you are some what guarded by the awning on the other side of the street feathers do make it over.  Yes I have a weird thing with birds and bugs and with Tenderloin Pigeons comes bird mites.  SICK!But it's not the cafes fault it's the Tenderloin's I can't expect anything more. Ideally, I would make myself a sandwich for lunch every day.  But I never have time enough in the morning, and keeping cheese & meat at work is kinda a mess.  Angel Cafe makes me the sandwich I wish I could make myself .  Except better, because they have a panini press & yummy hummus & sprouts ( i just wish they had spinach!).  Also, they are just so so nice, they make me smile and give a good tip every time I come in.  Thank goodness for Angel Cafe & Morty's brightening my TL lunch hour!! I do live in the neighborhood and I do think the staff is very nice and friendly, but let me tell you this is NOT a sympathy review. I come in here for bagels all the time and they are delicious! I usually get the breakfast bagel, your choice of bagel (I get cheese), scrambled egg, your choice of cheese (I get pepper jack), and your choice of meat (I am a veggie and get tomato instead). It is SO good every time. I love good coffee and the coffee is not the best I've had but is very good. The place is clean, the service is good, and I have not ordered the sandwiches but the breakfast and pastries are to die for! Although my first trip to this place is bookmarked in my mind because a patron beat another patron over the back with a chair, the bagel with humus and delicious coffee run a very close second. The staff is very friendly and the whole cafe has a great ""family affair"" feel to it. I feel terrible about having to rain on everyone else's parade. . . but I am at the service of YOU, THE READER. Yes, the staff is very friendly.  Yes, there is free WiFi. Yes, there is a downstairs with a cheap waterfall, but it isn't that soothing when the movie Casino is playing on the television and one man with a hacking cough is drinking a Coca Cola next to you and another man is neurotically fingering rosary beads. The thick plastic table cloths do not help anything downstairs, either. I came here because my girlfriend lives in the vicinity and I am often dying for a sandwich.  The others who have reviewed this joint seemed so reassuring about the quality of the food. Let me break down what the sandwich here is all about:Bread: same bread you find at Cala or Safeway, only not as fresh. Meats: thinly put on the sandwich, nothing specialVeggies: standard tomatoes (unripe), iceberg lettuce (seriously, wtf?)Condiments: yellow mustard.  Size: Contrary to many of the reviews, these sandwiches are SMALL. Summary: smaller and really not much better than a Subway Sandwich.  (And I hate Subway. ) Clearly, anytime you read a review where the reviewer explicitly tells you that the staff is a family, or that they are respectful, or something about the staff other than how they perform as a staff, you should realize that the reviewer is writing a sympathy review because they want the establishment to succeed. Fantastic place! I love it! They have great home cooked meals that are available. The lasagna and devil eggs are good. There is a back room that's quiet with a working waterfall garden that's gorgeous and ambient. The staff appears to be a family. they were nice and respectful. I was here from AM to PM working on a project and they were very accomadating! Adorable.  Clean, charming, yummy coffee and the owners are dolls.  I came in all cynical and he charmed it right outta me. Sit in the back!  There's a little waterfall feature and it's very soothing.  : ) I was in the civic center area today and decided to check out this place after reading good reviews. I had their black forest ham sandwich and I wish it would have been smaller so that I could try other stuff they had. Everything looked so delicious! I wish they had half sandwich half salad/med. side combo. Regardless, my sandwich was fresh, had lots of meat and their rye bread was descent. Good service, cute/clean cafe and good sandwiches. It is really true when other reviewers comment on nice smiling faces behind the counter. Looks family owned and everyone seems happy to be at work. I will be back to try other stuff besides a sandwich or even just to have another sandwich here. OOh. . and Free Wifi and clean bathroom. Two must haves! stephen t. and i decided to go to osha. 'i want something w/vegetables,' stephen said, scanning the menu posted in the window. 'well, there are salads,' i replied. 'they all have meat,' he said. disappointed, we walked down geary, in search of another establishment.   'i feel like a sandwich,' stephen said, as he held on to an imaginary sandwich w/both hands in front of his mouth.  'this place looks like it has sandwiches. . . '. . . wow, wasn't expecting the sandwiches to be THAT fresh and tasty!  later, we ate them, as well as our order of a tomato, basil, and cheese mix, as we awaited Earth Hour on the steps at taylor and vallejo. note:  be prepared to add a considerable amount of sugar to their iced coffees. I just go for the GREAT coffee, and the nice guys serving it. Seeing as how it's so close to work, why  not? Support the local business I say. Their heaven bagel sandwich is SO GOOD. It's a Vegetarian's dream. And I might point out, I'll never even consider doing that rabbit food diet but what they put on that bagel makes me just go ""M"" inside and accompany that with their chai latte not too sweet and not really spicy either. I'll visit more often if I get the chance. The man behind the counter is friendly and accomodating answers questions and puts up with the Nob Hill nervous twitchy type people asking about the Dolmas ""what's in that? how do you pronounce that?"" and does it with a warm smile. Now that's pretty awesome. I knock off a star 'cause it's not really big enough. Seats about  inside and has a few tables outside, but I can't really do work or feel like I can not have someone watching me as I eat, but otherwise a pretty charming place. Owners are adorable, sweet and always there to greet you with a smile amidst their hard work. Really delicious bagel sandwiches, falafal, cannolis, and drinks!Coffee is yum. . . Free wifi = Thank you! A great little place for a late breakfast on a lazy weekend. Sit in the back for a sweet and homey ambiance!I would love to have more vegetarian sandwich/bagel options, but until then I'll be back whenever I can anyway. I love this place. It's on my way to school in the morning, so most days I stop by in the morning for coffee and something to make my stomach happy. I have yet to have something there that I don't like. The pastries are pretty typical, but they're always well stocked. The bagels are great, my favorite is the hummus bagel. . . amazing. And the falafel pita. . . absolutely perfect. The coffee's really good too, though I always end up spilling it on myself on my way down the hill. But what makes this my favorite cafe are the people who run it. Everyone who works there is amazingly nice. Actually nice, not 'I'm complimenting your bad taste in clothing because I want a good tip' nice. Maybe it's because the owners are almost always working but still. . . they are always smiling.  It's very refreshing to get a cup of coffee in the morning without a side of hipster barista attitude. Upon arrival at Angel Cafe, I became a bit disappointed.  I walked so many blocks, had so many homeless people call me ""baby girl', for this? Don't be fooled by the cheesy exterior though.  It is reasonably classy inside. The staff was super friendly and the food is yummy.  I had a grilled sandwich with sprouts, avocado, brie, tomatoes, and pesto.  Any sandwich with pesto totally has me sold. The coffee is good as well, plus it's  fair trade/organic/shade grown or something. I tried to sit outside, but it was just too cold.  Wifi and power outlets are plentiful, seating is not. Also, smooth jazz?  Really?  At that volume?  You're killing me here. Moving day. . . it's pm and I'm walking back from Walgreens and notice that Angel Cafe is open and I'm also reminded that I haven't eaten anything but a SlimFast for breakfast (I was moving, it was the only thing in the fridge that was fast and easy!). I'm delerious from the day's activities and so I just order the first thing I see on the menu, a black forest ham sandwich. The gentleman behind the counter takes my order and I don't think I've ever seen a ham sandwich made with such love and care it tasted like it too! Will be back to try more Meditteranean type stuff, everything behind the glass looked yummy too. This place is AMAZING. On my way to work, and always very friendly. It is family owned and run and SO much better now that they have remodeled it. I recommend the sandwiches they toast them to perfection. They even have yummy cakes and pastries. All homemade and always quick. Cheap too! This place was so cute, clean and cheery. I stopped in on a rainy day and when I walked in the Cafe completely changed my mood. The food is great, and there is a beautiful display of pastries along the counter. Also, the owners are really sweet and the service was very fast. LOVED it! Other than what the other Yelpers had to say, here is what I have to add to this:AMAZING AMAZING MELT IN YOUR MOUTH FLAKY CHEESE PASTRY CROISSANT THING A MA JIG. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The coffe is good.  The falafel is good.  Anything I've tried there is good.  The owners are plesent.  Not the best place to study, though.  Overall, this is the nicest store on the block! The heavenly bagel is. . . i have to say it. . . heavenly!  There is no better espresso in the 'loin.  I realize that's not saying much, but really, it's quite tasty. Good riddance to the last coffee shop that held this address. At these little coffee shops I usually stick with baked goods and drinks, but I read the good reviews for this place and headed over for a sandwich.  So I had the pastrami and a coffee for breakfast (I KNOW, I KNOW, I'm probably not going to live very long). . . It was fabulous. They served it on one of the better bagels I've had around here (wonder who supplies them?), and the veggies were fresh.  The pastrami was tasty and VERY thinly sliced.  Mm. . . There was an adequate amount of meat on there, but I could've used a little more.  Also $ is a little pricey for a small sandwich.  But the quality of the food is worth it!Angel Cafe is a step above. update: tried the Italian combo sandwich on dutch crunch, and it was phenominal.  This place rules! The father and son that own this place are so pleasant.  I have only been there twice but the son remembered me.  Besides the niceties, the food in the display case always looks fresh and the display of desserts is quite impressive.  So far I have had the lox bagel which has a large portion of salmon with fresh vegetables, and a chai latte.  Both were delicious!  Please try this place one morning instead of Starbucks!  These people are hardworking and make a good start to your day. The cafe that used to be here, Grain D'Or, was. . . not good. One of my friends found a cockroach in her coffee there once. The place was all around grody. So for a really, really long time I avoided this corner. Avoided it a lot. Then one day I walked by and it was gutted. Grain D'Or was no more. I wondered what would replace it. . . considered the pros and cons of a Starbucks in the Tenderloin. Maybe it would be a new, hip bar. But before I knew it, the corner cafe had been painted blue and white, there were windows where windows had not been before, and the sign above the outside tables said, ""Angel Cafe. "" Still, though I was curious, I did not venture inside. What if it was still the old owners, and hey had just remodeled to trick folks like me and my cockroach chewing friend into coming back?So I walked by Angel Cafe on my morning commute (seven blocks down Geary to Union Square) every day, peering in out of curiosity, but I didn't dare go inside until one fateful morning when I had run out of Captain Crunch and was dreading having to go to Bistro  when I got to work. I stepped inside. I ordered a lox bagel. I was in heaven. Their falafel tastes like chicken. They sell a little sandwich that just has brie on it. Their Chai Latte makes me feel like a kid again. (Not sure how that works. )Plus the girl who makes my bagels is a total cutie. I love angel Cafe. You must eat this  the Oosa, or oosha, or ouza? It's the squashed Chinese bun like object in the corner, only made of delicate phylo with ground lamb, peas, raisins, pine nuts, herbed rice, and spices.  As flaky snack meal goodness it kicks piroshki's ass and makes spanikopita beg for mommy. The man at the counter let me in on the secret of where they find these.  His mom bakes them.  She makes everything in the shop, from pasta salads to all of the pies, tarts, and pastries, restaurant quality food at coffee shop prices.  Coffee was unusually good, too.  Plus free wifi  and only steps from the Leavenworth stop on the  bus, people. New owners have spiffed up the storefront, redone the lighting, display cases, seating.  It's sunny in here, and cheerful.  Older men still lounge and chat all afternoon on the outdoor seats, and it's still one of the most earnest little cafes in town.  But now it's inviting, and oozes a kind, unpretentiously urbane sensibility. I go here several times a week and I love it! They just redid the place and it looks great  very clean. I have never had the coffee, so I can't judge that. I often have the tabbouleh (made in house), falafel and hummus. I also like their vegetarian delight bagel. The owner, Nagum (sp?) and his Dad Maurice, are what really make this place though. They are so friendly! This is a great hang out spot. Everyone working there was so nice. I stopped in for a latte and bagel this morning and I'm really glad I found this place. All of the pasta salads under the counter looked delicious and the cafe was impeccably clean. They also have great taste in furniture. Free wi fi means  I will be back. Angel Cafe formerly Grain D'or closed it's doors in August. After painting the exterior bricks blue, I began to worry. But they opened this weekend and WOW! What an AWESOME place. First, the most important part: The coffee was EXCELLENT. Finding a good cup of coffee in this city is not always easy with Starbucks and Peets crowding every corner. Second most important it's clean! A clean place in the TL is more than I could hope for. They have even removed the bars from the windows and the pale blue interior has created a bright & cheery atmosphere. (Hmm. Cheery? In the TL?) I hope, however, they will not regret removing the protection those bars provided. But if something does happen, I will be there helping them clean up!Any clean business in the TL (or TenderNob as we Northern 'Loiners like to call the area) is worth a visit. Please help us support them. Stop by for a cup of coffee, a hummus plate, or a tasty pastry. By the way, they also have free wireless internet. So stop by and Yelp them while you are there! EDIT:  New owner, new look, new food, hilarious typos on the menu!  All winners in my book. . . . was that a brioche I spied with mine little eyes in the pastry case?  I'm in love. Old review:  I catch the bus out front of here some mornings and I often wander in looking for something to satiate my sweet tooth and or need for caffeine.  And I wander out.  The place is unpleasant with a fly problem at BEST. They seem to have changed their name  I thought maybe it had been taken over by a new owner but peeking inside, I found the same thing as always.  It's really a shame, this would be an ideal morning stop for my commute. The pesto turkey sandwich is surprisingly good.  The house blend? Surprisingly bad.  Regardless, it's where I get coffee on cold weekend mornings and watch the flocks of pigeons flying in unison through the sky over Leavenworth street. The place is run by this extended family of Tunisians, maybe a hundred of them, and they kick it here all day, every day.  You can find them posted around one of the outdoor tables smoking a hookah, playing cards and bullshitting, or inside glued to a soccer match on one of the flat screens.  They are all very kind and cool. Grain D'or is laced with free WiFi and two desktop computers, and the  stop right there makes it a good people watching spot. * UPDATE  SEPT Since being sold and converted into Angel Cafe, I haven't spent a dollar here.  It just doesn't feel right.  It's clean, but I miss the old Tunisian gang.  Oh well, we'll always have World Cup '. . ."|5|98|1|Routine| Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 9/25/2012 ]
Eden Cafe 0|4.0|Delis in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|22|0|4.0|  stars for what it is, how sweet they are, and the surprisingly tasty sandwiches. There were few alternatives for food after a family visit to the symphony and the son and hubby were ravenous. It's small and not fancy, but since we were the only ones there, we sat at the table indoors. From my hipy, zero waste perspective, I was pleased to be served our sandwiches on glass plates. Anyway, Eden makes a good sandwich. The boy snarfed down his tuna melt with much joy and very little sharing. My husband (who loves a good sandwich) was impressed by the hot pastrami sandwich. The only place in the area with boba. It's not the best boba, but it'll do when I have an afternoon craving. And you can't argue with $. for the thursday special salmon teriyaki rice bowl，sometime they were out of it，finally i go it today，it tastes so delicious！！ I was intrigued by the Chicken Teriyaki Rice Bowl combo that came with a Bubble Tea for $. . I didn't realize that the whole thing was just going to be microwaved. Not fun. However, it got me full. The Bubble Tea was fantastic, on the other hand, it even came with tapioca pearls! I would normally pay $.  $ for Bubble Tea alone at any other place. The tea pushes this rating up to  stars.

Eden Cafe 2|4.0|Delis in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|22|2|4.15384615385|" I literally walked by this place twice a week, for two months without ever noticing it. It's that small/unassuming. The sandwiches are a good deal, $ (with tax) for a BLT and a decent sized milk tea/salad. Usually I don't like tapioca, but these were nice and chewy. The kitchen is right in your face and there are about  seats, which just means that you get to smell all the wonderful meaty smells if you eat in. The dutch crunch roll was on the hard side so my bacon was busting out all over the place. I'll go back and try the pastrami next time :) A great small little deli that treats everyone like family.  The sandwiches are awesome as are the sides!    Come at it from the Van Ness or Hayes Steet side (if you are walking).  Market Street side is skid row between Van Ness and Franklin. Random hole in the wall place. Other reviews describe it as 'cute' or 'adorable' but I don't really see that. There is room for a few people to sit down inside but otherwise it's mostly a take out place in a grittier part of Hayes Valley. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich on wheat bread and it was good. No complaints on the tastiness of it. But it was small. I could've eaten two of them. . . so $ may sound cheap as a starting price for sandwiches there, but it's pretty expensive if you ask me considering the size and that this does not include avocado/cheese/any additions. Given the options for delis in Hayes Valley though, I'll most certainly be back. Adorable tiny little cafe, lovely service nice fresh salad and sandwich.  Good prices simple, straightforward, efficient and pleasant.  A few seats inside, a few outside.  Smoothies, coffee, bagel sandwiches, etc.  Will go again if running around near city hall! There is a new owner here.  I just had the the bagel and cream cheese it was good.  Two cousins from Hong Kong runs this place.  They also have wi fi. This place is amazing!  Probably one of the best sandwich places I've tried. Fresh carved turkey sandwich is their best tasting sandwich!  No other place makes it like they do. They marinate and carved the whole turkey!  This is not the usual turkey slice, but hand carved!  The smoothie is always fresh and made daily.  The couple that works there are probably one of the friendliest and loving people I've ever met!  They make u feel so welcome and always come back for more!  I will definitely make daily stops at this awesome sandwich shop going forward!  :) Tucked between Canto Do Brasil and Mandarin Villa lies Eden Café which is owned by a very sweet and personable Taiwanese couple. Alice runs the front and her hubby runs the back. It's more of a ""To Go"" Café, however there are a few stools and a small table out front if you rather eat there instead of heading back to the office. MENU: The menu is a bit confusing. There's different sandwiches listed on the whiteboard, brown board above the register and paper menu and some with conflicting prices.   Below is a bulk of their menu (all prices include tax). *Bagels ($)*Hot/cold sandwiches ($ $. ): about  different kinds including grilled cheese, meatball, spicy club, grilled chicken and bacon, turkey avocado, and teriyaki chicken. *Rice bowls: ($ $. ): teriyaki chicken, grilled chicken, and veggie bowls. *Drinks: coffee $. , soda $, and juices $ $. There's a $ minimum for CC. FOOD:I opted for the Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich (comes w/ Lay's chips) based on the other YELPERS' reviews. Personally, I did NOT like it. By the time I walked back to the office (.  blocks away), the bottom of the toasted french roll was soggy wet from the sauce and the crust of the bread was crumbling off.  The sauce didn't taste like teriyaki but more like watered down soy sauce. There was mayo in the sandwich and that with ""soy sauce"" did not pair well. The chicken meat was dark meat and not white meat. And, $.  for a ' sub? That's pretty damn steep! You're better off going to Subway and getting the footlong of the Maui Onion Chicken Teriyaki Sandwich for $ which tastes a lot better. Although the sandwich failed, I do believe in supporting Mom and Pop stores, hence the  Star review. This was probably just a bad pick on my part and I'll likely come back to try their other sandwiches and/or rice bowls. Or, maybe I'm just a sucker for good customer service! Great little place.  Out of the way, quick and fairly tasty. The owners are a very nice and friendly pair and after a few visits they will know who you are. . . . The menu is fairly basic but still tasty try the meatball sandwich! The couple that work there are amazing.  They're so polite and pleasant; I wanted to take them home with me!I started working over on Van Ness and Market and was looking for something quick that I could pick up for lunch.  I was ""yelping"" and I stumbled across this place.  I gave it a shot and I really enjoyed it.  I got the teriyaki chicken sandwich (with mustard, but I recommend ing that condiment), a bag of chips, and a soda for around $. .  The sweet woman even threw in a chewy granola bar, ""on the house. ""These people are awesome; go there just for them. I have been SEARCHING for a delicious tuna sandwich in Hayes Valley for  years , and today I found it!Eden Cafe is cute, quick and this tuna and avocado sandwich is perfection. Not to mention that the couple that runs it are just too sweet for words. My tuna prayers have been answered! If you like starting your day with being called sweetheart, honey, love  then you'll love Eden Cafe and the woman who has so much great karma coming her way, Helen.  I've been going for  years and in addition to having my fave hazlenut flavored coffee (no i'm not a connoisseur) she is also sweet enough to fill it partially with steamed non fat milk.  No matter what my mood, by the time I leave Eden Cafe with my morning fare  I'm happy as a peach. Wow, can't believe I'm only the rd person to review Eden.  I guess high schoolers don't use Yelp like us old folks. . . to the review:The family that runs Eden is amazingly nice. They get an additional star for that.  They also make a delicious chicken teriyaki sandwich and a rice bowl as well.  Pretty much everything I've had there is good.  Prices are definitely on the high side for what it is, but this is a small business and they don't have a lunch assembly line thing going on.  They take their time on each sandwich and do their best to make sure you'll like it.  I will continue to go back cuz I like them and I like their food. This is a walkup place. Yes they are really nice. However, they are so slow. I ordered a tuna salad with avocado. They gave me chicken with two pieces of avocado and  olives. They charged me $ for this. I was the only client in there. I know there is no language barrier.

San Sun Restaurant 0|3.5|Chinese in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|117|0|3.71794871795|" I always come here for pho. I'll always give this place  stars, I've been a regular here for over three years. I'll admit though if you're a tourist or don't speak Chinese it might be a little tough ordering. Once they recognize you're a regular the atmosphere totally changes. The food is always on point and service is fast. They have over  things to choose from, I lean more towards the Vietnamese pages with Pho. If this place wasn't in Chinatown which is pretty far out of the way for me, my boyfriend and I would definitely be a regular of this place. Came here after :pm and noticed they had a happy hour and some of their drinks were only $! You really can't get any cheaper from anywhere at all. We got  of the lemon iced tea and an iced soy milk for $ (excessive, but it was so cheap you just can help it). It was a really hot day for SF (+ degrees) so I didn't want any noodle soup (or I'd get a heat stroke) so I opted for a beef chow fun. It was pretty good here. Babe got the Beef stew with the wide egg noodle and it was ONLY $ since it was on the happy hour menu. It was so cheap and so delicious. The flavor was on point, and I think I like this more than my beef chow fun. I just personally don't like the egg noodle because it's hard but thats what babe likes. It really is such a shame that it isn't at a more convenient location. I came here for the first time with a few coworkers during lunch. After sauntering through Chinatown, we entered this restaurant. I just couldn't begin where to look in the menu, because there were just so many different styles of noodle preparation!Eventually, I was recommended to try the satay sauce egg noodle. It came out literally a few minutes after ordering, and I was excited to dig in. The seasoning was good, but I wish it wasn't so watery. I was hoping it would have more of a thicker gravy texture so that it wouldn't drown out my noodles. On the flip side, it could have just as well been a noodle soup dish where the noodles completely soaked up the broth. It was edible, but not fantastic. This review should really be .  stars. Fortunately, this rating is only on this one dish and I hope to try the other dishes in the future. Other than that, service is decent for a Chinese restaurant, and price is reasonable, but it's cash only. i'm a regular at this cafe. very good service for a chinatown joint. their happy hour prices are outrageously cheap. their pho is bomb and big portion. their dirnks are cheap, around $. con: parking. I stumbled upon this restaurant while walking through Chinatown.  A clean, modern, and cheerful place with friendly service and reasonable prices.  The Pho Tai was impeccable. really good spot!they have all kinds of noodles soups, menu is extensive, and they serve the noodle soups in metal bowls so your noodles remaind hot. Love it!kind service and clean restaurant, a rariety for chinatown. I got the chiu chow noodles and it was a generous portion and cheap!They have HH specials. . . great spot for lunch! Large, clean, well lit, good prices, and decent food. Loved that they have $ for an entree after pm everyday! It's quite a steal. Additional items on fridays too! Also, I appreciated that the kitchen was willing to alter their menu items if you can't eat spicy. :) Excellent quality food and very reasonably priced.  Try both the iced lychee and fresh lemonade drinks, they will make your tastebuds dance and sing! They have an enormous selection of over  dishes!  The portions are very generous also.  Staff was friendly and speaks English.  I highly recommend it for visitors looking for authentic Chinese food at very good prices. Cheap, fast, quality =  yelpsWon ton noodle soup .  yelp they use chow mein noodles vs. Canadian style won ton noodles. Beef chow fun  yelps solid choice. Raw beef and beef ball pho  yelpBeef and vegetable rice .  yelp smaller quantityMassive menu and they have deals after  pm. Excellent place to go in Chinatown.  It's very large, clean, well priced and has a huge variety of foods, plus wifi which is both excellent and quite unique to the area.  You could tell it was good because it was off the main road and full of Asians.  I went with a friend, he had the pho and I had a rice dish.  Both were delicious and well made, very fresh (though a bit salty, but I'm quite sensitive to that; others would love it).  It was cheap enough that we got that plus a special drink and a scoop of ice cream and it was all less than $, quite the steal. I have had some absolutely horrible experiences with the SF Chinatown and the food there, so this place was a very welcome treat. Clean pho place in ChinatownDid not expect a pho place in Chinatown that was this clean! The inside was huge, with lots of seats and TVs close to the ceiling. I ordered the Pho that was part of the ""afternoon tea"" discount items, fully expecting the reduced price to lead to a small bowl of pho, but boy, was I wrong! The pho came in a huge metal salad bowl, with lots and lots of ingredients and many kinds of beef. The lemon iced tea was also very, very well made, with just the right amount of syrup and actual lemon flavor. The menu also has non vietnamese items as well (e. g. chinese rice dishes), probably because the place is in chinatown. All in all, an ok place to visit if you're craving for some pho in a clean place in ctown. Awesome place with great food, service and price.  I ordered a wonton soup which is my favorite , but what  made it even better was the option to choose my own type of noodles.  I had the pure rice noodle which I never had before abd it was thr perfect compliment to wontons. Also you must try the  color bean drink.  The menu has pictures with each item that helped since I am visual person. This place is awesome! You get SO much for less than $. Their noodle soups have ginormous portions and the sides are delicious. Beef Chow Fun is amazing. You can taste that old, aged wok. This restaurant has a very extensive menu. . And I mean extensive! A minimum of a double sided  page menu with at least  different dishes on each page making it incredibly hard to decide! Everything from Vietnamese, Cambodian and Chinese!  Food comes in stainless steel dishes/bowls, even the cups! (kinda reminds me too much of what I see being used in mainland china)I ordered the beef ball/shank/beef tripes ho fun noodle soup. It was good except I think it was missing a little kick to it. The soup had scallions, parsley and a side dish of the regular bean sprouts , mint leaves and lemon. I would come again to try something else. Glad that they accept credit cards! I ordered the dumplings with veggies. The soup is huge and really lovely in a savory broth. Fast service. The atmosphere is kind of boring, but clean and bright. A decent hokkien/teochiu (southern Fujian, northern Canton) noodle and rice joint.  They also offer Vietnamese food (a lot of Chinese from Vietnam are Teochiu).  I order the combo soup noodles  with thin rice noodles.  It was pretty light with fish balls, pork, shrimp, kidney, fried onion, g onions and bean sprouts.  The soup noodles remind me of the ones in Taiwan (most Taiwanese have ancestors from southern Fujian).  You can choose a variety of Teochiu/Fujian/Cantonese noodles : wide rice noodles (Cantonese fun), thin rice noodles (Fujian rice vermicelli or mi fen), thin Cantonese egg noodles, yellow noodles (round spaghetti like Fujian egg noodles), a couple of varieties of kway teow (round rice noodles from Fujian). This is one of my favorite restaurant I eat out and I always get number  all the time. Eating me some Chinese food for lunch I haven't been here in a while. Free wifi. The service is always friendly . If you go there around  to closed Don't order any noodle soup. First Time Experience:Walked in around pm on a Saturday afternoon for lunch after exploring chinatown. We randomly decided on this restaurant b/c we didn't do our research, it was nearby and there was a good crowd of Asians in there. We assumed that it had to be good if Asians eat there too! Wrong. . . Place is a no frills kinda place. . . lots of seating, no real decor, the orange seats match the orange polos of the waiters. Everyone just seemed to be focused on eating their food. Our waiter gave us water and complimentary hot tea. The menu was huge! It had tons of pictures, which was helpful. We ended up getting some beef stir fry, orange chicken and chicken fried rice. . Beef stir fry looked gross. . . like a congealed mass of beef, onions, and lots of corn starch gravy. Didn't look appetizing and tasted ok. Mall Chinese food tastes better than this crap. . Chicken fried rice was good, but nothing original or special. . Orange chicken was absolutely disgusting. The serving portion was quite sorry. We were both shocked how little there was especially given then fact that % was fried dough surrounding a morsel of chicken. The orange glaze was overwhelmingly citrusy. Just not goodService: Waiters here are all Asian women that speak broken English. They were polite, but not very helpful. We received a lot of glaring looks, since we were the only Americans in there at the time. It definitely made us feel uncomfortable. CON: Unlike other asian restaurants, you have to order white rice in addition to your meat entree. I didn't know that so I had to eat the beef stir fry by itself. . . thankfully, my friend ordered chicken fried rice so I took some from him. I'm just always used to asian restaurants always giving you a bowl of white rice with any entree order. Definitely will do my research on where the better places to eat are in chinatown. I do not recommend this place, especially to Americans that are unaware of authentic asian cuisine.  items on the menu. That's right. FOUR. HUNDRED. That means if you went there every day for a YEAR, you wouldn't get through everything. Got take out with some colleagues one day. Since I spoke the most fluent Cantonese, I was delegated to put in the order. After repeating my order x, the woman takes it, then says ""ok!"" and hangs up. *sigh. Typical Chinatown. Just assume it'll be done in  minutes if they hang up without giving you a time. What we had:Seafood on Crispy Noodle  Was pretty solid, but the seafood was the super cheap kind. Like, squid, fish balls, and fish cake. A couple of shrimp thrown in (tiny shrimp). I guess for $, I'm not expecting THAT much. But still. Some fish would have been nice. I mean. . . most of the seafood in the dish was processed. o. OBitter Melon with Chicken  Solid dish. Pretty sauced up, but the bitter melon was done right, and there was good flavor all around. Chicken was good, and NOT DRY. Ginger and Onion Beef  I was told this is one of their signatures. LOTS of ginger and onion. Though. . . the ginger wasn't all cut the same way. It should come out in slivers, so you can consume it all. I found whole slices of ginger. . . which make it tough eating. Service was pretty good, and they were quite prompt with our food. It was a bit confusing walking in to get our take out (wasn't sure if we were to walk to the counter in the back, or wait in the front, or what. . . ). Space looks clean, and I'd say if you want a variety of Chinese food, solid price, this would be a good place to try it. Delicious!  Great service. . Combination pure rice noodle $. . Chicken & Leek dumpling soup with vegetables $. . Combination fried pure rice noodle $. . Fish & Bitter Melon fried noodle $. . Pork Kidney with ginger and onion $. . Salted Fish & Chicken fried rice $.  I first ate here in high school when they were first located on Stockton in a much smaller place next to Little Paris. What people aren't understanding that this place is a chaozhou or teochew cuisine WHICH is Chinese and not Vietnamese so please don't just assume its a Vietnamese restaurant because they serve Pho  i could go on about this but i'll just continue by reviewing the food. They have a large menu with pictures to display what dishes they serve. The new location is a lot bigger and cleaner. I always get the Chicken Pho on cold days and scrambled eggs over beef chow fun on the warmer days. My mom loved the seafood fried crispy noodles. They most definitely raised the prices but can't blame them for needing to keep up with surviving in this country. They have great customer service and free wifi :) Found this place wandering around Chinatown on a rainy day . The service was amazing, the food was brought directly to us. I most definitely recommend this restaurant. I love their crispy noodles! lets go as simple as possible: large variaties of food here, cheap with very plain taste. First off please note that this is a chiu chow style cuisine,known for its seafood and vegetarian dishes and is commonly regarded as being healthy. Its use of flavouring is much less heavy handed than most other Chinese cuisines and depends much on the freshness and quality of the ingredients for taste and flavour. As a delicate cuisine, oil is not often used in large quantities and there is a relatively heavy emphasis on poaching, steaming and braising, as well as the common Chinese method of stir fry. Love their chicken and leek dumplings, I always have it with half egg and half rice noodles. They also do a great job with pork kidneys with green onions and ginger, the Chinese version of liver and onions.  Pick and choose correctly and you will be rewarded.  Quality of food was slightly better in their original location on Stockton, however growth and increasing staff can dilute what they've done well in the past, but I will still visit and get my dumplings! starts for the chicken and leek dumplings in noodle soup.  stars for the pork kidneys, they don't give as much as they used to.  stars for affordability.  stars for service and cleaniness. Happy hour =$.  Sapporo?! Sounds amazing to me.  The food seemed to be extremely oily but still yummy.  We got the chow mein, vegetable pot sticks, and hot&sour soup.  By far the BEST hot &sour soup!  It was only $.  &they gave you so much.  I shared with my boyfriend &we both got  servings each.  The service was alright, didn't get my water glass refilled but I think the waitress was training which is understandable.  The waitresses were still very sweet. Short Story:Meh. . . an okay place that serves Chinese and Vietnamese food in Chinatown. Long Story:I came here on a Saturday afternoon with friends and I got the house special fried rice.  The meat tasted a bit funny and the shrimp was not completely de veined.  Although this is pretty common of most Asian restaurants.  The service was lacking as was the ambiance and decor.  But then again, you can't expect a whole lot coming from Chinatown. Verdict:I will not be back. While the food was acceptable, I would look elsewhere. We had been trekking through Chinatown and were growing hungry. Not wanting to indulge on Dim Sum we stumbled upon San Sun. Probably an OK place if I had never had real Vietnamese food, but given that I have certain expectations it was a real let down. I've dined at Chinese run Vietnamese places before that have really good food but unfortunately this wasn't one of them. July th was great fun this year, making the pilgrimage to San Francisco, except the highlight of eating out in Chinatown with family didn't come close to meeting expectation. We relied on Yelp for a leg up and have a hard time acknowledging anyone rating San Sun above  stars. There were few patrons in the restaurant which should have raised a flag. The decorum had little appeal. The eating utensil were no better than that used to camp out. The menu was many pages long and everyone was hungry so we went against our better judgement and ordered. The greens eaten were fresh and hot but nothing else ordered was palatable. The barbecued meat was extremely dried and over salted. In fact two of us eating that dish had upset stomachs for a couple of days. I've traveled Asia for  weeks once, living out of Beijing and have never had a regretful meal there. This experience was so bad it will be quite some time before our family will try this kind of experience again unless we have a personal review we can trust. It looks like a Vietnamese restaurant from the outside, and even their first few pages of the menu are dedicated to Vietnamese dishes, but this is quite clearly a Chinese style restaurant.  Don't be deceived by the menu because their pho is far from good.  What kind of place actually asks you what kind of noodles you want in your pho?  Our hero wanted to try what it would be like with egg noodles (oh the folly of such a decision), and was sorely disappointed. The service is kind of clueless and was unable to provide any decent recommendations of menu items and had minimal English speaking abilities.  The waitress didn't even understand that our hero wanted to order wings as an appetizer, and he was left waiting until after he finished his main course for a dish that never came. PROS: It's hella cheap. CONS: The Vietnamese side of their menu is definitely not authentic and poorly thrown together.  The kitchen looks kind of dirty and sketchy.  Servers have communication issues. Been coming here since their old location and it's still really good. Never lets me down. I ordered the Beef Satay Noodles and it was good as usual, but I asked for not so spicy. When I got my order, it was REALLY spicy. That was the only thing that disappointed me, but every other time I go, the food is always delicious. The service is always great. A friend and I ate here; she got stir fried noodles with vegetables and tofu, and I got vegetable noodle soup.  Both dishes were pretty unpalatable.  My soup was bland as can be, a very simple clear broth with stuff thrown in.  Her dish was covered in a slimy, clear gravy with little flavor and bad texture. Given how simple my dish was, it's remarkable that I got quite sick after eating here.  My stomach wrestled with itself for a good   hours after finishing half a bowl of soup (needless to say, I left the rest behind). So why two stars, not one?  Well, I imagine some people like bland food.  It wasn't awful in that regard.  As for getting sick, it's a dice throw.  And as someone who has traveled to less hygienic lands, I'm pretty forgiving of stomach distress.  One just always hope the meal was worth it.  Not this time. A very traditional Chinese canteen.  A lot of good eats from noodles to rice plates.  What really made me write this review was their fried fish balls.  I had to order a second plate.  It was extremely yummy! I loved them at their old location, but they had to move because of the new Chinatown station to be build there.  Now I have to deal with walking up the hill to this newer, larger, quieter location.  If I have time for a meal in Chinatown  this is where I go.  The only two things I have tried and will get would be . Satay Noodle Soup (in various meats, depending on my mood)  . Satay Beef Crispy NoodlesThat should say a lot about the satay. I thought this place went downhill after the move until I came back recently.  I have discovered why.  When ordering noodle soups, please DO NOT order any type of rice noodle.  Go with egg noodle.  Not sure what it is but trust me you will enjoy your meal, a lot.  We did order a stir fry kidney dish, which was good but was filled with onions.  The whole plate had maybe  pieces of pork kidney and was the most expensive thing we ordered compared to the noodles. If they were consistent in their food, they would receive  stars in my book. Since one good dish can't outweigh all the downfalls of this place, here are  stars to my love for their satay noodles! Great soup! My girl and I got the Cambodian combination rice noodle soup. Delicious. They give you big portions so we shared.  We also got egg rolls, can't complain. One star less for IDing and questioning me AFTER I received my beer. And for the weird fact everything was in metal bowls, cups, plates. It felt like prison. With delicious food. I ducked into this restaurant as I was running away from some bad men in Chinatown; that's the last time I'll parkour in the area. The adrenaline subsided and hunger began to set in so I sat down. Their menu landed on the table with a thud and it is huge! I flipped through the all of its pages, changed my mind five times before finally deciding on the scrambled egg chicken ho fun; funny to say and delicious to eat! It arrived hot with the scrambled eggs on top covering the chicken and ho fun on an aluminum plate. The ho fun was well cooked with a soft texture and adding some Sriracha sauce really makes everything come to life! I swear I heard the chicken bawking, ""why me?"" as I chew away at the meat. The price is very reasonable at about $ per plate and this place's endless menu choices menu are ideal for those who want to try four different cuisines in just one place. In addition, it is a great hideout for any foot chase involving bad men or lustful ladies. I remember eating here whenever I went to SF Chinatown with my mom when I was young. It was always the combination hofun noodle soup for me with a ton of hot sauce and chili peppers. My soup has to be red. I don't remember the menu being that crazy. . . so many options!  Different kinds of noodles, meat, etc. The combination noodle soup was delicious. The kidney stir fry was just ok. The sauce was way too thick and the kidneys were overcooked. Too dry. I still prefer VH noodle house's kidney with ginger and onions. I need to come back to try their noodle stir fry and the other millions of options! Very delighted to still see this restaurant around.  This restaurant has been with me growing up. I don't live in SF anymore but whenever i go back to visit, the food is always good.  My favorite dish is the beef and egg over chow fun.  It is the bomb.  I also really like the satay beef noodle, and their pho is good too.  Their food is always hot and made to order.  This is the to go place in whenever I go to SF!  This place is awesome, they have free wifi toO!  This place surely reminds me of my childhood!"|4|81|5|Routine Inspection| Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 11/5/2014 ] Unclean or unsanitary food contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 11/5/2014 ] Moderate risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 11/5/2014 ] Improper thawing methods   [ date violation corrected: 11/5/2014 ] Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 11/5/2014 ]
San Sun Restaurant 1|3.5|Chinese in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|117|1|3.61111111111|" Pretty good, but nothing special. We got the chow mein with beef curry, a won ton soup, and half of a Hainan chicken. The chow mein had great flavor. The soup broth was forgettable, but the dumplings were amazing. The chicken was a rather sorry excuse for Hainan chicken, but it was accompanied by an amazing dipping sauce that rescued it. I have better memories of the old location. It was ok for (downtown) Chinatown, but it's not near as good as most of the places in the Sunset or the Richmond. Huge food menu with low cost. I love Gourmet chicken here and varieties soup a lot. . . You cann't imagine how taste it be. . . Until your tongue takes it here. So hurriley go there and say with praise WONDERFUL ! I love the food here. We always order the spicy beef tripe and the salty chicken fried rice. The only thing I HATE about this place are those damn metal coated plates, bowls, and utensils. They never stay in place and one of the ladies here spilled that greesy shit all over my shoes b/c again, those plates never stay in place. It is pretty simple really. Their menu is too big. There is no way, NO WAY that a restaurant can make that many things well. Focus on making several things great instead of a thousand things mediocre. And think about it. . . With a menu that large, how can they stock everything so it is fresh? They can't. i only get #, a noodle soup which comes with both vermicelli and egg noodles, shrimp, pork, and a bunch of chives. they also give you a vinegar and garlic mix that you can add into the soup (i usually add about one spoonful). San Sun is a pretty cool place. The restaurant is clean and inviting. Service was great. The menu is huge, reading like a novel. If you don't like reading, you can always gaze at the menu items on the big HD tv's. Free Wi Fi to boot. Food is very good and comes out very fast. If you speak to the staff in Cantonese, they might place your food on a regular plate and not the aluminum plate everyone else seems to get (just an observation, I'm sure there's no bias   =)   ) An overall enjoyable experience, having lunch while catching bits of the NFL playoff game. A very quick place to stop in for an inexpensive bowl of Vietnamese, or Cambodian soup. This place is really lunch only. I've had better Pho, and don't expect to get the best bowl of Pho you've ever had. Yet, it's decent. Stay away from the seafood soups. Fishy smell. The ingredients are a bit sketchy by American standards. Yet, service is fast, and they serve complimentary tea. Love this place for it's combination ""ho fun"" noodles (the flat wide rice noodles). The combination comes with shrimp, pork and chicken meat. The broth is very flavorful, very similar to Oakland Chinatown's Vien Hoang. This place serves tons of other stuff too! Great lunch spot and super reasonable too. San Sung is amazing. Everything in this place's wonderful: taste good, cheap & good portion. On top of all these, there're like  food items to choose from the menu. I'd recommend trying their noodle. They're delicious, & has good consistency. They go about $  $ for noodle soup. Their beef & fish balls're pretty good too; very rich in flavor. You can get them for about  bucks. Combination Fried Noodle ($. )  Love this dish!  I highly suggest make it a Crispy Fried Noodle for only  cents. The crispy noodle, sauce & meat all blend very well together. Overall: You can't go wrong with this place. I went to this place  times within a week and ordered different food everytime; They all turned out good! Their noodle's the highlight of my experience here. Good authentic Chinese food, cheap price & good portions  What's not to love?!?! However, the service can be pretty bad at times. This is my go to soup place in Chinatown.  Always good, always cheap, always clean and there are plenty of televisions to watch a game on.  Plus the best bars are right around the corner. I visited recently with my family of eight. We each ordered a noodle dish. Portions were generous and the food was tasty . Best dish of the day was the grilled chicken with noodle soup. Prices were inexpensive. Will be back.  Star average on Yelp? You've gotta be kidding me!We saw all the delicious pictures from the outside and it looked clean and modern inside. So we gave it a shot. Dissapointed!I ordered the Satay Beef tendon with noodle soup. What I got was Dinty Moore Beef Stew Soup with Tendons + Tobasco sauce with Noodles. Then again, there was no soup! The ""soup""  was so thick it was more of a sauce. And it tasted dead on like Dinty Moore canned stew. My spouse ordered a basic chicken noodle soup. She said it tasted like instant noodle soup base with cheap quality noodles. Also very few chicken bits. But at least hers came out as SOUP and not SAUCE. Also I'm not a fan of the steel dinnerware. Bowls, cups, and chopsticks are stainless steel.  It feels and looks tacky. Are we in prison? Plus steel chopsticks and steel bowls dont make very nice noises when rubbed against each otherI would give this place  star but I usually reserve those for places that are offensive or insulting in some way. . This is more of a .  star place. Half a star for the place being clean and modern looking. Service was average for this type. Service was quick. Food was good. I was a bit iffy about coming here. . . as we were in Chinatown. . and my first thought from the name was Vietnamese food in CHINAtown? But I gave in and decided to give it a try. . They have a HUGE menu. . and it was kinda hard to decide what I wanted. . . and I settled for what I typically get at a Pho restaurant. . since my niece was getting a Chinese noodle dish, my husband was getting a, what I call, unique dish. . . so we were set. . we'd get to try everything. . . then my hubby suggested we order wonton too. . which we did. . :)We all ended getting the yellow noodle. . . which I kind of regret. . not because it wasn't good. . but I wish I got to try a different noodle! The wontons were YUM. My  tripe was as expected. . and my niece LOVED her yellow noodles. . . she's super picky so I'm super happy she liked the food and ate lots of it. She also really like the wontons as well! This would definitely be a place I would consider eating at again the next time I head to Chinatown! Good pho.  Good vermicelli.  Huge menu with good prices.  Nascar was on the tv, which is weird, but interesting.  Service could've been faster, but it wasn't bad. I like this place! Although their menu is ridiculous with their hundreds of items, I've enjoyed my food each time I've been here. Bun with grilled chicken  Fresh veggies and noodles, chicken was juicy and had good flavor. Loved it!Seafood noodle soup (menu said Cambodian style?)  Piping hot with a good balance of noodles and the seafood and meat. Yummy!Seafood congee  If you've never had chiu chow style congee this may look wrong to you, but it tastes so right! Chiu chow style congee is pretty much super cooked down rice in soup. Definitely can't compare to grandma's but they did pretty damn good. Revived me when I was dying from a terrible cold. And they had generous amounts of fish cake, fish balls, and shrimp. Great for those cold gloomy days ahead. Their service was normal, actually pretty friendly for Chinatown standards. I'll be back! We ordered five things and they were all pretty bland. Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings  worst I've had yet.  It was more like they battered it with flour and then sprinkled the chinese pepper salt on it(the one you eat with congee)Curried Fish Balls  these were alright but still pretty bland for a 'curry' dishHu Tieu Combo w/ Egg Noodle  this smelled good but tasted pretty blandShrimp Foo Young  not terribleWon Ton  my bf complained it was bland Service was great! Our waitress was helpful and fast. The food was just OK. Beef noodle soup was so so and feel really thirsty afterward. Milk tea was not strong enough and it was a bit tasteless. I would say if you are visitor don't mind to come here. If you are in SF all the time come try it and see if you like it or not. Had the curry beef rice for  bucks or so. Pretty tasty!SCARY and HUGE menu!They accept credit card too!

San Sun Restaurant 2|3.5|Chinese in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|117|2|3.66666666667|" The Pho and rice dish was  stars.  Really great if you can put up with the  Star service, and the ridiculously large menu. I had to ask at least three times during the meal for a refill on my water (I tend to go overboard with the Sriracha  sometimes), the soup took + minutes to arrive in a partially full room at pm.  And a neighboring family was making a huge racket banging silverware on the table throwing chopsticks around, etc. . . and the staff made no effort to correct it. This place has always been a ""must go"" every time I come to Chinatown. I love their varieties of noodle soup where you can choose the types of noodle you want. Their price is very reasonable for a portion size that big. They moved to this new location from their old site on Stockton St. Now I don't have to worry about getting a seat any more! :D This place reminds me of China. The decor, set up, and even the flashing bathroom signs. The restaurant is clean but that's because it's still new. Let's see how it holds up a year from now. There are numerous TVs all along the wall. Kind of pointless though because they don't air anything interesting. There were two TVs that were used as clocks, one that was rotating menu items, and another one airing a Jerry Springer like show. When you get to ordering, the menu is overwhelming because it's pages and pages of food but at least they have pictures. When we got our food, they came in metal bowls with metal chopsticks. There was even a page in the menu that emphasized that the chopsticks were not to be taken home. I must admit that they were pretty niffy.  I ordered the Taiwanese noodle soup. The flavors were good but I did not care for the meat. My beef was so rubbery that I could not eat it. They also have a good selection of noodles. Overall, good place for a quick lunch. I would come back! Overall .  starsBeen here many times over the last year. Food doesn't disappoint. Menu is HUGE and has tons of pictures to help the diner chose. TOO many options if you ask me!Imperial Roll are good, but dinky in size. Scramble egg (runny type) plates are excellent. Think it's odd that everything is served on/in/with metal  ie chopsticks, side dishes, bowl, plates, cups. Feels a bit like prison. Was walking around China Town latter in the evening. Found this place open later then most others,, Yea!!   Used the restroom,, Very clean,, Yea!!   A great place. . I hope they keep it clean as it is now,, as it is hard to find nice clean economical places to eat in China Town!! Well hard to find even clean places. . .   Huge menu, cool flat screen t. v. s, free WiFi! Great place to sit and relax when visiting China town. .   And the price is right, Huge bowl of fish ball soup for $ with complimentary hot tea. . I look forward to going back and trying more items in the near future.   The minus one star almost minus two is for the poor service. . Do not get me wrong the people are very nice, I met the owner he is very friendly and we had a nice short conversation. . .    But the staff needs to be trained to better describe/suggest items to those of us ""visiting China Town"". I actually would have ordered more food but did not feel I was welcome to as I was told when I first came in the kitchen closed in  min and needed to order everything now. I was not offered to order more even when  yes SEVEN other tables came in well after me including  arriving  min before closing. I was not checked on or offered a beverage other then tea as I would have liked a diet coke. The servers do not smile and are not inviting. . . Now this may be a cultural thing but they are in business in a high tourist area. . .   I WILL be going back as I really liked the food and the price! Solid food in a nice location!  Huge menu with  or so items.  Many of the soups are meals in themselves!  Entree portions are generous to say the least.  Every thing we had was very well prepared.  Following the custom in China, dishes tend to come out as they are ready resulting in everything being hot when served which I like.  Two soups,  apps,  entree and  beers came to about $ with T&T.  Great deal, will be back next time in SF. Solid diner style chinese.  There was a good split of Chinese and non chinese customers. Tables have the Sriacha, fish sauce and other necessary condiments.  Menu is huge.  We had the sweet and sour fish and grilled pork over rice  both great. I'll be back  lots more I want to try. The two stars are for neutral/indifferent service, and for pretty okay but not outstanding food. My tofu was chewy and just. . . There in my chow mein and vegetables. That being said, there's an ENTIRE page for vegetarian food, pictures for every dish and noodle option. Portions DO tend to go large, so come hungry!Total for my family of four was $, and we even threw in an appetizer. Very affordable. Don't take beef! I was a fan of the original location on Stockton, so I was concerned that the new location might lack some of the charm and quality now that it's so close to Grant. But it was fabulous as always. We got there a little late on a Sunday. It wasn't crowded and we ended up closing down the place. I had a spicy prawn dish that was excellent. My son opted for pork kidney and was also pleased. I enjoyed talking with the staff. They were great. I love san sun! Whenever i'm at chinatown, this is where you'll find me. I usually order the hainam chicken. They taste pretty good compare to other restaurants! And the fried wonton are delicious snacks! This place has gotten much bigger at the new location. Cheap price and workers aren't rude! It's been a year since I've come to this place. . . I was so looking forward to come back. Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations. Food was not comparable to a year ago. Portions have changed and their milk tea is half the size it was before AND it's not as good anymore! Still love the Mapo Tofu, but I don't think that will be enough to make me come back. . . Sorry San Sun! ): One of my favorite restaurants in Chinatown. The menu is huge, the portions are big and the food is excellent. The prices are reasonable and the place is very clean. Huge restaurant. Huge menu. Simple and easy menu to navigate. It's all written out for you and you can personalize pretty much everything. It's like. . how do you say, the self serve of restaurants, minus the part where you don't cook the food. . ? lolI think someone counted like  flat screen tv/monitors playing the news/advertising food they serve. FREE WIFI~They serve foods that you would find in a Chinese and Vietnamese restaurant. I've come here twice and I've made the following conclusions:) Chicken pho with ho fun (rice noodles)  Yummy. The portion size is just enough and they don't skimp too much on the chicken. Soup is yummy. ) Hainan chicken with rice  not something you should order 'cause they don't make it like other places. . a lot of bones and not too tasty) Lemon grass chicken with rice noodles  smelled delicious and tasty according to the other members of my partyThe prices here are good, since it's Chinatown so it's cheaper than most restaurants outside of Chinatown. Great pho.  Great prices.  Not much else to say. My girlfriend and I had our very first meal in San Francisco here while on vacation. I'm used to the Vietnamese restaurants in New York where they all pretty much have the same exact menu and everything is laid out in the same place on the menu. I was a little dumbfounded with the menu here at San Sun. There were just so many things to choose from. Pages and pages of different foods; some not even of Vietnamese or Chinese origin. I ordered the closest thing I could find to a classic NYC styled # pho noodle; the pho with everything. I can't remember the name of it now but it was the last item on the pho page of the menu. It was a pretty big bowl of noodles and beef parts. The broth wasn't bad either. It wasn't all too amazing but it definitely hit the spot. My girlfriend ordered the better dish of the meal. She had the Beef with Egg Sauce over Haw Fun. This thing was so amazingly delicious. We have beef and egg sauce all the time back home but we've never had it over haw fun. It took a lot of willpower from her to share some with me and even more willpower from me to not eat it all when she did share. The place is pretty clean and very well lit. There's even hand sanitizer outside of the bathrooms to use. Our waitress was a very nice lady. She informed us that you can park outside of the restaurant for free if you eat there. Definitely one of the best meals I had while in SF! The place is really big, always enough space for everyone. I ordered a wonton noodle soup. The tea they gave us had some chrysanthamum in it, which was a nice touch. The noodles were pretty dry and hard, probably not cooked all the way through. The wontons were whatever, not bad but not especially tasty either. Overall, just fine, nothing to brag about. Big props for it being clean, because that seems like a luxury in Chinatown. Since discovering this place a few months ago, I've been coming here for lunch at least half a dozen times now.  I always order something new since there are over  items on their menu.  What stood out for me so far are their fried rice (I've had  of their options under that category so far), each time perfectly cooked with a hint of smokiness that I look for.  They also prepare their shrimps, which are thoroughly de veined, and cook them well, with just the right amount of crunch and firmness upon biting into one.  And for those who are bitter melon aficionados like me, they also serve them just right, al dente and thin enough so you are not overwhelmed by the bittrerness but not so thin that the flavor is lost.  What I also like about this restaurant is its cleanliness, including the bathrooms.  In Chinatown, that counts for a lot!! I love this Vietnamese restraunt.  The pork dry bun is the best in the neighborhood.  This is also one of the cleanest restraunts of this type.  Prices are fantastic and If atmosphere matters to you, this is an oasis. Can't go wrong here. Don't underestimate a Pho restaurant in China Town. It's way good. Nice restaurant to sit and eat. Not like those small, crowded, or no seat restaurants in other parts of Chinatown. Yummy fried rice in a variety of flavors and meat choices. So very good after a long hard bike ride over the Golden Gate Bridge. The place was super clean, service was good, the menu was easily discernable, and the food was terrific. I wasn't completely sold on the shrimp egg foo young because it had too many onions, but everything else was divine. Great little place to eat local in Chinatown, San Francisco. Don't miss it. We stumbled on this place out of the 's of Chinese food restaurants after walking through the ally's in China Town. The first thing we noticed was the menu was huge! Can't remember how many thick plastic covered pages there were but if you are the kind of person who can't decide from hundreds of choices, don't go there!I have not seen choices like this except at a Vietnamese restaurant, so there must be a mix here which I like as I get lots of choices. We got  dishes. My wife got sweet and sour chicken. We got chow mein and I got fish with bitter melon. It was really good. Its always a treat when I find bitter melon. The prices were some of the lowest since we arrived in SF. So we will diffidently find this place again when in SF. One thing worth mentioning is that my wife is allergic to carrots, peanuts, lettuce etc. We talked to the waitress and she checked several times for us to make sure there was no peanuts or peanut oil used in here dish. Of course if a restaurant fails to find out or go out of their way to find out, we would not even give them  star! no matter how great they are. . . pretty modern for a Chinatown cheap eat joint. They have plasma's everywhere and use a touch system for a huge menu of Chinese ad Vietnamese dishes that can frankly be confusing with the sheer scope of the options available. Ordered the Vietnamese beef rice plate with an order of imperial egg rolls and a Viet iced coffee. All were pretty mediocre from the stale rice to the tiny imperial rolls. The prices are rock bottom and the place is clean with good service hence the extra star. I see much better options nearby worth a second look. I was so bummed that I haven't been to old Stockton Street location. But I'm glad that old location has CLOSED!The new location took over the historic Sun Wah Kue location, which been there since the Pacific Railroad Act of . ""You knew that, right?""On my debut of the new relocated restaurant, I was browsing through the glossy, colorful and extensive menu. The new joint serves Chinese (Mandarin & Cantonese) and Vietnamese Cuisines. ""Did somebody say, Vietnamese?""And that is what I ordered for lunch #: Bun Ghau Yau Bo Nhuong.  For $. , the bowl had grilled chicken, cold vermicelli noodles, a cut up egg roll and fresh vegetables all in one bowl with a dipping sauce. You have noticed the egg roll without the ""s"", is because I only received one in my dish. Other than that, the bowl was fine. I also had a Vietnamese Iced coffee with my meal. I needed because I was sleepy. As I was enjoying my meal, I was also watching NBA Basketball. ""A couple of old men, dining there and sitting next to me, cheered for. . . Jeremy Lin? I'm shocked!""And here is another shocking part. The Health Department gave the new restaurant a score of: , which were graded in the beginning of February of . That is pretty clean for a Chinatown business. A new and clean restaurant, but I do feel optimistic about the score of .  Unlike the historic Sun Wah Kue restaurant, no free slice of pie. Decent food and I hope the new San Sun will start a new chapter where the old business left off."|4|88|3|Routine| Employee eating or smoking  [ date violation corrected: 10/23/2012 ] Inadequately cleaned or sanitized food contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 10/23/2012 ] Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities  [ date violation corrected: 10/23/2012 ]
San Sun Restaurant 3|3.5|Chinese in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|117|3|3.76470588235|" This place has decent Chinese food.  It's clean inside and the servers are nice.  I had the Hainan Chicken and it was ok.  Their chicken pieces are mostly bones and skin but the rice is awesome.  It comes with a soup on the side and a tasty sauce to pour over the rice.  Husband had the pan fried noodles with seafood and it was HUGE!  It was also pretty tasty. This restaurant recently moved from Stockton St. This is a huge space, so you can usually always get a seat. I don't like how they installed TV's. I don't remember the soup base being sour in the old location, but it was sour the last time I went. I like ordering the fried fish ball soup. This place use to be on Stockton and they had to relocate because of the city working on the underground lightrail muni/bart systemWith the new spot, the lighting is better, and the decor is better, but their food is still the same. Their menu is huge, and its so hard to decide what to get cuz there are so many optionsI ordered a bowl a pho this one day and it was horrendous. There was literally three pieces of meat and that was it. The soup was not tasty at all and I barely ate it. Their service is also lacking. No refill on tea. No greeting when walking in. Tried the pho, and it was pretty good. Not the greatest but not the worst. You get a ton of noodles from there wide selection and meat proportion is fairly decent. Prices are decent, location is fairly convenient if your in china town. I would drop by here if I needed some fairly cheap eats that is decent. quick and fresh chinese food. the menu is a bit overwhelming, and if you order the wrong thing you will hate this place. i recommend anything with those fat chow mein noodles and vegetables that don't look cheap. the sauce they use on their dishes is light and not too salty. it doesn't taste like MSG is added, although i've never askeddefinitely better for your digestive system than z&y Used to be my favorite restaurant in Chinatown at its old location, and while the quality has dropped a bit, still a great place to stop by.  Having come here a few dozen times, I'd say to avoid the fried noodle stuff and stick with the chow fun and rice noodle dishes.  Their fish balls/slices are decent, and while their broth isn't that flavorful, their noodles are good enough that it all comes together right.  Their grilled chicken with pho is also great, but they don't' give you  nearly enough of that terrific tasting chicken. One thing to keep in mind here is that you can pretty much order whatever you want in terms of noodles or meats.  They have a bit more than half a dozen types of soup noodles, and around the same number of choices for stir fried noodles.  My personal favorite combination is the Satay Beef Stew Chow Fun.  It's usually a a bit more wet than I like it rather than crisply stir fried like in the past, but the taste is usually still there.  But in case you  need more taste, they have their house brand satay sauce in a little silver tin.  Usually has really fast service, but you have to be a bit more assertive than at some other restaurants in the area as it gets a bit chaotic sometimes. Their menu is HUGE. If you're hung over and want cheap, soupy Asian food, this is a one stop location. They have tons of chinese, taiwanese, and even vietnamese cuisine. I got their chicken pho and thought it was very bland and mediocre. But my friend got the spicy beef noodle soup which was good. Perhaps I am a bit spoiled with chinese food in LA, but we ordered egg rolls and they gave us  wimpy looking pieces. I like this place! The chicken pho with ho fun is awesome. It always hits the spot for me especially if it's cold out. I was battling a cold for a week and came here to load up on tea and chicken pho. They are pretty consistent with their food and the menu is enormous. In fact, it could probably be skimmed down a bit because it started to feel like an encyclopedia when I first came here. Good prices and good eats. There aren't too many restaurants like this in Chinatown, so it's a gem to me. The biggest plus for me was that I rode my bike here and the employee let me leave it inside while I ate. That always gains huge points in my book! First time coming the new location San Sun where it is much more cleaner with more space with more TV's. Came with a group and got bowls of beef noodle soup. The noodles tasted very good and we were able to mix with other types of noodles, topped off with some hot sauce, and hoisin sauce. BEWARE: The hot sauce is super hot don't over use it. Free wifi that is very fast where else can you get wifi in Chinatown. Good Place & Food to Eat. This place is very clean unlike other Chinatown Restaurant ! The noodle is different than any other Noodle restaurant. You can custom you noodle too haha such as: Mix  or  different kind of noodle and custom add on for about $  !! Wo hoo I love this place! It is bright and clean and it opens late! We each got a bowl of noodle soup and it is so big that none of us finished it! To be honest, I think they gave us way too many noodles. I really love my sacha seafood noodle soup because it is spicy, and full of flavors. We also got a plate of sauteed vegetables. Would love to come back one day! Since the old place moved here and yelp hasnt combined the two, decided to edit what i had from the previous location. I love this place. They have a massive menu which is even larger because there are so many options for the noodles. They are really friendly and nice when ordering and probably the only resturant that i know of in chinatown that went 'high tech' with ordering. The new place is bigger, but there is noticeably less foot traffic here. You may have issues ordering in english, but they are patient with you and the menus have a lot of photos so you know what your getting yourself into. Their portion sizes have decreased a lot and i would rather they just increase the price instead of giving less. The food quality has also dropped a bit, but there is something there that should appeal to you. good prices, large menu!you can get just about anything with noodles here.  good food, good service, good prices. I have been to their old location on Stockton. Came here for some rainy day takeout  sweet & sour fish, XO sauce chicken, Chinese broccoli and beef chow fun. Well, the food wasn't all that great. I understand that they specialize in noodles and other, well, less Anglo friendly items. I think I would have been a lot happier with their noodle soups, etc, but it was harder to do carry out. Will remember that next time I need some comfort food. Your average HK Chinese joint. . . but they are cheap and they have a huge variety of dishes.  I will admit, being Chinese and being born and raised in San Francisco, I usually NEVER go to Chinatown for Chinese food. . . strange huh. . it's usually Americanized Chinese food (not quite Panda Express. . but pretty comparable) with jacked up prices to lure tourists. . . yeah no thanks homeyBut this place surprised me.  It's a pretty sizable location with plenty of tables.  We went right at the peak of lunch time and still got a table immediately.  Service is fast (not the best since it is an Asian joint), portions are decent. . . so it's not too bad at all. My favorite noodle place ever. Whenever I go out for lunch in Chinatown % of the time I would go here even though its a far walk from the office. I usually get the combination noodle soup with clear noodles. Not many places have clear noodles.  =[  I love their satay sauce, its the best satay sauce ever! I'm glad they moved to a bigger location so the wait time isn't as long. This place is too good not to be yelped!  I ordered their chicken and egg over crispy fried noodle.  It is heaven!  I'm normally feeling ok after eating something like that, but this time on this hot and uncomfortable San Francisco day, I'm feeling like a winner after eating this.  This is making Tuesday. i almost freaked out when i went to their old location on stockton st and realized they weren't there anymore. thank goodness, i actually read the little sign and realized they had moved to washington st. the new location is HUGE!! we didn't even have to wait for a table! i think it's cash only. . . but don't quote me on that. everything on the menu is super cheap and fulfilling. and did their menu expand? bf ordered the bbq chicken over rice and the plate was stacked with so much rice and big pieces of chicken. he loved it! i ordered my usual. . . the combo yellow/rice noodles with the fried scrimp thing. mMm. . . and of course i doused my bowl with the garlic vinegar. so delicious!! of course, service is still lacking. . . but i don't care. they still get  stars from me! i was a regular back at their stockton location.   i remember liking their pho, even though they always had dead baby flies swimming around in their soup, which adds to the chinatown authenticity.  when i walked in for a quick lunch i was immediatly seated and had  on  service!  i felt kind of pressured but thats good service i guess?i had an old favorite combination: the soup/noodles + bbq chicken (huge portions for $. !).    the chicken was just as juicy as i remembered it however it did not have that same sweet chinese bbq taste that i remembered.  it was also swimming in a pool of grease and came with plenty of green onions, which some people may like or dislike.   the soup was fresh and clean tasting and to my surprise, it did not have flies!  my noodles were a little clumped together and slightly over done however. . . don't get the iced condensed milk tea because it is watered down and a rip offaverage  star food, + star for above average service, + star for no more baby flies,  star for the less tasty chicken The og location was on stockton st. they moved to this location which has more space, the seating was good enough pretty roomy. . . Alot of people were complaining about the services,for me it's a basic chinatown restaurant service. . Sorry guys but alot of restaurants in chinatown have bad service, i only order the scramble egg dishes # and on that's what this place is known for people. . oh and fyi if your coming in on lunch rush hour  pm good luck, For the best services and food show up after pm As someone else said, the menu is crazy big, they basically have all types of meat with various types of noodles/rice etc. I had the hor fun with beef and egg which I thought was pretty good  portion size is ok, in fact good for the price. The hainanese chicken was very tasty albeit also on the smaller side. It was nice inside, probably due to it being the new location. My biggest frustration was the metal dishware that it was served on kept spinning around as I attacked my food. Probably come back to try something else on the extensive menu. Looks like they went to all the other restaurants in Chinatown and then merged it into a super menu! Food is good and cheap.  The menu is quite extensive. . . so it can make a person indecisive :)  The metal serving dishes and flatware is a little weird, but not enough to stop me from coming back for good food. used to always order take out at the old location. i went to the new location recently. ordered the hainan chicken w/ rice. the soup that it comes with tastes super bland to me this time. i love the ginger sauce that it comes with, but did the portions shrink? nonetheless, it was able to fill me up. the service is quick, but pretty good. the new location looks nicer. i love how there's so many things on the menu to choose from, but it also makes it tough for me to choose what i want! Not as great as what I expected. I believe this is their new location besides the one on stockton. Ordered the chicken noodle soup, broth is clear yet it taste like its full of MSG and salt. Had the satay fish ball, it tasted like rubber balls. Im not trying to be mean but Im just trying to be honest on what I experienced. Lots of selections, from what type of noodles to what do you want in your plate. I think theres just too much going on that they are not focusing on preparing or mastering one type of food, whether its chinese, vietnamese or something different. Therefore it doesnt seem authentic, majority of the customers were tourists and non asians. . . . Besides that, the restaurant looked cleaned and there are tons of LCD screen all over the restaurant showing you the pictures of the meal on them. Suggested by a local. The old store was located near the intersection of Stockton and Washington. The new location has pretty nice decor for a Chinese restaurant that isn't a wedding venue. There are lots of tv screens displaying the menu and of course TVB. The food options and the way the food is served reminds me of Hong Kong. It can also be that it's in Chinatown. . Combination Noodle soup with thick white and yellow noodles: Extra .  for  types of noodles and extra $ for dry noodles (without the soup). Even though the soup base was pretty bland, it was still oily possibly due to the noodles. The white noodles were silky smooth and the yellow noodles weren't too rough. More suitable for a hangover cure as opposed to a lunch dish. Fish Filet with bell peppers and onions: more flavorful commpared to the noodle soup. Not too salty and would pair well with rice. Singapore vermicelli: also bland. The noodles were also were too hard. overall the dish wasn't very appetizing. Service: most of the workers are nice except one. The younger waitress is more blunt and speaks to you like she is having a bad day. Even if she did, should still be courteous to your customers. Also I should have gotten commission for getting tourists to try the restaurant. My party was sitting near the window and we saw tourists peering into the window to determine if the restaurant was worth trying. We caught them staring and started waving and smiling at them. After a quick deliberation, the party of  entered the restaurant. Our meal should have been discounted!Wide menu selection. The prices are reasonable, if not cheap for SF. The portions are decent as well. Too bad the noodles were too bland otherwise I would definitely recommend this place. The environment totally remind me of a Chinese go to place for late night food. I love this place and always tries to eat here when I'm in Chinatown. It's basically chinese fast food and the price is comparable to McDonalds. I like their dumpling noodle soup but I also like the beef with scramble egg over ice. It comes out to be about $  per entree. The portions are not huge but it's good enough for lunch without going into food coma. Service is also not bad considering that it is Chinatown. Mediocre chinese food. Shrimp shaday is taste really blend. Same with yang chao fried rice. The only good one is their chow fun. I won't recommend this to anyone. One of the best places to go to in SF Chinatown. This is their new location and it is very very nice: Lots of tables, new chairs, a bunch of new LCD TV's, nice bathrooms and a hand sanitizer outside the bathroom. As far as the food goes, the menu is HUGE! There is so much to choose from in this menu its crazy. It would take me a lifetime to eat every single dish they offer. They have lots of variety that includes pho, meat, rice, noodles, and lots of other dishes. I recently have been only ordering pho from here. It's pretty delicious, the noodles have great texture to it and the soup is great. I also want to mention their interesting bowls, plates, chopsticks. They are all made out of metal, which seems to last a long time for the restaurant. Will be coming again whenever i'm in the area! Some characteristic of a truly CCG restaurant include grimy tabletops, stained carpets (or cracked and broken floor tiles), and terrible service.  But it's okay, because I can live with that as long as the food is delicious and the prices are even more tasty. Enter the new and improved San Sun  the same restaurant with the really huge menu  just in a new location (where Great Oriental used to be).  It's bright, clean, airy, and the food is still as good. Mike C. and I met up so I could show him a CCG style lunch (actually because he wrote a review for the new location and it reminded me how much I love this place), and we had a beef chow fun (spicy!), fish cakes served over pickled vegetables, and fried tofu with a garlic chive dipping sauce.  The fried tofu is seriously one of my favorite things ever (if you've ever had stinky tofu, this is it. . minus the stank). Then, Sara P. and I came here for dinner one night, and I had the combination fried noodles.  I haven't had the crispy fried noodles ($.  extra) in forever, and I remember liking it a lot as a kid.  This one did not disappoint  there was plenty of bok choy, shrimp, and crunchy noodles in a savory sauce.  My only complaint is that there was a bit too much sauce, so it made the middle portion really soggy. So glad this place relocated!  Now I can come here on a regular basis (I don't even have to walk up the hill to Stockton St. anymore!) and live my CCG life the way I want to  with plenty of delicious food. Looked for clean local lunch in Chinatown, wanted to avoid touristy fare. We were the only tourists in the place. Excellent noodle bowl and grilled chicken we shared it, it's alot of food. Only possible problem is locals will push past you in line and hostess isn't clued in to the queue order for seating. Be assertive, it's worth it. San Sun is my # go to place whenever I'm in Chinatown!! I have already written a  star review before about their food and details but under their old business address (yelp. com/biz/san sun res…), so I just gonna make this review brief by saying what's from my heart. I grew up eating their food ever since I was a little kid and I can honestly say that they have never failed to satisfy me. I have total confidence in them regardless of whatever I order on their menu (I will never say these words to ANYwhere else). All these years, they stayed the same when it comes to the quality of their food to the taste and as well as their customer service. I've watched them thrive and grow into a better and better business. I'm very happy and excited for them in regards to their new location. It's wonderful how it all started when my mom had brought me here and now even my son comes here, it's been three generations of loyalty with them and I don't doubt more generations to come. . . my family and I are their loyal fans for life! :) Wow the first week was rough for these guys. Pretty rare for a place like this to have a line out the door, but San Sun really couldn't manage. They were extremely slow to turn tables around and took even longer to order and get food on the tables. BUT  THERE IS GOOD NEWS. If you are looking for a good lunch at a really good price, then San Sun is the place. Their menu has over  items (probably more like ) and they all look and sound good, so far everything tastes good too. They have all different types of noodles  fun, mein, vermicelli, pure rice noodles, egg noodles, pho. . . the list goes on. They pretty much make every kind of  ""Over Rice"" dish and have every combination you can imagine. I think part of the reason why the wait is longer than most other places in Chinatown is because this menu is huge. However, if you have the time/are prepared to wait a little bit longer than other places (like Golden Flower), I suggest trying San Sun. Anyway, week two was a lot better. It looks like they increased their staff, so there is better turn around. They still need to make improvements on organization and efficiency  especially with the lunch rush  but hopefully as they get more comfortable in this new location, all those things will fall in place. The newly renovated San Sun restaurant is finally open for business!I've been an original San Sun fan for years now and can't think of many other restaurants deserving for an upgrade like this. The restaurant still has that good ol' San Sun vibe to it: large mirrors all over the walls, flat screen TVs that display a random dish from the menu, the same sweet lady that actually knows English, and their reputable metal chopsticks! A few new additions to the restaurant is: it's brighter  ALOT brighter, twice as much more space and tables (no more bumping into people anymore), a huge new [CLEAN] kitchen in the back, separate restrooms for men and women, and even a hand sanitizer station too! Now can you think of any restaurant or place in Chinatown that even has hand sanitizer? Possibly the CLEANEST restaurant in all of Chinatown. Very impressive!So on to the food  Came here today with  others and was edger to try the new place out. We were warmly greeted by the lady (I should really ask for her name. . ) and sat ourselves at the family style table. After some small talk [she remembers her regulars], we received the menus; which still had the same old favorites but also a new selection of dishes in the back few pages. We all decided to go with our favorites   pho, spicy beef tripe, tomato beef crispy noodles, beef with the homemade satay sauce over rice, and the scrambled egg and beef over rice (one of my favorites) [see picture]. The food came one by one within minutes and looked very appetizing; not runny nor oily, but fresh. As expected, the food was wonderful and very satisfying. San Sun lives up to their long reputation and I wish them many more decades of success! If it lives up to the hype. . .  This is the NEW location for this restaurant that resided at  Stockton Street for several decades.  Due to the new Muni Metro stop being built in that building, the tenants on that corner building are either moving or closing shop, including the residential dwellers upstairs.  The owners bought this building and spent a pretty penny in upgrading this storefront into a clean and bright dining spot.  The grand opening last Friday included lion dances and there were lines for tables during the entire weekend.  I will try it next week, giving some time for them to work out any kinks.  Their hours are unlike most Chinatown restaurants ( am to  pm).  Will update soon."|4|98|1|Routine| Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 2/29/2012 ]
Silver Cafe 0|4.0|Burgers in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|24|0|3.8| We were walking in to eat here my disabled friend my daughter and myself. I went to go park the car after getting my disabled friend as close to the door as possible when I returned he said he had to use the bathroom. The restaurant owner told us to walk across the street and use the gas stations bathroom my friend would never make it over there because he's disabled they could clearly see that but they didn't care. A neighboring business said yes they do have a bathroom they just don't want anyone using it. How heartless not accommodate a disabled person in an emergency we left and they lost our business please do not eat at this restaurant they don't deserve your business. Their donuts are absolutely delectable. I have never met a doughnut that melted in my mouth as their doughnuts here do. I also don't believe this place makes a single doughnut that isn't delicious. I used to grab doughnuts here just about every day, but now that I'm dieting, I've had to refrain. If I could, I'd eat their doughnuts everyday, and if you're in the Excelsior and have a chance to try their doughnuts, it's an opportunity that can't be missed. I come here almost every morning not only for the great breakfast but for the great hospitality. I passed this place many times before and kick myself in the head to think I didnt come here sooner. I always get the breakfast special with bacon eggs toast and a coffee. Theresa is very nice! Service  /Very nice and helpful ladyGreat serviceNot bad glaze donutCurious about their hamburger . . . now that Joe's Cable Car is gone. next time in the area My favorite coffee shop in San Francisco just happens to be just a couple blocks away from my house. I've been coming to this spot for almost  years and I've seen at least  owners part the keys over to someone new. This time, they've hit the jackpot with the owners. Their hazelnut coffee is probably the best coffee I've had in a while and their donuts are really hard to breast both for the price and taste. I usually don't bother with the other stuff like the breakfast menu because it's literally what can make at home for a fraction of the price, but the donuts and coffee is, bar none, the best.|5|92|3|Routine Inspection| Improper storage of equipment utensils or linens  [ date violation corrected: 11/18/2014 ] Insufficient hot water or running water Inadequate warewashing facilities or equipment

Silver Cafe is both delicious and ordinary. Okay, the lady behind the counter actually makes a mean vanilla latte. The donuts here are also good and I have also purchased breakfast for $ which I believe was eggs,  slices of bacon and a huge order of tasty pancakes. . .

Silver Cafe 3|4.0|Burgers in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|24|3|4.5| Great coffee. The chicken in the basket is some of the best chicken ever. Get it. Just do it. I'm new to the neighborhood so I don't know if the cafe recently cleaned itself up or what but I didn't see ant bullet holes or graffiti when I visited.  The inside of the shop is clean with plenty of seating and a campus dining hall appearance (only replace the student diners with a diversity of working class types).  I love the mix of people that come here, young and old of all ethnicities, because it mirrors ths heart of Excelsior. The cafe is located within  feet of  bus stops and you can see all  of these stops from the cafe window.  If you see a bunch of people loitering out front, chances are that they are waiting for a bus.  I love grabbing breakfast there.  For $.  plus tax, you can get  sausages,  eggs, and  huge pancakes.  I love their donuts EXCEPT for the apple fritters.  Usually, apple fritters are my favorite donut but I find them too oily there.  Oddly, their other donuts don't share the same level of greasiness and are, instead, light and fluffy.  My favorite is their eggrolls which cost (if I remember correctly) about  cents each.  I have not yet tried the fried egg sandwich that alot of others had mentioned. Overall, Silver Cafe offers good food at a fair price at a very convenient location.  I have visited this place a few times already in the month that I've lived in Excelsior and am sure to visit many more times.|5|100|0|Routine|This inspection has no violations.

I love that they have boiled eggs!! And biscotti at times. Im five minutes away, and its nice to have a neighborhood cafe right down the street:) As a Samaritan stuck at the bus stop stranded with no change but a $ bill to take the bus because CLIPPER though it would be funny and very convenient to block my card due to an auto load issue without informing me. I came knocking on the door of Silver Cafe to get some change. I walked in and politely asked the lady behind the counter for change. She opens her register and said she didn't want even though she clearly had enough to break my $. I know this wasn't a bank but as a civil duty to human kind and when one is in such dilemma she could have graciously broke my $ and send me on my merry way. She said I would need to buy something. . . and I was refused previously at the liquor store next door with the same excuse. I browsed the menu quickly and decided to just get a glazed donut which would leave me with four $ bills and a quarter for  minutes at a parking meter. I stood there patiently waiting for her to come back since she was assisting another customer. I took a quick browse around and notice it was quite dingy and run down, Costco muffins and a lot of chatty mail carriers. She came back disgruntled with an angry face. SERIOUS!?!?! I WAS GOING TO BUY SOMETHING, BE PLEASANT AT LEAST!She got my deformed over sized and greasy piece of crap they call a donut and chucked it into a brown paper bag and sent me on my way just in time to catch the bus I needed the change to begin with. I took a bite of the donut on the bus, first bite ok. Very dense donut not like the fluffiness you get when biting into a Krispy Kreme but it was alright. A couple more bites and then I realized it was getting extremely dry and tasteless. But being one not to waste food I scarfed the rest down to the tremors of my stomach. The good: the price. Everything is dirt cheap. The bad: you get what you pay for, unfortunately. This is a greasy spoon, and from the handful of times I've been here out of sheer proximity to home, their tables match this very description. Not always clean. The donuts are dynamite, but the other food items aren't up to par. Sandwiches are poorly assembled and the french fries are previously frozen and super salty. I wish their primary focus was on pastry and their delectable baked goods, then I'd give them a couple more stars! I was craving for some fries so I came to Silver Cafe. Why you ask? Well that is because I live close by and there are a few (out of ) reviews that vaguely say their burgers and fries were good. Lets get down to the food. Frozen patties and frozen fries dont get any better than this. It aint gourmet, but they make it just fine. Cheese oozing on my double cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato and onions with a hint of mustard and mayo. My meal was about $  $ dollars which was not bad (they gotta eat too). The food itself would have probably only earned it  stars. But what I truly like about this place is the diverse crowd!  working class and seniors. Whats better than sitting amongst old Asian men playing Chinese Chess and blue collared workers with paint on their pants? Probably many things  but I like the ""ambiance"". Welcome to the neighborhood! note to Angus  doughnuts dont come with the burgers and fries Definite bang for your buck here!  Although this place may appear to be just a ""donut"" shop. . . it's actually a bit more than that!  First of all the donuts here are ginormous!  (The next time I stop in I'm going to take a picture  and post it).  The woman behind the counter swears to me that they have their own baker and I told her he must be a pretty dam good baker because the french donuts are to die for! So let me back up a decade ago actually a decade and a half. . . . the owners of this store used to own the coffee shop at Miramar and Ocean and as a young kid I used to go there after church and have my toasted bagel with cream cheese and a thai iced tea.  A couple years after they sold the shop and I believe it is called Lucky something?? Well here I am many moons later and they now own Silver Cafe! Well back to the review. . . . . Ham and Egg sandwich on a croissant is so good! There is a definite homemade touch to it which makes it a keeper!.  Egg rolls are good too ground chicken I believe!I would give this place  stars just for the food that I have tried but because this place also sells lotto, cigarettes, candy, ice cream, yogurt, cup o noodles, sodas, a variety of drinks and even pain medication for those afternoon headaches its kinda like a one stop quik e mart without the liquor!  There are definitely some regulars that come here and the owners are very nice.  So nice that they keep this place open  days a week!  Amazing!!  Oh and they always have fresh coffee.  Ah yes, always a plus!! A nice little place. The workers are very friendly and don't mind that you stay for a long time. I got a dozen donut holes for $. , you can't go wrong with that! They were fresh and tasty, not a gourmet donut but that's not what I would have expected. The coffee is always fresh and very reasonably priced. I always used to walk by this place and think this place was a bit shady, but I've since changed my mind. I'll definitely come back! The prices here are excellent, and the fried egg sandwich is beyond excellent. I went in here with Thor because he was hungry. He got the aforesaid fried egg sandwich, and I just got something to drink because I wasn't hungry. Cut to three days later, and I am STILL thinking about how amazing the fried egg sandwich looked. So I got one for myself and it didn't disappoint AT ALL. It was a perfect sandwich. Thor's eaten other sandwiches and always been satisfied, although he says the pastries are ""middle of the road. ""  I might try something else one day, but I don't know that I'll be able to resist the fried egg sandwich. Pros good value try their burgers and fries, comes with donuts donuts taste freshCons tends to attract the senior citizen crowd I started my donut runs about  months ago.  Sometimes, tutoring gets really frustrating, and I need to treat myself to some sweet goodness. I was surprised to find out that after my first purchase, I was given more donuts than I had asked for.  I was a bit puzzled, as the woman didn't even use the cash register to ring me up.  I thought that maybe I was being overcharged; I mean, who gives you extra stuff other than folks trying to be sneaky and make more money?Well my sis, the foodie, told me that even without the donut extras being added to my order, I got a good deal on the ones that I did want.  And after returning time and again, comparing the price menu to what's put in my bag, they truly are giving me a great deal!  It's like if I order at least  donuts, they throw in an extra. AND, they've let me in   min. after they were already closed, to satiate my doughy cravings!  How great is that? Lets get this straight: this review will give some light anecdotal descriptions, maybe a literary reference and a bit of self deprecating or clever banter. Actually it won't do any of those things because lets face it, I'm not that good of a writer. But this review is not about the writer and its not about the style. It's about the DONUTS, one donut to me precise. The most beautiful thing in pastry heaven if created properly ""the old fashioned glazed donut"" or OFGD for short. And this place makes the best old fashioned glazed I have ever eaten. It's crispy and moist and full of sugar glaze nooks and crannies that crunch when you bite them then melt in your mouth. The cake is never chewy a danger with OFGD.  So sweet you be humming for a good hour and a half if you eat it on an empty stomach. In all seriousness and for those who understand Homer Simpson, this is the best place to get this donut in the whole city. When the woman who bakes them started running out before  AM. I asked her if she could make more. . . . and she started making more! OK now I have to cover the other basics. Silver Cafe is on the corner of Silver and Mission in the outer mission. Not a lot of trees, and the only boutique is that pinata store that's never open. The inside of the cafe is a very basic setup no frills think donut shop in Delaware, but then we don't really go to these places for the frills we go for good cheap eats and sweets which Silver cafe provides admirably. The women that work there are know their customers but always keep their distance, and there are old regulars who stake out the tables next to the window. The guys in baseball caps and sweatshirts who hang out, read the paper and shoot the breeze with the other regulars. The older woman who carries the cart behind her and wears layers of mismatched clothing. So go, you'll be glad you did. Oh my gosh, hi. This place is love. It doesn't look much from the outside, but they know how to make a MEAN egg sandwich. I was starving for food after visiting my friend around  in the morning, and since she lived about a next block over from this place, I decided to give it a try . . . since it was about the only place open at that hour around there. I decided to go for the egg sandwich  and I. Was. Not. Disappointed. It was like having a series of orgasms with every chew. Ok, I'm not kidding. Oh, and despite having to be awake at ass o'clock in the morning to make me something, the woman behind the counter was so inviting and gave me the biggest smile before I left. Love! Posted //I got much love for everyone hustlin' out there, and these people are st generation American hustlers. am to pm everyday, if I only had / of that drive I'd be set, ballin with no budget at all. No vacation in  years let alone a day off and still a friendly greeting every time. How do they do it? Zoloft, strong Vietnamese Coffee, Redbull, coconut milk and curry? I'll have what she's having. So am I just spoiled that I was born here? Many questions about a coffee joint flying thru my head at am. Eggs perfectly over nice an easy an crisp bacon every time, my friend. Yeah no Starbucks but good, hot, fresh coffee, besides doesn't keeping your soul make up for anything these daze?   Chain stores are the death of the American hustler, I've seen it with my own eyes. Walmart wrecked my hometown, mom an pop went belly up and were forced into the blue smocks, humbly groveling and greeting mega store super savers. Finally I knew my purpose;  steal all you can from the giant, drive up the prices, give mom an pop back their dignity. So what if my pockets got swole from liberated video games and cd players? I was David battling the behemoth, armed only with my brash revolutionary fervor, knowledge of known blind spots and trusty liberated slingshot from sporting goods. So long story short I cashed out and Walmart finally closed but only to reopen as a Super Walmart across town. Argh, as is the agony of defeat. I can only hope that my torch was passed along to fellow freedom fighters with a hunger for heavy metal tapes, Gi Joes, Ninja Turtles and consumer electronics. An army stuffing packages and switching barcodes, anything for the ongoing struggle. Yeah so maybe I'm not quite Che or a Zapatista, I've been called a shoplifter, a booster ands a common thief but I never jacked mom or pop, not like Sam Walton did, that fuck.    Oh yeah, the topic at hand; so anyway the burgers are pretty good for the price an you get fries with that too. The $.  turkey sandwich has saved my ass so many times and the breakfast special continues to fuel the revolution to the day. Gotta give it up to the corner spot, much respect, hustle on and all you kiddies out there just remember; Don't Suck Corporate Cock!"|5|96|1|Routine| Moderate risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 7/30/2012 ]
The Blarney Stone 0|4.0|Pubs in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|183|0|4.71428571429| What a great neighborhood bar!  My friend and I got a spot at the bar where Shannon our bartender took such great care of us.  The pours are super generous and they use fresh fruit in their cocktails. I saw them bring out a ton of grapefruits which inpired me to order a greyhound (vodka with grapefruit juice). Boy, fresh fruit juice makes a whole lot of a difference in the quality of the drink. I can tell that the workers love their job and the ambiance was great. It was very busy but it wasn't uncomfortably crowded, which I loved. One thing to point out, I noticed Shannon kept making margaritas, which my friend ended up ordering. It was really good! I swear I saw her make over  of those so it looks like a very popular drink of hers. If you like a good margarita on the rocks. you should try hers.  You wont be dissapointed. I plan to go back to try their food. I'll update my review once I do, by looking at the pictures, I look forward to trying their breakfast one day. They have tater tots! Yum!! My favorite place in the Richmond district! This Irish bar features cool bartenders, a nice patio, and a shuffleboard. There is plenty of space to enjoy your drinks and watch your favorite team! They also have brunch on Saturday and Sunday, and the food is good too. Cool atmosphere overall! Go check it out! :) This is my favorite bar in San Francisco. I will admit that there was some bias in the beginning because it was the first bar I went to when I turned , but after going there + times over the last year, this five star review still stands, and is not biased at all.  The Staff: Amazing. . . . Nothing more I can really say.  I have personally met everyone who works there and they are all very nice, down to earth people.  They all remember who I am every time I arrive for a Sharks game and always remember to turn on the channel so we don't miss the game. The People:Amazing. . . Just as the staff.  all very awesome people of the Richmond (and other) districts just stopping by for a drink.  There are also a BUNCH of regulars who go to Blarneys and they all rock!  I've made plenty of friends there and the conversation is always amazing.  The people and environment of this bar make it feel completely awesome and it barely feels like a dive bar because it's very well kept and clean. Service:Amazing. . . . Yes, the rd amazing in a row.  Great drinks and for a good price  especially during happy hour! The cons:The only real con of this place, which does not take away from it's  star rating, is that it is COMPLETELY packed during any major sports games (during playoffs) to the point that you can barely even find a place to stand.  This is NOT a huge deal at ALL but more of a warning for people that get cluster phobic or don't like being in a huge group. I'm a regular here now.  Love this place.  / Intricately awesome Bloody Mary with a giant pickle!  Before we went to Aziza, just near there, we hopped into this place.  It was honestly pretty cool.  It is a nicer dive type place  complete with an outdoor patio.  Inside is rich in color, tons of random Irish or sports team stuff every where and of course, a wooden bar.  It isn't a tiny place, but it isn't huge either.  I would have a had time bringing a group. The outside is fairly nice and I always love being outdoors, so it was a huge plus for me.  It was also clean, had a few tables and a little greenery.  The bartender was pretty cool too.  He made the most elaborate Bloody Mary I've ever had . . .  seriously!  And it was so unexpected to. Cool place. Cool drinks. Cool staff. I've been coming here since I turned . I love it! Nice bartenders, every seating has a good view of the TVs, back patio for a smoke, laid back regulars, and the area has good food. Best part of Blarneys is the fresh squeezed grapefruit for a greyhound! It's the best! I wish I could give this bar  stars. Beyond the awesome bartenders to the great (affordable) drinks to the weekend brunches this place is a haven. Having gone here since turned  and moved recently to the neighborhood I not once in my .  years had a bad experience. EVERYONE is really friendly and nice, there's ample seating and even if there's a game on and it gets rowdy, there's still a maintainer crowd control feeling. Nothing bad to say about this place AT ALL. EVER. NEVER. Solid  starts for the boys.  The do a good job and they were there for the hood when the hood needed them.  I loved the previous owners as well but it was a bit depressing at times.  I do miss live music Friday night so bring that back eh?|6|96|2|Routine Inspection| Improper or defective plumbing  [ date violation corrected: 11/6/2014 ] Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 11/6/2014 ]
The Blarney Stone 1|4.0|Pubs in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|183|1|4.0625|" Cool spot.  Irish bakery next door has awesome sausage rolls and Shepard pies.   Beer Jameson and Irish snacks.  Great stop. Blarney Stone is one of my new favorite bars! We came on Saturday morning to watch the Bruins hockey game, and there was a good amount of people already there at :am. We were pleasantly surprised by their brunch menu and their egg and cheese sandwich was SO good. Their bloody mary is also fantastic, and they have great beers on tap. The bartender was so friendly and we ended up chatting with him most of the time. It was a pretty good crowd for the rest of the game, and the place filled up once the Giants game started. There are a lot of TVs and they are very accommodating in terms of changing the channel. If we lived in the area, we'd be there all the time! awesome!I can't forget them for serving delicious food items. I had three and all were delcious and it differs from one another. For having great justification I love it much. I highly recommend it. Charge is fair thouhg a bit high and location is fine. Tip your bartenders Awesome place to grab some drinks! The bartenders are super friendly, drinks are well priced, awesome atmosphere and they've got shuffleboard and free air hockey! I missed the fact that the air hockey is free but saw it mentioned in someone else's review. I must go back just to take advantage of that! Stopped in with some friends last night since we were in the neighborhood and had no regrets.  Nice chill bar, nice chick behind the bar who provided good service, pretty standard prices, and nice pours.  Nothing outstanding mind you, but if I were in the area wanting a pint and a whiskey or three I'd be more than happy to return. Best. Tots. Ever. Living in the Richmond district, this is the default spot for a great night out within walking distance, or a great place to grab a weekend brunch with XL fresh squeezed mimosas and awesome bloody marys. Doey is a great bartender. Oh yeah, and did I mention the best tots ever?. . . because yeah. BEST TOTS EVER. Pretty chill place. I would go here again, but I wasn't too crazy about it. Service is good. I had a great experience here and will certainly be back! The crowd is very richmond young, white and asian, and relaxed. I just feel like it's a safe place to get a drink without having to worry about walking around the neighborhood at night (as opposed to SoMa). The bartenders were very friendly and efficient. . . I never had to wait longer than  minutes for a drink (and it was a busy night). The drinks were strong! Wow. wow. wow. Great prices too. Loved the modern jukebox. The outdoor patio is totally legit! Bring your drink outside and drink under the stars. Side note: There's a small step to the patio, but big enough for girls in heals to miss a  step and fall to the ground. I saw  girls (including me _ ) do gymnastics as we try not to kiss the concrete. A  ""watch your step"" sign would be great for the future :) Good first impression when we walked in, several TVs playing Sunday football and pretty busy. I knocked off a star because there was a large group of chargers fans trying to watch their game, and the bartender switched it off at least twice and turned it to a game that was already on  other TVs. If it were me, I would have also been upset. I wasn't there to watch any game in particular, however, there were  games in OT that i would have liked to see (especially given there are  TVs) that they didn't  have on. To be fair, I didn't ask them to change the game so I can't complain too much. Waitress was very attentive and nice. Food was average bar fare. They have a nice patio but it was chilly today so I didn't check it out. The best part of this place shuffleboard! And air hockey. A good, consistent bar in the neighborhood to go watch sports and start a night of drinking! Plus, you get to bring outside food into the bar and having the bakery next door is a def pro! This bar is a place that I am proud to call home on Saturday mornings. As THE definitive Michigan bar in SF, The Blarney Stone meets all of my needs and exceeds my expectations. When it comes to sports the atmosphere is great. It invites a truly energetic crowd that turns up regardless of the kick off time. Viewing angles are great as every seat has a clear view of the five LED TVs that surround the perimeter. Without a doubt , the best sportsbar in the Outer Richmond. Drinks are great and the mimosas are created with freshly squeezed orange juice. Their bar food is serviceable, flanked by their excellent tater tots and buffalo chicken strips. I have to conclude this review by mentioning the great service from Bart, the bartender, and Kelly the main waitress. Even when things get crowded, they always find a way to make sure you're taken care of. Mostly, I come here out of convenience since I live nearby. But it is a fun Irish pub to go to on a weekday night, play some shuffleboard with friends, have decently priced drinks (fresh squeezed grapefruit and vodka is $ ish), and meet some unpretentious people of varied ages. I've come here on a Sunday morning to watch football and have brunch, and the food is pretty great (first time trying fried pickles, an amazing would be heart attack) with $ mimosas. Great for sports, unhealthy food, and a chill night where you don't want to put too much effort. This bar is my favorite neighborhood bar in San Francisco.  The bartenders could not be better. The atmosphere is spacious yet cozy, and boasts large screens for sporting events (go giants!)There are an assortment of fun bar games to play, and locals to converse with. They also have an awesome brunch. I have nothing but amazing things to say about the Blarney Stone! I had an excellent time at this bar. Bartenders are friendly and promote a good atmosphere. Excellent pub local bar feel. NIce bartender, cheap happy hour.  Only serve food on the weekends.  Plenty of TV's if your looking to watch a Giants game.

The Blarney Stone 2|4.0|Pubs in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|183|2|4.5| There's no Blarney at the Blarney stone. . . just a good pour of Guiness. . . and a shot of Jamieson. I was so buzzed after watching Paul McCartney at outsidelands. . . that I had to come here and get a drink or two or three. It was pretty busy but service was stellar. Great atmosphere, Great help and good drink selection.  days a week! I will now review the Blarney Stone, to the theme of Cheers:Making your way to the Blarney Stone today pull up a chair and take a spot. Taking a break from all your worries, sure a drink would help a lot. Wouldn't you like to get away? Sometimes you want to go The Blarney stone is it's name, and they're always glad you came. Smoke in the back patio as you can see, Not each bar is all the same You wanna be at the Blarney StoneThat's its name.

The Blarney Stone 3|4.0|Pubs in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|183|3|3.9| Hospitable bartenders serving fresh squeezed citrus drinks, numerous HD TVs tuned to all key sporting events, Irish style weekend breakfast/brunch, parlor games from free shuffleboard to air hockey, spacious and landscaped back patio, clean restrooms, and many other positive attributes are maintained by Vince and Bart, the co owners originally from San Francisco who provide all types of patrons a great experience visiting this Outer Richmond watering hole. Whether you are a regular, a post Outside Lands party goer, or a group of Mission district residents looking to switch it up, all walks of life will have an amazing time at the Stone. Mix it with the amazing nearby food options (e. g. , Tommy's Mexican, Aziza, Hot Sauce and Panko, etc. ), you can spend quite some time in the neighborhood. I'm a Mission resident and thrive on spending free time at my local joints, but visiting the Outer Richmond every so often is a must, and the Stone, along with Trad'r Sam, are dissimilar Little Russia inhabiting bar twins within walking distance that will leave you smiling. Whoo hope y'all wore green yesterday! I definitely had little splashes of green on myself to avoid being pinched. Keisha and I were trying to find a bar to hit up for our first stop of St. Patty's day and I chose this place cause of the name. Haha. . It was definitely happening here when we arrived. Loads of people in this little bar. There's also a patio in the back where you can purchase food & smoke obviously. I had their Skyy Blood Orange Refresher which was really refreshing just like juice. Then I got a Bloody Mary  spicy, and OMG. . . it was the best Bloody Mary I've ever had (although this was my nd time having a Bloody Mary). It was very tasty & had a nice kick to it. Mmm . . . I'll definitely hit this place up for more Bloody Marys if I'm ever in this area again which is rarely. haha. . . but if I was, I definitely would! :) They have a lot of tv's which is great for sporting events, but there isn't a whole lot of seating. The back patio is kind of hidden, so I didn't even realize it existed until I'd been here a few times. The drinks are delicious. They have a Skyy Blood Orange drink that is really phenomenal and they're only $ which is nice. If I lived nearby I'd probably go more often. I've heard they also have really great brunch, but haven't been able to check it out yet. Good priced drinks and plenty of TVs including a projector screen to watch all your fav sports. Best bloody Mary in the city. Love. Warning: if you say spicy, they give it to you SPICY. I am not a local, but came here with a group of friends who are in order to watch the SF ers win the NFC Championship. We got there about an hour before the big game and the place was packed. The bouncer told us that people were there hours before they even opened just to get a good seat. The only downside was that there was not enough seating for everyone and even standing space was a little tight. They have numerous TVs which made it easy to keep an eye on the game. The bartenders were very friendly and incredibly speedy. Considering the bar was packed I never had to wait more than a minute or two to get a drink. The prices are very fair and they also had a good specials. There were also serving beer and food on the back patio which was great because all the football fans were quite hungry. The atmosphere was very casual and fun. I really enjoyed my time here. I will be visiting again in the future. Not that I frequent the Richmond too often to go out but Blarney Stone gets my vote of awesomeness. We decided to double date last night and headed here after some Korean BBQ down the street. For $.  I ordered us our four drinks Jameson on the Rocks, Old Fashioned, Vodka/Soda, and a Speciality drink. Not so bad Blarney Stone not so bad!We also placed our card with the bar to play Shuffle Board which is awesome! A dumb game, but a ton of fun to enjoy while enjoying a cocktail. The staff is friendly, the price is right, and the atmosphere is laid back and fun. I also LOVE that they have a jukebox! In the event I venture back to the Richmond, I'll certainly venture back to the Blarney Stone! A compact Irish pub that's got tons of big screen TVs and beers on tap. Perfect for watching games with a great crowd of people and some cool, super positive bartenders too. One caveat: the food preparation can veer way off course. Chicken tenders came out fried to a radioactive, brittle burnt brown crisp. Even if it's fairly early in the day, say am or noon, maybe it's a good idea to change the cooking oil a bit more often. Still, Blarney Stone has a cool game day atmosphere and the *correct* partisan affiliation: nothing like hailing to the Leaders and Best while the Victors gets blasted over the loudspeakers after every score. ;) I was going to watch the St. Mary's USF basketball game in the City last spring, so I figured what better way to show up than stumbling and reeking of gin? I had about  minutes before I had to go there, and this place was able to get the job done quickly and for a reasonable price. I did like the atmosphere  friendly neighborhood bar, just classy enough to stay above dive status but by no means fancy. I was there just before the busy time would typically start, but you could tell it probably gets really crowded during peak hours. Would definitely come back here next time I'm in the neighborhood. Best bar to watch a Michigan game!! The bartenders are friendly and wore Michigan shirts. On Michigan game day, all TVs are playing the Michigan game!! Food here is not good, so come here only to drink! Would recommend you go next door to the Irish or German bakery and bring some food back to the bar if you are hungry!|6|98|1|Routine| Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 8/28/2013 ]
The Blarney Stone 4|4.0|Pubs in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|183|4|3.3|" I have been here twice now and both my experiences were similar, so figured a Yelp review is in order. Service/PriceIt's ok.  I found the mixed drinks to be a little weak and the pours of whiskey neat to be a little light.  Prices are decent  good pint of beer is around $, well booze is $ or $, decent spirits will run you $ to $. Typical experience on my visit the other night  while drinking my beer I asked the cure female bartender to see the whiskey list, she replies ""Sure"" then goes about her business.  Several minutes later she comes over and asked if I made a choice  ""um, well I never got the list. ""  ""oops, sorry, just a moment. ""  Several more minutes pass and the same question from her to which I reply ""still haven't seen the list"".  This was all done with smiles and we laughed about it, but . . . well you see what I mean. Then when she left and the guy took over, he completely ignored us.  I think he could tell we were wrapping up and thus there was no business here.  I just wanted a refill on my water and he ignored my polite motions to get his attention  he walked by at least  times and served the person next to me while never looking at me.  I finally spoke up loudly and got his attention  he refilled my water and said not a single word.  Usually when there is a shift change and I get a glass of water, I'll tip the bartender a buck, cause they have to make a living too.  Not this time. Not really complaining about the service, just showing why I think that it is not top notch. Bar Stock  BeerPretty good.  They have  to  on tap (didn't really count them).  But they have a good range of selections, pretty much for everyone's taste.  I got the Smithwicks  one of my favorites.  This is clearly the reason to come here. Bar Stock  SpiritsAgain I will use the descriptor ""ok"".  They have a decent though not extensive selection  the core holdings you find in most bars and a couple higher end selections.  But the list is nothing to write home to father about.  In the whiskey department they have  Irish, and handful of scotch, and a handful of American (mostly bourbon).  The list has them all listed together with no differentiation between them.  Also, the first two bourbons I asked for, they were out.  Similar selection of other spirits  decent but light on the higher quality gins, vodka, etc. ClienteleThe crowd both times was an interesting mix of older (drunk) locals at the bar, young (drunk) partiers towards the back, couples canoodeling in the corner, and a few lonely hearts spread around.  I have had a few interesting conversations there, in the interesting way of having a debate with someone much younger and drunker can only go.  It was entertaining at least. DécorI would describe this as a poor imitation of an Irish pub crossed with a sports bar.  Lots of wood  bar, floor, tables, walls.  It's basically a standard large ""Neighborhood"" bar/pub.  Plenty of TV's to watch the current sporting event, and TV's are usually turned to sports.  My only complaint in this regards is that the TV's mounted above the bar are too high to watch comfortably while sitting at the bar.  Since the bar is not that deep and the TV's are pretty high, the viewing angle is pretty steep  leading t a sore neckAlso, it seems that the younger set thinks that ""dive bars"" are cool and therefore calls most any local place that is older and not high end a ""dive"" bar.  This is not a dive bar.  Believe me, I have been a many a dive bar, and you can look up the common definitions of a dive bar  this is not one.  It is way too well lit, has way too many TVs, etc, etc. CleanlinessThe place is kept reasonably clean and the bathrooms were not too bad.  But I will say that both visits were earlier in the evening  : to : range.  I would wager that by the time midnight rolls around, the back patio and the bathrooms will start to get fairly rank and you may catch an occasional whiff of the love smell of urine or puke. ParkingBest to walk because:. Parking can be a bitch in this area. You are drinkingSo, three stars it is.  I enjoyed it there and will likely be back on occasion, but there are (IMHO) better places to go. Come one come all!  My coworkers & I dropped in to catch Game  of the NLCS. Can we say Awesome! Low key, good crowd, multiple  tv screens , plenty of seating , pitchers on tab all around.  Since they didn't serve food that day, the staff allowed us to bring in take out from Volcano Curry across the street.  You can't beat this.  Def a fan.  We'll be back! can't even remmber being here. (See pics) Review #. Local lively bar but you can still relax if you choose to with pockets of people choose one vibe over the other. Drinks were slightly weak but service was friendly. I came here for St. Patrick's Day and the place was, expectedly, a zoo. The owner was really cool, super friendly and personable given all the craziness inside. I've been here other times since then when it's much calmer and I really like the place. It's really big and open. They have a cool outdoor patio area which makes it a perfect place to day drink. Lots of tvs and a big screen projector that they put games on. They have pool tables too. They do have a virtual jukebox but they need to replace that thing asap because it sucks. The screen is broken and it takes like five minutes to select one song. Drinks are good and bartenders are friendly but one pissed me off because she just blatantly skipped two songs that I had played on the jukebox. I don't care if you don't like Britney Spears; I paid for that shit. Not cool. All in all this is a good bar for pretty much any occasion. The Blarney Stone is a nice, chill Irish bar in the Outer Richmond district. The bartenders are very friendly, down to earth and always down for a good conversation. This is a great bar to just grab a drink at with friends or coworkers when you don't want anything too crazy. They allow you to bring in food, which is always a plus & for games (Giants, Soccer, Olympics) they have tvs & a big screen. This bar gets packed with crazy drunks whenever there is a big event Golden Gate Park (but hey, what bar doesn't). This is the kind of bar I've recently become a fan off. I realize I'm getting ""too old"" for the crazy drunken nights and now just want a drink here and there. This is the perfect place for such nights. Came in here for a drink and to watch the Giants game.  They had four flat screens and a large projection TV tuned to the Giants and the Olympic games.  After ordering a Guinness and a mimosa with fresh squeezed orange juice, we decided to order some food after checking out their menu.  We ordered a grilled ham and cheese sandwich with tater tots and the FFS, which was two eggs, two slices of bacon, a sausage patty, tater tots, blackforest ham and toast.  The food to our surprise, was very good.  The bartender, who also took our food order, was friendly and provided great service.  Overall, a great experience at a neighborhood bar with some pretty good food. Best.  Bar. Evar!  (Or at least on this block)I'm a huge fan of this bar.  They squeeze their own oranges, limes, lemons and grapefruits and when they're in season, blood oranges.  The bartenders are awesome. A half star off for the accoustics.  With a few sound treatments,  stars.  :) Friendly serve and a good time. . . a few blocks away from Tommy's so hit this place up after we shut down the Mexican Restaurant.  The owner recommended it! I was treated so bad! I was there for a couple drinks my phoned died I saw An Iphone charger plug in the wall with no phone on it  so I asked the bartender if he could charge my phone because my husband was home with my son incase something happen I always like to have my phone with me with battery.  He looked at me an said I dont have aniphone charger, I told him  my  story  and pointed to the wall and said its over there would u be able to do that for me please He look at me and said I dont charge phones and walked away. I stayed there staring at him I also work in the industry and I was in shock with the way he treated me, specially because all I wanted was to charge my phone for  min to see if my son was ok. He came back and my sister asked again because she couldnt believe the attitude he gave us, and she said she always goes there  and knows all the bartenders and he look at her and said I DONT CHARGE PHONES. i ASKED ARE YOU THE OWNER, HE WAS AROUND   SHAVED BLOND HAIR, and he said walking away yes, I didn't believe him and I hope he is not the owner because to be RUDE like that he should never own a bar. I asked for my check and left didn't even finish my beer.

The Blarney Stone 5|4.0|Pubs in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|183|5|3.96183206107|" Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon in April.  Good for a draft and to warm up a bit.  Nice assortment of sports on the TVs.  Only a few folks at the bar so great service.  Wish they had had something other than bags of chips to snack on, but the beer certainly hit the spot. awesome place! including vince. good vibes, great drinks, extremely fun bar. I'm biased. It's close to my place, but after Doey poured the drinks it was great. I told them about my trip to Ireland coming up and he was super friendly about what not to miss in Dublin.  It is hella loud sometimes, but it's a sports bar.  I prefer the male tenders personally, but it's got some charm.  Lucky charm? ok, bad joke. LOVED our time at The Blarney Stone. Bartendar Shannon is nothing short of amazing! A warm welcome, super enthusiastic and fun, and makes one of the best margaritas I've ever had! What a surprise for an Irish pub! Topped off the evening with an Irish Coffee, custom made with an individual, freshly brewed cup of coffee. Our crew consisted of  year olds and it was nice to find a lively place that wasn't too crowded or noisy. . . granted we were there on a Friday around pm. Can't wait to go back again! For some reason I kept thinking that this place was called Foley Catheter. I don't know why. Sorry if you're one of those people who think writing thoughts like that is a waste of your time as you look for an actual informative Yelp review. Anyway, this place was fun. I like how it's not in a fast paced part of SF. It's a straight up dive bar with decent beer and a dartboard. It was too crowded around :PM and the bartender was efficient. My friend and I used a Scoutmob. Those things are pretty useful. I might come back if I'm in the area, but at least for me it's not really an end point destination. It's more of an on the way type joint. The place is jam packed, shoulder to shoulder and all that jazz. They play pretty good music but its LOUD. don't expect to old a conversation with your friends unless you're having a screaming session. But, you can still talk in close proximity. We were fortunate to grab a table near the corner and the drinks were amazing! I had their cherry bomb (yum) and irish car bombs AGAIN. Their irish car bombs were AMAZING. Better than tradr' sams.  The people were nice and strangers do offer to help you take pics! We stayed their for an hr or so and just talked. loud music. fun times. good company.  You have to push your way to the bartender, because its super crowded and people don't move in there! I would definitely come back to hang out. but, if you're looking for a conversation with friends dont' go here. . lol it was st. patty's day eve.  we just had to stop by to grab some car bombs $ a pop and some good ol' guiness beer.  The crowd was diverse and patrons friendly.  Left my tab open and called the bar.  they said they close it out for me, which is awesome and all i had to do was stop by and get my card back. I TOOK A SHOT OF OUT THE DEER'S ASS!! There, I've said it and darn proud of it! This place is awesome, you got whiskey coming out of an animal's bum hanging on the wall, air hockey table at the end of the bar, plenty seatings, and great bartenders. What more do you ask for in a local bar?Definitely not a place for deep in thought conversations because really? you're going to come here for a nice long conversation over a shot of vodka? Let me know how that turns out. . . . Pretty loud, but good prices on drinks. I checked in on foursquare and whammo! Check In deal! % off from Scoutmob. It's clear that the bar is UM and CSU bar. That's a weird combination. I'm sure there is a good explanation, but also, an unlikely pairing. Cool neighborhood bar located in the Richmond district!It's a nice hangout spot that doesn't get too crowded and attentive bartenders.  There are flat screens around the bar for you to watch SportsCenter on ESPN as well as air hockey tables for entertainment. I liked the big tables set up against the walls and they have some good deals at the bar for specific beers. We love the Blarney Stone!  Prices are reasonable and the bar tenders are friendly (and remember you!).  I think it's a good place to go for a low key drink, watch a baseball game, or bring a group on Saturday night.  It's not pretentious whatsoever, but has a nice atmosphere.  Hihgly recommended! I was visiting from out of town and came here to watch the Michigan game vs OSU with my family of Michigan fans.  I was looking for a bar that was lively without being packed to the brim with college students, and this place hit the mark! Also, mimosas with hand squeezed orange juice?! yes please! I freakin' LOVE this place! it is THE quintessential neighborhood pub. The Bartenders: In my opinion, a bar and your experience within is only as good as the 'tenders. Doey (I know I'm spelling this wrong), Bart, and Nate. There are more, but these are they guys I see and I love 'em. Super friendly, while still being real. (Sidenote: People, ALWAYS be nice to your bartenders and servers. They are people, they are your servers, not your servants, and they yield way more power than you bother to acknowledge!)The Atmosphere: For me, it's the perfect balance. Neighborhood vibe, comfortable and non pretentious, but clean and not dive y. (Don't get me wrong, I love a good dive bar, but I'm just clarifying. ) I can come here with friends, alone for a chill beer, watch the games (lots of T. V. s and one is a HUGE screen!). There's free shuffleboard and air hockey, a jukebox (although I feel the volume on this can be too loud) and a back patio with great atmosphere. My only wish is that they had a kitchen, but I get why they don't, and I don't care because what they do, they do well. There are still plenty of food options to get for take out, too. The Crowd: I've seen a little of everyone in here. Barely legals to gray haired regulars. I love that there seems to be a lot of neighborhood folk, who the guys behind the bar know by name. It's been pretty non douche y every time which has me breathing a sigh of relief. Even if there are a few, they tend to stay together in a little douche y cluster. Any drunk regulars are harmless. On a personal note: I love that this place is two blocks from my house in a safe neighborhood. I love that Doey promised my cousin that he would watch out for me when I stayed behind one night. That's good people. I love that I've actually made friends out of strangers. I think this place is getting to be my Cheers. ""Norm!"" Mostly a locals bar, nice neighborhood vibe, I have meet a handful of very cool folks here since I moved to the neighborhood. The staff is awesome, really customer focused. Good place to catch some sports, they have four flat screens and a big projector tv. You will always find live sports, ESPN or Fuse on the tvs when you walk in. Saturday and Sunday they do brunch for college and NFL football. The NFL crowd is pretty fun, mostly er fans but there was a scattering of people rooting for every other team that was being televised. The food wasn't great but decent for bar food to fill you up while throwing a few back. Years ago when it was run by Irish, we used to come here underage and drink. Now I try to avoid bars packed with  somethings so I stay away on Friday and Saturday but any other night I have been there the crowd can be decent sized but not annoying. I'd give their staff  stars, the atmosphere  stars and the food  stars, that averages out to  stars in end I suppose. I love watching Michigan football here. Besides having my fellow Wolverine fans surrounding me, the entire staff is very friendly (they even know my name from frequenting there every college football Saturday), and the food is great (way better than it was last year  I hope they keep this new cook). You can tell they get along great with the customers, and it's a nice, comfy neighborhood bar. They have plenty of nice HDTVs around, so you won't miss any action. I love this place! Had a few too many Cool place, not too crowded and have some cool spots to sit at. They have a little backyard so if you're a smoker that's another star for you. I love that they have blue moon and the bartenders are really nice. I usually go here when traders is way too crowded. Great place to watch the Giants (they'll have the game playing on all  TVs), drink cheap beers and chat with the locals and the awesome bartenders! During the day it's mostly a locals hang; nights (weekends especially) this place is full of large groups of cool trendy  something year olds. Bartenders are awesome. FYI, for those of you that complain about their inattentiveness, yeah sure, sometimes they may be chatting with someone at the end of the bar when you want another drink, but guess what? This is a LOCALS bar predominantly, and the bartenders have conversations with the locals because these are the people that come in every day and want to talk about their lives as they drown their sorrows in their poison of choice. So chill out. If you don't have the patience to wait for another drink, at least learn the bartenders' names so that you can call them over even when they're engrossed in a deep philosophical discussion on the meaning of life with an elderly client. That's what I do. And they will pause their in depth convos to get you another drink. Plus, an outdoor patio for all y'all that haven't quit smoking yet, air hockey and shuffleboard (both free!) as well. Pretty cool. Also, I like that people can bring in their dogs. They're cute and fun drunks because you can say whatever you want to them and they keep smiling and never get pissed off (like people can, especially the angry drunk kind). All in all, it's a great place to hang out at if you live in the western half of the city where the sun don't ever shine. I wouldn't recommend making a trip into the city JUST to check it out because it isn't THAT amazing of a bar; however, it just happens to be the BEST local bar that I've found in San Francisco so far. Every time I walk into this place, I feel like I need to have a biker leather jacket to complete the look of the regulars that often come here. I do like coming to this local, low key sports bar in the Outer Richmond. It is very spacious even when busy, with plenty of seating inside and outside. They also have a free shuffleboard AND air hockey, which is good for groups. They also have lots of TVs that will easily distract you if you are riding solo here. You will either be watching a sports game or Fuse TV. I also give them mad props for showing Wimbledon/US Open and other tennis games from time to time (when it's slow/daytime, don't worry late night drinkers) on one of their TVs. I am a HUGE tennis fan, and combing that with my love for drinking beer, it's bliss coming here. I also appreciate the fact that they make their drinks from STRACH. When I order a Whiskey Sour or Lime Margarita, they squeeze fresh juice into my drink, not whip out a bottle of syrup. It gives the drink a bit more character. Way to go Blarney Stone! If you want one of the best bloody mary's come on a Sunday morning and for $ your mouth can experience it. I like coming on  a game day and being surrounded by other fans. Sometimes there will be people. . . but you can't really avoid that part of going to a bar I guess. Not a great update to my review. . . but oh well. . . p. s. doey is still sexy. Okay people, let's get some definitions down just because a bar is old and not trendy, this does not make it a ""dive bar. ""  As a matter of fact, I have consulted with the experts, Mr. Guinness, Ms. Greyhound, and the Kamikaze and they have all confirmed that you can't really be both a sports bar and a dive bar.  It's in the regulations.  Check'em out w. divebarregs. bs. This is not a dive bar.  It is called ""The Blarney Stone,"" and it means it only in a mildly ironic way. Now if it were called the ""Blarney Stud"" then maybe it could be a gay dive bar.  Okay, now that I've vented I can get back to the review.  This is your fairly typical, neighborhood Irish pub. It's got TV's and plays local sports, so it could double as sports bar.  It has a trivia night which is yet another sign that it is not a dive bar.  The only trivia nights that dive bars. . . Okay, okay, back on my meds.  We've established that it's an Irish pub. Now even though it is fairly run of the mill, it is light years better than Hooky Hell (my new name for Hockey Haven) just a few blocks to the west.  Blarney has okay atmosphere.  Good lighting.  Nice wooden décor and Guinness served the right way to me. Now I would never leave the city to come here, but if you happen to be in the Richmond District it is one of three fairly similar bars within a few blocks.  You don't really feel like you are in the city here, which is both good and bad.  Bad because the crowd is maybe a little too low key and cliquey.  Good because you can get away from the pretentiousness of the city and just have fun with your friends.  This is not really a pick up spot, I don't think. I wouldn't mind hanging out here every so often. Oh yeah and here's a tip for the gals there's a secret way to get the bartenders attention here. It's called flirting with them.  They will keep an eye out for you and refill your drinks when you're out.  Oh yeah, and they're hot too. . . (see how well it works). Two more days until MICHIGAN FOOTBALL. I love this bar. See you guys Saturday! DIVE BAR. Loved it. Great jukebox. Great GREAT GREAT bartenders. Had a blast shooting the breeze with them. The Blarney Stone is the perfect place in Outer Richmond where you just want to hang out and drink. This place can get pretty crowded, but the Blarney is pretty roomy, with higher ceilings so you don't feel too crowded. A classic dive bar! Happy Hour all the time!Well, not all the time. . . it just seems like every time I come here, there's a drink special for something at some point. Free shuffleboard! I love that game!Slow Guinness tap (check out the one at Bitter End). It takes about  minutes to get one. Also, sometimes it takes a while to get the bartender's attention, even if it isn't really busy. He (no matter who) is usually talking/laughing/joking with a group of friends/regulars on the end of the bar and doesn't really look at the rest of the customers as often as a bartender should. Don't get me wrong, they're all very nice people here, and there's nothing wrong with shooting the shit with your buddies while you work, but at least keep an eye out for a customer making eye contact with you to request for something. With that said, overall, it's still a pretty cool place to hang out. It's laid back for the most part, and it's really clean! The jukebox has music catered to a. . . younger crowd. Another downside, to me at least. Brunch was delicious. Those tater tots. . . Wow. I dream about those things. I can eat tater tots, drink Guinness (order them in advance), and play shuffleboard all day and night! I was sad when I moved from Downtown to the Richmond because I was leaving my favorite Irish Pub behind. And then I came across Blarney Stone and what I consider the Best Happy Hour in SF, the bartenders are really nice pour strong drinks and play great musi, plus they have plenty of TV's and a big projector for the games. Make sure to grab some Shepard's pie from the bakery next door and bring it over. Good bar and good crowds on game nights. They play the Giants game WITH sound on a large projection tv and it's fairly easy to get a drink in the joint. Order beer, the usual bartender is lacking in the common sense and brain department. Solid neighborhood bar. All your standard pub essentials: beer specials, irish references, multiple TVs for watching the game. But this place is really clean it doesn't even smell like a bar. There's a ton of seating, plenty of space for large groups and a back patio. One of the best bloody mary in town. All the bartenders here are super friendly. It's a great hangout place for watching games. Joey the bartender is an awesome guy. He also works at Trader Sams so when I saw him here I was happy. They have a good tap selection as well as a good bottle selection of beers. I have been here twice and both times I had a good time. This place is super fun! Our kickball league goes here after each game on Sundays to play Flip cup in their  outside patio area which is awesome! Inside the drinks are served really fast, pitchers are cheap, the bartender was really friendly, and the patrons were fun to talk to. I was also allowed to bring my doggie in, so that's always a perk as well. There were plenty of seats inside to accompany our large group, so it's great for this reason as well. I'm excited that this will be a new Sunday Funday watering hole! This is one of the best hidden gems in the city. Its a big Irish pub with a full bar and fairly priced drinks. (try a bloody mary, they're delicious) Its a great place to bring your friends and hang out for a whole night as its normally not too crowded and they have free: air hockey, darts, shuffleboard, and even shake weights! The bartenders are always in a good mood and willing to play. i beat one at darts and he bought me a drink. plus there's a large outdoor patio in which to enjoy the rare warm nights out in the Richmond. totally worth the trip! I, typically, am not one to compose short reviews, but in the case of Blarney Stone, the characterization is so simple.  If you're in The Richmond on a weekday, between pm and pm, and you're seeking a beverage, whether it be something on tap, or a cocktail, then stop in this place.  It's a no frills bar, but the bartenders are friendly, and the   prices are cheap.  I did notice a patio on the back of the bar, which I'm sure is good when weather is warm, or if it gets too crowded inside.  I'll likely establish Blarney Stone as my pre dinner drink meet up spot on nights that I'm dining in The Richmond. I had a great time on Saint Patty's day. I also found a watch and a memory card. If one or both belong to you, call the bar and tell them. They have my contact info. I find myself frequenting Irish bar's quite often lately. Hmm. . . I wonder why. . . Blarney Stone gets a solid four stars, although it has a tendency to be hit and miss. I went in one Friday night, and was quite impressed with the sassy menfolk, and then went in the following week and was utterly dismayed when the only people to hit on were a group of Indian men and some totally inebriated Feminem wannabe. Gross. Keep in mind, I did go in around last call. . . so that may have something to do with it. Either way, I'm a fan. Thank you San Francisco for all the beautiful Irish men. And  by beautiful, I mean drunk. OK atmosphere, ordinary selection of beer. LOVE this place. It's not stinky and dank like a lot of other pubs in the city. It's actually super clean and spacious.  The staff is really friendly and there's always an interesting mix of patrons from locals to The ENTIRE SFGG Rugby Club. . . . yum. . . but I digress. . . Crowning moment: with literally  mins. until our bus arrived my friend and I ran in to grab a drink,  laughing our heads off.  The bartender didn't look at us like ""what the f is up with you mofos??"", but instead was all smiles and served us on the spot pronto. He didn't want us to miss that bus. Now that's the kind of bar I like. Not pretentious. All fun. Thank you, Blarney Stone for being the coolest bar in my neighborhood. My friends and I stumbled upon the Blarney Stone when another place nearby was packed full of people. But I'm glad we came here instead because I was craving a good snakebite (cider topped with Guinness) and space.  The atmosphere is your typical pub ambiance. And I was surprised about the cleanliness.  To top it all off, the drinks prices are reasonable (my snakebite was $). I didn't see any creepy men there.  The people that I encountered were late s/mid s having a great time amongst friends. After enjoying a drink at Trad'r Sams my besties and I headed down Geary and landed up at Blarney Stone. The place was laid back and spacious and the crowd was chill (I hate using that word, but it was the best one to use to describe the people). A woman approached us and asked us to participate in a blind test of  samples of whiskey and scotch (gross!) but what kind of crazy person denies complimentary alcohol?!Afterwards we indulged in shots and beers from an extremely nice bartender who participated in our ""Best Friends For Live MoFucka!"" shots. It was fun! We had a blast and this is where the night ended for my besties. . . I helped their staggering drunk asses out back to the car, haha. I can't wait to head down to Blarney again! Many people were worried (including myself) when this place changed ownership a few months back, but I think it got better.  No more Irish brunches on the weekend, though they do have BBQs on occaision and my understanding was that they did plan to serve food ""soon. ""  Outside food is still welcome.  My favorite part of the change? Greyhounds and screwdrivers now include fresh squeezed grapefruit and orange juices, and by fresh squeezed I mean they have an actual juicer juicing actual fruit.  Score! I miss this neighborhood, this spot is one reason.  stars for being one of the best bars to hit up in the RichmondNice, clean and laid back placeThe environment can be to come and watch a sports game or spend an evening with friendsBartenders are really friendly and make good strong drinks at decent prices I came here after the Giants won the world series. Perfect place to be. To my surprise there was parking! They have a big outside patio area where you can smoke cigarettes and socialize. It's a nice long bar and the drinks do not take forever even on a busy night. The owners were all bartending and they were super cool and friendly. Definitely coming back for a chill night. Just a good ol' neighborhood bar that is obscured in the quiet part of the city. I am sure when people think of partying in SF, they don't think, ""let's go get faded in Richmond!"" So with that said, this place is pretty quiet and not that busy. If you're out to meet or hit on people, you'll be hanging out with yourself and the bartender here. But if you're with some friends in the hood and want to go somewhere to chill, this is a great place. They got a good amount of sports paraphernalia all over so it should be pretty good for sporting events as well. An awesome, awesome place to watch a game.  We were lucky enough to snag a table here for Giants/Rangers World Series Game .  Unlike a lot of bars in the city, The Blarney Stone is square shaped, not long and narrow, so they can fit a nice amount of tables in their main area.  Plus, the ceiling is very high, and they have a nice big movie screen hanging from the ceiling on which they project the game.  Add in a few flat panel TVs along the bar, and you find yourself with multiple angles from which to watch the action. The place was filled to the brim the night we were there, with everyone cheering on the Giants.  They had happy hour prices going on during the game, plus a burger/hot dog menu to keep our bellies full.  The Blarney Stone definitely took advantage of the World Series opportunity, and made for a fantastic venue to watch the game.  Thanks guys! I would go back if the bartender would wash her hands after playing fetch with her dog  dirty tennis ball and drinks do not mix. Great for watching games! Multiple Tv's, HUGE big screen. A bit small but wasn't crowded at all on a Friday night during the playoffs! Good Whiskey sours. . . % Amazing bloody mary. A weird look for ordering it on a saturday night, but what do you expect? Everything you could ever want in a neighborhood bar; good bartenders, alcohol, happy hour that lasts forever. I called in for a late drink on the way home after work last Friday  am or so. I know, I was late, but well before last call. I couldn't get served a drink. I waited  minutes and the two bartenders did not come over. Nor were they busy. They were hanging by the credit card machine; reviewing receipts/tabs and chatting with the regulars seated nearby. The bar back noticed me (nice guy) and others trying to get a drink. He brought it to their attention, but . . . . no go. They didn't budge. After  minutes, I left. I can't comment any further. Not bad!The space is great with lots of open space and seating, some great flat screen tvs and decent music playing.  However not very friendly and although the young women and man working the bar were nice, it was hard for them to keep up with all the orders and hard to get there attention. Hey Blarney Stone, thanks for hosting Michigan football! + stars just for that. The Blarney Stone just became the official Michigan bar for San Francisco (GO BLUE) and though it's kind of far out there, it's a great place to watch a game. Several flat screens, plus a pull down screen that most folks in the bar can see. It also has a square layout which lends itself really well to a lot of folks watching the game at the same time. Also outdoor patio which is awesome  I just wish that the TV they have out there was a bit bigger. Still cool that they have one at all. Bartenders are friendly and seemed thrilled to have the extra business. Wolverines, head for the Blarney Stone on Saturdays this fall. Notre Dame fans. . . you probably don't want to. FREE AIR HOCKEY.  Need I say more?  Fine, how about CHEAP DRINKS!  Got your attention now eh?  That's right, Blarney Stone offers up two things that no person can resist.  One STIFF white russian, one Lagunitas, and Blue Moon cost a measly $.  All served up by a super friendly bartender.  Maybe I'm just used to getting ripped off in Hollywood, but I thought I was getting away with robbery. . . and I liked it!  They also have a nice little patio in the back to enjoy those unbearably hot nights in the Richmond district *rolls eyes*.  This is definitely an awesome little joint to hang out with some friends, throw back a couple, and have some intense games of air hockey.  I'll be back soon for sure! the space is nice. well positioned tellys and $ high life bottles. spot on smoking area outside. I love this place!Citrus drinks are all from fresh squeezed fruit and if the Giants win happy hour goes until midnight!Can't beat a deal like that. Cheers! Great bartenders, lots of TVs, a patio, jukebox, table shuffleboard, darts. . . it's like someone put everything I love in this bar. PLUS, they take credit cards, which always puts a little smile on my face. Blarney Stone is a low key joint prone to regulars and the assorted passers by. It's a great place to meet for a drink and catch up, as you're never drowned out by the music or fending off (too many) drunk people. I've been watching a lot of the World Cup/NBA Finals here and it's been great. The only negative is that there's no food served (except in the morning for the World Cup), but they allow you to bring/order food from outside. Problem solved. Go forth and imbibe! It was quite on Sunday afternoon when we stopped by but I liked it non the less. I heard it was recently redone, they are serving breakfast during the World Cup games and soon will be serving lunch.  It's a definite stop if your thirsty, driving down Geary and see a parking place. Best of all if you only have $ bucks plus a tip in your pocket you can still quench your thirst with a Miller High Life. I dig this place when it's not crowded.  The staff is really friendly and the drinks are alright.  I wish they poured a bit stiffer but I'm a hard person to please in that regard.  My idea of mixing drinks is  parts Jack mixed with  parts Jack.  The atmosphere is relaxing, but you can yell and sing along to whatever is playing without too many dirty looks.  If you're there and it is not too late, there is an Irish bakers right next door so that is a huge plus as well. Who goes to an Irish bar for Cinco de Mayo?!?! I do!! Our group enjoyed SEVERAL coronas in honor of the holiday. Blarney even had a special mexican bbq with tacos and chips and salsa! It was the best spot to be! I'll definitely be back next year, and probably a few times in between! I fall everytime I leave this place. Like many things Irish, Does not disappoint. Blarney Stone is the best pub in the immediate area. The drinks are well priced, the staff is kool, and the environment is decent. It seems that they aren't doing the Irish breakfast on the weekends any more  that's a shame, hopefully they start doing that again. Anyplace that has $ mimosas made with orange juice fresh squeezed by a  bartender I'd happily give up men for gets at least  stars. $ bloodies and irish coffees on weekend days don't suck either. And darts can be fun if you know what you're supposed to be throwing them at. Year after year, I'm lured downtown to gawk at the pig pen that is Front St. on St. Patrick's Day. $ beers in a giant boot while crammed against bros declaring their love for Journey? No thanks, holmes. The result is the same. I grab the fastest bus I can and head for an Irish pub as far away as possible from the 'Di. I've been to Blarney Stone for St. Patrick's Day twice and it's been a consistent joy. A cozy patio with food and beer gets a drink in your hand faster than a normal night at any other bar. The crowd is friendly and it's festive enough to feel like you're getting crunk for a reason on a Wednesday night. And I really love the staff, from the friendliness of the door guy to the woman serving booze outside. Per esempio:  [ordering beer in the garden]Keane: You can just reuse the cup I have. . . Beerwoman: Are you sure?Keane: Yeah. . . I try to be green when I can. Beerwoman: Ah! Today is a good day to be green!! *winks and smiles*  Point, Blarney Stone. For the night's battle of wits has been won. . . $ margarita specials all night. High ceilings, no drunk patrons, just people enjoying themselves and their drinks. Awesome bouncer :) Was pleasantly surprised by this place. We randomly stopped by after eating in the Richmond  nice, chill bar, cheap drinks ($ patron margarita special when we went. . . yes, I had plenty) and great outdoor patio. We don't go to the Richmond often unless we're craving good Asian food, but will definitely add this place as a post eating spot for drinks in the future. Nice bar in Outer Richmond.  Staff was very nice.  Not a lot of people there but we went for a birthday and had a huge crowd with us so it was perfect.  There was lots of seating and lots of space and we didn't have to fight thru people to get a drink at the bar. love the Blarney Stone, bartenders are cool, music is good, and it's a chill place to go to. yaah! After using Yelp for well over a year, I decided to join you all and start judging myself! My first review. . . phew, it's a lot of pressure. . I wish this thing had spell check. . oh it does! Four stars because:  because the service is good,  because the drinks are good,  because they use fresh ingredients, even if those juicers totally get in the way. And I got sprayed! And  stars because of the following analysis on new leadership and direction:The Blarney Stone has been the local spot for years now, I've always gone in when I had the chance to grab a bite (ha! the portions are huge, there will be no nibbling here!) of brunch on the weekends. Though they do not have the same rush of people frequenting, as they used to, when I first moved here, they still have an amazing Irish breakfast/brunch. Get the Ulster, it's amazing. I've read the reviews, and yes, Bart seems to have a hard shell, but at least he's real. He doesn't just cozy up to anyone who throws a dollar down, and I appreciate that. That goes for that new Indian chick too, who seemed to be handling the brunch and the bar! Woo, that girl can move! (I think her name is Rasha. . She's cute. ) The're both efficient and courteous and seem to handle the drunks well. They ask you the basics any bartender will ask. . and will talk with you if you have something interesting to say (not as though you need to bring up the Zeitgeist conspiracy or anything. But I think they figure if you want to talk you will talk. ) The atmosphere is different, not bad, just different. They have not really found their own new identity yet, seemingly riding off the old one. It's like an old friend who has undergone a drastic life changing event, and they themselves, in turn, have changed. . But it's still your old friend the Blarney. Stay tuned for my next review! Alright, the Blarney Stone got sold in November. . its run by new people and has new management. It's been no secret I've been unhappy about the change, but only because I don't do well with change in general. . I've been going because it's local and I've felt dirty doing it. . But like Pavlov's dog, I've been trained to walk over to st and Geary to relax. . and I tell you. . . It's actually just as good as its always been. Just cleaner. They hot Irish guy still works there on Monday nights, and they still have awesome brunch on Saturdays and Sundays to go along with the game. . . You will no doubt find me milling about. . This bar is about  blocks from my house and therefor convenient. My friends and I frequented here before it was bought out. Since the new ownership it feels a bit empty and just doesn't have the same vibe. Two stars until further notice. I went in here on a Saturday night and there were like  people. Seriously? After dinner, the wife and I jumped on the Muni limo from the FiDi to the Outer Richmond for The Blarney Stone's NYE Party. I have to say, it was probably the nd best New Year's Eve party we've been to in SF, the best being the dearly departed Pat O' Shea's open bar extravaganza in . The biggest reason we chose The Blarney Stone was, unlike most places in the City, they resisted the urge to make easy money by charging a cover, or even worse to make everyone buy overpriced pre sale tickets for a ""party"" that included nothing more than a glass of $ a bottle champagne and a noise maker. It was just crowded enough to have a fun vibe, but not overly packed to the point where it takes an hour to get a pint of Guinness from the bar. We got there about : and were able to score seats, a special treat on New Year's Eve in the City. The bartenders did a fantastic job of serving patrons in the order they stepped up to the bar, no matter what tricks the drunken masses tried to get even more inebriated faster. The crowd was great, with none of the amatuer, Jersey Shore ish shenanigans that we experienced on Polk St last NYE. We watched the Ball drop, had a few pints, and checked out before the wait for a taxi got too ridiculous (or the urge to head over to Video Cafe hit us). We don't make it in to the Blarney as often as we like, since it's kinda out of the way, but it's a great little Irish pub. The bartenders are super friendly and always treat you like a regular, no matter how infrequently you drop in. The beer prices are pretty standard, $ for a Guinness and $ for a Bud Light. They also have a cool outdoor patio that's great for killing those lazy football less Sundays in the Spring. One bonus is you can order food from John Campbell's Irish Bakery next door and the bartenders will bring it right to your barstool. Overall, The Blarney Stone is one of the better Irish pubs in San Francisco. A word to the debit card addicted like myself, The Blarney is cash only, but there is a Chase next door and a Wells right down the street. Found the bar  years ago, been going here for Happy Hour on the weekends.  It was an Irish pub with a friendly group, everyone knows everyone.  Now this place has gone under new management and the atmosphere has changed.  The old bartenders like Julie, Jerry are all gone.  After that experience I was not coming back.   Luckily there were  cool bartenders Dre and Chrissy who makes the bar a fun place to goto again. Great local Irish pub. Laid back and unpretentious, pub has free food on Monday during football season, darts, and a nice back patio. A bit more class than other Richmond establishments. I would never have found The Blarney Stone were it not for a warm day in SF and a long, ambling walk from Sutros Baths. We walked along the Lands End Trail from Sutros Baths to Baker Beach through the Seacliff neighborhood. At that point we decided to saunter back to the beach through Golden Gate Park (it was quite a long walk) and as we were heading to Golden Gate Park we spotted the Blarney Stone. Of course we stopped for a pint mid afternoon because it was a warm day, it was a Saturday and it didn't seem too unacceptable to drink at  in the afternoon. The interior is well lit and the bartenders are friendly. Everyone seems to have an Irish accent (bartenders and patrons) and they had Smithwicks on tap (my absolute favorite Irish beer though it will never compare to the stuff you get in the UK). They had a nice selection of ales and an even better selection of Irish whiskeys. They even had a few shitty domestic beers all relegated to the corner like a bastard child obviously neglected but necessary in this country and our expectations. It seems like the sort of place that would be fun in the evenings with live music, quiz night and darts. We sat for about half an hour with a pints and we chatted, listened to other conversations and watched the bartender pull an expert pint of Guinness. I'm impressed. Also impressed that the bathrooms are surprisingly clean for pub restrooms, but we'll see how clean they are if I'm back in the evening. We hands down loved this place. The food is great. The people are friendly and the bar tender was helpful. Granted it wasn't very busy when we went in on a Monday afternoon so at times the bar tender disappeared when we wanted service. But we weren't too picky about that, so it still stays up in stars. We ended up playing cards and laughing our time away at a table once we got a bit bored sitting at the bar. The cutest thing that happened: when I walked up to the bar and asked for our check, the bar tender handed me a napkin. He drew two lines separating three columns and said ""Dis is da one for yew, dis is the one fer da boyee in the middle, and dis is da one fer da other lass. "" I smiled and laughed. He did bill exactly what we each asked for and since I did share quite a bit of whiskey with the ""boyee in da middle"" we put our totals together and split it evenly. I wished there were a few more Irish whiskey selections, but I suppose I've been a bit spoilt by the Black Rose Irish pub back home. I stuck with drinking the Tullamore Dew happily. But there were the other usuals like Powers Gold, Bushmills, and Michael Collins. I missed my favorite Red Breast though. It does seem all the Irish bars we frequented over the day are cash only, and this one was no exception. However, this was our last stop so we had plenty of cash in hand after getting used to the idea. The afternoon impression: Cool, Comfortable, Friendly, Warm, and worth stopping by again. Oh and high recommendation to the curry chicken pasty. We just wished it came with more curry sauce instead of HP. One of the few authentic irish pubs ive been to here in the city.  Authentic meaning that not only are the bartenders irish, but all the patrons were as well, accent and all.  I wonder if its like that all the time.  And when i say all, basically, my friend and i were the only non irish in there.  And damn if everyone didnt seem like they were  feet tall.  My friend and i both felt incredibly tiny.  For the most part everyone was very friendly, minus the   jerk guys.  No joke, as im standing at the bar waiting to get a drink, this really tall guy starts talking to me.  I ignore him. . . i also couldnt understand a word he was saying his accent was so thick.  But i did understand, very clearly, when he leaned over to his friend and said something along the lines of ""aye, i could get a bj standing up no problem"".  I really could have gone without hearing that tidbit.  My friend looked at me, rolled her eyes, as did i, and we both walked away.  I have many friends that are irish, and I like the irish, but sometimes they really have no filter for their mouths.  Overall, its your typical bar.  Despite the asshole i came across, everyone else was friendly, including the guy at the door.  They also had live music playing and an outdoor patio.  If i was in the neighborhood, i may stop in for a couple drinks again.  Originally, i had this at  stars, but i feel i need to bump Blarney up an extra star because i appreciate owners who take pride in their business and really care about their customers enjoying their time at the establishment.  Gerard, is a very kind man who likes to make sure everyone has a good time at his pub.  I have no doubt that he has many loyal regulars as well as new patrons, who im sure upon meeting him, will want to come back again. Note:  its a cash only bar so make sure to have some handy. Great neighborhood bar for me and the roomies. Cash only, but there are like  banks in a  block radius, so shouldn't be a problem.  There are definitely some regulars that are there all the time, but never felt out of place when walking in there since the bartenders are so friendly. Also, it connects to the Irish bakery so they will sometimes bring in free samples or you can just buy some deliciousness and they walk it in when it's ready. Sometimes the girls and I go for ""one pint"" then end up staying there for hours upon hours, proving our attraction to this local establishment. It's just so relaxing there during the day on weekends. And, hey guess what? I wana tell you something. I love booze. It's usually a pretty chill bar unless one of the Irish teams they sponsor has had a big game, and then it gets good and rowdy. It's Cinco de Mayo, and of course, you'd go to an Irish bar, right? HUH? You read correctly or may be completely hungover from last night, but yes, in honor of this Mexican Holiday, my friends and I hit up the Blarney. Trust me, we were in the Avenues, and Tommy's Mexican Restaurant and Tia Margarita's were our ""Go To"" places for tequila y cervezas, but it wasn't meant to be. Crazy crowds inside and outside of both Mexican restaurants, and we weren't willing to wait a gazillion minutes for a table. *So, what's this Pinay Paddy and her friends to do? Go with Plan C  Blarney Stone! Our hearts were definitely in the right place, but we opted for no margaritas at this Irish bar, and instead settled for the brewskies. Anywho, when I used to live in the 'hood,' I'd frequent this place, and always solid good fun! I love the chill and relaxed vibe, and the patio area out in the back. Crowd can be a mix of locals, students, and even a few tourists. Decent selection of draft and bottled beers and lots of hard alcohol for your drinking pleasure. There is a jukebox and various tvs for your futbol or other sport watching, and oh BTW trivia is held on Tuesday nights. I also think there is karaoke night, but can't recall which day. No unisex bathrooms here (thank goodness), but one drunken evening, I walked into the Men's room by accident. Oopsies! When I realized where I was, I exited immediately to enter the ladies room, hoping no one saw. Boy oh boy, was I wrong. My friends got a good laugh at my expense. Whateves! :) As you may (or not) recall, a few months back, I yelped all Irish establishments in honor of St. Paddy's Day. I inadvertently missed yelping Blarney. Erin Go Braugh and Salud to you Blarney! A lovely Irish bar in the heart of the Inner Richmond, and next to John Campbells Irish bakery, a wonderful Irish bakery that I also hold near and dear to my heart! chill spot for an early st. patty's celebration. had a yummy half baileys/half jameson shot while the boys chugged irish car bombs. great little outdoor patio to hang out and smoke. karaoke was questionable, though. Wow.  I just went in there.  There wasn't anyone at the bar  I felt like I was walking into a locals only establishment and definitely didn't feel welcome.  To top in all off as I was leaving I caught some mouth from some Irish guy.  The management did contact me in an attempt to sort things out and I appreciated that.  Perhaps I stopped by on an off night. The Blarney Stone is a welcoming place. Always a greeting and a smile. The service is great and the bar tenders are very friendly. Ger in particular is one of the finest bar tenders in the city and pours an excellent Guinness! It is also a good place to catch up on news of Ireland, sports and gossip. I like that it rubs up beside the Irish bakery so if you are a little peckish you can hop in next door and order a pasty  they will warm it up and bring it in to you. Definitely worth checking out for a pint and a chat. We came here last night for St. Patty's day. . . . I don't usually go out to celebrate it cuz' I'm not Irish or a lush so I try to avoid the hyped up drinking days, but my brother wanted to hang out so we ended up here.  It was crowded, but not so bad that you couldn't find some standing room.  There's actually a nice patio out back lit by white lights and good conversation, but there were too many smokers there for me to hang out.  Funny enough, my brother just wanted to go out for green beer (since he's not a big drinker either), but they didn't have any here (which probably means its more authentic than some other places in the city).  I got a oz. Strongbow for . , which isn't too steep. . . but nothing really special about this place.  The dj just played s music and there wasn't anyone dancing, except for the one drunk old Irish guy that came up to us and starting talking nonsense. . . . . Around the corner from my house, has a pool table, has $ drinks, and is never crowded. OH they don't take cards. One of my favorite bars in the city, and not just because it's within stumbling distance of my house!  It's a proper local Irish pub with many local regulars and a fun trivia night every tuesday.  Friendly bartenders and a great music selection in the jukebox and a smoking patio/beer garden out back make it an excellent spot.  They show Setana Pub channel for all you soccer and rugby fans.  They also serve breakfast on weekends made fresh from the Irish bakery next door (also fantastic!)  it's the best breakfast in the entire neighborhood!  Try the Belfast Bap!CASH ONLY, and NO ATM!  Make sure you stop at the bank on your way to the bar! Just a block from my house this place is a cool little find. We have wondered in here a few times either before heading out for the night or making it our last stop for the evening. After reading the reviews I should I really want to go here on a monday and I didn't know they had breakfast!?! Everyone there is always friendly and it's always something different everytime we go. Not usually crowded which I think can be a good thing depending on what you're lookin for.  I would recommend to anyone stopping in the richmond Blarney stone is great!  I lived right next to this place for  months and it became my default spot if my roommates and I were feeling too lazy to venture very far.  The high ceilings and decor give you a european feeling and make for a cool ambiance.  The staff here are always really friendly and welcoming and make you want to keep coming back.  One of the best parts of Blarney is the back patio where you can enjoy a smoke with your drink.  This place def. trumps the pub style places I'm now walking distance from and is one of the main things I miss about the outer richmond. Disclaimer. . . . % of my adventures to the Blarney Stone have been on Sundays. . . Why?? (No, I'm not an alcoholic). Irish Breakfast: They get the breads from their Irish Bakery (conveniently located next door) beans and home fries among other things. . m. FOOTBALL: I am from Wisco and therefore an avid Packer fan, and a huge football fan in general. They have lots of TVs all the games, and you even get volume (I know some bars have the game, but play music. . just not the same) . I get a nice hot tea. . and once feeling in the mood. . grab a guiness Why else do I enjoy the Blarney stone?The employees are amazing, the owner/manager Ger is a great guy, and the ladies are all super friendly (And Im a sucker for accents, so that helps too) It has a really great home atmosphere. . I can show up in sweats or whatever I want, and just hang out like I'm sittin in my living room :) blood sausage! m! god! Ah yes, the Blarney Stone. . .  Quite a few good college memories of this place. . . my friends on the other hand, not so great memories.  One, in his drunken stupor promised me a million dollars. . . Still waiting to collect on that one.  Another just had a VERY rough night. . .  Good times though. . If I'm in the Richmond, I'll pass by this place always contemplating going back in, yet never actually doing so.  Would I go back?  Maybe, as one of my last resort bars. . . This is a great bar to hang out and have a Guinness.  I went on an off night so it wasn't too crowded, but it's a great place to just chill and have a beer or two. This is most  likely the friendliest bar in my neighood.  you really never know what kind of night its going to be. Its an Irish Bar with live music on occasion. The Bartender on Monday night rocks! ( we love you ) so. . . there are a hand full of dive bars out here. and this one is pretty nice. Its Dim and comfortable and Clean. its Clean. ( not so divey after all. )No fighting and yelling. I like this bar its Chill and well, its nice. The Blarney is an Irish Pub that tends to feature live bands and or DJ's. Yes, that is kind of a strange, combo. Come in here on a Saturday night and you're never quite sure what you're going to run into in terms of the venue. I think in the nights I've happened in I've seen, in no particular order. House music DJ, Lounge singer, Karaoke contest, Irish Fiddle band, Hip Hop Dance DJ, Rock band. Oh and other times it's been dead. Random! Aside from all that, during the week it's a pretty laid back place. On a side note, I don't know what the deal is here but they always have the music cranked up to , so don't expect to be able to hold much of a conversation on the busy nights. The bar itself is very solid, dark and 'pub like' with a big back patio that you'd never know was where unless you frequent the place.  If you're in the neighborhood, check it out and be prepared for anything in terms of entertainment. It's sorta like an Irish Pub. . . but when I was there, there was a Hip Hop show.  It's out of my neighborhood, but I went cause I know the bartender, she's super hot and Latin (yow), so I guess I really liked it.  There is a patio outside and a big gas grill that gets some use.  It's a typical bar, there is sports on TV, pool, darts, etc.  Come by if you're in the neighborhood, you will have fun!.  stars (extra / star is for my hot bartender) Candlelight!  With real candles!  And real candle wax!  Oh, this could get naughty. . . The cover of darkness and vast selection of alcoholic beverages gives this place an ambience of debauchery and madness, further evidenced by the lingering smell of regurgitated consumption.  I met a realy hot guy here on Tuesday night for some drinks and convo, and was excited to see that they had trivia.  Then the RHG told me he's not that into trivia, so my little trivia balloon deflated.  No matter, as we managed to talk about a plethora of subjects while partaking in two of the many beers that were on tap (in case you're taking notes, it was Widmer for me from my brief stint living in Oregon, and Sam Adams Octoberfest for him I could only imagine was to toast our mutual Boston connection).  Suffice it to say, this is yet another Irish bar that I like.  It was virtually empty when we came here, and I don't know how I'd feel if it was packed (less opportunity to use the candle wax in ways other than to hold up a wick), but I definitely dug the vibe.  They have an excellent selection of liquor, and had I not been trying to impress RHG with my beer knowledge, I would have liked to get an irish coffee.  Perhaps next time.  Although we moved on to bigger and better things that evening, I will look back on the Blarney Stone fondly, although I'm going to have to take away a couple of stars. . . .  for the occasional wafts of vomit odor this may make it an authentic Irish pub, but it's not that pleasant for them not taking credit cards this may also make it authentic, but I try to deposit all those ones I get from my other other job as soon as possible.  It's tough carrying around money in your thong, so I stick with the cards. Irish pubs are not up my alley, altho this one wasnt particularly irish. we came here on an off night I guess, cause it was almost empty except for a few  something drunks, tho not the slump on a stool type, the ""im so much fun, Ive been drinking for  hours, who"" type. so maybe if Id been here another time I wouldnt be so unimpressed. there are a few  tall tables with barstools to perch on, a decent sized bar, with TVs above it, and a back patio area, which is a plus. We had a big group, so we sat at the one large table in the back, which is next to the bathrooms and the jukebox. A creepy guy in his late s tried hitting on us and asking us about music, we pretty much ignored him, he played his U and we kept talking. later two severely drunk blondes, also about the same age, kept stumbling back to the bathroom. Its pretty sad when you are old enough to be a college student's mom, but you are still acting like one. The drunker of the two females stumbled back and tried the bathroom door the third time and found that it was closed, so she went outside and puked over the balcony into some plants. When she came back in, she used this baby voice, and told me that she had thrown up. I was a little taken aback, and complimented her. What do you say to someone like that? You're pathetic and maybe you should pick up a hobby? About a month ago stopped in to try the Irish breakfast; it is a huge thing, of irish sausages ( so fatty juicy, the oil just burbles out), generous amount of cheese and eggs in a freshly made hunk of bread. I thought it tasted ok, however, its' too much food. When it goes down, it will hit your tummy like a Hand Grenade. I came with my Irish buddy , who at  lbs, could not finish his food. Better bet is to split the sandwich and get your own pint of Guinness. Decor: pool hall. Service: very very slow. They served other people who arrived after us, before us. The bartender is hot. Stiff cocktails and great selection of cold beer. I repeat, the bartender is hot. The only reason I have been here is because of close proximity to a friends apartment, but it is one of the friendliest and cracking bars in the area. St. Patrick's day was absolutely crazy. I have never been on the back deck, but I hear its cool. Unlike alot of other people rating this place I have never ran into obnoxious people besides for a homeless man outside who proposed ""smoking a bowl, OF CRACK!"" We ate our food from John Campbell Irish Bakery here.  They didn't say a word.  That's cool.  Heard they own it too. We got a Guinness beer $ & an iced tea $ = $. Separate lad (men) & lasses (women:  toilet/sink) bathroom. Think there was  TVs in the place. As Irish Pubs go, this one isn't on my ""to do"" list anymore.  It might be if I were under  and single, but it is loud and full of obnoxious people, so if you fit that, by all means, go there.  The last time my husband and I felt like slumming we went there and the music was so loud and so awful we quickly found the exit.  There were those who seemed to be ""grooving"" to the loud and totally unmusical music, so obviously they have a type of customer. I can't give it a five because I have only been there on Tuesday nights. But, I have thoroughly enjoyed those Tuesday Nights. In case you aren't aware, that is their Pub Trivia night (if they are still happening. The last time I was there it was a pretty small crowd). The bartenders are nice, the atmosphere is pleasant, the soccer on the television is plentiful and they have deals on pitchers. I went to this place for the first time last night and I really enjoyed it!It was the last night of Blarney Idol and a friend's friend was performing. Sadly he didn't win but his competition was really good as well. It was a nice little place, seemed to have a really good atmosphere, and loved the  motorcycle sitting up in the door (well not the door but i can't think of what it would be called at the moment). But yeah. Good atmosphere, seemed to have really nice people. It's okay; almost got into a fight here because of some drunk morons.  I usually prefer getting my drinks without getting into a fight.  AtmosphereThe place is pretty big which is an awful reminder of how empty it can be on a slow night. DrinksThey do not have my Remy XO but that's to be expected in an Irish dive bar.  Generous pours of J. Walkers. ServiceAverage, except for the J Walker pours of course. I'm still half and half on whether to come back here again who knows? I live right near the blarney stone, and go there frequently. It's always a good time, if a little empty. The bartenders are friendly, they have an outdoor patio, and the drinks are reasonable. All around a great bar. I can walk here from my new apartment so that's one reason why I would come here. Other than that there is nothing extremely exciting pulling me back. It's a decent bar, decent prices, decent drinks, good people who work there, yes. The brunch was nothing too great. My Denver omelet had a very generous portion of all of the toppings, but it just did WOW me. Ya know?  They have a small patio out back which would be nice when the weather is warm. So, it is a good place to stop by if you're in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get here. This place is the opposite of Nag's Head  lame on a Tuesday and bumpin' on a Saturday. They have a decent selection of beers and they pour a Guinness the RIGHT way. Their whiskey sours are lame, and their Jack and Gingers aren't very good either. There was some good live Irish music on Saturday, and overall my buddy and I had a good time. But the crowd that was there on Saturday was kind of douche baggy. One particular group of people was WAY too drunk  they were doing handstands, knocking over speakers, and grabbing microphones. I am pretty surprised no one got kicked out. They certainly should have. I'm sure we'll be back, but I don't think we've yet found that perfect bar around th and Clement. The search continues! This place is awesome because it is right around the corner from my house. The first time we went was after a long night of drinking already, and we walzed in, had a jaeger bomb, and left, only noticing the fact that there were only  other people there, and the ladies room was more disgusting than i've found at any gas station. We decided to give it another try on a Thursday night a few weeks later, only to find that it was closing, at midnight. Disgruntled, we hit a few other dive bars on Geary and headed home.  weeks ago, we had a few sake bombs at Little Tokyo, and went a couple doors down to the blarney stone, where we found about  people, many of them foreign, a karaoke singer, and good beer. This once abandoned dive finally wormed its way into my heart, and i'll be sure to go back. Good people!Good drinks!Good Times!! A new addition to the Brainstormer pub quiz scene, and still nicely uncrowded.  Plus it's a cozy place with good lighting, and has authentic Irishness without being all insular like Costello's or Shannon Arms.  All in all, it's easily my second favorite pub quiz venue after the Chieftain.  Sadly, we still weren't able to grab first place we lost on the tiebreaker: How much was the fine imposed by Emperor Norton for calling SF ""Frisco""?  A lot more than we thought, it turns out. But at least we scored a free pitcher of Pilsner Urquell, which, when added to the  other $ pitchers we had, made it a pretty fun night overall.  Throw in the impressive list of friday night happy hour specials, and the back patio, and I wouldn't hesitate to come back here even without the pub quiz. I drank here in the morning a couple times and also in the afternoon.  I have only been in the front section, i didn't know they had a back area.  the front interior has a lot of wood, which I don't really like.  Good bartenders who know their Irish stouts.  A good Irish bar in the morning.  I used to always get the half Bass Ale, half Guiness drinks there. Good for a pint and hanging out on the patio.  Pretty much the only bar that I go to in my hood.  Friendly folks and they pour a good Guinness. They loose a star for usually smelling kinda funky (the bar not the people). This is a true Irish bar and pub, and yet very hospitable to ""yanks"". My Irish housemates and I make this our regular bar for Sunday morning breakfast which they start serving at AM.  The food is excellent, even for a vegetarian (try their house fries!).  The bar itself is very clean and spacious, with a long bar, a few high tables, and a family sized sit down table.  There's two large and clean bathrooms, a loud jukebox with great musical selections, numerous tvs, plus a smoking patio outside with picnic tables and a little smoking atrium in front of the bar.  The service is fast, and attentive, though make sure to smile at the Irish baristas just to be sure not to get on their bad side.  There's a lively spirit in the air, and generally the place isn't packed so it's great for communication and a good round of Magners. Honestly, a perfect place to drink and eat + with the added plus of being Irish! Stay away from my bar. Honestly go to the inner richmond bars, this one is off limits, if you must come stay away from the dart board or I might just take an eye out. . . Sorry for the rant, on to the review:Good pub, standard beer selection, stage (never seen anyone actually perform), and patio.  No hipsters or clubers here, just people who love to drink. Aye thats a  in my book. The quintessential neighborhood pub and oh so Irish.  LOUD music all the time except in the AM for world cup and other odd sport games.   No, I don't make a habit of frequenting bars in the morning but when you don't have a tv and have to see a game, this place is a great option.  Also, it makes a great Sunday afternoon post Ton Kiang hang.   So. . . I guess this place isn't my choice hang out on a Saturday night, but it still deserves   stars because you gotta love it. I dunno why this is classified as a dive bar maybe cuz it's not as purty as the Redwood Room. Anyhow, it's a large space with a most excellent outdoor patio and darts (Yay! Drunks launching razor sharp projectiles!) and ample seating including the standard, sturdy, beer soaked picnic tables. Bar tenders are friendly and they have got loads of good beer on tap (Fat Tire is SHITE!) and a few angry Irish men slumped over the bar. Bring your buddies or just sit down next to someone that's already there everyone is very friendly especially if they've been on the drink for a few hours! Favorite Irish pub so far in the city, sorry Napper!I came here for NYE and that particular event stands out, probably because it's the clearest memory (yeah, booze). I was actually going to not go out, but Dave and Jill dragged me out (thank you!). I danced the night away and at the end of the night totally made out with a girl while her brother watched in horror, she was moving to Spain the next day (yea right, thinks me) so we didn't ever see each other again, but I'll be damned if she didn't call me from her Spanish cell phone in the awesome bar I worked at briefly in Nerja, Spain to thank me for recommending it to her and for making her New Years Eve extra special. Talk about an awesome call!the bar is great, they have an outdoor seating area which is sweet. It gets packed pretty easy, but always a crucial stop on the Geary crawl. I really should make a list of the Geary crawl hot spots  it's a fun freaking night. Maybe Someday. This is definitely a very Irish bar. The employees are Irish, the beer is Irish, the whiskey is Irish, and the decor is Irish, but it is also a great neighborhood bar with a surprising amount of variety. On your average weeknight, you may walk into this place and see no more than three or four people enjoying a beer and shooting the shit with the bar tender. On another night, you may walk in to find a large group getting rowdy watching a football game (soccer for us Yanks). Sometimes, you'll come in and find me playing dominoes, And, if you come in late on a weekend you'll likely find a full blown dance party complete with DJ and smoke machines. Basically, this place has something for everyone and great atmosphere to go with it. This was my truly first DYL experience from start to fin. . . one of the first  to arrive around ish where i was openly extended with warm fuzzies by Eric W, Black Irish G and Jennifer s. (actualy i think Christopher K was there b all of us at the bar)  A bartender was sweet enough to roast me very own fresh irish coffee yum!Like  minutes later and being amused by BIG's rendition of a black leprechaun images. yelp. com/photo?id…other Yelpers rolled in with the adjoining of many tables and downing of Guiness, Jameson, and Irish Coffee. . . oh. . oh a live Irish band is playing tonite hot!Later in the eve we had taken over the dance floor, most of the seating area and the back patio.  I got to meet tons of new faces and share in the laughs of much DYL zanyness.  Yes!  I actually caught Rommy G's famous worm in action smooth as hell!!  Got to stomp, march and clap all night to smokin' jams with everyone and learn how to bust some real, authentic jig shit from Mark a p!  Killah!The patio was very comfy, tho the heating lamps weren't on. . . i was just buzzed enough to get egged on by NISHisHOT to try and ignite some power into the battery with my ass. . uh thanks!  Yo Todd!!  Great pick and to the staff at BS big ups!  Had a decked out dude playing the pipes and a harem of miller lite girls hooray! We were all having way too much fun and ended up heading over to Gabriel R's for the afterparty. . . thanks Kathryn for helping me get there in one piece! I'm glad not very many Yelpers made it to this happy hour. . . . so there! First off, there wouldn't have been enough room because it was crowded with Irish people dancing to an Irish band, drinking Irish Car Bombs and passing out on the Irish bar then receiving Irish kisses* from the few Yelpers that did attend. Second, we wouldnt have all had a place to sit on the cool outside patio, chit chatting the night away in a more intimate group than you normally get at a DYL. Most importantly, it wouldn't have been as special to share with tons of people the moment I found out that Black Irish G. is actually White English G. (yep, uh huh, his Momma told him so, on the phone, I was there. . . I heard it with my own ears). *Irish kisses are sort of like French kisses. You still use tongue, but you use it to lick various body parts of passed ot Irish guys. HOT! This is a great Irish Pub, proper style. Show up early, drink lots, pass out on the freaking bar if you'd like.  The bartenders won't bother you.  Be warned: other patrons might use you for photo ops. They have a small terrier who resides on the spacious patio out back.  He's got the most awesome non threatening, ""I'm all excited but slightly annoyed"" snarl.  I think someone fed him after midnight. The Blarney Stone is a good Irish bar. I really like the patio out back. . .  the drinks were very strong.  I had a good time here.  It is a haul to this bar from my apartment, so I doubt that I will make a regular habit of hanging out there. I don't know how to say this other than Blarney Stone is the standard I will now use for other bars. It's not trying to be some trendy club bar neither is it a dive. It's a bar through and through. The hard wood layout is classic. The juke box selection is plentiful. The live band is a group of lively octogenarians. The bartendress is polite and service is swift. Drinks are clean, just strong enough and moderately priced. It's a lively good time, and may only have been as good as it was because of it is St. Patrick's Day weekend. Regardless, I would come again in a heart beat. I don't know where the Irish in this neighborhood live, but they hang out at this bar.  I spent far too many days watching the World Cup games here, and eating the massive ""full Irish breakfast"".  Their food is good, and they have the standard beer choices, but half the appeal of the place is the outside seating. Cute place, dark, jukebox gets a .  to  stars. Room to dance if you're into that sort of thing. The bartenders are always friendly here.  I come here sporadically, and never have the same style of experience.  They have darts and a patio as well. I have to admit I used to like this place more with the old ownership, but its still a fun spot to go hang out. One of the very few out in the richmond with a patio thats open after dark. I watched a couple world cup games here too. The selection is not large, but definately enjoyable. I love the Blarney!  If you are a local in the Richmond  Irish or not  this is the place to be!  Great local pub, good drinks, wonderful music (well  as long as the DJ isn't there). The only complaint I have is they have a GREAT beer garden out back with heaters, and everyone used to do out there there smoke, but due to the noise of the DJ  they have closed the beer garden.  No one is allowed out there on Friday or Saturday nights for any reason. This sucks!  I say get rid of the DJ and bring back the beer garden! This review is for breakfast only. Did you know that they serve breakfast at the Blarney Stone? My roommate comes here all the time for their irish breakfast and I finally came long to try it. It's pretty darn good, it's like regular American breakfast but with more meat. What's not to like about that? You get eggs, home fries, beans AND four different kinds of meat. Yum! They also have the most delicious shortbread cookies ever here. i've lived in this neighborhood all my life, and well. . . Patrick S's review is right on the money!! (esp the sob story. i spent a good chunk of Thursday night trying to decipher a sob story from this guy that had the heaviest Irish accent. think brad pitt in snatch. )This is definitely a great neighborhood pub  luckily it's right down the road from me. all of my visitors make it here at least once during their stay and all have loved it. make sure you go there on one of the nights that the jaegger spout is broken. FREE SHOTS! When the sun comes up the streets are full of Chinese and Russians sharing the neighborhood.  But when the sun goes away, the Irish leave the construction site and come to the Blarney Stone.  I don't think I've met and Irish person at this bar that has been out of Ireland for more than a couple months.  If you go alone, you'll spend your night listening to some poor Irish bastard's sob story all night.  If you see Clive, tell him to hang in there. The coefficient of Irishness at the Blarney Stone is one of the highest I've seen in any San Francisco drinking establishment.  It's not a classic facade whose extent of Gaelic culture is a shamrock over the door and a barmaid with an accent.  No indeed. . . I've come by the Blarney Stone half a dozen times, and each time my ability to join a conversation has been utterly neutered by my inability to understand some of the most incomprehensibly thick brogues I've ever heard.  The crowd is very Irish. . . and very local too. The authenticity doesn't stop there either. . . . a SETANA like sports channel seems to grace the best positioned television, while numerous types of athletic jerseys (I'm guessing soccer) hang behind the bar.  A largely wood interior with tasteful decoration contributes to a musty but pleasant vibe, and a lovely outdoor patio sits beyond double glass doors in the back.   The patrons tend to be friendly amongst those of their own ilk, but they seem wary of strangers; During my drop ins at the Blarney Stone, I've gone  for  in striking up conversation.  It's overall feel is somewhat like Durty Nelly's on Irving, but the crowd reminds me of the somewhat quieter lot at the Sam McGuire on Noriega. Well moderated music and civilized patrons make this place a great retreat from the noisier spots along Geary and Clement.  If you're Irish, you'll no doubt find kindred souls, and if you live near th and Geary, It's worth it to break in as a regular.  But if you stop by as an outsider without a brogue, bring a date or come with a group.  It's a tough crowd to crack. . . . and one that's left me sitting with little more than my own thoughts on more than one occasion."|6|92|2|Routine| Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities  [ date violation corrected: 12/18/2012 ] Moderate risk vermin infestation  [ date violation corrected: 12/18/2012 ]
Mamá Art Cafe 0|4.0|Art Galleries in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|115|0|4.5| Mamá Art has a fun, ever changing atmosphere and a parklet out front. They even did an amazing exhibit on Cuban film posters. The staff is friendly, bilingual and laid back. Our go to order is a large drip coffee (which I dress with brown sugar and cream), an iced latte, and two veggie bagels. The avocados are always perfect and they have that sandwich down to a science. Our toddler goes insane for the veggie bagel and you will too. Love the fact this family owned coffee/art house is just down the street from my house. Mama is always quick with a hello sweety or sweetheart which makes my day. My love for soy white mochas has only grown since I found this gem of a place. Cute cafe, good coffe, great ambiance. I'm usually not a fan of Mexican hot chocolates. . . . but the lady changed the game with her Mexican mocha. . I'm a fan!!I wish their lox bagels came with sprouts though! Hidden gem in SF! I am becoming some sort of an expert in cafes where to go and get work done and this is so far the best! The coffee is great (of course fair trade. . . ) and unique, I had a Mexican Mocha uhm deli. Good atmosphere and today, a super treat, live music with guitar David Trevors who comes to play every st Thursday of the month,  pm. An interesting art expo too. My lucky day. I love the veggie bagels at this place and treat myself to one  or  times a month.  I'm not much of a coffee aficionado, but their iced coffee is good and they offered me a Mexican Mocha one time which was very good, even though I was a little shy of having the cash on hand to pay for it.  Mama is a really sweet lady and treats me well each time I'm there.  I've never used the wi fi there, but noticed that they did take down the (not unreasonable) signs requiring a $ minimum purchase to use their internet connection.  What kind of a douche would go ahead and use it anyway then have the nerve to write a negative review complaining about it?  Sheesh!They often have interesting artwork there.  It's definitely worth stopping by for the good cafe fare and friendly atmosphere. Only decent place to get a latte around this area. I would even say it could be better than my usual starbucks. A definite recommendation. I will have to try the breakfast  sandwich sometime. So happy that this coffee shop is in the Excelsior instead of a Starbucks! Their brewed coffee is delicious especially the organic Colombian. We buy the whole beans in bulk to brew the coffee at home as well. The egg and bagel sandwiches are also delicious. It's a great spot to get some work done, and it's nice that the tables aren't too crowded togother. Also love the rotating art on the walls!|5|94|2|Routine Inspection| Permit license or inspection report not posted Inadequate food safety knowledge or lack of certified food safety manager
Mamá Art Cafe 1|4.0|Art Galleries in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|115|1|4.125|" Great neighborhood Cafe, with nice ambiance, and good coffee and food.  Their breakfast bagels are delicious, and a must have is their mexican mocha, to die for.  Highly recommend visiting this cafe. After passing by this place so many times whenever i go walking to the bank especially that living in the excelsior/amazon crocker for a long time, finally got to try it Egg bagel  $  its pretty good. The egg is like thick size. It was steamy when they give it to you. It also cheddar cheese, cream cheese, avocado, onion, cucumber, and tomato. Even it maybe expensive, this bagel can keep you full for breakfast since it quite filling and thick. Small regular hot chocolate  $: kinda pricey but i like that it actually hot. compare to most places, hot chocolate is usually luke warm. The hot chocolate that i had at this place had a lot of the chocolate flavor. At least it wasnt flavorless. Has photos/painting/arts on wall to make it homey. Looks like a family own local coffee place since its seems like its a mother and daughter working together at the cashier when i came inPlay music in backgrounds Its roomy and cleanFriendly service and it seems that the workers enjoy talking to the customers and it seems that they will remember you if you become a regular I was happy to find this place on a random Saturday. I am pretty easy to please, but the baristas I met were very friendly and made me feel welcome. I liked the local art on the walls  some photography. The drinks seems decent enough, but I admit ice latte like I had is easy enough to make anywhere. I just felt happy when I came in and ""Mas Que Nada"" started playing while some sunlight shone through onto the DIY looking furniture. Possibly I am overly generous on all my reviews, but damn the torpedos,  Stars to Mamá Art Cafe! I moved into the Bernal Heights neighborhood recently and decided to do some exploring in the general vicinity. I ended up needing coffee at : AM on a Saturday and discovered Mama Art Cafe. This place is functional, funky and get's the job done as a caffene dispensary. The breakfast bagel sandwich was delicious and I recommend it! Megumi,Sato,KamataniI am a reguler costomer. I come to Cafe Mama,almost everyday. To see my friends at there  times a week. Owner&Mama are very nice people. that why,we are having good times. Workers are very friendly too. I will recomend to anyone. Come to Cafe Mama! You can enjoy fine organic Cafe&Nice music too. Sometime,I play the Piano to my friends,also. Good atmosphere for everybody. Everybody's favorite is Bagel sandwich. I think Cafe Mama is a like second living room for everyone.    Thank you. I hate this stupid place. The owner of this cafe is RUDE, ARROGANT and very NASTY.  My sister witnessed her be very degrading with an African Immigrant who was asking for the wifi password. My experience:I was walking my dog while my sister was inside placing an order. I politely waited outside, and called my sister to come out. She starred at me for about  minutes straight with this dirty look on her face. I acted like I didn't see her. I DO  NOT RECOMMEND OR SUPPORT ANY BUSINESS WITH THIS CAFE! Good breakfast bagel! It's a sunny day an I'm walking on Mission Street in search of a cafe with wi fi. Instantly I gravitate toward the outdoor music playing right in front of Mamá Art Cafe. The place has white walls with pops of orange, brown and yellow and covered with beautiful art. It's spacious and the you really get a sense of productivity and comfort in a community setting. The coffee is pretty good and the owner is someone who obviously knows her regulars. All in all, warm, fresh and understated. Love it."|5|94|2|Routine| Inadequate food safety knowledge or lack of certified food safety manager  [ date violation corrected: 8/7/2014 ] Permit license or inspection report not posted  [ date violation corrected: 8/7/2014 ]
Mamá Art Cafe 2|4.0|Art Galleries in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|115|2|3.8| Nice little coffee shop in the outer mission with a good seating area out front. Also a nice selection of bagels and sandwiches. One of the only local coffee shops I even know of near D. C top of the Hill area! I thought i was confined to Starbucks when I stay over there EW. Right on mission next to Burger King. . . Tons of street side parking when i went weekday around am. Found Mamas thanks to a business friend suggesting a coffee meeting here. Great White mocha! Great Lox Bagel! Super fresh n delicious. The ladies that work here are all super sweet! Very cute and cozy deco inside, lots of places to sit inside and out!Ill be back Im glad I know about them now! I only had the coffee here and it was pretty good. I was allowed to use the wifi after purchasing just a coffee, despite their signs all over the counter that say you need to spend $ minimum to use it. Yelp says it's free, but seeing signs like that are kind of a turn off and not very welcoming, especially when there are more than one of them clearly in sight. I appreciate that they still let me use the wi fi for work but please get rid of those signs. I enjoyed the people watching there though! Some really interesting people come here during the day and the workers here seemed to be very friendly and close to a lot of the folks who walked in. Fresh flowers were also on the table, which is a plus. The place is spacious and is a good neighborhood place. My suggestions would be to get faster wi fi. It was a bit slow. Get rid of the $ min signs unless you enforce it. Otherwise, it's an empty threat that's not welcoming as a first impression. The lady behind the counter was really nice, and the drink I ordered was actually really good. However, I came here to study and quickly found out it was a poor place to do it due to the music playing loudly over the speakers. Additionally, there isn't enough seating. I love their Mexican Hot Chocolate! It's rich, thick chocolate and has the right amount of cinnamon and spice:) The coffee selection is alright, but they are lacking a bit in their food selection.  Would love to see more fresh pastries.  I like the fact that they have local art and music here, which is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  Now get some awesome food and we're in business! I have to first say that I've only been here once but you know what they say about first impressions. . . . So here's my take based on my first visit to this cafe. I was burning some time while waiting to meet up with my honey and walked into this place. I waited for about  mins. for someone to appear and take my order. Hm. Finally, someone showed up from the back, I asked for a tamarindo tea. They were out of it. hm. Ok, I went for my go to order at any cafe  a mocha with soy milk. No soy milk. Ok. Nonfat milk it is. Then I asked about the empanadas that was advertised on a sign at the counter. . . . no empanadas today, at this time. Guess it's only available during lunch. I was there at pm. Oh well. i got my mocha and sat down at one of the small round tables at the window. My mocha was not that great, it tasted like it was from a powder. Overall, I wasn't too happy with my first experience here. I may come back for the empanadas if I can time my visit during their lunch time which I guess has to be before pm. Good coffee, fair prices. Nice selection of pastries. The outside seating area is nice as well. These guys are magical people in a magical oasis in Excelsior. We love this place! Can't wait to go back. Bagels rule, coffee rules. I crave the Egg Bagel here from time to time. It's toasted with butter, then they add scrambled eggs, red onions, tomatoes, and cheese on a bagel of your choice. Each cup of espresso drinks are made to order. Fresh grounded beans and fresh steamed milk every time so don't worry about how long the espresso or milk been sitting there. Regular black coffee are self serve so go right ahead, pour it yourself first, then pay. I love how their arts constantly changes on their walls. From photographs to paintings, to hand crafted arts. . . you name it. They sometimes have local music artists that come play their instruments as well (guessing Sundays).|5|94|2|Routine| No thermometers or uncalibrated thermometers   [ date violation corrected: 1/3/2014 ] Moderate risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 5/9/2013 ]
Mamá Art Cafe 3|4.0|Art Galleries in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|115|3|3.88888888889| I get a breakfast bagel and a soy cap; both are always solid. The reason to come here is the atmosphere. It seems to attract a minimal amount of hipsters and its a nice quiet place to grab a cup and read/study. I have met a few random people here and they have all been really cool down to earth. Definitely a cool spot to go to. I like the atmosphere and plentiful seating and even a nice parklet outside. I came in here with a friend to redeem the yelp deal. The place was pretty dead. The lady didn't come out of her office until a few minutes after we arrived. I got a veggie bagel and an egg bagel. $ each. I liked the atmosphere of the place. The egg bagel had a big slice of egg in the middle, cheese, and I forgot the rest. Lol. It was good but didn't like the onions on it. I liked that the veggie bagel had cream cheese on it but didn't like the cucumber and onions. I would probably get the egg bagel if I were to come again but the veggie bagel did smell really good. .  stars: Crap I checked in after I paid so I wasn't able to purchase the yelp discount. This cafe is near my friend's house and I had to get some work done. Free Wifi with a purchase ok! Got a Bagel with cucumber and cream cheese and a white chocolate mocha. mocha was eh, too sweet and not enough espresso flavor. The bagel was tasty. The place I liked, lots of light, relaxing and nice service. I would go back. I like this place.  Nice people.  Good coffee.  And a parklet out front. Super friendly staff, tasty bagels and coffee, cheerful and bright physical space. Had some trouble with the wifi, but mine may not be a representative experience in that regard. I love going to Mama's on the weekends real early in the morning and getting a medium organic coffee that has the best aroma and tantalizing taste.  The blend of beans is amazing and the coffee has a unique delicious taste.  They are very consistent and believe it or not, Mama's is a real treat to have in the Outer Mission! Went here while I was waiting for my Car to be serviced. It was a nice place. Got an iced soy vanilla latte and egg bagel no onions. The service was very friendly and the bathroom was very clean Whenever I get breakfast here, I get a bagel. I've tried the veggie bagel and egg bagel which are each $ flat. I do prefer the veggie bagel because there is avocado, but both works for me. I've tried their hot caramel machiatto and it was good. It wasn't super amazing but it was good. It was $ something. I did not have to add anything to the drink. it was good when I got it. I plan to try more of their drinks. Their food menu is pretty small and you will not be able to get a bagel if you come at PM because they stored everything away.|5|100|0|Routine|This inspection has no violations.
Mamá Art Cafe 4|4.0|Art Galleries in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|115|4|4.23684210526|" I've been to Mama Art Cafe mainly for the delicious egg sandwich. Theres a really sweet young girl who makes them REALLY REALLY GOOD. The coffee is ok. I like that they have coffees from around different parts of the world. However, I have a mixed review from my last visit. The really sweet girl was not there and there were two older ladies there. One of them (I think was the owner), wasn't initially very nice. I honestly got an arrogant vibe from her. She later on loosened up and tried to make small talk. Either I misjudged her or she saw that I wasn't impressed. Also, my egg bagel wasn't as good as the one the other makes for me. I even think the lady left out a couple of ingredients that make this bagel so good. I still plan on coming here but would honestly prefer coming at a time that I know I will get great customer service I love the chai frapp here!The worker is a dear. She politely asked if i wanted additional things added to the frapp, and when i told her my specifics, she definitely took note of what i told her. The ambiance is alluring. The walls have beautiful paintings on it, and amazing art done by local artists are adorned on the walls by the frontmost window. There are either couches or chairs and tables to use. This place definitely gives off that ""homey cafe"" feeling :)Its a cozy place to be in :). I haven't had their coffee yet, but i definitely will be back to yelp on it! This place makes AMAZING bagels. Some of the best I have had in a long time, so good. Not sure about their coffee, as I didn't have any. This place is really amazing. I'd go there for a cup of mocha even at PM in the evening! It's so delicious. Haha, the old woman who works behind the counter is so adorable, too. I like watching her as she slowly stirs the little cups till perfect before finally pouring it into the paper cups. For me, $ for any drink is pricey, but here, it's definitely worth it. I DON'T EVEN LIKE COFFEE, LOL. Though one time, I was in a rush (I'm sure she saw) and my friend and I ordered at the same time. She ordered a Caramel macchiato and I ordered my small mocha, but as I watched them make it, I saw her squirt caramel vigorously into both cups. HAHA, ohwell, though, I like caramel anyways. (: She looked apologetic, but just so long as I got my mocha!  It's absolutely delicious. Once, she asked me how it was and I  said, ""It's delicious, way better than Starbucks. "" She starts laughing at the mention of Starbucks. Haha Starbucks cannot even be compared to this place. :] I am still waiting to go back to this place, soon! This is a wonderful neighborhood stop. I don't patronize any of the coffee ""chain"" places, this is a cozy friendly place that offers fair trade and organic coffees. In  this was voted Best Cozy Cafe in the SF Bay Guardians Best of the Bay issue. Each month there are art or photography exhibits from local and afar that you cannot miss!You will not find another place like here. Besides a vast selection of coffee and tea drinks, there are plenty of eats and sweets. Even if you don't live in the Excelsior/Outer Mission you just have to try this place. And if you're very lucky, the owner Paulo himself may be there, and maybe even his mom. They are probably the warmest people you'll ever meet, and so deserving of your patronage. And as well, in the past, they have been supportive of Community Events and often generous donors on occasion. Colorful, peaceful, comfortable cafe which really brings my humble Mission Terrace neighborhood to life. The food is simple but tasty. Clara and I sat on a comfortable sofa and had good, fresh bagel sandwiches (egg/cheese and veggie/cream cheese) and yummy chai and coffee. They also have lots of juices and fresh croissants. The owners are really friendly. They display beautiful art from local artists, host live music every week, sell fair trade coffees and donate money to local causes. Great people running a gem of a cafe. I will be back regularly. Decent. I just happened to stumble upon this place the other weekend and was pleasantly surprised. This a great coffee shop! The coffee was excellent and the staff was super friendly and nice. The place was very clean, spacious, and had beautiful art covering the walls. All the coffee is organic so the coffee is a little more on the pricey side but worth it. I plan to head over here again this weekend for another latte. Finally decided to try this place out after passing by it several times.  The lady was so nice! She dealt with me having to go back to my car to get some change, then me changing my order, and then having to change the size. . I'm not usually a difficult customer so I felt really bad. Also, I used to work at a coffee shop so I know what it's like having to deal with customers like that.  Nonetheless, she took her time to make my drink perfectly! I wanted my chai to be iced and instead of just pouring the cold milk with the chai she steamed a little bit of it to make sure everything would blend well. The result was AMAZING! The chai flavor was nothing like I've tasted before. . seriously though, it is on point! And the drink was so smooth, I didn't want it to end.  Usually when I get chai with soy milk it's always too sweet but this one had just the right amount of sweetness and spice. Definitely will be back! I was expecting a little more local art but it is a cutie little place to hangout for a cup of Joe. Love it when locals support their neighborhood businesses I would've given them five stars, but their WiFi isn't really ""free""  you have to spend at least $ in order to use it (sign is posted next to the cash register). Other than that, I love this place! I used to frequent Martha & Bros. which is basically right next door, but after I read all the good reviews people wrote about this place, I decided to give it a try. And I've been coming back ever since. They're famous for their Tiger Chai (and I'm ashamed to say that I've yet to try it. . . . I always get the soy white mocha) and they have live music on the weekends, which is definitely a plus. In terms of food, there isn't much of a selection. I heard their bagels were good though  just don't expect to find pre made sandwiches, parfaits, etc. Super friendly neighborhood cafe. I came here all the time when I worked part time and had three hours to kill in between my first and fourth period classes. Great place to grab a cup of tea and read a book or do work. Chill music and relatively comfy couches. A few fairly large tables that usually aren't all taken as long as it's not lunch time. Their food is pretty tasty for the most part. My favorite is a bagel and a bowl of their delicious homemade chicken noodle soup. The past few times I've been, the soup was sadly absent. Hopefully it's not a permanent thing. For coffee, I'd stick to Martha's down the street. Especially if you like it fairly strong like me. I'm at Mama's right now, studying.  She's playing mellow instrumental and choral music, which I appreciate. It is slightly too loud for reading though. Not too crowded, coffee is good, and the two couches are comfy.   Overall, great experience. I didn't give  stars because I tried to come the other day and there was live trumpet music.  The place is not large enough for that nonsense.  People go to coffee shops to quietly read or to have a conversation with a friend.  Come on. I live right in front of it! Every Monday is coffee day from there. Watch out for crazy people playing the piano poorly. Incredibly slow service. But I like the coffee and it's a really nice space. really good organic coffees. nicest cafe in excelsior. nice backyard but not sure if you can hang out back there. They have great chai!  The best in this neck of the woods for sure.  The workers are friendly and willing to customize drinks, but make the staples well.  Mama Art Cafe also builds into this community, hosting everything from open mics to office hours for the district supervisor. this coffee shop is a great addition to the excelsior neighborhood.  it brings a colorful vibrant energy to mission street.  decent coffee, and i love the fact that they sell dried goods so you can brew your own tea at home. Great sandwiches, bagels, and hot drinks. Clean, neat, and spacious cafe. Colorful and beautiful art to look at when you are there. There's a piano, and I assume customers can use and play music =) Love Love Love this place. . . . Fantastic!Sincerely friendly service. Clean bright space. Great strong coffee. Simple cafe fare. Another reason to explore one of the genuinely most vibrant and culturally mixed 'hoods in SF. Oh yeah, afterward slip into the ¢ store next door. Best stocked. . . ever. Oh Mama, you are so friendly and attentive with all your customers and I felt right at home on the first day, if only you were closer to me! I love the tea and the bagels of course are straight from the Noe oven and fresh every day. Also thanks for supporting the locals and their art and music. A  in my book. This place rocks. It makes me hungry just thinking about it. The breakfast bagels are really good and filling. I want to go right now, infact. # Strong coffee, good chai tea# Bagels, more bagels (variety?) :]# Clean, artsy atmosphere you wouldn't expect in the area# Warm service# Quiet# TV + free wifi with an excellent download rate# Seating roomI'd be back to meet a friend and sit down over a cup of strong coffee. If the Ritual/Blue Bottle brand of cafe is too pretentious for you, but you want organic and fair trade drinks, go to this cafe. It has the broken in, homey feeling of the Excelsior and is run by friendly Latino women, which makes for a living room vibe. Comfortable couches. The art is a tad kitschy, but it works within the context. Shout out to vegans, delicious hummus bagels though I can't vouch for the purity of their food ingredients. Still, this is easily the neighborhood's best hole in the wall for getting caffeinated. A good friend of mine and I decided to meet up for a cup of coffee and some sweet munchies and since we live in the area, we decided to venture away from our usual spots in Glen Park or Bernal Heights.  We decided to wander around the  Mission/Excelsior and found this place.  Open wide, spacious and quiet  a nice place to sit down, have a conversation with a good cup of coffee.  I really like the colorful tables  and the artwork on the walls are interesting.  The barista was very friendly; I'm a sucker for friendly service. . . love it.   My friend and I did want a cookie with our coffee but they had nothing but bagels.  However, there's a pretty good bakery right across the street,  so we were pretty much set.  We'll probably make this our local coffee and hang out spot. I use yelp all the time, but only just now joined to put in my  cents about this cafe. It's simple: Mama's is a warm, community oriented neighborhood cafe where you can get good coffee, well made, reasonably priced sandwiches and other cafe food. The folks (customers and workers) are friendly as hell.  You can sit here all day on the internet, good free wifi, local artists' stuff on the walls, lots of lovely light through the big windows where you can watch the Excelsior neighbors walk by (which is one of my favorite things about the place).  For the yelpers who've complained about the neighborhood (""I wouldn't want to be in this neighborhood after dark""), or the workers here not kissing your butt or supposedly not speaking enough english for your liking Why are you in San Francisco?  Maybe you'd be more comfortable if you stayed in Walnut Creek. . . For the rest of us  come to Mama's for a good cup of coffee at a friendly neighborhood business  the kind of place we should support to keep SF real. I like it. It's quiet and has everything I need to get a quick bit of work done. The chairs could be a bit more comfortable but it's a small shop. . . can't ask for the world. My laptop adventures continue.  I brought the laptop to Mama and was pleasantly surprised to see an unpretentious coffeehouse that supports local artists.  The environment was pleasant for working and the wi fi signal stayed strong throughout my visit.  I wouldn't want to be in this neighborhood after dark though. They had oatmeal, muffins, some pastries that looked Mexican (a couple were made with corn), and bagel sandwiches.  The place is spacious with mismatched furniture, free wi fi, bathroom, power outlets, an old piano, open kitchen and stacks of boxes.  They sell coffee beans and spices.  The coffee beans came in bags that said El Salvador on them. * Latte (large, $. ): it came in a gigantic cup, it was extra hot and strong, bold but with a sour taste.  The foam texture was too airy.  * Bagel sandwich ($): They use Noah's bagels.  $ for a bagel sandwich with  egg, cucumbers, tomato, American cheese, and red onions, is expensive.  The bagel was chewy (could have been toasted longer) and they layered the ingredients nicely.  Every layer was thin but equal in size.  Tasty. The coffee is good, and the seating area is not so bad, but one of the women who works the counter just completely turned me off. My friend and I came to have coffee and do some work for school together. We both bought a drink right away when we came in, and have been purchasing refills. We also have our computers plugged in to charge while we work. The last time my friend went to the counter, she was told next time we came in we needed to buy something for five dollars or more because we are plugged into her outlet. We have spent that much, just not at the same transaction. And why have wifi if you don't want your customers to use their computers? And such a tone from her in speaking to us! Repeat business?  Absolutely not! there is great light here and i like the local home flavor, but i was a little surprised when i was told that i needed to spend a minimum amount to stay and use the internet/electricity. I have never been harassed about this at any cafe I've ever been to anywhere, especially one that claims free wifi (I always buy food and coffee at the cafes I work in, btw). Granted, I understand the need to pay bills, etc. , but considering wholesale vs. retail costs of food and coffee, etc. , and overhead which should already be factored in, i am somewhat speechless and turned off from coming back. I will add, though, that the older woman smiled at me while telling me, and she told me quite gently. The younger woman was distant and not very warm, though.  For newbies, I would recommend coming either one time or just stopping by for a takeaway coffee. Keep in mind this is NOT free wifi, according to cafe stipulations. The Excelsior can be a pretty shabby neighborhood but between the fast food joints, dive bars, and greasy spoons is this little treasure.  The food and drinks are great and everyone who works here is really friendly.  I think one or two of the employees aren't totally fluent in English, but the Excelsior is a mostly Spanish speaking community, what do you expect?  My drinks and food have always come out right (and delicious!) so I'm not complaining.  My favorite thing about Mamá Art Cafe is that it really is a legitimate art gallery.  The featured artists are always changing and there are frequent events promoting artists.  There are also musical performances about once a week I think.  The only thing that I could wish for is later hours! This place brings back so many mermories. I went to high school a few blocks from here. This was where I came when i was skipping class,which was pretty much everyday. I would come here and have an everything bagel with cream cheese and cucumber,and sometimes when i could afford it i would have some hot cocoa. I would come here so often that the owner would be surprised to NOT see me here. I wonder if she still remembers me,probably not though because i came in the other day and had the tiger spice chai (which is the BEST!) and she didn't seem to recognize me. Well anyways,i like this place becasue it feels like it was once a second home to me. Yeah they don't have much as far as food goes,but i like it nonetheless. I am in Mama's right now, as we speak! I am sitting on this sticky icky yellow couch of theirs, glancing at all of these flies. Damn son! Their tiger spice chai is very delicious! However. . . I can do with OUT all of these dang flies! Other than that. . . It has been an enjoyable experience. I must go now. My planet needs me. I'm off to tapdance into the sun! Maybe I misjudged this quaint Excelsior cafe.  Since I wrote the review, I have been going back out of convenience rather than my desire. . . but the situation does seemed to have changed (just as I'm moving out of the neighborhood, but that's another story).  All the ladies behind the counter have become pretty friendly, even making conversation with me and the friend I come with.  I would recommend coming with the mindset that if they are rude to you at first, they will eventually be nicer as you come in more and more.  OH, and I've tried the veggie bagel since then, and it is GREAT!  Friend says the chai is good, too. Cute as can be! Great drinks/food/service! The atmosphere is clean, cool, and interesting! Perfect! We like this place and the people there. They host events for neighborhood events and have a good coffee to boot. Cozy and friendly, what more can you ask for. Oh yeah, a lot less crazy drifters wonder in here  Martha Bros seems to get them for some reason. Sorry for this sucky review, but this place (IMO) blows! I mean you have like nothing but bagles for ""sandwiches"" really? Oh no wait, you also have ""croissants"". I guess I am the only one not going there for coffee, but to me it seems they have nothing (aside maybe plain tea) that is healthy! And I must have came there on an off day because the girl behind the counter hardly could understand me (hey I speak some Spanish, maybe I should have went with that, but I don't think that was it either!) and it was really annoying how many times I had to ask her if the ""sandwiches are pre made?"" I mean it seemed like a simple question to me, yet it took her (seriously)  times of me asking to finally say ""no we do in here"" as she pointed to the counter. Plus they are too pricey IMO. Pass! This place is very active in the community. At town halls, they have donated coffee and pastries, its also a chill place. I have meetings with friends here, its nice they don't expect you to buy anything, if you just wanna come in and sit on their couch, go ahead. But I always get a drink or something cause I feel bad for being there and not buy anything. Awesometastic! tiger spice chai + veggie asiago bagel sandwich + sincere service & a dope ambiance = happy, happy days!i seriously love this place! it's hella cute, everything tastes good, and it's a business that supports the community. yay This place is so cute, I absolutely love it! Nice place to chill out and get some writing done, especially by the window. . . I just don't wanna blow it up too much and ruin my favorite low pro spot with hoards of people!  The young Latina woman who works in the afternoons is really sweet and always friendly and, hey boss, give this girl a raise! Fantastic place, everything is really yummy. . . . only suggestion is that they start taking debit cards! Great place to stop by if you're in the Excelsior.  This is a real San Francisco scene.  The place owned by a nice Salvadorean family who know how to make you feel comfortable.  Just don't go there if you're in a rush!! AWESOME! Love it here! Best service, fresh food, and clean. . . . . what more can you ask for! Oh my gawd. . try the Tiger Chai Tea. . . to live for!Sonia and I come here to play scrabble and the art work exhibitions vary and are beautiful! The bathroom overlooks a garden and the walls have murals as well! Cozy place with ample table space. You'll find free parking on San Jose Ave. . . it's worth the walk to avoid the stress of getting a ticket on mission as you lose track of time at the cafe. I love ""Mamá""!  It is a romantic Cafe Gallery with delicious Organic Coffee. As a visual artist, I was impressed with the opportunity to attend a recent Art Reception.  And while there, I had a chance to talk with the staff and learned more about the purpose behind the gallery cafe.  It is impressive how much work and love is put in to the exhibition and cultural events.  Plus I found it a great place to meet international and artistically minded people.  It is truly a warm and inviting place. Thank you ""Mamá"" for all you offer us. I am always fascinated by ""Mamá"" Art; Orrganic Coffee and Fresh Spices. This venue is decorated with colorful smiles, and International people.  I love my coffee from berkeley but Mama has never dissappointed me. As a dancer instructor and a lover of life, I must admit that this is true cultural gem in San Francisco. This is a genuine venue filled with inspiration. Thank you ""Mamá"" for keeping us smiling :) Things didn't start out well  the lady behind the counter had no idea about the % off deal mentioned on their yelp page, and there were no sugar free syrups for my coffee. But things got much better. Coffee was good, their parfait was jam packed with granola and fruit goodies (plus I had my choice of lowfat yogurt flavors), and my turkey and hummus sandwich was outstanding. Free wifi adds to the draw, though the seats aren't all that comfortable. Overall, a nice spot in an area that needs coffee shops such as this. The staff is super friendly and makes you feel like you're family. It's a ""everyone knows your name"" kind of place.  I walked in and was greeted by a friend and Camenita (aka Mama con acento sobre la 'a')!They don't serve too much food, but everyone was friendly from the staff and regular patrons.  I was with a resident of the area who was familiar with the staff and the regulars.  But it was not long before we were invited by a fellow guest sitting near us to attend a poetry night and our night was filled with great conversations.  The free WiFi is spotty so don't expect to have a great connection at all times. What a sweet place. The neighborhood surrounding this place is not good, but once you are inside it is very nice. Friendly staff, good bagels and coffee, and nice sturdy wood tables. Definitely looks like a good place to study at or read a book by yourself. the church where I pastor  yeah shameless plug  just moved into this district from Portrero Hill where Farley's was our hangout.  I knew the first think on the agenda was to find my new ""office"".  I had always known about Mama's but had never really spent any time here until recently. UM . . . YUM . . . WOW . . . AWESOMEFirst things first . . . quite possibly the best Egg Bagel w/Ham sandwich I have ever had.  Certainly not good for you in the artery kind of way, but oh will your soul be grateful. Top it off with an iced coffee, get your free wifi on and you have yourself one heck of an Excelsior hang out. And that is not even the best part  though free wifi and ice coffee are hard to beat  but the vibe here is all SF Excelsior district all the time.  This district is a constant rock concert in my opinion and it's people are the stars.  All the energy, color, edginess and beauty of the district can be found right here at Mama's. Thank you Mama's it is great to know you! I'd like to give a shout out to my good friend Paolo. Keep on moving!. Your business establishment is one of a kind and as a resident of the Excelsior. . . it is very gratifying to see the incorporation of various cultural themes that never cease to amaze me. Your consistent attempts at providing various art displays and performances for us is greatly appreciated. Having now understood the motivation behind your efforts is all that much gratifying. . . Again, muchas gracias Paolo! Besos y Abrazon a tu famila. . . . . . . hola Evelyn! The coffee here is pretty bad  I mean in Austin, the quality would be four star, but in SF, it's more like a one or two star. But there is something to this sunny, well lit casual space with cheesy pop music that has its appeal in the Bay Area, where it feels each cafe is trying to top each other in how hip it is.  Getting nice service (the woman here is really friendly and has service with a genuine smile and wearing a t shirt and jeans), having a calm non outdoing each other atmosphere is relaxing to me. Oh and free wifi! Lots of plugs.  Good for doing a little bit of work on a sunny Sunday afternoon if you feel like the bike ride out to Excelsior. Clean, friendly staff and customers, good wifi. Parking meters in front are  hr only. The Excelsior suffers from a lack of good bars, restaurants, cafes, and stores, but Cafe Mama is worth going to. It's really the only GOOD cafe in the neighborhood. The owners are great, the art is usually compelling, the food is decent, and the chai is tasty. It's got a friendly vibe and it's cozy. Viva Cafe Mama ! This was my first coffee experience in SF, but the staff made me feel like I was practically family. The place is sunny and warm, with artwork on the walls, a little bay of goodies to buy, and a great selection of food and drinks.      Unsure of which coffee we wanted, the cute little old lady gave us three cups to try each one  all of which were yummy. We snacked on the orange slices set out for communal snacking, then flipped through a little bio of the artist they were exhibiting as we sat at a big huge table. The owner even came over and chatted, telling me about ""Mama"" and the summer festival they have in her honor, the cafe, and the artist. What an adorable family owned and operated place, I wish I stayed in San Fran long enough to hit it up again! I've heard so much about this place for two years but I've only recently discovered and actually visited in the past year. Ever since then, I've gone back quite a bit. Imagine a stereotypical trend seeking, beret wearing, art infatuated guy in a coffeehouse. Cafe Mama allows you to get one step closer with the fantastic art, cozy atmosphere, and really great beverages and spices that they have. I love getting breakfast there if I can spare the time. I recommend their pesto sandwich and their bagel and cream cheese is always good. How can you ruin a bagel and cream cheese? Although, they do put so much cream cheese that sometimes I really do have to wipe away all that excess fat. I haven't got too much of their coffee or espresso based drinks though. Their freshly made orange juice, yogurt parfaits, and fruit cups are also a favorite of mine. I like Cafe Mama and that it's a local cafe. The story behind the opening of the cafe is always really heart warming, as a guy opened it in tribute to his mother and grandmother. They lose money (most likely due to rent or Martha Brothers or perhaps a combination of the two) but it's still impressive that they continue to open just for the community. You can also find some art exhibitions or programs meeting in their cafe, which they endorse and advertise so they really are more than ""that cafe around that corner on Mission. "" I'm all for supporting the local mom and pop store BUT to pay $ for a oz soy latte is just too much. This place is not cheap and it definitely is making you pay for free wifi through the drinks. The latte tasted good but I've had the same quality or better at more affordable prices. Also. . . the service was not fast. There were two ladies before me. The cashier girl took my order and didn't tell the person making it. I stood there wait and wait and finally noticed they served the people before me and then is standing around talking about something. It definitely wasn't about making my drink until they noticed me staring at them. It was not busy! Mama has by far the best coffee I've every had in my life.  They have like  different roasts that they import themselves.  All of the coffee is organic and fair trade.  They also import a variety of spices which you can buy at the cafe or at various markets which carry them.  The peruvian coffee is incredible. There is live music pretty often, and usually some friendly cool people hanging out.  the staff is great too, although they lost two cute baristas in the last few months, keeping me from issuing a  star rating. Good coffee, cool staff, LOVE the art  this is a GREAT local coffee place. Their music is very cool and I love the fact that they rotate artists. I love having a great local cafe! Yeah! Mighty Leaf tea + starRotating artists + starFree music on Saturday afternoons + starFree wifi + starThe nicest friendliest staff ever + starEven though it's Excelsior, I will be making my way out here more often it's that great! They make the best soy latte and chai!  Even just a regular coffee with cream tastes so smooth.  My bf likes their almond frap.  I think they have weekly music events inside the cafe.   Personally I haven't gotten the chance to go check  that out, but I kept going there for the drinks! Well this is a beautiful cafe. They have good coffee and the environment is very comfortable. The only thing that bothered me was all the flies circling around the middle space. They made me question the cleanlieness of the place. Best chai I've ever had.  Don't know how authentic it is, but it's spicy creamy goodness in a big, fat over sized cup.  I don't want to know the fat content because I'd never be able to get it again.  The folks are nice, and the food is uber slow, but worth the wait.  Not a place to go to when you're in a hurry.  This is a place for when you have an hour to invest somewhere.  The space is airy and light, even on overcast days.  A great place to sit and work. This is definately the only worthwhile place in the excelsior to hang out.  They have delicious espresso drinks, and Mexican hot chocolate so good that you'll pee your pants with pleasure.  The homemade chicken soup is also delicious and made to order; actually everything is made to order, so there's no disgusting reheated slop.  The people working are all super friendly, and so are the other customers. Come on Saturday for free local music.  They have a different band/artist every weekend.  Also, ask the people at the counter about upcoming events.  They have cd release parties and art receptions. The first time i walked by this place was when i was getting off work and i saw (now my friend) Thomas playing. I stood outside and he motioned for me to come in. I came inside and ever since that day (almost yrs ago) I've been comin back. i love how home feeling it is when you're there. you got a couple of tables, a couch, wonderful people employees, AMAZING art from the locals on the walls, the food is always fresh, there are never any ""surprises"" showing up in my food or drink which is always a major bonus. occasionally i'll show up on a thursday night where they have live FREE music. some of the musicians that play are worthy of a record deal. any one who is sick of the the burritos or entry fees, stop by here for a fresh change. Is there any kind of unspoken rule on what's considered an acceptable length of time for your stay based on how much you purchase? I stayed about eight hours yesterday, a full work day for me, and the entire time I felt completely comfortable and welcome! Their wifi works great compared to others I've tried, plus their food and coffee are delicious. I had an iced mocha, water, and a veggie bagel. Seriously one of the best bagel sandwiches I've had: avocado, cucumber, lettuce, tomato, salt & pepper, and cream cheese on a toasted asiago cheese bagel. So good!It seemed like a lot of people were getting the homemade chicken soup though. I definitely will be trying that out next time I come by here. =) pleasant, charming, affordable, and very friendly.  check out their bagged spices too. After our solid Hawaiian meal, we were picking our meat from our teeth and walking down the streets of Mission to do a little window shopping. Then a guy walking his dog with a cup of joe in his possession. His coffee was aromatic and can be smelled from a distance. Then Matt approached the guy and asked, ""Hey buddy, where you get that cup of coffee from?""He responded, ""Mama's. It is located next to the Burger King. I love their coffees!""Without any hesitation, Matt dragged niece's hand and ran down to the coffee shop and check it out. This coffee shop is very pleasant and has no sight of ruggedness in this cafe. Matt had a medium Vanilla Latte. And for $. , not only that it is cheap, the hot drink was very tasty. The drink is good enough to revive Matt's struggle through the day. Niece had a  oz White Mocha. Her $.  is also a winner. A smile on her face is proven evidence. The coffee shop is a family operated business and a damn good one. Back in the day, I used to come here every once and awhile because it was by my school. Very relaxing and comfortable atmosphere. I always enjoyed the artwork they had on the walls, and the workers were always very friendly. The name is also very cute. FREE WIFI that actually works, and works well, since it seems underused and underappreciated in this neighborhood.  Been here for the whole morning in this spacious cafe and saw only  other laptop people (and not at the same time). Good yogurt parfait and egg bagel. Jazz playing pleasantly in background.  Cool photo art on the walls. Clean bathroom. They have live latin jazz on Saturdays  check on the time. Don't you hate it when you order something to eat and you're all happy, then you see what someone else ordered and you wish you had ordered that instead?  I definitely had one of those moments last week as I sat sipping on my white hot chocolate (tasty) and drooling over the soup that the girl across from me was sipping (smelled like heaven).  This place is totally cool for supporting local artists.  In fact, the reason I was there was to see a friend and his group Active Crime Transplant (may as well plug it).  I like this place a lot.  Not enough to go to SF regularly from Oakland, but I've never been to a cafe THAT good. I love Mama Art Cafe. First of all because they actually do have a commitment to supporting local artists. The walls are covered with a revolving display of local artists' work, and they sponsor live music regularly. Everything from the latest up and coming indie band to accordeonists, chanteuses covering torch songs, to jazzy bass mood music. Like another reviewer I am puzzled that it is not more crowded. But maybe that's a good thing. There are always a couple people inside either chatting or working on their MacBooks. . . you never have to fight for a seat (and I LOVE the cushy couches to cuddle up with my computer). Best coffee shop in Outer Mission (Martha & Bros is just a few doors down and is a close second but I prefer Mama's if I'm going to drop a few bucks to rent space for my butt for an hour) This cafe/art/music space is the best in the Excelsior. I'm amazed it's not more crowded all the time, but with the ""name brand' of Martha and Bros. up the block, it's got competition. It's named for the mother of one of the owners, and she is often there behind the counter. A friendlier kinder Mama I can't imagine knowing. Many of the people who work here are family and friends, and the family style attention really shows. The breakfast/lunch menu is small, but everything is always very fresh and made to order. The breakfast bagel sandwich is one of my faves  delicious! The space is always decorated with fresh flowers and original artwork hanging on the walls. A beautiful custom mural decorates the back wall. Be sure to check out the bathroom and its quirky decor. I'm a Mama's boy.  Mama makes you feel like you are part of the family.  The owners, people who work at this cafe, and the clients are all so easy going and warm.      Fresh food; free wi fi; live music every Thursday night and Saturday afternoon.  A blend of Folk and Latin Jazz, and sometimes impromptu performances by local artists who are also customers.  Attractive Latinas behind the counter, always with sunny, authentic smiles.  Very cool yet down to earth.  Walt Whitman would have loved this cafe.  The coffee quality can be improved, but I really just go there to make friends and see all the beautiful people. This coffee shop is located in the outer mission in a pretty nice neighborhood. It is owned by a nice Latino lady who receives you with a smile every time you come by. They don't have anything more than simple sandwiches and bagels with cream cheese to eat, but the place is a peaceful place to chill out during midterms and finals. Everything is so clean all the time, even the bathroom, and they have large windows by which the sun fills the place with light during the mornings. Once in a while they have musicians performing live music."|5|98|1|Routine| Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils  [ date violation corrected: 4/24/2012 ]

I am a regular.  I love my amigo Chefs that always prep me a wonderful meal.  It is an old school diner.  I ordered many dishes from their burgers, breakfast burritos, Latin dishes  they never failed me.  Every dish I ever had gave me a #mouthGASM I def would recommend this place to anyone who loves to eat at diner type places & would enjoy a meal for a good price. I have passed by this place several times before on Tuesdays before I go to Dance Mission to take hip hop dance classes. Last Tuesday after work I came here to eat for dinner. As you go inside the decor reminds of you diners in the s and s. I didn't want to have a heavy meal. I ordered two items: Queso Fresco and Mission Omelet. The first item is fried cheese similar to fried mozzarella sticks. It was sort of salty maybe because the cheese itself was salty. The second item omelet consisted of chorizo, mushrooms, and ground beef. What I liked about this omelet was it wasn't heavy as other omelets I've had in the past. Nothing spectacular about my meal but overall I had a fulfilling dinner. On our stay in San Francisco this place was across the street from the place we were staying at. The service is extremely friendly and great. My crepe was amazing and yummy and def a great price and my fiancés Denver omelette was meaty w/ great filling home fries!   If you're in this area it's a def must come! One star for the steak sandwich I had a few months ago, and another one for the the chilaquile sauce that was actually spicy. It's a decent place to eat at, but maybe it's because I've always had the same server. I've enjoyed what I've eaten here before, but today there was an issue with the service."|4|74|6|Routine Inspection| Moderate risk vermin infestation  [ date violation corrected: 4/21/2014 ] Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 4/21/2014 ] Improper food storage  [ date violation corrected: 4/21/2014 ] High risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 4/21/2014 ] Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities  [ date violation corrected: 4/21/2014 ] Improper cooling methods  [ date violation corrected: 4/21/2014 ]

We sat at the counter for breakfast around am and there were only a few other patrons around. The server recommended I order the chilaquiles for breakfast and I am so glad I did. They are delish but fair warning: it is a heavy dish so definitely wear your stretchy pants and maybe take a spin class beforehand to offset some of the guilt :) A lady that works there, be careful because she over charges. It's a good place to eat and um the prices are reasonable. Just watch out for your bill! I've walked by this place a thousand times and never took note of it. Well, I should have. The prices are great. The service is great and extremely friendly. And I loved the chilequiles! I became a fan of that dish while vacationing in Puerto Vallarta and I was overjoyed to find a local restaurant that faithfully prepares it. It's a diner, so it don't expect fancy decor. The lines are too long & it's hard to find parking but the chilaquiles of mole poblano are delicious. The woman waitress Lolis or Lolita has no respect, she likes to caress mens face & play with their hair if she knows them & doesn't matter if their couple is sitting their. This place is a great spot to have brunch with friends/family. The service is excellent. They're friendly and chipper, of course a bit slow when it's busy. The owner[manager?] is really friendly, he even gave us some quarters to put in the jukebox one time. The food is good as well. I really like the tiramisu that they serve. The omelets and scrambled eggs are on point. Might I suggest the home fries? Those are so yummy! First of all parking is hard to fine. Mission's Kitchen is a great place to eat breakfast and lunch. The pancakes, burgers, and omelettes are well made, has Mexican breakfast as well. Not to pricey, service is good and friendly. When the place gets packed watch out because the waiter might forget about you. Overall food is fantastic love this place but they lost there touch and the service/waiters sucks now of days. . . . .

Mission’s Kitchen 2|3.5|Diners in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|88|2|4.15384615385| This place is tip top. To me it is one of San Francisco's top spots. Portions are good, large and excellent quality. Bilingual staff and the food is prepared right in front of you. Went here b/c Pollo Campero had a line around the block. The waiter was so nice. Very homestyle food. Big portions. My salmon was tasty.  Sat at the counter like the old days. Great lunkfast spot.  Half Mexican restaurant, half greasy spoon diner.  Best Chilaquiles in town! #Boom.  Great greasy spoon. Want St Francis quality without the handlebar mustache or the goat cheese scramble? Come on over, spend / less and leave happy. I'd be here daily if my health wouldn't suffer as much as it surely would. Do it. Huge portions. Great prices. Great food. What's not to love? its a decent place i like the sandwiches and the chilaquiles i would always go with a friend and we used to have a really good time i would recommend this for breakfast/brunch and lunch good, clean , really friendly service, great for mexican and american breakfast at very affordable price.  great hash browns crispy, not soggy. Great local diner with a great staff. The portions are big and the prices are very affordable. I love coming here and ordering the mole chilaquiles, they are delicious. Am I the kind of girl that will swoon and fall in love with the first diner that brings me a pitcher of sweetened condensed milk?  Yes I am.  They brought us an entire pitcher of sweetened condensed milk.  OMG.  I did not know you could put it in a pitcher.  Yes, I think I am in love.  This place is super cool, you walk in and you are greeted by a painting of a chihuahua (Chico! Chico! Chico!) and a warm hearty welcome.  The staff are all super nice and the food comes promptly. We had juevos rancheros and french toast  you get a pitcher or syrup and a pitcher of condensed milk for your french toast (and for pancakes too).  The food was good and plentiful, filling up the giant plates it is served on.  The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is relaxed, no wonder they attract a diverse crowd.  Love it! The servers here are so friendly and have great attitudes. The food is always really good, with really generous portions.  I've tried so many things and loved them all. The Mexican omelet is like a burrito inside egg instead of tortilla the beans are really good. The frittata is always super bomb. Sweet things like waffles, pancakes and french toast are great they come with mounds of fruit on top and either syrup or yummy Lechera. I have no complaints about this place at all.  Oh and somebody said they use RC cola I beg to differ, it's Coca Cola. Come here for cheap in price, good in quality food, a fun atmosphere, wonderful service. Understanding that this is a very casual diner, how is it possible to hate on this place? You've got comfortable seating, a very friendly staff, great food portions and extremely reasonable prices. A breakfast here will run you approx. $ and you will be well fed. It's also kind of cool how the indigenous Mexican population seamlessly eats side by side with the dot com crowd. You'll definitely want to get to know Mario (among the rest of the wait staff); he's awesome. This is not a place where you would expect farm fresh or organic fare. But if you're looking for a fun, casual, inviting atmosphere with generous portions at reasonable prices, then look no further than Mission's Kitchen. And you can trust me on this one; I'm an Elite. ;) This was seriously awful.  I am a huge fan of mexican diners, obsessed with Red Cafe, and figured I'd branch out and try another spot. . . . . The reviews couldn't be more wrong.  My central american breakfast cost $, had inedible bacon (how is that possible!), the gallo pinto was so dry and overcooked it tasted like sawdust, and the cheese was a rubbery rock of fried nastiness.  They even got the plantains wrong  deep fried, so missing all of the essential delicious gooey goodness.  They even got the soda wrong  its not cool to try and pass of RC cola as diet coke  you can clearly taste the difference. I will not be going back, and I recommend that you don't waste your money as well.  I am sorry write such a negative review because they are nice. . . but the food was disgusting, and in the mission there are so many more delicious options. I'm giving these guys  stars because they're everything a breakfast place should be. This is not because the food is going to blow you away.  That said, I got a bomb waffle with fruit, eggs, and bacon, and it was all greco.  I always feel comfortable here, and I think that's the most important thing in a breakfast place.  The waitstaff are just on top of their shit!No line, plenty of seating, great prices, and prompt service.  Please go.|4|92|4|Routine| Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils  [ date violation corrected: 1/9/2013 ] Improper storage of equipment utensils or linens  [ date violation corrected: 1/9/2013 ] Wiping cloths not clean or properly stored or inadequate sanitizer  [ date violation corrected: 1/9/2013 ] Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 1/9/2013 ]

Not a go wait in line place, it's a want to go out to breakfast, not wait, get some hot food for a decent price type place. I love Mission's Kitchen. They're not overpriced, they have a nice array of breakfast foods to choose from, and the service is great. Everyone's really friendly and the food is served relatively quickly for a busy place. Their spin on traditional egg dishes is really fun too. Their Mexican frittata is great, though watch out for the jalapenos if you're not one for surprise heat in your morning meal. Most (if not all) breakfast dishes come with a meat or potato side and a bread (either a tortilla or sliced bread, in most cases). The hash browns are my particular favorite. It's an unassuming, not too big not too small kind of place. I'm definitely a fan. Good diners are a rarity in the Bay, but Mission's Kitchen is the real deal. It doesn't have a huge menu, but their breakfast options are quite plentiful, not to mention yummy  there's a definite focus on Mexican cuisine here, which suits me just fine. I ordered the chilaquiles with the spicy salsa and MAN they weren't kidding about the spice! It was so good, though, that I just had to keep eating, despite the fact that my tongue was practically crying. Service is very adorable and friendly, portions are plentiful, it's cheap, and, most shocking and awesome of all, the place was not overrun with hipsters despite its location. Dy no mite! We sat across each other in the same booth every time. The servers recognized us each visit; ""More coffee?"" They'd ask. He went for the mole chicken a lot. I chose different breakfast entrees every time. Huge portions for a reasonable price in the city (under $ for most!)Highly recommended: French toast served with sliced fruit on top. Lovely bit of vitamins on decadence. We could sit here for an hour or two, talking about immigration politics, our friends' lives, or checking our iPhones for updates. Greasy spoon diner, but it had a lot of charm for us. I will always treasure the moments spent at Mission's Kitchen. I love this place so much, it took me a long time to write a review, partly because I am selfish and I don't want to have to wait in line once people hear the buzz about it, visit and realize how amazing the staff, food and prices are! And partly because I didn't want to rush and write a half ass review, Mission's Kitchen deserves better! Anyhow, the story goes like this: I used to be a Red Cafe fan, but my friend Curt always said ""Mission's Kitchen is better"" and I totally shut him down (yes, I can be a fascist) and thought he was cray cray, however, one day he finally dragged me to Mission's Kitchen and since that day, I haven't been back to Red Cafe! Why? Because there is no reason to! I can have an AMAZING Latin breakfast for $ less! I was irritated that Curt failed to mention that:) They have cute waitresses!) They have a jukebox! (I LOVE jukeboxes)) It is freaking cheap! ) The portions are massive) It's ran by Latinos, frequented by Latinos and they play Spanish old school music) They have an entire Latino breakfast menu (huevos divorciados, chilaquiles, huevos rancheros, Mexican frittata, Central American breakfast)) They close at pm, which is a fucking rarity in this side of the MissionIt's been a few months and the honeymoon stage is still going strong. By now, Cristina, Lourdes, Miguel and the rest of the gang are part of my food family. Now to be completely fair, if I could change something about this place would be their drink selection, I wish they had fresh squeezed oj or at least Martinelli's apple juice because I dislike fountain drinks, but really, once I see my delicious huevos divorciados or beautiful chilaquiles (for $. !) I no longer care about my beverage, because by then I feel sorrounded by family, eating at home. Mission's kitchen is truly a delight. . . I recommend this spot with the utmost of enthusiasm. I first tried it about  months ago and have been going back about once a week ever since. I've brought at least  friends to try it, and the verdict is unanimous: Mission's Kitchen is friggin' amazing. Service is great. The staff are friendly, accommodating and engaging. Definitely service with a smile.  Greasy spoon/hole in the wall/diner atmosphere. . . but nonetheless inviting.  The price is right. . . less than $ for a meal that, for all intents and purposes, could sufficiently feed two people. The food is wonderful. The chilaquiles are phenomenal. One of my friends said they were even better than his own mother's recipe. Both the spicy and the mild sauces are delicious. Another breakfast treat are the ""divorced"" eggs. . . although the title is a little off, the flavor is spot on. The mole is sensational. Breakfast burrito is awesome. . . haven't explored the lunch menu yet. . . mostly because I'm already hypnotized by the chilaquiles. You don't wanna miss out on this place, it's a gem!! just went to brunch here on a saturday afternoon.  the staff was super friendly and attentive, smiles all around.  had the chicken mole enchilada plate which was great.  some of the best mole in the city i thought, a little spice and very complex flavors.  kind of like an old school diner menu with a latin american twist.  would definitely recommend this spot for a chill place to fill up.  the plates were double size and completely full. Such wonderful service  always with a smile and accommodating.  Very clean.  Food is great.  I like the huevos rancheros a lot and my friend ordered the sausage  the sausage looked great.  Very reasonably priced and a huge plateful. big breakfast for little dollars. they keep your coffee full even after your plate has been bussed. get the sausage, trust me. I'm willing to try out all the best breakfast places in the Mission. This place already had me coming back twice. Prices and portions are beyond reasonable. Service is attentive as expected. Cozy diner feel with wooden seats. Cleanliness could be an improvement, but with the price I'm not trippin. Recommendations by friends come a long way. Solid. Not fancy, but always good. I haven't had a bad brunch there yet, and i live around the corner. The Central American breakfast is my fav. And love the sweetened condensed milk with my pancakes. The prices are reasonable, and the service is tops. Greasy Spoon Diner + Latin Flavor = Mission's Kitchen. Countless times I've plopped my hungover ass at the counter, been greeted with a cup of coffee, and indulged in chilaquiles mole poblano.  The servers are friendly, the service is FAST, there's a ton of American and Latin breakfast items, and you can eat and drink and barely break double digits on your bill.  Viva Mission's Kitchen! Very very nice staff and cheap! I love the chilaquiles! Friendly staff, great place  to start the day, but dissapointed about the oj, I'll stick to coffee . . . But everything else great In my book, if the service is great and the food is cheap AND good, then they deserve  stars. The huevos rancheros and chilaquiles hit the spot. I'm definitely coming back!! A solid diner. I've had breakfast here twice, and both times the food was ready in under  min. It was nothing out of the ordinary, but it was hot and fresh, and they kept my coffee mug full. The coffee was also above average. The wait staff are attentive and friendly and polite. Top ten Diners in SF as far as I am concerned. It's clean, the service is great, they have satisfying cheap food and it has a great diner feel feel. This is one of my favorite spots for a good breakfast with coffee for under $, with tip! When I am destroyed and hungover I crave a simple dinner sammie and a cup of soup with unsweetened ice tea.  I do not know why but it always works miracles. They make their own chicken noodle soup so it isn't a consistent flavor and in my opinion that is a good thing (bo the Sysco fication of food).  It isn't that it is sometimes good or sometimes bad but rather sometimes it has more carrots or sometimes it has more bay flavors.   There is nothing fancy or great about the food but it does remind me of diner food outside of Philly or in Jersey. The staff here seems friendly enough, and the food is cheap. Apparently it's cheap for a reason. Stopped in here this afternoon for a quick bite. Ordered grilled cheese (asked for cheddar) and a milkshake. I got what I think may have been a velveeta sandwich (disgusting) and what they call a ""milkshake"" is actually cocoa powder, milk, and ice thrown in a blender. ick! Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing, but I'm not sure I can bear the possibility of a meal that bad again, so I doubt I'll try it again in the near future. check out the lady waitress! and they have good burgers too. if you need a place to warm up in the mornings its good too and they have a big menu with good and very affordable food. nothing to complain about! maybe show more skin lady waitress? Huevos Rancheros for $. ?  Check!  I thought they were a little tomato heavy, but certainly filling (with good rice & beans), and quite a deal for the price. Mission's Kitchen is a classic cheap diner, and is everything you'd expect of a classic cheap diner.  A mix of counter seating and booths (it's actually fairly large), and lots of bright orange paint.  Is the food great?  No.  But it's dirt cheap, there's a lot of it, and it's filling!   bucks will get you oatmeal.  They've got a big collection of box cereal.  They've got box wine.  They've got GREAT bacon (really, considering how ordinary everything else was, the bacon was quite outstanding  pretty thick cut, cooked to just about crispy, with a nice peppery crust on the edge.  Nice!). It's clearly a local favorite with a lot of regulars  about half the people at the counter spent their time chatting with the staff like they'd been best friends for years. Good, friendly vibe, long hours, breakfast all day. . . just what you'd want in your neighborhood diner! This place looked promising and my friend was too lazy to walk the extra block or two to Red's Cafe.  Big fat sucky mistake. The service was extremely s l o w.  The servers were pretty nice but somewhat inattentive.  Was it because we sat in the nook in back?  Unsure!  I ordered the chorizo and eggs and my friend had the huevos rancheros.   minutes later we got some lukewarm food that tasted sort of meh.  You know, meh.  Okay, not wonderful  not even ""ok. ""  If it had been the temperature food is supposed to be served at, maybe it'd be ""ok. ""  Because we were hungry and pretty thankful we finally got something plunked down in front of us, I think we just shut up and ate it.  But I ate mine somewhat angrily. Would I go back here?  Heck no buddy.  It is cheap so if you're broke and don't care about that which you ingest, give it a go.  You'll understand what I mean.  Next time I think I'll force my friend to walk the extra little bit. Hallelujah! This place has the best value I've found in the Bay Area so far. You can choose among various mountains of delicious ""American"" and Mexican Central American food for under $ under $! I had the huevos rancheros and they were great; my friend's chilaquiles were equally good. Service was quick, friendly, and bilingual. I declare this my ideal choice for a Sunday morning hangover cure. its a good ass breakfast place definetly better than toast , , great omelettes and great service , so greasy soo good The food's actually two stars worth (chorizo and eggs), but the low prices, having breakfast available anytime, and great service earn it the third. This is THE PLACE for huevos rancheros! I came here on Sunday because all the other breakfast places in the Mission were absolutely packed. I didn't think it would be awesome, but I was totally wrong. The three of us devoured our eggs and pounded coffee (Saturday night was pretty eventful) and spent about $ each. A success in my mind! I discovered this place on New Year's when I couldn't find any other place that was open by my house. I remember ordering the salmon scramble and the french toast with fruit that first time, and I've ""been a fan"" ever since. When I took Kota Bear here for the first time, she ordered the pancakes and they fixed them so that they were shaped like Mickey Mouse's head. I didn't even notice until she pointed it out. Now whenever I watch Kota on the weekends, we have breakfast here almost every Sunday and it's become our spot. I think she's hooked on the Pops cereal : )  This past Sunday we ordered chicken nuggets, Pops, and a breakfast burrito and it all came out to about $. It's a good deal for all the food you get, but stick to their breakfast. I've come for dinner and it's not as crackin as their breakfast. Decent, but not as good as their breakfast menu. I was craving pancakes, went here and got the Pancake Special for $. , which includes  pancakes,  eggs, and  bacon or sausage. Not bad at all. I think it's a decent and convenient choice as there's not really any conventional breakfast places in the area. Totally satisfied my craving. I had some time to kill early on a Tuesday morning while I got my oil changed at B&W. I was hungry so I decided to take a walk and find some breakfast. I was originally going to go to Boogaloos but then happened upon Misson's Kitchen which looked clean and inexpensive so I figured I'd give it a try I sat down at the counter and ordered a frittata along with hash browns, toast and coffee. I really like that the food is all cooked right behind the counter  being able to watch it be prepared makes for a better dining experience . The service was friendly and the food was decent for the price. Great service, great, cheap, yummy, big breakfast/lunch. I always get the cheese, mushroom omelet.  As most omelets are skimpy on the cheese this one is always ozzing with fat. I LOVE IT! I loved the open kitchen.  When things picked up, watching those two cooks was like watching wizardry. . . A three egg Spanish Omelette with hash browns and toast for $.  was wizardry for my wallet. . . This place is brought to you by the folks behind the El Farolito empire.  The prices are great there, too. . . I love Mission's Kitchen!We discovered this place last year on one of our trips to SF. We wanted a good mexican breakfast in the afternoon and that's exactly what we got. We went twice last year during that weekend and twice again last weekend on another SF trip. The chorizo con huevos is awesome. They make great beans. I'm not to happy about green beans in rice but I just pushed them aside. I've also had the chilaquiles. When it comes to chilaquiles, everyone has their own style. They makde them with tortilla chips,green salsa (m) is poured all over and topped with mexican cheese. They were awesome and our waitress was cool even though she looked at us funny when five of us crammed into a small booth. lolWe left her a nice tip for her excellent service and it was much appreciated as my friend caught her smiling after she cleaned up our table. It's one of those places we'll always go eat at whenever we go to SF. I went there one time, :pm on a Wednesday night. Sign says closes at pm.   Sign on door says open. We walk in and they say they are closed. ""Your sign says pm?"", we reply.  ""closed!"", is the answer we got.  enough said. . . Your food comes fast, the service is friendly, and it's great prices for the large quantity of food you get.  I LOVE the centro american breakfast, it's awesome.   plantains, eggs, rice & beans, toast, fried cheese, and bacon for $.  Totally delicious. great food @ even greater prices on your table in front of you by the time you are done talking shit about the pork store's chorizo plate!  the staff may not be that attentive to your needs once you do have your food, but at least the ""main dude"" can subdue you with his big ass deer eyes and make you drink your coffee/water like your waiting for the love of your life to come back home. . . yeah his eyes are that intense!  bottom line. . . .  great food.  great prices.  good service  close to (my) home Not bad.  The only thing that's pretty awesome about this place is the price.  The food portions are HUGE and the prices are so so so cheap.  However, don't get the Mexican Frittata.  The eggs were super dry and the entire thing was pretty flavorless.  However, I'll always go back because I'm a student and the food is cheap. At breakfast, way too much of our two plates came from either a can or a freezer. Nice staff, but a definite no repeater. Very friendly & attentive service & just a half block from th Mission BART.  Now that Herbs Fine Foods up the hill on th St is closed this is my fave greasy spoon cafe. Food isn't great, but certainly not objectionable, and the price can't be beat. New Years morning this was the only place open that didn't have a line down the street.  The place was packed but we actually got a seat right in front at the window.  The service was excellent and super friendly despite the obvious morning rush.  Coffee cups were always filled and the food came pretty quick considering.  Portions were huge but flavors, well, they weren't really present.  We had to dump a lot of hot sauce, salt and pepper to get things tasting better.  My fritata wasn't cooked all the way through either .  You can't beat the prices either but in the end I can't say I'll come back for such bland food.  If you're looking for a quick, cheap and easy breakfast place this will work but you'd be better off waiting at the St. Francis. Friendly service, convenient location, hardly any wait, but tasteless food. Seriously.  Even their bacon is tasteless. Ideal location, filling greasy american breakfasts, cheap and best of all, in addition to the traditional syrup option they have leche nestle! (carnation condensed milk) to pour on your pancakes. Super delicious and friendly service. sailusfood. com/wp conten… I've only  experienced this place during the mid to late hours of the morn, and although a good compatriot of mine, had some steel wool in his burrito, it didnt stop my other good buddy Mr. Temby from taking a good taste of that wool himself. Whats in question is the contents of that burrito, NOT repeat NOT the taste and quality. My friends, the quality of this break fast burrito is glorious. its everything you need for a good belly ful of morning jumpstart AND THEN SOME. I cant knock it for the price nor the contents, its a hand in hand thing. i recommend this spot if you are looking for a good place to have a cup o joe, and good bfast delight. The reason its  stars shy of perfection, for obvious reasons, im a tough critic and the crew that runs this place are a bunch of clowns, no the haha kind but the kind that you have to repeat your order  times and show on the menu. Point and Click. *they ask a small corkage fee for Colt 's with partys  or more* Overall, good for breakfast. Nicely priced and pretty tasty food. For those weekend mornings when I find myself (either happily or unhappily) alone but still enjoy the thought of someone else making my breakfast, I always opt for joints with counter seating, and Mission's Kitchen makes the grade. I don't know what this place was before, and I don't really care. It does, however, have the feel of a new kid in school  shy and  a little unsure of itself but at the same time overly eager to please. My breakfast was basic, but big and tasty enough to bring me back. On my second visit I ordered something in the south of the border vein, and it was even better. My third trip was a nooner  for lunch. A basic cheeseburger. No complaints, but my real reason for going back was to confirm the name in order to write this review (yesterday, I tried searching Yelp for ""Mission Kitchen"" and without the apostrophe s. . . nada). I had to explain their own menu to them, which was a funny little adventure: ""It says here that I get a choice of fries, soup, salad or mashed potatoes with my lunch, so. . . uh. . . "" But I habla no Spanish, so the response was a blank stare. Another waiter came over and the two of them consulted for a few minutes. Then, with everyone on the same page, I chose the soup. It was fine, but I'll stick with their breakfast from now on. I like Mission Kitchen.  I give it  stars for quality of Food, Service and Atmosphere  an extra star for price. The food is pretty standard diner fare for San Francisco, but offers several nice hispanic twists.  I am a big fan of the Chilaquiles (fried tortilla chips with eggs, green salsa, and peppers). The service is mostly attentive and very friendly.  I love that when leaving the whole restaurant  line cooks, manager, and all say goodbye. The atmosphere is standard diner booths/counter.  Clean, a little snug in places, bright and not too loud. Overall, I think it is a .  star spot.  The low menu prices are a big draw for a filling breakfast in a respectable neighborhood restaurant. What can I say about you Mish Kitch?  Who else can I turn to when I'd rather eat a giant, grease laden, $.  breakfast burrito, and sleep standing up rather than actually work?  Gracias Tio!I have officially downgraded Mission's Kitchen.  Denada.   Because of the steel wool that I found nestled in my burrito about half an hour ago I shant return.  It only makes me wonder how much steel wool will be caught in my colon for the rest of my life. I am very dissapointed by this place; I like a good diner but this is not it.  The eggs I had were completed unseasoned and the accompanying potatoes dry and flavorless.  The french dip sandwhich was served with a dipping sauce that was salty and tasted of soy sauce.  The french fries were limp and mealy.  Service was friendly but confused.   Maybe the mexican food is better but with some many great tacquerias around, I don't see any point in trying it. SFD I've tried to love you Mission's Kitchen. . . I really have!! You're so close to work and your menu sounds so good! You're inexpensive and fast. . . what more do I really need in a restaurant??I actually need a restaurant that serves less hair in their food, that doesn't put me into a grease induced coma for the rest of the afternoon and has less ants walking around the restaurant!  Once all of those issues are addressed, the Mish Kitch might be the place for me! Great food that leaves you in a coma for the rest of the day. The staff is friendly as they banter back and forth with each other. Not the cleanest, but they fix a mean ass breakfast  worth  stars if you like the extra protein of ants in your meal. Chilaquiles are delicious, wanted to add a star, but couldn't bring myself to do it. I just can't abide by the service and Gut Bomb Quality food  but I love it. It won't lose stars because of it's awesome and ""my office only"" delivery policy. SWEET!/UPDATE: It loses a star for the steel wool my co worker just found in his burrito. yeah, no shit. Sad thing is, I'll be eating there tomorrow, so what's that say about me? Mission's Kitchen is a little joint I stop in at for breakfast. Early opening (open at  AM) joints are kind of hard to come by. Closer to the th St. BART station than La Taza, and a little cheaper, too. The food is good and comes out pretty quickly. My Chilaquiles were awesome. Clean place. Service was friendly enough, though there's never anyone in there very early. One gripe: This place is not as busy as La Taza, it lacks the ""bustle"" of a diner, and the damn credit card machine never seems to be working whenever I go in there . . . gr . . . Diners, I love you. But you've got to come correct. Little Mission's Kitchen occupies the same space of the long running John's Diner, a place known for a really sweet hostess who treated you like family and served up eh OK food. Flipping the script, the food is now really great and the service, though totally friendly, sadly for crap. But with it being an unrepentent diner, and not say another damn celphone store, that's still right around the corner from my house, I want to love M's K more than I actually do. Mexican and American breakfasts at around $ , standard diner luncheS and dinners are $ . Huge plates. Delicious home fries. On the minus side, me and buddy pal watched as our toast cooled visibly in the toaster, an additional waffle never materialized at all. Yet still my Chilaquiles were pretty good (if a little damn too spicy, which I don't often say about anything) and buddy pal's Huevos Rancheros looked great.  As inept as the CS was, I'll be back, if only in the hopes that Mission's Kitchen (Mission Diner anyone?) eventually overlaps their quality of service with their inexpensive traditional fare."|4|86|5|Routine| Improper food storage  [ date violation corrected: 2/10/2012 ] Moderate risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 2/10/2012 ] Improper storage of equipment utensils or linens  [ date violation corrected: 2/10/2012 ] Improper or defective plumbing  [ date violation corrected: 2/10/2012 ] Foods not protected from contamination  [ date violation corrected: 2/10/2012 ]

Yes, they are .  each, and  breaks my $ lunch by .   but the belly filling and fun quality eating it  not to mention the amazing taste, is very worthwhile. I love their bulgogi, and japchae, bibimbap and spicy pork. Really a great loaded dish. Most meals are under $! Big portions, decent price. The Japchaebap hits the spot. A little bit of beef, hella rice, and a heap of japchae. Which is sometimes all you really want, damnit. SOMA why you gotta be like this? Anyways, I'm glad we have the store on the corner. If you blink, you'll miss it. Coworker got the spicy pork  that was an insane pile of meat. I always like supporting the family owned business. Alas, I only discovered this after I knew I was leaving the area. Tofu soup. Tofu Soup. Tofu effing soup. And everything else. . . Veg & Meat friendly. Family run, so great. Just go. Been coming here for years so its about damn time I write a review for this overlooked gem. In a sea of overpriced and mediocre food downtown this place stands out as cheap and good. Love the spicy pork & bi bim bap; they always hit the spot. Just thinking about them is making me hungry, time for a lunch visit!Family owned/run very cute older Korean couple and their son (who is a nice guy). I spotted a lunch line within an unassuming convenience shop while walking down the street. Strangely enough there's a little lunch to go spot selling mom and pop Korean food. I had the beef bibimbap. It doesn't come with an egg or the crispy rice since it's served within a plastic container. But the flavors are good old Korean. They are a little stingy with the beef. The chili paste is tasty awesomeness. I recommend only if you're craving quick to go Korean during lunchtime. The invigorating flavors of the bibimbap saved me. Wow, has it been  years since I yelped this place?  This is my go to place whenever I'm near that area.  This place is reasonable ($ for a made to order to go box) and the food hits my hungry insides wanting kimchi and spice.  I bring it back to the office and everyone is jealous how yummy it looks.  The family is nice and the price is too.  If I was a poet, that would have been a good rhyme.  This is quite a balance meal with half veggies (salad & Kimchi) and smidgen of meat and rice.  Fast and hardly a wait.  They have remodeled and the kitchen is doubled the size.  There is a tiny counter place for one person to scarf down and eat.  I wish there was a nice park nearby to enjoy my meal.  They really keep it ""corner store"" with all your junk food you need, from Hawaiian potato chips, candies, and sodas. I'm always here for some quick korean food. The bulgogi and spicy pork options are tasty. The jap chae bap is also a decent alternative. The food won't blow your mind, but it's quick and decent. Reasonably priced lunch/dinner for SOMA that's just the right amount. The store owner and family are nice people to talk to. When you first walk in, it looks like your average convenient store, but in the back the family that owns it is cooking some really awesome Korean food. Prices are reasonable around $, and you'll be in and out within  mins. Store on the corner is the very definition of 'hidden gem'. It's one of my go to's around the office for lunch, lately I find it very difficult to last more than  days without getting a strong craving for the Spicy Pork. It's a lot less spicy than what I like, but that's where the Sriracha comes in handy. Tried this today and it was good. I had the bibimbap veggie style for  dollars.  There are very few Korean alternatives in the financial district area so if you're craving some Korean food (and don't want to feel like you got robbed  like at some Korean places within a mile of this place) definitely a place to checkout. Just to be clear the three rating is to say that this place is good and worth a checkout. Stumbled on this place at lunch today. Ordered bulgogi. Meat is mealy. Looks and tastes cheap. Came with rice (fine), salad (meh) and kim chi (good). I love Korean food, and there's certainly not enough of it near my office, but this barely scrapes the bottom edge of acceptable. EDIT: I'm intrigued by all the positive reviews here, so I'll just step back far enough to say that I came once, tried one thing, was underwhelmed. Maybe I was there on the wrong day or ordered the wrong thing. Anyway, there ya go. This place used to be a convenience store with a small counter in the back where the owners (?) made homemade Korean food with a bunch of rice cookers.  That concept is about the best thing ever!  Recently, they expanded the lunch area and minimized the convenience store aspect, so selling food must have been way more successful.  It makes sense, because their food is damned good!The soondubu (Korean tofu stew) is tasty and filling, and is a great choice.  The japchae is good too.  The only knock on it is that if you order the vegetarian version, all you get is a massive tray of japchae.  It would be nice to get a bit more veggies and less noodle.  That said, this is definitely one of the best workday lunch spots in the area.  Best of all, there's almost never any line. Arbitrary rankings:Shrimp with the head still on:   /  Cheap, fast, and delicious. This is a great place to grab lunch if you work in the area. It used to be a convenient store that happend to serve food out of the back, but they recently remodeled to be primarily a take out place that happens to have some convenient store items up front. Don't let the fact that they serve everything straight out of a rice cooker deter you, the food is great. Most people seem to go for the bibimbap, but I think the bulgogi is the best thing on the menu. I am Korean! And this place rocks. Cheap and delicious, friendly and quick. I've tried the spicy pork, beef bulgogi, and kimbab. All were good. Especially the spicy pork. They give you a thing of salad and kimchi, and the spicy pork is poured on top of the rice. I sometimes fantasize about what I'll get for lunch the next day, and I think about the pork dish often  it's that good. So easy. So authentic. Mostly everything runs out after p so get in there before then to have your fair share of the pick. Yeah, I had two Korean tacos at lunch, and a soda. Very tasty / good variation from the norm (hadn't had it before). I want to go back to try the bibimbap, but then, I kind of want to try the taco again. Oh and, very nice couple running the business, and pretty cheap for lunch. Boom. This is an excellent spot for a quick, tasty, and cheap lunch. The BiBimBap seems even halfway healthy, due to the lovely veggies. The store is rather odd and not much to look at, but give the food a try! Love supporting mom and pop businesses where I can. You would miss this store if you didn't know where to look. It's literally on the corner of New Montgomery and Natoma. I had the bi bim bap. It was good. My co worker got the spicy pork and scarfed the whole thing. For $, I'm stuffed! The Store on the Corner was recommended by a friend for Korean take out. The Tofu stew (with a piece of shrimp) was delicious. It was filling but not heavy and had the right amount of spice. I am taking the fried Pork dish to my boyfriend for dinner tonight. The staff was friendly and attentive, and I arrived by :AM so no line. A nice change from the Ferry Building and Embarcadero restaurants, I plan to return. Lunch was tasty today! Spicy pork came with a helping of kimchee, and a side of salad greens. Very tasty and an excellent value! A family run tiny gem in Soma / financial district. The bi bim bap is awesomely delicious!! Totally nondescript storefront that looks like a Spanish Harlem bodega. . .  But ran by a Korean family with a few rice cookers and some meats.  Solid japchae and bibimbap.  Not life changing, but a nice, simple, quick lunch option in the hood.  Not bad at all. You are forgiven for not noticing the Store on the Corner. After all the area is full of many stores and even more corners  they all tend to blend together after a while. But this store is worth your time. Walk inside and note the convenient ATM, cozy register, racks of drinks and  the kicker  a kitchen in the back serving fast and cheap Korean food. I love coming here for the bibimbap. I'm sure it's not the finest Korean in town, but it's quick and in SoMa for lunch. Staff is friendly and you will only thrown down $ instead of god know what for the fancy sandwich next door. Cash only, if that's a deal breaker for you. I'm getting married to a Korean guy in a couple months and since he cooks up a storm, I typically don't feel compelled to spend money on it elsewhere  but for those work days where I have the craving and no leftovers, Store on the Corner fills the void (aka my stomach) just fine. I always get the bi bim bap (veggies and beef over rice) and while I'm a fat kid at heart that wishes they'd put more meat than veggies, it really is the perfect amount and balance of flavors. Today just for the hell of it I decided to try their Korean taco since that kind of food is all over the place. It wasn't bad but if you prefer a thicker tortilla like I do, you might find yourself needing a fork. Service is always friendly and prices are reasonable. I prefer going here over HRD because at least here I don't think I've ever had to wait longer than  minutes for my food. No frill, cheap korean food to go. If you are craving old school bibimbap or chap chae, then this is perfect. The food is not amazing, but it hits the spot. Now I'll be the first to admit that I've never been to Korea. Not even once (I know, right? Embarrassing. ). In short, I wouldn't know authentic Korean food if it walked up and slapped in the mouth while screaming ""ME! I'M AUTHENTIC KOREAN FOOD!"" I'd probably chalk it up to some intense marketing and move on. But what I do know is deliciousness, and the delicate balance we consumers must play between it and its evil slash unwelcome but wholly necessary twin, frugality. And The Store On the Corner definitely comes close to maximizing that function (can I get a ""derivative"" from the math fans out there? A double edged cheer!). Let's talk about the place. It's actually on a street corner, so bonus for naming honesty, I guess. For the most part, it's a convenience store  and a fairly small one  selling your standard convenience store things. Other reviewers, I'm sure, have dissected their convenience and their offerings. But you're here because you want to know about the food. That's definitely why I was there. In a word, adorable. The food counter is found in the back of the convenience store, run by what appears to be a mom and pop duo (though mom seemed to be doing most of the work [ain't that always the way, moms?])  The pop is super polite and the mom is super efficient; together, they are a voltron of effective service. For around $ (after tax!) you can get a quite good tasting, home made Korean lunch. The line is either non existent or extremely short, so your time investment is also pretty small (unlike a certain other Korean BBQ place *cough*HRD*cough*). In short, if you're nearby and hungerin', The Store On the Corner is worth a shot. Protip: if you want the spicy pork, get there early. Its a good place for a quick meal. For $, you will get a lot of food without having to stand in line which is otherwise the general case around here. It might feel wrong getting food from a convenience store, but don't let that stop you. It might also feel weird that they serve rice directly from the rice cooker, but what difference does that make? I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked into this convenience store. What I found was a pleasant surprise.

The Store On the Corner 1|3.5|Korean in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|111|1|3.85714285714| I'm only reviewing the food counter in the back of the store. The Spicy Pork tasted like Korean BBQ pork in spicy marinara sauce. Not what I was expecting. I don't know if I was charged more for some reason judging from the other reviews, but this place is not cheap esp. if you are ordering vegetarian. My vegetarian bibimbap was $ they didn't have egg so it was literally veggies and a ton of rice. I'll be going to Bibimbar for my Korean fix! .  for bibimbop which was ok.  There wasnt an egg option for the dis. I ate it outside Yerba buena gardens on rd Ave. Then I went to the local museums.  You've got to ask for kimchee. Excellent Korean food!  I love the bi bim bap. It's affordable and the owners are AMAZINGLY sweet.  They accommodate my being gluten free and are always open about what has soy sauce in it.  I love coming here and will continue to do so as long as i work in SOMA. More than a store. Traditional corner store: Groceries. Household items. Drinks. Cigarettes. Lottery. This corner store: All the above plus Korean food. In the back is where you'll find what seems to be a mom and pop serving homemade bulgogi. Scoop of rice. Scoop of meat. Some sides. Done. Shocked in the best way possible the chicken seemed to be all white meat. Not so shocked I finished what could have been two meals in one. Really good. Meal costs about $ with tax. You can spend your coin the traditional corner store way or the Korean corner store way. In my opinion the choice has never been easier. Giving  stars because of the few options for lunchtime korean downtown, this is the best AND the cheapest! A handful of menu items on the korean side. . . soft tofu stew is homemade authenticity. Better than my mama's. Small store, fresh food at the back, a small line of folks waiting, many speaking korean  which made me feel like trying this place was a good choice.  And it was.  Bibimbap is very good; yes you can get better at various korean restaurants, none of which are in the FiDi.  But in the FiDi  nice veggies, a good chuck of seawood for that salty flavor, decent meat and a nice portion for $.  I haven't tried the soft tofu stew, but I will be back for it. And the older couple, dishing up the food in back, were very nice and clearly a little perplexed to see  people in line.  Apparently, that is a massive crowd for lunch.  Which is super cool. LOVE the Tofu Stew. You must come before pm. They sell out quick! I kept thinking. . . this is like a blue collar version of a bulgogi plate. This is the feeling I got when you roll into a convenience store, and order up a plate of bulgogi, along with jap chae, and rice plus a salad. It's a no nonsense meal with a pleasant price. The owners (i think they are the owners) have a spirited personality and laugh easily. Solid .  stars. Stopped by after my friend suggested to eat some Korean food. After all, I have been craving a meal with rice all week, so I decided to give this place a try. For about $.  for bulgogi, I have to say this place is pretty good. Food is quickly prepared and fresh. If you're looking for some Korean food in Financial District, give this place a shot. Getting unpackaged food at a convenience store is a real gamble. On one hand, you could get a cheap, quick and tasty meal. Alternatively, you could get a grey hot dog, a withered taquito and food poisoning. Luckily for me (and you!), TSOtC offers the former. You feel like you're inside the owner's house, getting your food straight from the rice cookers. The spicy pork is my favorite here, but I don't think you could go wrong with any of the menu items. Everything's cheap, and there's rarely a line at lunch (crucial in the area). Thanks to Yelp, I found Korean food in the financial district (SOMA is close enough!)It really is on the corner but easy to walk by the first time. The entrance is right after Lee's. They have a wide selection of beverages, everything else I can't comment on because I made a beeline to the back of the store for tofu stew. Kimchee, salad, plenty of rice, a to go carton of tofu stew and $ later I had an awesome lunch!Great for those chilly SF days! This is a well stocked convenience store with a wide selection of drinks, chips and chocolate bars.  In the back they make Korean food for lunch at excellent prices. The Japchae Bap was delicious, and a lot of food (and beef) for only six bucks.  The Bi Bim Bop was less awesome but still pretty good and well priced.  They were out of the makings for Kim Bap and smoothies but they sell these as well.  Owners are nice. Upping to  stars after trying the soft tofu (seafood) stew today.  De lish and so much food for $.  For takeout in the area this place can't be beat.  Delicious home cooked meals, you're not going to get that from Working Girls.  What a gem! This may look like a convenience store. You can even poke your head inside, and see all of the usual convenience store accoutrements  soda, candy, newspapers, cigarettes. But then, go to the back and you'll find a little counter whence comes delicious korean food. A little bowl of bi him bop, some bulgogi, whatever. There's never a line of more than two or three people, the food is cheap (and has not increased price in at least the last years), and is quite tasty. Especially when slathered in Sriracha, although maybe that's cheating.|3|81|5|Routine| Other low risk violation  [ date violation corrected: 9/16/2014 ] Food in poor condition  [ date violation corrected: 9/16/2014 ] Improper storage of equipment utensils or linens  [ date violation corrected: 9/16/2014 ] High risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 9/16/2014 ] Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities  [ date violation corrected: 9/16/2014 ]
The Store On the Corner 2|3.5|Korean in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|111|2|3.43333333333|" Check out ajumma's ""Bear House"" apron. Chicken Bulgogi: boiled / stewed texture, not grilled. Tasty broth. Bibimbap: it's bibimbap, not dolsot bibimbap. No hot stone bowl, FYI. $ even for the two items and two bottles of tea. Man didn't understand when I said my $ included tip. He understood when I stuffed the change into the tip jar. I found it to be just okay.  I ordered the chicken bulgogi.  I was expecting the chicken to be grilled and it tasted like it was boiled.  There I don't eat non grass fed beef so there were not a lot of menu options.  My co workers all go the bibimbap and beef bulgogi and really liked it.  I would go back again, but wouldn't order the chicken. For those that don't know, they serve Korean food. A decent option for lunch considering convenience (a real convenient store  no joke) and value. For $ flat, you will be in and out in   minutes. It's a convenience store first and not a restaurant so there is no seating. Usually take it back to the office. To me the food is just average. The menu is limited, but covers the essentials: bibimbap, tofu soup, bulgogi, japchae and spicy pork. It's okay for what it is, but nothing is stellar. I do like that they give me a large thing of kimchi. . . although it's frowned upon during work (garlic breath). Everything is pretty standard. I think it's cooler than it really is because there is lack of Korean options in the area. But being Korean, it does satisfy my Korean food fix when I need something quick. I suggest you get there early because I've been when they have run out of stuff. I've tried using my Korean to get the bulgogi plate, but substitute half rice for japchae. She said no. I figured because japchae is more expensive than rice. But I would have paid extra. *shrugs* Grabbed a bulgogi from here for under $ to bring back to my office. By the time I got to the building lobby, the kimchi juice and bulgogi broth had sloshed around enough to leak out of the plastic container and into the plastic bag (yes, the bulgogi had broth, since it was served from a rice cooker). This mixture of fluids was quite pungent smelling, prompting funny looks from others whom I shared the elevator with. Embarrased, I just stood in the corner of the elevator with my head down, impatienty waiting for my floor to arrive. God dammit, there are a lot of people on this elevator, and it's making stops on every other floor. I get to my office open 'er up, and get a big whiff of intense korean food. The aroma is so strong that five minutes into eating it, I overhear a colleague of mine from another office down the hall asking another colleague ""what's that smell? Is someone cooking? It smells like kim chee. "" Embarrased again, I closed the door to my office and finished my meal in silence. The bulgogi was decent, but not great. The kimchi was quite good, though not as potent as it smelled (I think the heat from the rice and the broth from the bulgogi intensified it). The rice was soggy, like it was cooked with too much water and/or it sat in the warmer for a long time, but was far from inedible. Overall, the meal was A OK given the price. Will I return? Maybe. But if I do, I will most definitely eat it outside before returning to the office. In five minutes I can walk into Store on the Corner, and walk out with a bowl of homey bulgogi or bi bim bop. Great for convenience, and value  a bowl is roughly $. The limited kitchen space (the food is served out of rice cookers, from what I can tell), though, means you're just getting the basics. Tasty tasty meal. At first glance you wouldn't think it was going to be very filling however it packs a nice punch. The hot sauce that comes with it is pretty potent as well. I'm not a huge fan of carrots so I quickly discarded those upon opening. Bibimbap all the way!The owners of the shop are very polite, however I wish they took credit cards. Kamsamnida! Bomb. Tastes homemade, straight up. Takes only cash, but affordable and filling. Made with TLC too. If you like home style Korean, then try it out. I like this place a lot. When I came to the city, after living in Korea for a bit, this place has been the cheapest and most nostalgic of authentic Korean food.  The place is owned by really personable Korean people and they kindly endure my poor Korean whenever I order.  The jeok bokam is well flavored and ample, the bibimbab is a pretty standard variety and filling, and the soondubu jjigae is surprisingly FULL of spice and lots of fresh seafood. I always go in and talk to the owners, I always tell my Korean students in San Francisco about this place just so they can feel that closeness to familiar food if they want it and I just generally like this store on the corner. Only problem: it's so damn small, you have to eat next door at the tables outside or take the food to go.  Don't mind the limited space in exchange for the good food, kind proprietors, and affordable costs: Prices are definitely under $. I didn't eat there because there were actually no seats ! But I'll certainly go there again, for the price and also because my Korean friends told me that the food looks delicious !And you can easily eat your dishes in the park close to the store. Mm, perfect lunch on a cold San Francisco day: tofu stew lunch (just spicy enough, soft tofu with some seafood mixed, m) for my bf and chicken bulgogi (tender, slow cooked, yum) for me, both complete with rice, salad with a nice dressing and kimchee (yummy!).  Very reasonably priced, nicely bagged to go, and I took it home for us to enjoy.  It was like home cooking and it was so yummy and comforting  we were all smiles!  My only wish is that they had seating and tables as I don't work at an office nearby, but hey, can't have everything. Thank you!  We will be back.  Happy New Year! I came here looking for some Korean food after realizing it was too late to grab HRD Coffee Shop. The Bibimbap was alright but I wish they had a real kitchen and could make it with the crispy rice at the bottom and cracked egg on top. The pork they had that day was on special and was kind of gross . . . But I will be back for more BiBimBap one day. The locations great & the man serving me was very friendly. I just wish they had more to work with than a few rice cookers! Walked right by it a few times searching for lunch spots in SOMA.  Had the Beef Bulgogi which was served with salad and kimchee.  Very good bargain for $.  Service was fast and friendly. Did you know ""The Shop Around the Corner"" is one of my favorite classic old Hollywood movies? How would you know?. . . you don't know me. It's the one where Jimmy Stewart plays a Hungarian music shop employee and. . . oh, you don't care. And it has zilch to do with this modest operation except the name is sorta the same. But this one is actually on the corner, and there are no Russian music boxes being sold here, no quaint characters having secret pen pal romances like between the cashier here and the sandwich maker next door at Lee's Deli. Actually, how the hell would I know?Anyway, I had no idea that they have a little Korean kitchen in the back of this liquor store until Jamie W. informed me. It's made up of big rice steamers (the kind my mama would have killed to have) and piping hot pots of homemade Korean fare that the woman just puts together in a plastic container, so you can just pay and go away (see photos). I went for the $.  Bi Bim Bop (see photo)  even though they were running a special on spicy pork that day. I had a meeting scheduled right after, so I did not want to risk an extrusion if you should pardon the expression. It was no culinary masterpiece, just home cookin' at its most comforting when you're looking for mama san goodies. What brings it up a notch is the hot sauce that comes with it. It has a smoky barbecue edge to it that really makes the bop bop if you know what I mean. I brought it over to the solarium at  Second Street, my favorite free public space in the immediate vicinity, as you eat among the office workers and bike messengers taking a break from their humdrum lives where they don't have the benefit of my bowl of bi bim bop. They can bop to their own food as long as they don't infringe on my bop. A bop is a very personal thing. FOOD   stars. . . bop 'til you drop from the sauceAMBIANCE  .  stars. . . well, it's a liquor storeSERVICE   stars. . . hey, it comes fast. . . no complaintsTOTAL   stars. . . reasonable lunch option where an arm and a leg do not have to be sacrificed. . . unless they need it to simmer in the bop Novelty of homemade Korean food being served in the back of a corner liquor store in SOMA doesn't really overcome how mediocre the food is. I got the bibimbap and it was pretty enough with the usual assortments of veggies and bean sprouts, but the beef was underflavored and the main flavors of the bowl came from the gochujang. Yes, big lack of Korean food downtown, but still. I do like the unintentionally hip name though. Way better than Sorabol!~! This ahjumah serves up some damn tasty korean food all cooked in rice cookers. That's talent. It might not be the best, but SOMA has a serious lack of Korean restaurants, so what else are you gonna do when you don't have time to drive to New Korea House in JTown for lunch? This place may look like a gas station convenience store but it is secretly also a kitchen operated entirely out of a set of rice cookers. The proprietors have pre made the [many] ingredients in bi bim bop which they assemble on the spot from a series of rice cookers when you order it. (For the uninformed out there, bi bim bop is that Korean rice bowl dish with beef and an assortment of pickled vegetables on top) My one real gripe with it is that unfortunately, with the rice cooker, no kitchen constraint means that there is no egg on top. If you're looking for a solid, convenient (I mean, it is ""the store on the corner"" for so many), fast and very cheap ($.  ain't bad in this neighborhood) lunch, I  highly recommend checking out this very hidden gem. Not bad! Will go back This is good stuff.  The Store On the Corner is one of those candy bar, soda, homemade Asian food stores.  You might never guess that they sell extremely tasty fresh food inside, but they do. I tried the chicken bulgogi.  It was basically a ton of white rice  not too sticky, not too dry  and a bunch of lumps of probably boiled chicken with tasty sauce.  Some friends got the bi bim bap  which looked quite good but comes in a flimsy plastic bowl instead of a burning stone bowl.  More convenient for take out but less conducive to crunchy stone burned rice. Good gem hidden inside a corner store.  I ordered something like a rice bowl with Korean beef.  Two thumbs up.  It's probably way too much rice for me.  However, you are definitely getting your money's worth. Remember to bring cash! I'm surprised it took me well over a year to eat here since I only work a block away and five of my coworkers have already given it good reviews. Based on the recommendations of everyone I was with I got the bi bim bap. It's been the best lunch I've had this week, striking just the right balance between light and filling, and it came in under $. The service was quick, especially considering we ordered five bi bim baps at once. Store On The Corner is going to be worked into the regular rotation. Think you've stumbled on a hidden gem?  Think again. . .  This is truly mediocre Korean food and there's no two ways about it.  Move along to your next discovery. . . I had the Beef Bulgogi and it was mediocre. The salad that they serve with it sort of ruins the authenticity of the plate. It would be better accompanied by one of many Korean condiments. My gf told me about this place and I was skeptical about buying hot food from a liquor store. I'm glad I went. I got the bulgogi (beef) and it was good. Not the kind where you would find at a typical Korean restaurant. Looks and tasted boiled but still good. Just the right amount of rice and meat. I'm a huge meat eater so i ofcourse think this could have come with a bit more meat. ;)Comes with a small side of salad and their home made salad dressing. I like my salad dripping in dressing and I asked him for more dressing. He thought I asked for more lettuce and proceeded to slowly add more lettuce. I stopped him and pointed to the bottle of dressing. He was very happy to accommodate my request. He was a total sweetie! I don't eat spicy food. I tried their home made kimchi and it wasn't that spicy for me. It had the right amount of spice for me. So that means for others who do eat spicy, this might be too bland for your taste. FYI: There's no egg on top of the Bi Bim Bap. Say what? I'll try it anyways. This is the closest and quickest place that I know of near work for Korean food. I wish their menu was a bit bigger but hey, can't complain. I'll be going back to try the other items on the menu. Aside from the somewhat ambiguous name, this is a great SOMA workday lunch option. The food counter is nestled in the back of a cozy mom and pop convenience store. It consists of  or  rice cookers full of homemade Korean food. I usually stick with the bibimbap  it's light and flavorful (don't forget the red sauce). I was really hesitant to try the food from this place because it scared me every time we'd walk by after getting food in the area. It looked scketch. Finally, one day, I was craving Korean food and co worker, who'd been wanting to try this place, suggested it. I got the Bi Bim Bap. The veggies were tasty, but I wanted more meat! And there was no egg that I could swirl around and mix in with the veggies and meat. But, don't get me wrong  it wasn't bad. It was worth the walk and $.  to satisfy my craving that day. Boss and I finally tried this spot last week b/c frankly, we were sick of the choices we have around our office. We walked in. . . definitely a Mom and Pop store! We went directly straight to the back. . . checked out the menu and ordered. I got the bulgogi . . . it's a Mom and Pop version. . . not the kind you get typically in a Korean joint. It tasted more like a stewed beef than bulgogi. They give decent portion. . . so overall. . . can't complain for $.  plus tax. Boss got the bi bim bap and I think next time I'll try that. . . the veggies looked good but it did lacked meat. Not bad but not mind blowing either. . . just another joint to add variety to our boring lunch options here at work. Although I have about  saved reviews that I need to finish, right after coming here for lunch, I felt compelled to write a review for this place asap!I don't get what the type is all about . . I came because I work across the street and had heard some coworkers rave about it . . . . bland. lackluster. dry. I love korean food but I would have rather had Panda Express (umm or the Korean equivalent?) than here!! What is going on?? The novelty of it being a mom and pop (literally) spot in the back of a liquor store doesn't make up for the dare I say, crappy, food. She gave my coworker  shreds of meat in his bi bim bap, he asked for more, she said no. It was pretty hilarious. But in the end, he was thankful because it wasn't yummy. The clear noodles are decent though and they do use fresh greens. Let me start by saying I've been to Korea and I have had better bi bim bap or jap chae, but man, i just love the husband and wife. They make you feel so comfortable. I even get to use some of my korean without them having too much of a laugh. All of the menu is great, and you will walk out for less than $. + it's less than  blocks from my office. The longest I have ever waited for food was during the Giants World Series parade (and that was still only  minutes) Pretty good, fast. I cannot keep from going back.  The food is like addictive drugs. . . if I do not have the ""Spicy Pork"" each week I begin to feel homicidal.  You get quality rice here  the large fat sweet grain rice, not the long grain tasteless stuff for the masses  on top of that rice is heaped the spicy pork; a faint sweetness with chili, pork and ""other flavors"" that is so good I have a difficult time restraining the hand holding the fork to wait until I swallow each mouthful before the next is transferred from the box to my mouth.  The kimche that comes with it is flat  not too spicy  more like chili salt cabbage.  I like it, but it's probably the mildest kimche I've ever eaten.  A small salad comes with it that is doused with some dressing that I do not care for. . . but I dutifully eat everything as anything less is disrespectful to the Korean lady behind the counter who cooks and hashes out this delightful lunch.  $ well spent!  Oh  the service is fast~!  If you want, you can walk West down the street to the park to eat your food  or take it back to the office to have a good ""looser's lunch"".  ( If you eat lunch at your desk, you are a looser. ) A great option for lunch if you're in the area and looking for take out.  Fairly quick, but it's only the one Korean woman working the back of the store who serves the food. So far, I've only tried the bulgogi, which *looks* underwhelming, but it's got a lot of flavor.  Definitely not as heavy as most bulgogi.  Every entree comes with a little side salad and some kimchee, and they're all priced at slightly under $. Bonus points for basically being a Korean home kitchen awkwardly installed in the rear of a convenience store, IKEA style. (using Yale romanization til yelp allows utf .  bear w/ me)five stars cuzza its convenient location, super friendly shop keepers, and fresh home made kimchi.  i was pretty surprised to hear there was a korean place so close to work (cuz i woulda thunk i woulda seen it) but there it was, a tiny convenience store, no place to sit down, but cheap cans of beer. went to the back, the lady was in the process of packing kimchi into a jar.  pretty good sign. 'do you have swuntwupwu?'nope. 'so, what is there?'just 'pipimpap'.  fine, beggars can't be choosers.  she prepares a bowl of 'pipimpap' for me.  i ask her if i can try the kimchi she's making, but she says it's not for me  claims she made it american style (which she explained meant it was sweeter), and busted out a bowl of kimchi she thought i'd prefer. indeed it was pretty damn' good. the rice dish was totally adequate.  stoked to have a source of cheap food nearby. i was looking for some bibimbap and was over on howard at tan's cafe (initially to get bibimbap there) only to find they were cash only, somehow ended up at walgreen's getting cash back, and stumbled upon the store on the corner as i was walking around. i was pretty excited to find a place that serves korean food not too far from work. especially after working in silicon valley for the last few years where i was only in walking distance of  mediocre office park delis. that and not having to make a trek to the richmond district for korean food. $.  isn't bad for an SF lunch. but i was disappointed that they skimped out on the beef and there's no egg in it either. although the people working there were really nice. one of them ran after me to hand me a plastic bag for my bibimbap and utensils. wasn't bad but wasn't the best food either. I was looking for Korean food in SOMA and didn't want to go too far off of nd/Market St. Based on the other yelpers I thought I'd give it a try. The old lady in front runs the cashier. The elderly man serves the food. In the very back, the lights are off and if you don't ask, you might assume the back kitchen is closed. However, it is not; I think they just shut off the lights to save energy as this is a mom and pop business. I ordered Bibimbap. I must say, its delicious. The only con is that the temperature of the meat isn't even warm, more like room temperature. I asked for more kimchee, I didn't get it.  The meat portion is very little. The bowl is more than / white rice only. The best thing is the fresh taste and price of only $. . The red spicy sauce is delish, you must try it and MIX it into your rice and veggies!. . . . . . . For others reading this, this is not a sit down restaurant. It is just 'order over the counter, pay and leave'. Take note this is NOT Korean BBQ, so don't mistake it for Korean BBQ or you'll be disappointed; At best, it is Korean food. The owners wear humility well and are very courteous. They don't speak English well, but they do understand. . AND YES, they do smile!  that's always a plus I returned here after noting it on Yelp a few weeks ago. Definitely a mom & pop establishment, meaning friendly,  good food, but you better get there early or your outta luck. I wanted the Bulgogi, but they had only a little chicken and a little beef left so she offer to mix them, which was fine. I have a feeling the portion would have been a log larger if she had full pots. It was plenty for lunch though. It had a very good sauce, the chicken was so tender. I take a late lunch so, I will probably always get the bottom of the pot. . . oh well, it's still good. I've now dashed over here for lunch a number of times and I am sold on the bibimbap.  It's got just the right combination of crunchy vegetables, savory meat, seaweed, and that delicious red sauce. Combine that with the fabulous liquor store ambiance and you've got a winner.  What I mean to say is, you definitely feel like you found a hidden gem when you walk into the back of this tobacco store and get a steaming bowl of delicious food handed to you. The bulgogi, I must confess, was less exciting.  While it did come with kimchee (the bibimbap is noticeably lacking in kimchee), it just didn't have the combination of flavors and textures that make the bibimbap the star.  That said, this place is just so darn fun to walk into (and out of) that I've gotta give it four stars. Cheap prices, generous portions, mediocre food. There are only about  or  options to choose from, and after coming here once I feel I've tried everything I want to try. I had the BBQ chicken, which was decent but unspectacular. The primary reason to come here is for value: you get a lot of food for very little money (especially by Financial District standards), so if you're on a budget it's a great option. Otherwise, there are plenty of other places to try nearby. I love noodles.  I like Korean food.  And I prefer not to have to walk too far to get lunch.  So it makes me very happy that I can get my jap chae fix on just a couple blocks away AND on the cheap ($.  for a FULL to go container of food  unheard of downtown!). I go there whenever I get my jap chae craving (which is often) and it's always good.  I usually get the Bulgogi plate which comes with a heaping serving of jap chae and rice and salad.  First and foremost, the jap chae has delicious flavor and the noodles are plump and slightly chewy, just the way I like it!  The bulgogi is nicely marinated and very tender, the rice is a nice balance to the saltiness of the other items, and salad makes me feel not so bad about eating all the other stuff  healthy and refreshing.  All in all, always a very satisfying and filling meal. Who knew that delicious be bim bap lives in the back of the corner tobacco store? To those not privy to be bim bap (I wasn't before I ate here), it's a bowl of rice with beef, veggies, seaweed, bean sprouts, and a delicious sweet and spicy sauce. If you're going with a group, tell the lady behind the counter the total number of be bim baps so she can better pipeline the process instead of doing it serially. Store on the Corner has definitely become a lunch staple for me. I come here all the time during lunch at work. Best place in the area for bulgogi and jap chae! Great prices! don't let the convenience store exterior fool you. Go in and try it. The male owner at the register is always really nice, too. and FYI If you don't know what bulgogi is, don't write a review saying it wasn't good korean bbq. . this is not korean bbq it is bulgogi! People often praise homemade food from mom & pop shops for the sole reason of being homemade, but let's remember that not everyone's mom can cook!  Most of the food seemed like sub par versions of what you can get at restaurants.  The one shining item, bulgogi hot dog, is apparently off the menu for good so little remains to warrant the trip. Soft Tofu Stew: Maybe they called it soft because that's what the package said at Safeway?  I know it was mass marketed tofu because I saw the spoon resting in the old tofu container.  If the tofu is not silky and soft, almost like scrambled eggs, it's a very bad start to soft tofu stew.  There was one shrimpy shrimp with it's head and all in the stew.  Not only miserly, but the whole small shrimp is bad idea in the messy red broth.  Lots of mushrooms which were nice actually.  The broth was too bland. Kimchi: Definitely homemade since it tasted like it was barely fermented.  Almost raw cabbage with spices is ok, but I prefer the more pickled variety. Bulgogi: Tasted stewed/steamed rather like ""fire meat"" with the crisp edges.  I realize the small space constraints, but still not that great. Bulgogi Hot Dog: This *used* to be my reason to come here until I was informed they no longer serve it ever.  Apparently it took too long. . . must be laziness over customer service reasons since I've never seen long lines to begin with.  This dog *was* good with decent bulgogi on a big thick frankfurter.  Could have used some spicy mayo or hot sauces, but a moot point since you're not going to get it again. Japchae was just ok  really onion y. Disappointed it didn't come with any side of kimchee or veggies. Also kinda expensive at $ for a single serving of just noodles (no meat). I may go back for tofu soup, which looks like a decent amount of food. Definitely not amazing, but hey it's SOMA and a convenience store. Ths is not the place to go if you're expecting Korean food.  I ordered Bulgolgi over rice  the meat was very dry and  tasted nothing like Korean BBQ. Suhweet!For some reason, i wandered at lunch today.  I was tired of burritos and sandwiches and shitty chinese food. . but damn if i had no clue what to get!Like others I saw the sign outside for korean and figured I'd give it a try.  In the back of this corner store an older korean lady was serving up homemade food! $.  and I had some Beef Bulgogi.  I won't lie. . . it's not the best korean I've ever had.  In fact the meat consistency is a little interesting, but flavorful nontheless. But $. !?! and shit. . . it's korean BBQ!  I'm not cmplaining at ALL.  I ate every bite, including the tasty Kimchee (i think it was freshly homemade!) and the salad that was included. For the price, the food was absolutely delicious.  I'll definatley be back, and hopefully there won't be a long ass line this time. Review number two for me today.  I was walking down the street a while back and a sign caught my eye.  It said Korean food.  Since this is a convenience store I was a little confused.  In the back there's a lady selling Korean dishes.  I've been there several times since and I usually get the Bi Bim Bap.  I'm not going to say that it's the best Korean ever.  Of course, fresh off of the stove is better.  But, it is heads and tails above the take out place in the Rincon Center.  Check it out to get your Korean lunchtime fix. I usually do not eat any food from a convenience store but their Bibimbap were surprisingly good. The fact that this place is one of the only places in SOMA that I can find Korean food is amazing. Chinese food is scarce enough but this Korean place is only one of two places in the neighberhood that I know of. It is truly hard to find since there is no real name for this place (it's across from an arts supply store). When you go in it is usually empty with the male owner chilling by the register and his wife next to him. She'll get up once she sees you going towards the food area. The food is decent enough to come back and the hot sauce is great. Price is fairly cheap where you can get a bottle of soda and bi bim bap for about $ dollars. Wished they had more selection but when you want Korean you can't complain. Service was fair and the selection decent for a little smoke shop. The ""restaurant"" is an alcove in the back serving mediocre Korean barbeque; no seating available. My bibambap (meat and veggies over rice) was unimpressive  the rice was hot but the meat was only lukewarm (health alert!), visually unappealing, and not all that tasty. When you need sriracha sauce for the meal to be tasty, it's not worth a second go. I was on my way to the Sentinel yesterday and their sign caught my eye.  Korean food this way .  I was sold, and was determined to go back first chance I got. I dragged my poor coworker with me and had to do a double take before walking in to the corner store (get it, get it?  The Store on the Corner?).  The man was spacing out at the cash register, and the lady was reading her newspaper.  I felt bad intruding, but damn it I was hungry. I ordered the japchaebap after reading the rest of the reviews.  She loads me two scoops of rice, a side salad with house dressing, a heaping plate of japchae, and my beef.  The lunchbox was definitely heavy on my walk back. I looked at the dinky hot sauce and wondered why they were so stingy with the portion.  After tasting my japchae (a little on the bland side) and dumping my sauce in, I know why.  The hot sauce means business, and definitely not for the faint of heart.  As a matter of fact, my mouth is still burning and my body is heating up. I had the jap chae for lunch, with tax it came to $. . Pretty good, big helping, excellent value by FiDi standards. I'd get it again. Totally tasty and acceptable Korean food for $. They got a bling y new sign out front that looks like they got their daughter or son to whip it up in Illustrator. What I like about this place is that I can get my fix for cheap, fast Asian food, but it's not the grease bomb of Lee's Deli or the overload of Sorabol at the mall. Is that really their name?This is a liquor store with a questionable lunch business.  They had their liquor license revoked so they decided to start selling food (I think). The food isn't bad, though.  It's cheap and tasty, but I would be a little concerned about the sanitation standards.  Not a place to come everyday, but probably worth a try. A liquor store that has recently opened up a kitchen in the back where a middle aged Korean lady, presumably the owner's wife, reheats bibimbap on the side. Though of questionable legality, it might be the only source of Korean food north of the county line where the prices don't double after lunch. A more recent development is the addition of a ""Korean BBQ Hot Dog"" to the menu, which is a foot long covered in bulgogi. The very concept of a hot dog whose sole condiment is more meat is so brilliant and so obvious that I wonder why it took more than a century of putting sausages in bread for mankind to figure this out. Although the execution leaves something to be desired, this is definitely an idea that I need to steal. . . I came here for a BULGOLGI HOT DOG: static. px. yelp. com/bphot…Yes. A hot dog with bulgolgi. . . Or bulgolgi with a hot dog. . . Weird? HELL YEA IT WAS WEIRD. I've never had the two together, but I've had them separately and yes, I've experienced better. I don't recommend getting it. The bread was a bit dry. The bulgolgi was definitely dry and mushy. And the hot dog wasn't really hot. Lukewarm. Woot! Cheap, decent, Korean food in FiDi. . . that's unheard of! I first noticed this little convenience store yesterday when me and my coworkers were walking over to Yerba Buena for bowling and I saw a random sign outside of it on the street that said ""Korean Food"", etc. I thought it was interesting so I Yelped it today and decided to try it out for lunch with my Korean food obsessed bf Derrick D. =PWe ordered the chicken bulgogi, the bibimbap, and some japchae. We were served by this Korean lady who was really nice. Chicken bulgogi  This came with a side salad and dressing as well as kimchee (but unfortunately she ran out when she got to us). The rice and chicken were both nice and piping hot. . . the chicken was well flavored and very tender. She added some kind of sauce on top of everything which made the rice kinda soggy though. It was all pretty good and the portion was filling!Bibimbap  This was mainly Derrick's dish but I got to try some of it. It looked like a typical bibimbap dish (minus the egg). . . there were the assortment of veggies, beef, and a side of spicy Korean sauce. The only downside was that it was kinda cold so remember to microwave it if you decide to get this. . . the right spice and flavors were there though. Japchae  Like the bibimbap, this was also a little colder than I would have liked but it's nothing you can't fix. The portion was large and was really tasty overall with lots of noodles, mushrooms, green onions, and cabbage. Those  items and  bottled drinks for $! Super cheap. . . will be coming back next time I have a craving! I also love the originality of the store name lol This place is awesome! The two people who run the store are the epitome of niceness!! I was a bit skeptical of the food at first but I have to say I'm a huge fan of the bi bim bap. It's the only thing I've had but it's pretty good!! It's not totally authentic, there's no egg etc but it's a good portion for a cheap price and lots of yummy vegetables. Be sure to grab a little container of hot sauce to add to your dish. But beware it is HOT! I stupidly added the whole container one time. Big mistake! Add a bit at a time til you have some tasty bi bim bap! I had the Japchae Bap (japchae with beef. )  The beef was well marinated, but a little overcooked (which is understandable because they need to keep it warm over time. )  The rice was also a little wetter than I prefer.  The noodles and salad were solid and overall it was very good.  The menu is very limited, though, so it's probably something that I'll only hit every couple of weeks. The couple that run the store are really sweet. they now sell korean food to go.  bi bim bab for $!  an yung! An excellently well stocked and kempt convenience store in a busy little SOMA corridor.  Always happy to patronize a friendly family run business.  Soo go heseh yo! A little friendly shop that has most everything you may want  snacks, pop, some coffee, cookies, energy bars, cigarettes.  Nice, clean, friendly, and has a remarkably good selection of things you might want.  Always good for a quick pick me up."|3|96|2|Routine| Other low risk violation  [ date violation corrected: 5/17/2013 ] Improper storage of equipment utensils or linens  [ date violation corrected: 5/17/2013 ]
Cafe Francisco 0|3.5|Coffee & Tea in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|165|0|3.9|" i love this super neighborhood joint. and i can't believe the FRITATTAs are not mentioned more often. it's SO good. i always think about coming back and getting it. they can be a little slow but its not horrible. this place is great to catch up with friends or to do some work or study. So, I'm probably more like a  star versus a  star.  I love the falafel sandwich and everything is good. I wouldn't say it's great, but overall good. If you live in the area, it's a perfect place to stop before or after grocery shopping. I like Café Capriccio better for hanging out and getting coffee but they don't have a lot of food options. Café Francisco has a lot of food options. I haven't tried enough on the menu to give it a  star, but I'm willing to keep going. It's also nice to sit outside on a nice day. (It's always hard finding places to sit outside with your dog). The service here is unbearably slow. I've been here twice when it wasn't busy and waited almost thirty min for a breakfast sandwich. Definitely not worth the wait. Solid coffee. Simple, good quality cafe food. Straightforward, no nonsense service. IThe casual, unpretentious vibe is awesome. It's perfect for grabbing food on your own while doing some work, or bringing a book or newspaper. If you bring a friend, the menu is varied enough to suit most people (there's salads, sandwiches, egg frittatas etc. ) To the reviewer below who seemed perturbed about them no longer serving breakfast, you don't seem to get it. The service here is just straightforward and simple. There's no ""hidden message"" in the lady telling you they stopped serving breakfast at . I have no problems with this place. Drinks are cheap and pretty strong, and the layout is nice, especially with all the outdoor seating (and on both sides of the outdoor area in front of the cafe). They also do happy hour every day of the week. That is no laughing matter, folks. Pastries and coffee are good, and neithe will break the bank. You can spend a whole day just people watching in this cafe. Love it. Order the San Fran! Grilled chicken, bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato and mayo/Dijon mustard on sourdough. . . absolutely delicious! I love they're Margarita pita sandwich and the coffee cake BUT they really take their time preparing their food which is great and all but when the line is out the door they should really make an effort to not make you wait mins for a Togo order. It's frustrating. It's a Wednesday and its dead here and i've still waited over mins. This is the one thing that would make me stop coming here. . . . Great spot for lunch! We just happened upon it, and we were very happy with our meals! I got the parmesan chicken sandwich, and highly recommend it! i come here when i dont know where else to eat, probably like once a week. . . lots of bad things  i dont like the coffee they use, im always ""too late"" for french toast but they still offer me waffles (which are not good btw). why can you make waffles but not french toast? they charged to pour an americano on ice which is pretty dumb, the girl who i think is the manager has an attitude problem and most of the time is pretty rude even after tipping. seriously not that hard to smile or wait to roll your eyes until i turn around. they also have a fruit fly problem. good things  its cheap! the garden vegetarian sandwich is good. not good enough to make all the bad stuff better. after my last visit i realized im never eating there again. I come here for lunch a few times a month and my favorite thing to get is a half sandwich half salad combo. You can pick from ANY sandwich on the menu which most places won't let you do and it comes with a side salad with greens, tomatos, cucumber, peppers and dressing. All for $ $, great deal!During the week they get pretty busy around lunch time so come early or after lunch. Overall a nice little gem in the neighborhood."|4|94|2|Routine Inspection| Inadequately cleaned or sanitized food contact surfaces Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings
Cafe Francisco 1|3.5|Coffee & Tea in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|165|1|3.875| Nice little find on a Sunday morning.  Great food, nicely presented. Seems to have a local following.   Service is a bit on the slow side. . . But not an issue on a sunny Sunday Absolute breakfast bliss with a bevy of Bay charm. This cafe rivals any you might come across in the West Village in NYC,  but without the inflated prices and inevitable pretension. I ordered a simple bagel sandwich, and was pleasantly surprised at how it was nearly indistinguishable from my fond memories of consuming bagels on Sundays in Florida and New York. The eggs were scrambled perfectly, fluffy and plentiful. Cafe Francisco is just one of many reasons why I keep coming back to SF. Not much to say.  Very generic bagels and coffee that was pretty mediocre.  I'm sure it is better than the touristy places on the docks, but we were not very impressed with the Cafe. Great prices and tasty food. Super convenient for calling in a lunch order for pick up. The only thing that would make it better  stop over frying the falafel on the Mediterranean plate. This place is a great little gem in the tourist infested area near Pier . I am a student at a school in the area, and this is one of the few places around there that I can go for good food and good coffee, away from the pier. The food is really pretty good I usually get the mediterranean plate but I've also had the veggie sandwich and the spinach salad with bacon. All good. And the coffee is really excellent never needs sugar. Decent place for breakfast or lunch.  Not sure where they get their bread from, but it's really good.  Sandwiches and soups are the best option here.  I've tried the salads, but haven't found one I actually like.  Fritatas are good also; they take a bit longer to make, so don't order one if you're in a rush.  Lattes are OK. I live pretty much above this place, so frequent it quite often for coffee and quick bites. They have a great selection of pastries, bagels and other breakfast items. They also have beer and wine and make some great sandwiches and salads. They tend to get pretty busy, so expect to wait a while for anything hot. I wouldn't get the fruit dish though  both times I have it's been out of season and off. Great for grab and go, but with so many other places in the area it's hard to recommend lunch/dinner items here. We had breakfast a couple of times here and enjoyed all of it.  The yummy mochas, tasty breakfast sandwiches, and a nice SF atmosphere. It's fairly close to Fisherman's Wharf, but seems far away for crowds and noise.|4|87|3|Routine| Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils  [ date violation corrected: 7/2/2013 ] High risk vermin infestation  [ date violation corrected: 5/30/2013 ] Foods not protected from contamination  [ date violation corrected: 5/30/2013 ]
Cafe Francisco 2|3.5|Coffee & Tea in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|165|2|3.91666666667| Awesome, quiet cafe with super nice people, great sandwiches and menu. love this place. great prices too. This place hit the spot on a sunday morning  great frittadas (egg scrambles with great fresh ingredients) and quality coffee.  One thing I would advise someone doing breakfast here to do is to ask for the frittada to be cooked a minute less  mine would have been a little better had it been taken out of the oven a moment earlier. . great nonetheless!!I was very pleased with the salmon frittada and will definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting SF. Quaint place out of the main tourist hustle down the road. Note you order at counter, no table service (no one will tell you) . Good little spot for breakfast. Just go there for coffee. The food is actually good but their service is straight awful sometimes. If you're super hungry, go to Moe's. Now that Jamie W. and I strap on our Fitbits on weekends, we like to stroll from SoMa to Fisherman's Wharf and back just to see how many thousands of steps we can put on them. For some reason, Jamie always has more steps on his Fitbit which seems cruel and unfair since I walk as much as he does, probably even more because I'm way shorter. When I'm not busy being bitter, we find places new at least to us to park our keesters for a spell. On the way back on Powell, we stopped here since it just seemed inviting before going up that treacherous incline to Washington Square Park. OK, it's not that treacherous. It's not even that much of a hill. We just wanted a Diet Coke and maybe something to snack on before counting our steps again. There's quite a selection of salads and sandwiches served here. Also a lot of tables occupied by people working on their MacBook Airs (or is it MacBooks Air?). We were able to snag a booth and split the $.  Greek Salad, which turned out to be quite a treat with fresh hummus and dolmas added for good measure. There were lots of other fresh ingredients  garbanzo beans, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, olives, cucumber slices, tomato wedges, red onion, basil leaves, and feta cheese of course (see photo). It was an unexpected cornucopia of goodness which tasted healthy and delicious. As we munched, regulars walked in with great frequency to get their caffeine boost. Definitely a neighborhood cafe that I wish was in my neighborhood. FOOD   stars. . . quite a plethora of fresh ingredients in the Greek Salad hereAMBIANCE  .  stars. . . where everybody knows your name. . . except mineSERVICE   stars. . . friendly and attentiveTOTAL   stars. . . a welcome find for casual neighborhood eats Honestly this is probably the best place to go for lunch in our area.  The service is a little slow, but on a nice sunny day it's nice to sit outside, people watch and take it all in. Great food and friendly workers! We were looking for a small place to grab a sandwich, somewhat close to all the action near the piers.  Cafe Francisco was a great find. I went with a club and my girlfriend went with the roast beef.  Neither disappointed.  They were both warm, fresh and delicious.  There is plenty of seating outside, and being away from all the tourists means you can enjoy some peace with your food or drink. Overall this is a great place to grab a quick lunch and next time we're around the area we'll stop by again. Stopped here while passing by a few days ago for a cup of coffee to help battle food coma. Upon ordering, you get a cup and have a choice of four pots of brews to choose from, from strong French roast to something less strong.  I see here it's not just a coffee shop in that they serve sandwiches and maybe a small number of hot food plates. Overall, a very good local coffee place. Awesome! I've walked by this place a few times but it's so unassuming, didn't figure they'd have good food. Gave them a try since the weather's been nice and they have outdoor seating. Had a Belgian waffle (yeah!) with strawberries and scrambled eggs on the side. Along with a coke, came to  bucks. Two blocks away around Washington Square Park, same meal would have easily cost me . The waffle was delicious and the strawberries tasted fresh. The staff was nice but left me alone to sunbathe and read my magazines. Much quieter than the more touristy part of NB too. All in all, a great experience, and I'll be back to check out the salads and sandwichs. OK this place has fine food for a good price. But really I come here for the atmosphere and it doesn't hurt that the food doesn't drive me away. Good looking salads, nice sandwiches. Just a great neighborhood hangout. The music is not obnoxiously loud. They have wifi. Great sunlight. Beer and wine if you like.

Cafe Francisco 3|3.5|Coffee & Tea in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|165|3|3.55263157895|" This was a decent cafe I discovered walking a few blocks up from the wharf.  The food here and it is located in a cute neighborhood and the staff is very friendly.  The only cons were a few tables were pretty dirty even when there was hardly anyone there.  Other than that it was a nice place to grab lunch, but wouldn't be a must see if I visit again. They get my food & drink out quickly  then leave me alone so I can get work done!  The Short: I give this cafe  stars because they give me what I need when I need it.  I come here when I need to eat a solid lunch or breakfast, drink a yummy latte, heist free wifi, and deal with friendly staff that let me sit and study in peace  for hours.  Good place to focus.  I have a few spots I like in NB, but this is the only one where I actually get work done.  I don't know, maybe because they keep it simple  nothing fancy.  The weekends get a little crazy during certain hours, but otherwise, I can't complain. Little Longer: When I first noticed this cafe, it looked so homely compared to the others in NB.  I really didn't want to try their food or drink.  But, one day, I was at the super famous cafe around the corner talking to my neighbor who informed me that the good coffee is on Francisco.  So, we walked over and she was right  AND it was quieter (no crazy loud jams)!  Quick turn over too.  After a while, I decided to give the food a try.  I've had almost everything on the menu, but usually stick to the sandwiches, omelets, and falafal.  Occasionally I'll have a waffle with strawberries and whip.  They carry beer too, and I often fantasize about ordering several bottles; but like I said, I come here to work.  Unfortunately, I cannot work with a beer buzz.  Bottom line: you want simple food and friendly service, this is your spot.  If you need to get hopped up on caffeine and/or bang out some work, this may be your spot too.  Note: they do a happy hour and take out. . . good portions.  Not many electrical plugs for laptops; if you can, charge up ahead of time. i grew up a block from here, never came here when I was little. . . luckily, i was fortunate enough to work nearby for a couple of years. . . this place is a real gym. . albeit a bit priceyfrancisco salad, mediterranean plate. . . and the sandwiches This cafe is a few blocks up from the wharf which puts it in more of a local category than tourist spot.  I was there late evening and had a cappuccino.  It was OK but I think the server was not top notch using the machine.  It is quaint and a neighborhood spot but would have liked to tried something to eat as it looked great.  Would consider stopping there again if I were around the area. One of my favorite neighborhood spots and a place where the community truly comes together. I love their coffee, food, and the atmosphere and have made many friends and business connections here over the last few years I've lived in the area. The space has high ceilings and large windows which flood it with light. There is outdoor seating too which is one of my favorite things for eating, drinking, and people watching. If you want to get out of the house and work then use their free wi fi, I have used this place as a local office on many occasions. The portions are always very generous and the food is consistently fresh. Great location. Great food. Great people. Great place. A ""Mediterranean frittata"" for .  with eggs, spinach, tomato , cheddar and feta cheese arrives after   delightful minutes in the cordial ambiance of this cute north beach gem. The plate came with  pieces of whole wheat toast, orange, grapefruit and a side of diced tomatoes, cilantro and onions. As for the frittata, it was baked and still sizzling upon arrival at the table. The sizzling seemed to compliment the big band sinatra ish background music. The eggs and cheddar were slightly golden, and sat on top of a layer of feta and onion over a bed of tomatoes followed by spinach. The feta being in the upper layer melted into the lower layers, infusing a cheesy chewy texture which provided contrast against the spinach and tomatoes. If had one complaint, it was only that I do not remember them asking me what type of toast I would like! This place is so quaint. It is a wonderful neighborhood spot, and hidden just a bit even though it is really close to the Wharf.  The staff was really knowledgeable of the menu, and seemed to care that we enjoyed our meal.  The Francisco salad was light, and had a wonderful presentation. It was a large salad, so it could easily be shared. The paninis looked tasty too. A cup of tea and some nice people watching if you are able to score a table outside, simply perfection. Very great little neighborhood cafe run by very nice people.  Breakfast there is outstanding although for me it is my lunch place.  Their San Fran sandwich is really tasty and the med. plate is one of my favorites.  On nice days, it is a real delight to make use of their outside tables.  It just a little bit of Parisian cafe in my neighborhood and I love it.  It also has internet service. Greg Free wi fi, decent food and tea/coffee! Only problem is that it closes early, wish it was open till a little late. Love this place! Great place to grab coffee while waiting for the bus. ALSO, amazing smoked salmon bagels with. . . CAPERS!! Very cute place to have a nice relaxing time. Cafe Francisco is a nice neighborhood  spot. It is a good 'go to' for basic food like sandwiches, and quick breakfast foods. It lacks the 'make everything gourmet' that is so common in San Francisco, but it has excellent pricing. This makes it a place that you can get more than what you pay for. Worth a weekly visit for neighborhood dwellers and passers by! very average food ( stars), but coffee was a little under average, but it's affordable (free refill!).  When I'm in a rush to catch a bus, I would get a cup to go, otherwise, I would go somewhere else for better coffee.  Good outdoor sitting to have a beer in the evening after work on my way home. Love these guys.  Good food and the service is the best I've had in a long time.  Perfect place to have just down the street from where I live. Save the time and walk another block to Capriccio.  Used to go here a lot for brunch but the omlets took a turn for the worse. . . barely cooked through with cold cheese in the middle.  Plus the last few times I went coffee and espresso tasted ridiculously burned. During a long walk around the financial district, through North Beach and then towards North Point, we stumbled on this little place on the corner. At first I assumed it was going to be like every other cafe/coffee shop in the city with a bunch of bagels and espresso. It was better the menu boasted plenty of breakfast items, deli sandwiches and salads, and beer and wine. The best part is that as soon as we walked in the door, the man behind the counter actually greeted us eye contact, smile, and the actual word ""Hello!"" Sad to be shocked that this simple act sets places apart for me here in the city. We ordered a sandwich each; I did the pastrami special and my friend ordered the falafal sandwich. . . when a tiny fruit fly landed in my wine (it was a beautiful day and their front and back doors were open), they happily replaced my glass. The portions were ample for the price and the cafe has a nice, light local atmosphere. I will come here again when I am in the neighborhood and hungry for basic, common courtesy and a good lunch. Randomly came here while I was waiting to go to a class at the Cheese School of SF (right next door). It was happy hour, so a glass of wine was only $. And they filled it up to the very brim!! Me & a friend ordered a greek plate and a proccuito plate ($.  each). Definitely worth it! The hummus on the greek plate was really yummy. And the proccuito was good quality, super soft & tender. The place was relatively clean, however, there were some flies/bugs flying around inside, so one star less for that. Love the breakfast, the staff are really nice; try the frittata. it's amazing :) Very good place for lunch! I've had the French Dip and Chicken Parmegan and both were above expectations! This place is good when you need to stop for food, but it'll leave you questioning a couple of things.  First, table cleanliness.  All the available tables were pretty dirty.  The place wasn't busy, so it shouldn't have been a problem to go around and wipe everything down. Second, their roast beef was wet.  Like dripping wet.  I'm not sure how cold cuts are on the West Coast, but to me, roast beef shouldn't be wet enough to drip whatever it was soaking in. Third, their sourdough bread.  I'm under the impression that San Francisco is the place to get good sourdough, but the toasting they put on the slices here took all the flavor out of it and made the crust too hard to be enjoyable. Nonetheless, the result is more than the sum of its parts.  It surprisingly worked despite my gripes above. Or maybe I was just hungry. This place is not a cafe in the traditional sense, but in the expanded sense of a sandwich shop, that also has some pastries and an espresso machine.  Seeing as how coffee was not their strong suit, I decided to get a sandwich.  Well it turns out that the tuna melt comes as an open faced sandwich.  The toast was burnt on the edges, but otherwise is was delicious: fresh basil and tomatoes topping a healthy portion of swiss cheese and tuna salad, baked on some rather mediocre bread.  Completely filled me, was delicious, and cost under $. .  I think that makes this place a gem since it's easy walking distance from the touristy nightmare of Pier . The place also has free internet, but it closes early (:pm everyday), so it's not much use as a cafe, but probably great as a lunch and snack spot if you live/work around here.  The ambiance, however, is crap.  Dirty old tables, lame music, and the workers are yelling and banging stuff constantly.  These problems with the environment cost them two stars.  I mean, it's set up like a quiet little deli on a quiet street corner with light (lame) music, but it's like a New York subway in there just because of the noise made by the people behind the counter.  Not conducive to anything pleasant.  If they fixed that (i. e. learned manners and common sense on running a place that's comfortable for customers), then place would be great! Great Food and ServiceOpen til pm everyday I LOVE this place!  The food is fresh and the coffee not bitter at all.  They have outdoor seating and the owner is very friendly.  Not much of a wine selection but they do have wine and beer.   I live in the neighborhood and it is a great place to meet with friends. I recommend the caprese and wild turkey sandwich!  If you do sit outside choose the two by the front door the ones along the side can be a bit noisy with the traffic. Came here one morning, slightly hungover after crashing out at a friend's house not too far. I ate here almost a year ago and from what I recall this place is great. I had pancakes & eggs I believe. I still remember how fluffy the pancake was. I plan on coming back here again real soon and will definitely update my review. . . I discovered this place when I came to SF for the first time back in . Returning now is like seeing an old friend from college. . . pleasant, but we've both moved on. The service isn't really up to much. . . a New York scowl awaits you when you order, and if you have the slightest accent, you'll repeat everything  times, mainly because the person taking the order isn't looking at you. The food is pretty good though, the eggs and salsa are top notch. The coffee is a little below par for this town (help yourself from the flask), but if you just flew in from North Korea, you might think it's awesome. The jazz in the background will either add to the ambiance or distract, depending on your taste in music (it makes me tense) but you'll get nothing else for free (water, coffee top ups, a smile). Having said all that, it's well away from the other tourist coffee bars  you'll feel more like a local, which can be refreshing. It fits the location, pretentious and over valued. Just like that Inuit Poetry major. **edit  after scouring the area a little further and realizing that virtually every other café gives free coffee refills with breakfast, this place is even more disappointing. Relegated to two stars. . . Today we bought two cups of juices that they said were ""freshly squeezed"", but they were some Minute Maid juice u can buy in shops. and the wireless Internet wasn't working. We left the place right away! Cafe Francisco is a great little spot I can go on a lazy morning with or without my son to read a bit and enjoy a cuppa joe.  Last time I was there I splurged and ordered a waffle. Nice big portion, enough whipped cream, strawberries and sprinkled with cinnamon.  It actually was quite tasty and for under $. . . can't beat that.   I have to say I love the music they play and they hang art from local artist which is always enjoyable.  Last time my son and I were in, we met the publishers/editor of my son's favorite manga, Naruto, and the editor came back in especially to give my son a new edition.  NOW that was really cool. So again, it's a great spot to chill. . . you never know who you might run into. What's not to love:  It's FAST but not fast food; in fact, anything but. We had the falafel and the wild turkey sandwich on sourdough.  They were both scrumptious.  Nothing was oily tasting.  I suggest getting the turkey on sourdough because they toasted ours just so that it had that chewy consistency. Loved the mushroom spread on the turkey sandwich  they don't overdo the sauce like too many places.  They have the art of light touch down  same with the tahini and basil on the falafel.  Light but just enough for the palate to appreciate and savor.  MInd you  all this from a small, corner, simple, unpretentious local joint with an old, hodgepodge of tables.  AND the food is so affordably priced.  My two sandwiches were $ and $.  Another little nice touch but important thing I love is when you get your order to go, they put your sandwich in a box  so your sandwich isn't squashed when you get to your destination  it's the little things sometimes that make a big diff.   They take credit card thank god.  Just for that, I'll be a regular. There are so many places that only take cash and it drives me nuts since I hate carrying cash. Would be *'s if the staff hated their jobs a little less. I try not to hang out that often in the highly populated tourist traps. There are many reasons as to why I prefer not to wrangle my way through a bunch of tourists and other unmentionables that clog up the sidewalks in their elastic waistbands and overly done up hair.  Gone are the years of loitering about with locals in unblemished spots of respite.  I do, however, enjoy the occasional bombardment by Italian or German tourists at the local noodle stop.  What can I say, I am biased, especially when the Berlin & Beyond Film Festival is in full swing and the Castro runs rampant with cuties and their fabulous accents. When guests arrive from out of state or abroad, they mention the several strips that are long feared by locals (Fishermen's Wharf, Ghiradhelli Square, Union Square) and I am swayed in hosting them to a nice walk: me with my camera and my wards with their eagerness to explore. Café Francisco has saved me many a time and on top of their great Breve lattes, that keep me comforted during the cold evenings, the lack of pretentiousness and down to earth ambiance seduces from the sidewalk.  For the less fortunate in this struggling economy?  The prices are a welcome sight.  My usual purchase of a toasted bagel with cream cheese and jam takes an easy $ out of my wallet.  Here, only $.  When my friends visit, this is the easiest place to stop and take a quick respite, especially if you elect for their Belgian Waffle, a fantastic colorful display of fresh fruit topped off with a mound of whipped cream.  And for a mere approx $.  We were not in the mood for larger plates, but for the so inclined, they also serve omelets, soups, and sandwiches, all for under $. The staff here are friendly and quick to respond to requests, no matter how trivial, and remember to take a moment to check out the art.  They host art exhibitions and when I need a moment, losing oneself with a great cup of coffee amidst creativity adorning the walls is a willing surrender. Never had food from here, but the lattes are creamy and delish. I sometimes stop by before work and the girl working the counter is nice and pretty quick. Nice neighborhood spot. This place always has fresh produce & yummy ingredients.   Friendly staff too!I've had some of their specialty salads as well as a few sandwiches  the open faced Parmesan Chicken sandwich with pesto was delicious! My biggest complaint is that they're always out of ingredients.  For example, I've never once been there when they still had focaccia bread, but I tend to go there to grab some dinner, so I guess they're more prone to being out then. Overall, good place, good service. Love that you can do half sandwich (including falafel sandwiches) and half salad, but the falafel is a little dry. Cafe Francisco remains one of the better lunch options if you live and/or work in the area. On the plus side, portions are large, the food is tasty, and the prices reasonable. On the down side, the service can be slow, the workers cranky, and the place is a bit dirty. My biggest beef right now is that I recently went in and asked if I could order the bagel with lox. The usually unfriendly server told me they only served that for breakfast, so I opted for my usual veggie sandwich. It wasn't until after I put my order in that I saw they had a lox sandwich special, which was identical to the bagel and lox, but on different bread. She couldn't have told me that? I've been pretty miffed with them since. Yet, I continue to go back. I eat there  to  times a week.   I've been doing it for over  years. It's good food at a good price. A cute little shop.  Nice place to enjoy the sun and the peace. I eat here fairly often as I live close by. Breakfast ranges from good to mediocre, sandwiches are better. In general the service and quality of the food really suffers on the weekends  the guys who work there then can't scramble an egg without burning it!Most people are here for the location and good coffee and selection of drinks. You get a good crossection of locals who go to the place. Free wifi is a plus. The sandwiches are delicious, I had the Veggie and my friend opted for the BLT. . . He had originally wanted the San Fran (ran out of avocado), and then the Wild Turkey (ran out of mushroom spread), so he finally settled with a standard BLT.  It was a little off putting because it was lunchtime and not all that busy at the time. . . but shit, if I worked there, I too would snack on avocado and mushroom spread, not pointing any fingers though, just sayin.  The indoor seating is casual, definitely could munch, drink, and work on my computer there.  A coffee shop with good eats  thumbs up. Filthy, filthy, filthy! When one looks at the espresso machines' steam wand, its all white and not from nice and shiny plastic, but rather an accumulation of dried up milk, over the months. The floor is covered with food,(a feast for any rodent), and the tables are so sticky they leave an imprint on the clothes. Then to forget all you have just witnessed, you looks out the window, only to get depressed even more by mistaking the filthy windows for another foggy day in the city. Frankly, I don't know why the health department hasn't shut them down. Local breakfast/lunch place for good coffee, salads, omelets and simple, healthy sandwiches.  Opens early and closes early/around pm. Good sandwiches and nice friendly staff. Try any of the sandwiches on foccacia  yum! I work in Fisherman's wharf and this place is just a couple of blocks away but it's a great escape from the tourist traps of the wharf. I'm not the only reviewer who has ""stumbled upon"" this place and was consequently very pleasantly surprised. In addition to being located in a corner of the City I have not yet experienced (and am very much looking forward to experiencing more!), Cafe Francisco also delighted me because:* True to its name, it just *feels* like Classic San Francisco circa turn of the (previous) century: old wooden paneling reminiscent of chowder houses, antique designed bathroom signs, tree lined brick filled street and proximity to Coit Tower. I almost expected the fresh fish catch deliveries to be in the back. * It has very friendly staff *and* patrons. During my visit, an  (or  ) something man came in to order a glass of wine and a customer looked out for him, asking me to have him step in front of me. How could I refuse? He was adorable! He took a lot of time ordering and chatting. . . subsequently adding a feeling of familiarity, warmth, community and history to the already historically ensconced environment. * Its menu is definitely ample, and my selection was perfect: what else to order but The Francisco Salad, replete with greens (spinach, tomatoes & artichokes) and protein (avocado, feta and chicken which I used to replace the bacon which normally accompanies this)? All of this topped by a beautiful basil leaf and accompanied by lightly toasted wheat (of course) sourdough with a tasty strawberry & pineapple garnish. Delish. A few nits: the coffee was just sort of so so, and there is only one functional power outlet (and this was hogged by a less communal patron. . . he also had a Mac though, so I empathize). But: there is free wifi!I'd definitely consider returning here on my next romp in this historical, quaint, sunny part of town. This cafe is pretty quiet and good for studying if you have lots of school work like me! They have Free Wifi, reasonable prices on their coffee and sandwiches. I tried the Tuna Melt and Grilled Chicken Francisco. It's a quiet cafe for reading/studying unless a group of loud people come in of course. Most mornings, I fall out of bed and stumble into Cafe Francisco looking for coffee and food. I'm  really grumpy before I get my coffee, but the fine folks at Cafe Francisco are always friendly and quick.  Their breakfast bagels are pretty tasty, and their coffee has plenty of caffeine. I usually have several cups (free refills!) every morning.  Cafe Francisco is a good place to work, they have free wifi, and the booths are nice and big. However, only the tables by the front have power. The tables outside on the sidewalk are great on sunny days. Their sandwiches are pretty good too, the roast beef is highly recommended. Meandering through North Beach one recent day, my girlfriend and I stumbled on Cafe Francisco. Immediately, it became a future staple. I was skeptical that this tiny place on Powell Street was anything more than a coffee/bagel walk in. Instead, I was greeted with a huge menu that covered at least three continents. I settled on the Greek Salad, to satiate my European craving of the day, and a bagel, because I hadn't had breakfast yet. The salad? Oh it was Greek enough for me. The lettuce was leafy and green, and it came with several blocks (not crumbles) of Feta, and a healthy portion of hummus on top. The highlight, though, was perhaps the best dolma I have ever tasted. Though the dressing was a rather bland balsamic vinaigrette, instead of my preferred Greek, I let it slide. The rest of it was that good. My plain bagel, by itself, wasn't particularly interesting. But the welcome surprise of whipped cream cheese made it at least a little adventurous. And to top it all off, the coffee was strong with a bit of a smokey flavor. I'll be heading back soon to try the rest of the menu. I am a regular here.  I walk in and they already know what I'm going to order.  That's how much I come here. Sure its convenient to my office.  But if it sucked I wouldn't keep coming back.  I come here all the time in the morning for my iced chai (with little ice) and sometimes a breakfast bagel.  Wow, those things are awesome but filling!  I only get one if I'm starving, because I don't need to eat for the rest of the day after one of those suckers. For lunch I either get one of their stacked sandwiches or yummy salads.  They also have a great fruit, yogurt and granola bowl.  Seriously, I've never had anything bad here.  It might be ""standard cafe fare"" but its good cafe fare. I went to Cafe Francisco on a whim yesterday looking for a cafe near my house. I had heard a little bit about this place from friends but had no idea what I was getting into. . . My friend and I checked out the menu and ordered the Mediterranean Plate and the Greek Salad. We grabbed a cute little table outside and shortly our feast arrived. Both plates were filled with amazing Greek treats. You name it, we had it on our plates. I have never seen so much food piled high on two plates. We even received side plates with pita and fruit on them after our huge main plates. We left painfully full, but will definitely return again. This might be unfair since I haven't been here in over a year, but I advise everyone to stay away from this place. I ordered a vegetarian sandwich and noticed it was crunchy, though there was no reason for crunch. When I opened it up I was disgusted. The vegetables all had a bad mucousy sheen to them, the greens were black and soggy, and I was crunching on the mostly blackened avocado slices. Those vegetables looked like they'd been cut and laid out in the open for a week. I brought the opened sandwich to the person at the counter and told them it didn't look right. He just said, ""Sorry you didn't like it,"" and threw it away. That's it. I went home and was horribly, horribly sick for  days. So I lost three days of work over a bad Francisco Cafe sandwich. My advice: Don't go here, ever. When I was first looking for an apartment back in July , I was at a place around North Beach and wandered into this little cafe. It was perfect since I was looking for just a quick sandwich for lunch.  I got a Wild Turkey sandwich and it was great.  The smoked turkey was moist and flavorful and the avocado was nice and fresh.  The sourdough bread completely made up for an otherwise shitty weekend. I also had their freshly squeezed orange juice which was amazingly sweet with just a hint of tanginess. Ok so if you are looking for a easy going brunch/coffee shop in North Beach, look no further. This place is awesome. The people are friendly, the food is fabulous, and the chai is perfection. My sister is a big coffee drinker and she loves coming here for their coffee whenever she comes and visits. We never have an issue getting a table and they have outside seating on the sidewalk, which is quaint and enjoyable. You dont even have to wait very long for food. As for food recommendations, pretty much anything on their menu is good. I usually go for their bagels, but I have had their french toast, which was really good as well. Like it said, you can't go wrong. One of my favorite lunch spots around.  Almost always get the Garden Vegetarian sandwich or the Mediterranean Plate but their other sandwiches & salads are good too. Once I sampled a bacon egg sandwich that was pretty darn tasty. Good food, good price & wine too :O) Excellent lunch. I had a group of  and we were looking for a place that had a little variety but quality sandwiches. The bread was good. The sandwich construction better. Definitely worth a lunch stop. A really nice lunch spot. They make great sandwiches that taste awesome and look great too. Pretty fast service and a nice atmosphere on the inside. I often get the garden vegetarian sandwich, and it never disappoints. They also have a Greek salad which is insane! It is like $ and it is frickin' huge! I think the only time I ever finished it was the st time I got it. I can't speak for the meaty sandwiches, but many of my mates get em and love them. From what I can tell they make a great french dip and also some sort of margarita sandwich which has tomatoes and basil and prosciutto, that seems to be a favorite of my friends. Oh and their focaccia bread really bangs the sammies up a notch. They have some basic outdoor seating where you can watch tourists go by in buses and loud school kids getting onto buses. Hey Francisco's! I admit I may be positively biased to your establishment since I work near by. I've had your coffees almost every morning which is ""good"" but not ""the greatest. "" I've had your morning bagel, consisting of bacon and eggs, which is pretty delicious too. Some people seem to think that the the staff is rude or otherwise unfriendly. In rebuttal to that, I like to say that they are not the type to talk random BS and kiss up for better tips, that's for sure. From your secret admirer,S. R This place is pretty decent. I think the prices are a bit much for what it is but I really do love the mediterranean plate. It's a lot of food that keeps you full and happy the rest of the afternoon. Plus, the various things that come with it provide a nice variety over a standard salad. I haven't had any problems with rude staff or insanely long waits for food, but then again, I only stop in here for lunch once every two months. Cafe Francisco is right by my house.  I think they have the best BLT in SF.  Their salads are great too. Came here en route to Stinson beach yesterday for some delicious sandwiches.  I had the BLT with avocado on sourdough, we had another one of those, the Parmesan Chicken, which comes served open face with chicken, tomatoes, basil, parm, red onion and pepper, and a San Fran, which is basically a BLT with chicken and a pesto mayo.  I loved my sando soo much! The avocado was super fresh and the bacon was cooked PERFECTLY! It was great and I was even able to get half down, considering the hangover I had.  I ended up eating the other half on the beach, which may have been even better, but a bit sandy :)It's also priced pretty well. My sandwich was only $. , which is alot cheaper than most other fancy sandwich shops. What a great place to hang out and have a bite to eat. I am starting to write reviews on the places I really did not want people to know about but since the economy is in the tank I feel people need to know about places that have great service and are a great value as well. I have to say that Cafe Francisco has what i think is the best damn Club sandwich in San Francisco. They also make a mean fallafull as well. Great coffee and so many other food choices it was time for me to share this one. Every year the owner has a th of July party that he invites everyone who lives or lived in the neighborhood to. I lived down here and worked down here for a few years. i love this place and I wish I didn't need to tell people about this one, but it seems that the ones I love are being found any ways. Let's admit it. There are few places in this area to really eat. So when you find one that carries a Pseudo Parisian while it offers you breakfast, lunch, or misc with the possibilities of wine, you have to look deep down and ask: ""Why wouldn't I want to experience this considering the part of the city I am in?""Once pondering this deep thought, you will rise and have at the opportunity of a wonderful Mediterranean Plate or French Toast to make you feel like you are a part of something bigger. That's Cafe Francisco for you, a place where you can be a part of something bigger than yourself. I'm so glad I'm not the only one! I logged in to write a review and noticed someone else made the same comment. . . . . . this place is really dirty! I actually come here all the time so it's not a deal breaker, but Cafe Francisco really needs to do a little spring cleaning! I don't think some parts of the cafe have ever seen a sponge. The food is good though so I keep on coming back. Just a little too dirty inside it needs a good scrub down. Otherwise I'd give them a four. I like the hardwoord floors and the marble tables and the free wi fi is great. My americano was nice as well. Spent a relaxing afternoon here where the rating got better with each dish. Started with a three stars parfait (nice amount of fruit, but the yogurt was a little bland), next came a three and a half star latte (nonfat milk and sugar free vanilla syrup were great, not so much the $.  charge for the latter) and I finished with a five star sandwich (turkey on wheat, made all the more delicious with no charge hummus instead of mayo and a side of fruit). Food alone is probably closer to three stars, but they earn a fourth star with free wifi, outlets, a corner location perfect for people watching and very friendly and welcoming service (letting me open a tab, asking if I wanted anymore substitutions on my sandwich since I declined cheese and avocado). I changed my mind. There are some things you can't do with out. Skippy Peanut Butter, Smuckers jam, Sharmin toliet paper, Ketel Tonic, B Sando from Cafe Francisco. Even in hard times there are things that you cant do without or cannot compromise. I felt Cafe Francisco was too expensive. I thought I could do with just your regular grocery store deli sando. I thought it wasnt worth it. New Years Resolution ', Dont lie to yourself. Those Cafe Francisco sandwiches, although pricey, are darn good. I really enjoyed my time at Cafe Francisco. I went there last week on a lunch date and had the Turkey Club sandwich. My date had the omelet and it looked incredible! I will say the cheese wasn't thoroughly melted in the omelet though. I had no problems with my sandwich. The atmosphere was bright and the tables spaced out with plenty of room if you wanted to bring your laptop in, which they provide free WiFi FYI. I definitely will be back here to study! (.  stars)  In the mid s I used to come here every once in a while for coffee and/or desert.  I liked both then, and apparently I like both now, although now I can throw in a liking of their sandwiches and soups.  Very fresh, hot, looks good, tastes good, and very well priced.  I couldn't help but wish I worked closer so I could frequent for lunch more often.   I always thought they were located in a somewhat strange location, but when the weather is nice, windows open, and tables all outside  very relaxing place to hang out, eat, read, Wi Fi, etc.  Did I mention they had beer?   Makes it just perfect for a morning coffee/pastry pickup and a late lunch stop on the way back. I am pleased that Cafe Francisco has free Wifi again, but maybe getting that perk comes with a cost.  The coffee used to be very good, but nowadays it's not.  Clearly there's not enough beans being used.  The food is still quite tasty, though.  Nevertheless, I still go there because it's in my neighborhood and I don't drink much coffee anymore. Through no fault of its own, Cafe Francisco is only pretty good. I mean, in a vacuum, there's absolutely nothing wrong with it, and several things right. Great salads, sandwiches, carefully made to order in a somewhat speedy manner. But the fact that Petite Deli (to name only one example) is mere blocks away kind of hurts the whole proposition. Still, worth a try. And maybe I'll be more inclined to eat here more often if it continues to rain every day. Otherwise, I'll make my own or go a few blocks farther to North Beach. I love their soy lattes, it's what keeps me going back, probably one of the best in the city. Unfortunately, parking is a nightmare in north beach, and the girl at the register either hates people or hates her job. I've never seen a smile or a greeting for that matter. So i try to get in, get my coffee and get out as quickly as possible. Great spot for people watching and sipping a beverage on a warm day. . . if your beverage is made well.  I ordered a cafe au lait, which was seriously just steamed milk.  I don't understand.  Yeah, it's my fault I didn't go back and ask if she knew what she was doing, but still should I have to?The ambiance is chill and nice, although the bathroom is a bit gross.  And, they close at  on a weeknight?  SILLY! This is a really cute neighborhood cafe. I was in the area because I was getting the grand tour of the malt house down the block by one of the project managers, and after four hours of walking around we were pretty hungry. Having worked there for so long, he suggested we pop in here for lunch, siting delicious sandwiches. Now, being a vegetarian I believe there was really only one option on the menu for me sandwich wise. The sammy sounded pretty darn good, and after reading other reviews I almost regret not getting it, but I opted for the Mediterranean plate since I had been craving some good hummus for a few days. The service was quick, they came and cleaned off our table as soon as we sat down which was nice. The plate was huge, there was hummus and pita bread, plus dolmas and fallafel, plus a giant greek salad. On the whole the plate was pretty damn delicious, but to be nit picky, the hummus could have used a bit more tahini, and the large chunks of feta was a little odd. I did however, really like that they get everyone a little bit of fruit with their meal. We sat here for at least an hour eating and talking, and by the time we left the near empty cafe had filled up a bit. All in all, if I am in that area again I will definitely stop in for a bite to eat, although the portions are quite large for cafe food. But as north beach, and even more so pier  areas are places that I only frequent when I have a specific mission, I probably wont be back for awhile. This place is comfortable, tasty and has a great, friendly atmosphere. Ziad is top notch and is such a warm and welcoming person leaving me to have no complaints about the cafe.  Keep up the awesome work Cafe Francisco. I really like this little place.  The food is always fresh and the portions are very generous.   I tend to like Mediterranean food so I usually opt for the salads with feta and olives but I had a cured salmon appetizer that was very nice.   The only negative is that the food sometimes takes a while, so might not be a good place to stay and eat if you are limited for time.  Oh yeah, also, they serve beer and wine but both the red and white wines were way too warm the few times I've had them there.  Just as well, trying to cut down. UPDATE:  I just learned that their health inspection scorecard is not so great.   Not terrible, but not good.  I have to deduct a star as cleanliness is very important to me. I like their cafe. And I like how they care about not being conventional. when you order bagel with cream cheese they serve it in a little tray with some fruits on the side. I would give more starts if the place was a little bit more clean. the bathroom was very dirty when I used. There is the door on the back, just for employees, but it is so dirty. . I pay attention on details. . Makes you wonder if they are careful about hygiene when dealing with your food. . . Once I got a bowl of fruits and the fruits on top were going bad, probably wasn't fresh. . . no internet available :(There is a girl who works there that seems to always be in a bad mood. . The young boy is very sweet tho. . Right across the street I will be teaching at soon.  Delicious sandwiches, fresh ingredients.  A pretty chill place for teachers and other nearby professionals to have lunch. I'd recommend the ""San Fran"" sandwich (although no one who is actually from the Bay Area calls San Francisco THAT).  It's filled with lettuce, chicken breast, bacon, tomatoes. . . and I'd recommend it on foccacia.  Comes with fresh fruit on the side as an added bonus! Once a week I go to Cafe Francisco to get the Mediterranean Plate ( falafel,  tomatoes,  olives,  hunks of feta,  onions (I omit), lettuce and  toasted pita, one lump of hummus, one hell of a lotta dressing). It's funky, but good. Get a sparkling water. It's a place I like when I'm outside. Pretty quiet neighborhood, especially when school is out (across street). Close to work. MP is like clockwork. Never different. The service? It seems like there is a mini cultural exchange going on here. There's usually a young euro femme recently hired who leaves within a month or so. Other than that, there is a laughably unfriendly woman who's been there the full  years I've been going. She shows up in other reviews here. Attitude: cross between disdain and bored to tears. Not aggressive, but aside from that, really unwelcoming. But hey, I like the MP. Just don't go there for the conversation. Any conversation. No, not even, ""Hi. "" I work around the corner from Cafe Francisco and have been here twice for lunch during the week. I've had both the Mediterranean and Caprese salads which were both tasty. The atmosphere inside the cafe is warm and there are a few tables set up outside to soak up the sun's rays while sipping your afternoon latte. I'm giving this place  stars only because there's really nothing special about Cafe Francisco that would make me return, aside from its close proximity to where I work. I work over in the lunchtime HELL known as Pier   so finding this place is refreshing. The Mediterranean Plate is the best.  It's a ton of food at a decent price. They don't look at you weird when you get coffee refills, which is nice since on occasion we come to work here in order to escape the office. And the outdoor seating provides some amazing people watching.  Has anyone every bought a ping pong table from that ping pong shop across the street? This is a frequent lunch spot for me.  I usually get an americano and the chicken sandwhich which comes with a little salad. Nice place to sit outside and have a quiet lunch with a friend. .  to ? Yeah, another one of those. But after several visits, it's still  at the worst on an off day, and  on a rather good one. Free WiFi though!My co workers and I hit up this place for a Tuesday lunch, and they didn't balk at the group of  that showed up and started moving their tiny tables around. I came most recently for a lunch alone with my book, and it was perfect for that, too. You can come here on a bad day and have a pastry or scone to eat your feelings away, or you can come here on regular, good days and have your choice of salads, sandwiches and espresso drinks. Caprese salad was almost the perfect size  it was actually a shade too big, leaving a tomato+mozzarella+basil ball for a lucky, still hungry co worker. Iced coffee kept me blissfully awake through food coma. The roast beef sandwich on focaccia with pesto is my favorite so far, and all that oil reminds me that I should take the hills home instead of the F. Francisco salad is good and worth the $ if you're, say, de toxing from four days in unhealthy Texas. Speaking of the oil, there is a lot of olive oil in everything. This makes for tasty, but it's perhaps a bit much. Also, the roast beef sandwich and an iced chai latte ran me $. Not the end of the world, but I'll think twice about how much I'm spending later for dinner. I've complained loudly, at length, about the dearth of regular person places to eat in Fisherman's Wharf and North Beach. I'm more than happy to welcome Cafe Francisco to my   list. I'm giving it  estrellas because I've never had a bad food experience.  I recommend the Francisco style bagel with lox.  It's the Zeus of bagels.  If you like salad, try the mediterrean plate salad.  For sandwiches, I highly recommend the parmesan chicken and the tuna melt.  Yum! A damn good felafel sandwich, if I may say so.  Well prepared, and very well presented (if a little messy, because of all the tahini.  But what tahini it is!  It's probably the best I've had in San Francisco!).  The felafel sandwich here is actually PRETTY TO LOOK AT.  Imagine that!  If they served this on lavash instead of pita, I think they'd have a real winner (Wouldn't be as pretty, though.  Also if they offered some sort of hot sauce for us folks who like our felafels spicy, it would be great.  And an option of adding hummus to the sandwich. . . )I must confess, I'm a bit curious about their EIGHT DOLLAR EGG & CHEESE CROISSANT (Yes, that's right, folks: EIGHT DOLLARS!  For eggs, cheese & bacon on a croissant!), but my common sense prevents me from going through with it.  I mean, what's in this thing to justify such a ridiculous price?!!  Is it sprinkled with GOLD DUST or something?!  Can someone please inform me why this sandwich is so incredibly expensive?  Usually, the high water mark for breakfast sandwiches is about $, so this WAY surpasses that.  Maybe one day I'll splurge, just to see.  But I'm Vegetarian, and don't eat bacon, so it's even HARDER to justify that price!  I can't imagine them selling very many of these. . . So glad I came across this place while walking down Powell Street the other day!The girl behind the counter made me one of the creamiest, best tasting sugar free vanilla lattes I've ever had!They have outdoor seating out front one side non smoking, the other side OK to smoke. Not sure about other amenities, but seems like a popular neighborhood spot across from Francisco Middle School, since it was full of patrons on Monday afternoon at pm. I'm annoyed that you don't put your hours on your website.  Aren't I much more likely to visit your website to find your hours than to read about how you ""periodically"" do wine and cheese tasting events? Very nice place. However, a sandwich with fresh mozzarella on it does not  I cannot emphasize this enough  does not have to be warmed! You may toast the bread, if you are so inclined, but I do not need my beautiful mozzarella melted. I want it fresh and cold, not warm and greasy, period. gah, gross.  almost $ for weak coffee and a vegetarian sandwich that had tuna on it.  I ordered the vegetarian sandwich, and asked quite nicely for extra yellow mustard.  The woman behind the counter looked at me kind of funnily, and said that they don't put mustard on the vegetarian sandwich.  I asked her if they had any mustard for other kinds of sandwiches, and she said yes.  So I then repeated my request for yellow mustard, and she said ok, we have dijon.  This whole conversation took a couple of minutes, and could've easily been solved with ""I'm sorry, we only have dijon. ""  Anyways, so I wait a few minutes for the sandwich (which I got to go), and get my coffee while I'm waiting.  Maybe I'm spoiled, but I at least like the option of strong coffee.  I put a little from each variety in my cup to see if any were dark enough, but it was a lost cause.  My coffee looked more like tea.  So not helpful when you've got to deal with a bunch of cranky teenagers later!  Sandwich comes, my weak coffee and I leave. Later, I sit down to finally eat, and there are two huge problems.  One, every single ingredient has been piled in the middle of the sandwich.  It's like a soggy mountain, I swear.  The avocado is falling off left and right, the  pieces of red pepper are sliding around on each other, the tomatos are grainy and the bread is soggy as can be, which means the entire thing just falls apart after I take the first bite.  I open it up to try to rearrange things, thinking maybe if I do that it'll be easier to eat, and find bunches of tuna fish mixed into the hummus.  I ordered the vegetarian sandwich cause of how I'm a vegetarian.  And I'm not usually a picky one. . . if it'd been some kind of cold cut, I could have picked it off and gotten on with the messy business of eating my damn lunch.  Tuna, though, is a different beast.  All grainy and mushed into the bread and stuck to the vegetables.  Blech.  Lesson learned  inspect your food here before you leave, cause this was just inedible.  Huge waste of money. Cafe Francisco, a nice place , The San francisco sandwich is great, and also I love the mediterranean plate, The humus is good , and the falafel. all the salads are very good. This little neighborhood coffee place looks quaint enough and seems a respite from the tourist hell nearby, but I recommend against it. As other folks have mentioned here, the staff are just so incredibly unfriendly and incompetent, it would be laughable if they weren't trying to charge you $ for mediocre sandwiches. I work nearby and try this place every three months or so for coffee or lunch, thinking that it can't possibly stay that bad for that long (especially when it seems so darned convenient), but it HAS! For three years! ONCE, just once, there was a sweet Irish girl behind the counter who was actually civil (friendly, even) but she's gone now and it's the usual cretins who seem to resent you for even stepping though the door (seriously, how can this kind of attitude persist? What is the restaurant owner thinking?). A new restaurant just opened up on the southwest corner of the same block, I can't remember the name right now but the food is great and the staff is friendly. Check it out instead. We came in and I addressed the server with a ""How's it going?"" or ""How are you?"" No answer. We started to order breakfast. Monotone response from dark haired woman with no affect: ""We're not serving breakfast. """"What? Really?""""We stop serving breakfast at twelve. ""I check the time and watch it go from : to :. I check server's face and watch it go from blank stare to blank stare and then just briefly take on the subtle hints of blank stare. I say to my honey, ""You want to find somewhere else?""She says, ""Sure,"" and we leave. TAKE TWO: A few days later server and I meet again. I thought I caught a hint of a smile (maybe a smirk?) but that was quickly replaced by blank stare. I thought about engaging in dialog designed to resolve our issues, to come to some kind of closure and put our past behind us. I thought of protesting outside so that the world would know how cold the service could be here. But I need my coffee, dammit. I need my coffee. I'm so ashamed. . . I come here for the Garden Vegetarian sandwiches on foccacia bread. It's a big messy hummus sandwich that is very, very tasty. It also comes with a slice of melon, some feta and olives on the side. I can't say much about the service (you order at the counter so what is there to say?) or other items on the menu. It's also a little warm inside, but the old jazz music they play isn't half bad. i can't speak on what a dining experience is like here, but i can tell you about the wretched presence that took my money for a simple cup of coffee here last wednesday. i wandered in before an appointment in the area, the place was really cute and had a cozy feel, until i walked up to the counter and asked for a small cup of coffee to go, and the raging woman behind the counter shot me dirty looks, and without a word took my money, shoved change at me and walked away barking orders at the other people working with her. . lacking my morning caffeine i stood there dazed and a little stunned at what had just went down when she came back and snapped at me that i had to grab the small paper cup from the stack myself um alright, you maniac, really?! what gives?? so i did, and was super bummed to find that their ""small"" is really taste tester size cups. . such a fucking tease, i said i wanted a cup, not a sip. i was running late so i sucked it up and just left. obviously the  two gulps of coffee didn't hit the spot so on my way back from my appointment i begrudgingly went back in and ordered a medium, this time thinking i knew the drill. i dropped my money on the counter, and went to grab my medium cup when she stormed up on me with crazy eyes, and snapped about not touching the cups, she will give me the cup. . . this is where i had to school her. . i thought she would have put up more of a fight but apparently i'm scarier when you fuck with me before i've had sufficient amounts of coffee. . later i felt bad and thought maybe she was just having a really rough day, but i later heard from a good friend who works right around the corner that she is this heinous every day. . . i don't ever plan on finding out if it's true or not. i'd suggest caffe capriccio a couple blocks away on mason and chestnut. . the staff there are sweethearts. This is one of many neighborhood cafes in the North Beach/Pier  area. The atmosphere is personal and cozy, though, so many loyal customers go and sit for a couple of hours reading or chatting with friends. The service is quick, the food is always fresh and very generous on the portions. There's a touch of fresh pepper on many dishes, which adds just the right amount of flavor to the dishes. My top picks from Cafe Francisco are the San Fran, Garden Vegetarian, and Roast Beef Tuscany sandwiches, and the Francisco and Greek Salads. Breakfast at the cafe is also very enjoyable; the omelets are all very tasty and filling. They recently added new special omelets, which I have yet to try but I anticipate doing so. I highly recommend this cafe for those looking for a quiet ""getaway"" in the busy tourist area of North Beach/Fisherman's Wharf. I have been coming to Franciscos for a few years now and as many have said in previous posts, the service is the real problem at this bare bones/cozy neighborhood cafe. I have a few favorites on the menu including the Francisco Bagel w/ Lox  although for $, it's become a ""treat"" instead of ""the usual""  and the San Fran sandwich on foccacia with turkey instead of chicken. Although thing I go back for is the Hazelnut coffee. Sure the morning staff is a bit grumpy, but the coffee helps. They went through a real rough patch with staff who didn't know how to multitask and were sloppy. Everything suffered, and it was right after they raised everything by $. Those guys are gone now though  thankfully the ""little one"" as we called him is . . . I once waited for a good  minutes at the counter with a line of  behind me while he counted tips!  and the staff seems to be somewhat better . . . the food has been more consistent, but I still feel like I only eat there once in a while as opposed to at least x/week now. The ambiance is minimal, although cozy; benches inside are hard and uncomfortable and the owner never seems to be enjoying himself or the fact that he has customers, but the table by the big window or the patio are good options. Mostly bring the food home with me  I think maybe to escape the chaos of new staff and a sourpuss owner. Bottom line . . . some competition moved into the neighborhood recently  tried it once and Franny's will always be my default. More like .  stars. Very friendly place to stop in for a cup of coffee. The woman in the morning is always friendly and quick. This is just (to me) a place to stop and get coffee on the way to work. The food is ok. The pastries are store bought, so nothing special. The sandwiches I've tried have been pretty good so far. They also make omelettes. It's not great, but is a decent place. This is one of the better cafes that I've been to foodwise. The coffee is pretty good, but is inconsistent. The food is always really good. I'm particularly fond of the rather pricey, but delicious Francisco Bagel (bagel with cream cheese, tomatoes, red onion, capers) with lox. The ingredients are always fresh (the breads are always fresh, the tomatoes are nice red and ripe, and the lox doesn't smell ""fishy"") and the portions aren't stingy either.  The real problem is the service. The owner doesn't smile much, but is polite. His staff on the other hand is surly and unprofessional  even if you make sure they are watching when you drop some cash in the tip jar.  I went in there a few minutes after pm and asked if it was possible to still get the lox bagel. The cashier glared at me a barked ""no breakfast!"" Ok, no problem, just asking. Disappointing, but I understand. So I order the BLT with avocado, which was great, but after paying and sitting down, I noticed that the chalkboard had a lox sandwich special for lunch! Wtf? Is it too much of a strain to politely tell the customer that no, we aren't serving that breakfast item, but we are serving something that is % the EXACT same thing as a lunch special? If that's the case, I think that putting my hard earned cash into the tip jar might be a bit too much of a strain on my part.  Regardless of the rotten service and FiDi level prices, the patio tables and the tasty, fresh food will keep me coming back. I work nearby, so this is often the default lunch place. VERY up and down. The food is pretty consistently decent, but the espresso drinks vary wildly depending on who's mixing . . . the owner does a good job, but the staff turnaround is high, and I don't think they are trained well. There was one guy who always had everything cleaned up and ready to close  minutes before they actually closed  he was really grumpy when I would then show up, and he'd then have to make me a latte and  clean up again . . . Dude! Close when your sign says you close, and then clean up! I think he's gone now though . . . I like this place because you can sit outside and watch the world go by (or at least all the people making the trek up to Coit Tower).  I've only had breakfast and coffee here, but both have been good and the price is right. A lot of people from work walk over here for lunch.  It's descent, but nothing special.  It was nice sitting outside, but it took awhile to get our food.  Very relaxed atmosphere. . . On average there is one person out of four at our table who doesn't really like what they got. I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  The food is always great and so reasonably priced.  I also love the fact that it's a block away and a spot unknown to all the tourists down at Pier .  I always order the tuna salad sandwich, and my boyfriend consistently gets the BLT (they never skrimp on the bacon).  The salads always look amazing, but I'm too hooked on the tuna to order anything different.  The food comes out very quickly, surprisingly since the place is so small.  I tend to stray away on the weekends because the experience is ten times better during the week! we have been living near this cafe for almost  years and we get our coffees here every morning. the food is consistent no matter who is behind the counter, maybe a little too consistent since they never change or update the menu with the exception of the daily soups. the tables outside are great on a sunny day. . . so drop by and order their chicken parmesan foccacia. kinda/sorta hidden away, far enough from the tourists so it's always nice and quiet. the sandwiches are great and decently priced. coffee is good as well. not much people watching, but if you're into that walk a couple blocks up to see all the people from arkansas ambling around the wharf These reviews are all over the place, with one slamming the food right before another praising it.  I think the problem boils down to *service*.  If you're lucky enough to go when some of the best employees are working, they will make sure that your experience is great. The rest of the time, you'll be disappointed.  It's a tough place to go with expectations!  Staff turnover here is really high, which isn't always the owners fault  some folks work here planning to be short timers.  Heather (the redhead) used to be great, but I think she's gone walkabout in Australia for a while.  Grumpus in the morning never smiles, but the coffee is always fresh and hot and she's efficient at keeping the line short during the morning rush.  But the two boys in the afternoon are slobs and a bit lazy  once I went in late in the day and *every* coffee dispenser was empty; they just hadn't paid attention to keeping them filled! So, with all of that in mind, I do love to come to Cafe Francisco for a cup of coffee, to grab a newspaper, and watch the world go by.  There's no better place north of Washington Square to do that. The chai had a slight band aid flavor. I'll be here more often now that I've taken a good look at the salads they serve and wished I had ordered them all.  My sandwiches are always delicious.  Easy going in the daytime. Cafe tables outside. My kind of place. Although. . . one block away. . . Some gnarly guy and his bony, crack ho girlfriend tip toed up behind me and touched my head!  I nearly lost it! When I wheeled around my Philly came out and I went to punch him but he beat a hasty retreat. All I could say was 'who the F are you?' over and over. They began raving about conspiracies and taunting me for thinking THEY were they crazy ones. I think they thought I was Donald Rumsfeld or something. Not that I look anything like him. If homeless people continue to accost me on the street I might have to invent a 'bum repellent'. Problem is: what can I use to offend the nose of a bum? They can out stink an angry skunk drowning in a port a potty. I've seen flies do a  when entering their air space.  I don't need to smell that particular eau de no chateau. What to do? This is THE place for lunch for us folks who work at the Academy of Art near Pier . Most of the restaurants / cafes in the neighborhood (by the Pier) are overpriced, have crappy food or more likely are both crappy and overpriced ~ as is usual for tourist trap destinations. All the food here is very fresh (the first most important thing). The lunchtime salads, soups and sandwiches are very tasty, interesting combos, large portions and reasonably priced. Service is fast and efficient ~ also crucial for work time lunches (although sometimes grouchy family stuff I think ; )The Greek Salad and the Mediterranean Salad Plate are both large, fresh and rich in dolmas, feta, olives and the like. . . My favorite lunch is the / sandwich // cup of soup combo. The soups here are delicious and dependable. The half sandwich is usually served on small pieces of bread as a ""whole"" sandwich and can include any of their wonderful sandwich choices. Their Garden Vegetarian sandwich is perfect avocado, hummus, peppers and more yummy stuff. I usually order it on the sourdough which is the real deal (from a bakery) and not the pre sliced crap often served at sandwich places. I pair this up with a small soy chai latte and I'm good. Sitting outside in the warm weather is always nice. I wish they would offer a half salad / soup option or even just a half salad option since their salads are too big for me. But they won't budge on this for some reason. They do have a smaller garden salad, though. I've only tried a couple of the breakfast items the French toast was too sweet and the omelette was just okay. Come here Monday  Friday for lunch and odds are there will be one or two people from my office sitting next  to you. you can sit by the window with a hot cup of frothy coffee . . . . . and a book people watching or immersing yourself in what you have bought to read. The food is generally pretty good . . the pancakes are delicious. . . the french toast was just a bit to sweet for me ! I think what i really like about this place is the unobtrusive feel it has to it. Very similar to a european cafe. Some staff are better than others so if you have weird service the first time dont let it put you off. There are also tables outside for when the sun is shining. m! pancakes When I first moved to SF in , I used to live half a block away from Cafe Francisco.  It was convenient.   They served decent coffee, had a few tables outside where one could read the paper and just relax, especially on a warm and Sunny saturday morning. Their breakfast food was ok. . . nothing extraordinary, though.  I'd give them .  stars, but I'm feeling generous today. I go here for lunch at least once a week.  So far I have not been disappointed.  The menu seems very accomodating (I am VEGAN) given the availability of a greek salad (minus the feta) and a falafel sandwich. The olives on the salad were outstanding  always a good measure of restaurant quality IMO.  The yellow split pea soup is also outstanding on days when they make it.  I love food and stuffing myself so much that I sometimes get a bowl of split pea and a whole falafel sandwich.  (Total cost is still under $ for that enormous meal. ) The portions are totally adequate for normal people. I work nearby and when I first started going here, I loved it. . . but as time went on, the lil cafe seemed to know they were not in danger of being taken over by a Starbucks and things began to slip.   The staff seemed to change every month and the coffee got worse and worse.  The prices also soon went up and the quality went down.  $.  for a lox bagel at a lil walk up cafe?  Or for  eggs and toast? (no potatoes)  Come ON!  The manager does pace around a lot like he is the bouncer of some hip club. This used to be my favorite lunch spot but now I only go there if I am tired of the other local choices.  Please bring back the old Francisco's! I really like this place as a lunch spot.  The food (the few times I've been there) has been consistently good I have yet to experience the missing ingredients.  They play old jazz, and the staff is really nice.  Plus, they sell the NY Times right by the register. The owner dude needs to stop pacing around in the dining area, though.  He makes me kinda tense. When I lived nearby, this was one of my favorite little spots. It's the kind of place where the food is so so but the sodas are cold and cast off newspapers always abound. You can't really go wrong, whatever you choose from the menu. In all honesty, though, whatever you choose from the menu, they're bound to be out of at least one key ingredient. I love the building, but on several important fronts it doesn't provide: the food is so so, the coffee is so so, it takes forever to get your order, and there's no wi fi (last checked July ) this place doesnt have a huge menu and its kind of small, but its a really cute little neighborhood cafe to grab coffee or a light breakfast or lunch.  they have outside seating which is great when its sunny. You know the ""good on paper, bad in bed"" guys?  This is like the cafe version.  I was excited when I ordered my Garden Vegetarian sandwich listed with hummus and other veggie goodies, but in reality there was so little ""meat"" to it, plus it was overwhelmed by the huge (and very hard) focaccia bread slices. . . and I love focaccia bread.  I also had a cup of carrot ginger soup which did not have much kick to it.  Do not be seduced by the menu.  It all sounds good, but disappoints in the end. Decent coffee, wi fi, locals, the Chronicle and quiet.  Just sit back and relax. Cool little cafe near north beach and pier . They make great medit. food (salads are awesome) and sandwiches are yummy. Cool crowd. Nice location and decor. Not too expensive."|4|94|2|Routine| Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils  [ date violation corrected: 11/20/2012 ] Inadequately cleaned or sanitized food contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 3/14/2012 ]

Pizza is always fresh and warm. Guys are very nice and friendly. Also, I am absolutely addicted to their mozzarella sticks. I am drooling thinking about it right now! Definitely check it out if you are looking for fast, cheap food :) I live right around the corner at Tower  and order here pretty much   times a week for these simple reasons:. Their mild chicken wings with ranch are to DIE FOR!! . Their delivery time is beyond fast, last time I ordered, it took them  minutes exactly to get to my door since I hung up the phone. . Their pizza boy Paul is extremely gracious, very engaging, and offers friendly personable customer service.

[ of  YELP CHALLENGE ] I used the eat  app and was not happy with my order. The sandwich I ordered had beef instead of chicken on it and they didn't even bring the salad I had paid for. Unfortunately, I will not be ordering from here again. I noticed the owner purposely hires and employs undocumented Mexican immigrants for cheap labor. also these workers don't wash their hands prior to making pizza. not very sanitary. I would go to other pizza parlors. Made the mistake of ordering from here a second time. Whoever thinks this is good pizza has no idea what a pizza should taste like. Its too chewy anf bland. The ingredients they use are of inferior quality. Even the sides i order, jalapeno poppers and wings were terrible. Please do yourself a favor and order from somewhere else. Just around the corner from Wilson and Wilson. Pizza is sold by the slice  large slices! Fast and filling for a late night snack after hitting the bars. As easy as one two three. One Milan down in the Mission: yelp. com/biz/milan pizza…Two producers to create this classic: youtube. com/watch?v=zqN…Three stars for a slice of cheese that satisfied the wallet ($. ) and the stomach (generous in size and quite like the doughy crust everyone else complains about). Know your Milans. And know your ABCs: youtube. com/watch?v=M aS… I really wanted to like this place because it's convenient for me, but as other reviewers have said, the crust is too thick and doughy. I ordered a slice of the pesto. I ate it because I was starving after work, but it tasted mediocre at best. Also, FYI, bring cash. There's a  cent charge if you use a credit card for a purchase under $. pizza was good, hours were good, but place was compacted, dirty and needs a good scrub down. Yes, the Pizza is overly ""bready""/doughy/chewy.  This being said, I'm curious to know why the owners don't simply take the bad reviews here and change the recipe?  I ordered a small veggie pizza, it definitely wasn't spit it out on the floor gross, but the crust simply kills any potential. I also ordered the Jalapeno Poppers.  I completely understand the risks of ordering an item like this through delivery, but damn they really messed them up.  They were (surprise) strangely ""bready"", cold and overall not very enjoyable to eat. Waited exactly  minutes.  Altogether I paid around . .  I'd be lying if I said it was worth it. I ordered delivery tonight from here. . . I live one block down on o'farrell so you could walk to my place. I get a call an hour after ordering from some guy Imcan barely understand telling me to come downstairs. Ive got a foot injury which is why I ordered delivery in the first place so this defeated the whole purpose. . . plus Ive never had anyone refuse to deliver food to my apartment. The guy called me again because I wasnt moving fast enough for him so I checked him and told hime he needed to cool his heels. When I got downstairs this guy was pulling my food out of the dirty trunk of his car. I told him Id never had such poor delivery service and he had the nerve to give me attitude. I hope he enjoys eating that pizza. Ive eaten here for years but Ill never spend any money with this business again. Overly doughy, chewey base, very little sauce and gross cheese. Better then nothing in this area, I guess, at  a. m. Someone from this restaurant illegally entered my apartment building to put their advertisements on everyone's doorknob. STAY OUT OF MY BUILDING. IT'S TRESPASSING. This place serves the best pizza I've eaten in my entire life. You can get a specialty huge slice of pizza with a generous amount of toppings for only $. . Highly recommend everyone to eat here at least once. Good pizza. Slow service. . . but friendly Italian pizza man.

Milan Pizza 1|3.5|Pizza in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|195|1|3.06666666667| OK pizza.  HORRIBLE service. We waited  minutes for a pizza because they burned it the first time. Fine. Mistakes happen. At least offer a drink while we wait. When this mediocre pizza finally arrived,  the guy sat it down on the table and could not get away from our table fast enough. It was as if the presence of dissatisfied customers made them uncomfortable so they handled it by ignoring us. The nerve of us. Also, they looked like they might have roaches. Find some where else to eat. Cheaper ingredients? Shame! Pepperoni pizza delivered at midnight to our hotel room.  Good price, very convenient, and tasty pizza that was also good as a cold breakfast the next day. Great small pizza joint.  Large slices for $. . The owners of this pizza joint are smart. Why is that?(a) They are one of the only places open until  a. m. on Fridays and Saturdays. (b) They are located near hostels and several blocks away from bars and clubs(c) And they serve mediocre, doughy, fluffy pizza. Because they can!However, it's better than nothing when you're out late and you're hungry. Waiting for the drawing for the Lottery tickets at the Curran Theater a young male usher told me the pizza across the street is just ok & Milan Pizza is better so after not getting tickets to the BOM I had a quick, cheap dinner at Milan Pizza. They have ready made pizza so if you just want some slices they will heat it up for you.  I got a Slice of Pesto $.  with tax $. .  It's really  small slices, so it's filling.  Credit card minimum is $, so I paid CASH. I ate my  slices which they call  slice at the counter, but there are some tables/chairs in the back. I noticed lots of take out orders & delivery. Really great pizza! Loved it. Got a supreme pizza to go and it was about as good as a pizza can get. Reasonably priced & friendly service too! halloween weekend,  am  my friends and i were hongray!! thank goodness we could count on milan pizza!these owners are smart. i bet they make a lot of good money off drunken food deliveries on the weekends. even better? it's easy to meet the minimum delivery fee (basically you just have to order a medium or large pizza, which corresponds to about   slices). the extra perk is that the pizza is actually something i'd eat sober  it's delicious without swimming in grease/lord knows what else. SUPER HOLE IN THE WALLBUT! If I am coming from a comedy show or any late night and need some garlic pesto in my life I will head over to the TL for some entertainment and damn good pizza! To my tastes, this Palestinian run, family eatery serves, hands down, the best pizza in the Tenderloin/Tendernob area. And while I do consider it very good quality pizza, typically I'd consider four stars fair enough for what you get, but in this case I just gotta bump it up an extra star for excellent, friendly customer service as well as fair prices ($.  for a large cheese slice usually hits the spot for me). As a regular patron I will say that every worker there is honest, positive, hard working and always there to greet you with a smile. Once I forgot my wallet and Mohammad even trusted me to pay them next time  now how often does that happen in this city, especially in the TL? In my experience, almost never. Keep up the great work gentlemen! The most discusting pizza ever! Could not even finish the one slice. Greasy, and ingredients were definitely not fresh. HORRIBLE! I wish i could give zero stars. As another reviewer posted I wish I could give ZERO stars.  DO NOT GO TO THIS PIZZA PLACE.  I ordered two slices, one was fresh out of the oven but was very thick, doughey, oily, and overall just NOT GOOD PIZZA.  What made this place ZERO stars was the nd piece i ordered.  It had been sitting out for who knows how long so they placed it into the over to re heat.  DID nothing and when I got home (had ordered pizza to go) the piece was COLD and cheese was hard.  The was the pizza nasty piping hot, imagine how it tasted as i attempted to eat it cold.  SICK.  Threw both slices away.  Should of known by looking at the pieces through the glass.  If you like thick, oily, flavorless, pizza, go here.  If not, please go somewhere else. I am only visiting San Francisco, but after spending an hour online reading reviews of pizza places I ordered from here. The pizza was great! The delivery was an hour, which was when they said it would be and although a little on the colder side, what can you expect when it probably took  minutes to deliver to me. Overall, liked it alot and was pleased with service. Pizza was okay if anything. I enjoyed the toppings, the problem was that the crust was to chewy and it had more of a loaf taste too it. The mild buffalo wings lacked flavor. Taste was something out of a Chinese restaurant. Will try out the other pizza parlors in the area. Hope is not lost Very average pizza :( and when I say a pizza place is average that is not a good thing.|4|94|3|Routine| Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 3/19/2013 ] Wiping cloths not clean or properly stored or inadequate sanitizer  [ date violation corrected: 3/19/2013 ] Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils  [ date violation corrected: 3/19/2013 ]
Milan Pizza 2|3.5|Pizza in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|195|2|3.31578947368|" You and I both know this place only has business because it is the only place open at am. They must make an assload since they were fucking packed and I drunkenly threw all my cash on the counter and said I WANT THIS MANY PIZZAS. It's alright if you need something late night and quick. Crust could be better. Late night and hungry for what I was reading was fast delivery. The guy could barely speak or understand what I was saying which became redundant and nerve racking. I hate repeating myself more than  times in an order need I mention about . Never again there are always other options. Then I hang up after not finishing the order and they still have the nerve to deliver. Business must be bad for them. He keeps banging and waiting outside my room for like  minutes. GO AWAY. . . . . . Desperate for a quick buck I was gonna give him a tip for effort but he was off the chain annoying. Some of the best pizza I have ever tasted.  Absolutely delicious and fresh. I'll give this place benefit of the doubt, maybe I ordered the wrong specialty pizza. I live across from this place so I really want to love it hahaOrdered the San Francisco "",  slices. More than enough for  people. $ pickup. Can't beat that! Ok so maybe the pizza was too meaty. . is that even a thing? Yeah I'll give one of their veggie pizzas a try and do an update. The Greek or Mediterranean maybe. There was nothing wrong with it, just underwhelmed. Qualtiy of the ingredients was good. Crust prob average. I can say though that's it's better than Pizza Hut! First, they took an hour and  minutes to deliver after quoting   min (strike ).  Then they delivered the wrong pizza (strike ).  The wings tasted like they came from a frozen tyson bag (strike ).  Horrible.  The pizza was ok itself.  Just not impressed. I totally approve of this place. Best pizza and chicken wings. I love the staff so friendly . I was pleasantly surprised. The BBQ chicken pizza was very good. They also make the best ranch.  I love this place. RECOMMENDED ;) We went here because our hostel was around the corner and had this place listed on the Late Night restaurants board. The staff was nice enough, and we took our pizza to go. It wasn't that great a pizza, something didn't taste right about the cheese, maybe they use a special blend instead of just mozzarella. We were exhausted from exploring the city though and it was better than nothing. If I were in the city again, I would go somewhere else for pizza. No handwashing here.  I wish I could write a more in depth review, but that is all I have to say.  They don't wash the paws before working with your pizza dough.  The pizza was not really great.  It was okay, and next to our hotel. I am a fan of the Mild chicken wings here !! I have ordered a few times and the flavors are always spot on!Minus   stars because the pizza can be a bit dough y but some people like that. the spicy wings are not that good because they are smothered in sauce and taste soggy but the mild ones are super nice and crispy chill place, they let us bring our beer in. get the roast beef sandwich. I eat walk in pizza because i work across the street, I've never tried the delivery, but I can say that the pizza when i get there is always fresh and delicious, its my favorite in the entire Tender Knob region, and the guys are all real friendly (maybe because by now they know my face!) They have coupons on their website that they don't require you to print out to use.  Free delivery too!  We opted for the large pizza,  wings and a  liter for $.  I asked for pesto on the ""San Francisco"" instead of the red sauce it comes with but realized they put it on the veggie ones for a reason.  I couldn't tell there was pesto past the pepperoni, bacon and beef.  It also had just enough feta to be able to list it in the ingredients. Everything was evenly layered on a doughy crust.  The cheese remains the same for the first day then takes on an iridescent, rubber consistency.  This isn't the best leftover pizza. The spicy wings, which were not spicy or very good, tasted like the frozen Tyson wings you find at Safeway but only if they're partially cooked.  Toss those bad boys in the pizza oven please!It's not the best, or the worst  but I would be willing to go here beyond the late night stumble (they're open till  am). Hands down the best slice in the TL. It's one of the better cheap pizza palaces in the area, but it can be a bit shady at times.  For some reason they have a bunch of guys hanging around who are ""working"" but not really doing anything.  One time I called in an order and they totally forgot that I had placed the order. Big slices, friendly guys who work there. Open really late. WOW. Delicious pizza. I had a slice of their mushroom and sausage pizza, and melted. Granted, I had in me a few cocktails thanks to Yelp Drinks and was famished after a busy day of no food, but the taste was pure heaven, clouded judgment or not. Definitely a great place to stop in after a late night carousing around town or simply for a quick fix. Better service and cleanliness could have lended them a better rating, but hey, it's pizza by the slice for goodness' sakes, so that's arguably unimportant anyway. If you're looking for a good slice of pizza in the area, Milan is a solid choice. You'd probably give it   stars if you were drunk. But I was sober, and I'd only come here if I was in the area or looking for a drunken th meal. The pizza is good. . . and they are open really late!  THere's nothing like pizza at am after a long night of dancing!"|4|88|3|Routine| Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities  [ date violation corrected: 9/13/2012 ] Inadequately cleaned or sanitized food contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 9/13/2012 ] Improper thawing methods   [ date violation corrected: 9/13/2012 ]
Milan Pizza 3|3.5|Pizza in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|195|3|3.45263157895|" I have been here a couple times now and ive yet to be impressed, but it's cheap and im usually wasted. I wouldn't recommend coming here unless you've had a lot to drink. You can always count on Milan Pizza to be open for late night eats!  I came here after a night out and got  huge slices of the combo for $. . . it was so god!  For the price, hours, and level of yum factor. . . it gets a  stars! This review is for their delivery on eathours. com and they give back cashcoupon!I've ordered from here a few times already. It's one of the better pizza places on the website. They have a ++ deal ( medium,  toppings,  liter soda) for . . The dough is soft and their crust is a medium thickness. The last order from here was mushroom+artichoke and chicken+bacon (it's canadian) pizzas. The pizzas were both hot and fresh when they arrived. The delivery guy forgot the salad but said he would come back. And he actually did! I recently had a terrible customer service experience here. It was weird because they are usually so nice here.  Was it different because I came in with guys?Anyways, came in here with my boyfriend and another friend.  The pizza guys spent  minutes talking to and flirting with an extremely intoxicated tourist.  It was really frustrating because they literally ignored us for way too long.  We are regular customers and really didn't appreciate this level of unprofessionalism.  I really like the food here, but I haven't been back since. As much as I am being a pain and complaining, I am INCREDIBLY ECSTATIC THAT AT AM, someone would deliver a pizza to us in the Fillmore. Yay! Pizza will be here in  minutes?! CLAPS IN JOY!However, it wasn't that great of a pizza. It looks appetizing and feels as if it could be, but in actuality, it is mostly bread. Most of it was heavy starchy bread. Toppings were alright. We went with the salami, pepperoni, and sausage mess. Ingredients were fine, nothing super fresh or noteworthy. It was super cheap though. They are definitely between a   star right now. Until I find someone else who will deliver to us that late. . . Came here for lunch, got a slice of pepperoni, sausage and jalepenos and a medium soda for  bucks straight up!  Awesome.  The pizza had a great crispy crust and the toppings were ample.  After trying a bunch of pizza places around my office, I think I've found the one to go to when I'm craving a slice.  Guy at the counter was really friendly too! We got a pepperoni pizza tonight, on Christmas. They were open which was amazing, but they delivered to our hotel room and the pizza was fantastic! Excellent pizza  made New York style. Service is friendly and fast. Came in for a slice late night  probably around  or : AM on Friday November th, . Waited a few minutes in line  behind a few drunk customers who appeared to be coming from a club (most of the crowd appeared to be somewhat buzzed) while I was sober. As I walked up to the counter  a pizza was coming out of the oven with numerous toppings. It appears they bake numerous types of slices on one pie  and then cut it up. I selected the combo slice  and it was immediately plated. The slice while thick and big; was one of the greasiest slices I have had in my mouth. Cheese didn't stick overally well to the slice and appeared to fall off rather quickly. Found it favorable compared to Rotana  which is around the corner. Will have to try it buzzed next time. Great pizza but wish they were actually open during the times they say they are. . . Taste:Value:Cleanliness: Atmosphere:Wait time:Overall: being the worst, and  being the bestCame here after a late night of partying in sf, its a good place for drunk food, but the place was a bit small. and almost no where to sit. we had to take it to go and eat in the car. I had a piece of pesto and combo, The pesto didnt have much pesto taste or flavor. the combo was good. I think its about .  a piece. big slices,the area is cool, I saw some guy smoke a blunt or big cigar and PTFO on the street, that was something new for me after a long night at the club Take it to go or for delivery. The place itself is super cramped and furthermore cramped in an iffy spot on Geary. The pizza: Soft, medium thickness crust, large cuts sold by the slice, moderate pie size altogether for a reasonable price. Atmosphere: A couple small tables stuffed in the back, and all the right ingredients that encourage you take your pizza with you. Try: Pesto pizzaSkip: Mozzarella sticks, too expensive for a bar style snack Food: The best by the slice pizza I've ever had.  The dough is perfectly baked so it's a little crispy on the outside and very soft on the inside. They are very generous with the toppings. The cheese is perfectly melted, not sloppy or dry. Price: $.  gets you a very large and filling pizza slice with a lot of toppings.  They have a stupid $ rule on credit cards but the pizza more than makes up for it. Space/Service: The space is small, you're better off with delivery/take out.  The service is quick and friendly. Nothing beats late night cravings like a hot slice of mushroom pizza.  And Milan's makes one that will fill you up and satisfy you. Pizza is not bad, but the service is TERRIBLE. One word answers without explanations. Overpriced menu items. Dirty bathroom. If service is important to you, I suggest you go elsewhere. Would not recommend. yay drunk pizza! i mean really if you're not drunk and looking for some munchies post the TL bars you probably don't need to be going to Milan pizza but if you are in that particular situation it's quite good, at least until the morning. Ordered a California pizza for delivery. Took an hour instead of half an hour. Was the most doughy, bread y, piece of shit pizza ever. Grease seeping through the box. Crust as thick as breadsticks and twice as dry. The meat was old and overcooked. The sauce to cheese ratio was right but everything else completely blowed. Can't believe people like this place. Disgusting. Amazing place, cheap delicious pizza, its hott and all you need is exact change. The guys are cool dudes, i've never felt uncomfortable, they give you a box for your slice and they warm it up for you. It worth the stop. I always get Pepperoni for about . , worth it, its delicious. Pick up  slices, one for today and microwave the next one tomorrow! great lunch also, it fills you up and the slices are huge! Nice little gem. I live in the hood and this is the best pizza by far. They're also open til bartime, which is very convenient! They always have fresh pies coming out of the oven and keep their work area pretty clean, especially compared to the other pizza spots in the TL. It's not fancy, but definitely good enough! the pizza is decent for how late its open for delivery (am a lot of the time)but it's not great Good pizza if you live around the area. Be aware that they charge .  cents for credit card purchases under ten dollars. Pizza is nothing special, but good if you're a student or drunk hostel goer in the area. SO god!!Greasy, but soo yummy!Not the best spot to dine in at, so delivery is your best bet. Wish I still lived in the city to get some more! Best cheap and fast pizza I have seen so far on my route back from work! Rodney King here with your triple play by play,layin it down like peperoni, pineappz and jalepeno! Bros, hookin it up, Vin Diesel rippin up fast and the furious ,finished with red pepper flakes, parmesan and a weird memory of passing out on Geary st after an all night San Pelligrino binge. decently delicious pizza with a one two three times a lady in the makin. One star because of their service, and for ripping me off.  I spent $ through KGB for a $ voucher for a slice of pizza and a can soda. They gave me fountain soda instead, but that's not a big deal to me. But then, they said to pay $. I was like, what. . . I already paid for the $ voucher online. Why should i pay another $. They wouldn't budge. Rip off! I plan to use that coupon again to get the most from my purchase!  They're not honoring the voucher the way it should. For a late night pizza place, Milan pizza is great. Comparing it to some of the best pizza i've ever had, I can't say it is in competition. The pizza overall is good though. They generally have  types of pizza ready for you, some of them I remember are: Hawaiian, meat lovers, pepperoni, cheese, and veggie. I've been there a few times and have tried the first three. The slices are large and filling, and the price is good (I think a couple bucks for a slice). The crust is crunchy and they use the right proportion of crust, cheese, and sauce. However, whenever I eat a pizza from here I just feel like it needs more flavor. I'm not quite sure what it is missing but if they figured that part out, they would have one of the best pizzas i've ever had. Maybe it is as simple as some salt. . . I don't know. Milan Pizza is open until am I believe, which is great for the late night bar hoppers getting out of the last bar of the night. Its OK Pizza not great!  Price was a little. . . i mean STEEP, however the size of the slice is massive.  Combo slice from Costco is better than here and the price. . . WHOA! and you get a drink, lol!  Better than Papa JJohn, Pizza Hut and Dominos, but I've had better. Late night pizza place is also a good thing. I picked up a KGB Deals coupon for a slice and pop at Milan Pizza for $.  I decided to head over for lunch yesterday with my coupon in tow. The guy behind the cash could use a lesson in being a bit more friendly and service oriented but the pizza was definitely worth the trip there.  The slices are a bit small in comparison with other slice places I've been to but the price is quite a bit lower as well.  They had a few flavours to choose from, I decided to stay simple and go with the cheese pizza.  Lots of cheese, a good amount of sauce, it was definitely a very tasty lunch.  Not a lot of pop selection I found, but I was happy with the blue raspberry crush (I've never seen that flavour before!)Not a bad place to grab a quick lunch when you're on the run.  And the coupon definitely made it worth it!  Would happily go back to pay regular price for a slice of pizza and drink! So I purchased a $ voucher on kgbdeals that was supposed to include a slice of pizza and soda. Verbatim ""Satisfy your cravings with today's oven crisped kgbdeal: $ for a slice of pizza and canned soda at Milan Pizza (worth $). ""Now, clearly, it does not specify what type of slice. So, I go in thinking I have a $ credit  cool. I get a ham and pineapple pizza for my other half and produce the voucher. ""That will be $. "" Uh. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Huh?? I fork over the $ and then scrutinize the menu. Now, the menu says $.  for a slice of cheese. . . . . each additional item is $. . . . so in all my pizza slice, being the two extra toppings, could not have cost more than $. . . . . A can of soda (which was blazing hot because the 'cooler' did anything but that,) was $. . . . . I know I am no mathematician BUT I do know that $.  plus $.  is undoubtedly under $. . . I also know that there's no way in hell that $ is going to be the amount on tax. Obviously, the genius working behind the cash register read my ""$ for a slice and soda"" as only $ worth of credit towards a pizza. Maybe before they issue vouchers they should uhm. . tell their employees how to handle it?! I guess the pizza tasted good so they got a star for that. . . otherwise they would have definitely only got one star. BOO TO Malin. Milan Pizza is the place for a late night slice.  Hands down.  The pizza is downright good  excellent medium thick crust with tasty sauce (just the right amount of seasoning) and the Italian Sausage in particular is a winner for toppings.  Is it the best pizza in the city?  No, absolutely not.  But it is definitely the best pizza in the tenderloin/union square/nob hill area at  am.  I can't speak to the rest of their menu  they do burgers, sandwiches, etc/ in addition to pizza, but why buy a burger from a pizza joint?   stars from me for the pizza and the late night hours. This is one of my tried and true pizza places in the city. Of course, I haven't tried too many others, but out of what few I have I keep coming back to Milan. I've only been inside a couple of times, and nowadays I only order for delivery. I always get the Greek Special, and it's always the same Greek Special yum that it was before. They get to me within the allotted amount of time, and the delivery guys are always polite. I've also tried their mozzarella sticks and french fries, which, separately, are pretty friggin delicious for mozzarella sticks and french fries. Eaten together, however, they may or may not create 'splosions in your gut of the painful variety, because they are the fried foods that they are. In any case, they're pretty good and it probably won't hurt you to try them. They serve some yummy foods. Not the best, but it's convenient. Really doughy crust which is good in my opinion but sort of lacking flavor. Overall it's good in a jam. We spent some time here waiting for some friends of ours. There is usually a soccer game playing with a crowd watching intently. The interior is nothing special but it is something to write about. As we were sitting there, you could hear water dropping slowly into a bucket. The bucket was by the cash register. A little while later the crack in the ceiling started letting more water through, almost as if the source above had a reason to let more water out (a shower, a toilet, etc are all that came to mind). Sadly we saw this as we left :( Not very good. Didn't taste terrible but was close. The place delivers until am, what's not to like about that? I always order their $.  large one topping special with pesto. The service is quick and pizza above average. We went here for a carry out diner on our last night in SF.  It was delicious, just as expected from the reviews.  Good, fresh crust, tasty sauce, hit the spot for a pizza craving.  The guys that were working were very friendly and our order was ready quickly.  Id' prefer to give them .  stars, as it was better than , but just under my faves back home :) Was walking from a bar to my hotel late one night when I wanted some food to supplement the early dinner that I had eaten.  For no real reason other than because it was nearby, we chose this place.  The best thing about having no expectations is that there can be pleasant surprises.  The pizza was warm and the pepperoni wasn't the cheap stuff that a lot of places use.  There was copious amounts of cheese on the crust and. . . need anything more be said?  Lots of cheese! I spend way too much of my life in Milan Pizza  but for $.  it really is the best cheese slice around. Service is always friendly too  big bonus I visited here over this past weekend.  It was one of the only places open near our hotel late Saturday night.  We were starving so we decided to give it a try.  The pizza  was surprisingly good!  Crispy crust and flavorful.  I got something with Basil pesto and tomatoes. . . tasty!  The slices were of generous size also.  Service was really nice too.  Very friendly for it being so busy and late at night.  We got some mozzarella sticks to go and unfortunately passed out in the hotel room before we got to try them.  However, we did eat them the next morning cold and it was still pretty delicious. I have eaten my fair share of slices from cities around the world, and it always surprised me how lacking SF pizza was.  Mr. Pizzaman and Pronto being the staple late night deliveries. . Once you put the bong down, you realize. . this stuff tastes like crap. I finally came to my senses and moved to the TL. . and found Milan pizza on my way home from work one night.  Oh my gosh, this is the best pizza I have had since NYC or Chicago. . Finally someone is getting it right in the neighborhood.  Mystic treated me well for many years, but I don't find myself in Lower Haight that much any more. . Milan delivers fast and hot. . Good stuff Awesome pizza after a night of drinking and puking. Thank goodness for my girlfriends for not listening to me that night. I was wasted as usual on our first bachelorette party night. Friends would not get me my onion rings from Mel's Diner so after  rounds in the bathroom, I finally came to my senses and ate a slice of this beautiful pizza. It was tasty alright. Credit to Milan for making me feel better with its greasy goodness but the pizza was actually even better a day old. This is a review of delivery from Milan Pizza (San Francisco). I was not very impressed. Philly Steak Sandwich  the beef had a burnt flavor and was relatively dry. The roll was pretty good. There was very little cheese. The fries were average. Garlic Bread w/ Melted Cheese  the garlic bread was dry, hard, and cold. Calzone with Pepperoni, Salami, Mushrooms  the crust was actually pretty nice. The ""toppings"" were good but there was little cheese. There was not any sauce in the calzone and the side of sauce was a very small amount only filling about half of the small plastic cup. Delivery was a little long. I consider anything over an hour long. In the case, it was about an hour and twenty minutes. This was  minutes past the estimated time. The delivery person was polite and professional. Milan PizzaSFFriday December ,  StarsDisclaimer: NYE is never really a good time to judge food.  It was the first place we saw so we ate there.  They just heated up some slices that were sitting out a little to long.  It was cheap: $.  for a cheese pizza slice.  The Waterboy with Adam Sander was playing on the TV. they should change their name from Milan Pizza to Good F*ckin Pizza! and that's saying alot coming from someone that only likes pizza when he's drunk. Good pizza and great guys! Big slices, great toppings and pretty fresh! Debit/credit $ minimum keeps this from  stars  one $.  slice is enough! Coke and a slice, guy! I am giving it three stars because their sauce has flavor, they do not skimp on the toppings, they are open very late and the single slices are huge. I did encounter a penny in my pizza one night and no doubt from some drunken fool that maybe chucked a bunch of change in the air. The dough is a bit too thick for my liking but overall, I never experienced it undercooked or burnt. They are very friendly and accomodating toward not only the derelicts in the neighborhood but also the vegatarian, drug addicted, retarded hipsters. My only dissapointment is that the Palistinian family that ran it before, left. Best Shawirma (oops, don't know how to spell it), I have ever had. It was the Mother's family recipe and it was off the hook, amazing. Her son had to call her down to make one anytime it was ordered (she wouldn't even give her recipe to her son :) Basically as for Pizza Milano, it was the only Pizza option in my neighborhood that was passable/not highway robbery and open late night. I work nights so. . . .  it worked for me at that time! Almost a year later. . . second verse, same as the first. Night out drinking. Brilliant idea to order pizza. Orders an entire pie and two extra slices. And, root beer. Comes back to hotel and shares the pizza with others. Result: heartburn but not as much regret as last time. For me. I didn't experience a coyote morning. My eating partners, however, were not so lucky.  They experienced: exclamations of private moments (and parts), spilled pie, heartburn (natch), threats of bodily harm, angry texts and e mails. . . It's amazing what this pizza does to people. so good. you'll s^&$ your pants to get some. Yum!  This has to be the best late night pizza I've found in the city, and for dirt cheap.  Plus every time I go in the guys behind the counter are super nice (and patient when I can't decide what I want due to that last drink at the bar).  Love it :) I was excited about pizza.  I was excited about this pizza.  But then. . . Does there always have to be a ""but then. . . ""?See, I'm an EA, which is a pretty way of saying, I'm a secretary that's really, really good at my job.  And amongst my duties  I order food for our every other month staff meeting. My homeless youth services staff is woefully over worked and under paid.  And staff meeting is one of the very. . . VERY RARE times that they get anything other than a pat on the back for their very hard work. Let's be clear, we cater a lunch for our staff about  times a year. So, I thought. . . Pizza. . . everyone likes pizza.  After calling and getting a busy signal, I hoped online and used their online ordering system. . . GREAT!  Pizza. . . ordered. . . done.  I print off the confirmation and put it in my box of crap for staff meeting tomorrow. Now, one of the things I've learned in my job is:  you've always got to call.  On the day of a meeting, you call the other party to make sure it's on their calendar or in their book, on a post it taped to their windshield, written across their forehead. . . whatever. . . On the day that my pizza was supposed to be delivered, I called just after they opened. ""Hey,"" I said, ""I've got an order for  pizza's today at :pm.  I just wanted to make sure you had all the info you needed. ""The guy said that yea. . . he had my order.  Great!So then, I called back at :pm to ask, ""hey, my pizzas are late, and I've got a meeting starting in a few minutes for  people. ""  (if you do the math, you'll realize that my catering budget lets me buy them one. . . count em. . . one slice of pizza per staff member. )""Oh,"" says the guy on the phone who sounded suspiciously like the guy I talked to at noon, ""I don't have an order for  pizzas. ""I look at the confirmation sheet in my hand. ""But I have a confirmation sheet in my hand. """"The online system is down. """"I called two hours ago, and you said you had the order. """"I don't have your order. """"Okay, how fast can you fix this?  What time can I expect my pizza?""""Um. . . I have too many orders, so, I can't do it. ""So. . . f**k you, Milan Pizza, there's some social service kharma that's surely gonna come down on your hard. I live right next store to Milan and come here whenever I order pizza. Compared to most places in the city Milan is always fresh, tasty. and always hearty. The crust, sauce and cheese combonations are always perfect. The only downside to this place is individual slices they sit out, so order fresh! Their hours are awesome and the location is convienant to most people. Enjoy! Not very good. Good! my usual stop over after a night of a few drinks in the city. . . I discovered it while squintily eyed looking for a place to eat after Rye (or was it Ambassador. . . ), and found a place that has cheese that is thicker than the crust!Not a bad deal at all, and the slices are on the bigger side so the grease can help absorb that extra drink that you wish you didn't have so you could drive home. A good balance to a great night Just finished my pizza and I'm pleasantly surprised! I got a  topping (garlic, peperoni and spinach) medium pizza, garden salad and  sodas for $. The delivery guy was fast and my pizza was piping hot. The salad is big and fresh too. I was leary of the light orange tomatos, but they tasted amazing and figured, I'd rather have tasty tomatoes than pretty ones. I'm not sure what they call a medium, because I'm pretty sure I consider what they gave me to be a large pizza. They were generous on the toppings too. The only reason they get  stars instead of  is that their crust is nothing to write home about. While the sauce and ingredients are delish, the bread was just there not good not bad just bread. I would recommend them again adn now I have tons of left overs! It was a large portion of food. I expected smaller happy surprise. I've become even more familiar with nocternal eating habits as of late. I blame it on vacation and many a happy hour that turned into hours that turned into ""wtf? It's what time?"". I've been hanging with friends and Jones is my turning point. Left or right, cute or subtle, decisions are to be made on Geary. If its past the witching hour and I need to pop in some place for a minute to clear my head and fill my belly, I look no further than heading to the Milan of the TL (ha ha). While this place is handy, its not exactly a destination for late night delights. There's minimal seating inside and your choices for your by the slice purchases will vary. Plus the quality of the pizza is inconsistent in both tasty and texture. But for a food purchase under the five dollar mark its not too shabby. If you're going the full pizza route a small specialty will run you under $. Plus out of towners I've heard they aren't clueless twits when it comes to ordering for delivery to your hotel. Nothing deserving any over abundant praise but nothing I'd consider a last resort. An aok quick choice past midnight. I live next door to this place and glad i do! great pizza, good prices, never a long wait, open basically all the time. not much more i can say. reasons for not giving the fifth star? SOMETIMES the pizzas are inconsistent, they either taste ""best"" or ""very good"". never close to ""average"" though. also, sometimes when i walk by i notice only one or two pizzas ready. i assume the rest arent far away though, so no big deal. i dont care that theres only enough room for a small child inside the place ( seats max) cos im always on my way home anyway. just to throw a bit more praise at Milan, its one of the only places i will or want to order a strictly vegetarian pizza. even without meat on it, the amount of vegetables and cheese are yum e!! If it's late at night, you're starving, just happen to be walking by here and the only type of food you want is pizza this might be the place for you. Otherwise, go elsewhere. My pizza was average and nothing more. I've had worse and I've bought a frozen pizza that has been better. We ordered a pizza at pm. At : we called to see why it wasn't here and were told that the delivery guy locked his keys in his car and that the pizza would be here in a half hour. Were they going to bother to call and tell us this? It is now : and we still don't have a pizza. If it actually shows up and is the greatest pizza I've ever had, I'll update my review. But I doubt it. Pretty decent pizza, i live close by and its really convenient for me to just go grab a pizza after drinking, BOOZE AND PIZZA, without it, life has no meaning, I kid. The slices are pretty big, the place is really hot inside, i sorta almost feel bad for the guys that work there.  The skinny lanky gentlemen that works there is pretty humorous and nice, i always leave with a smile. i'd definitely come here again. oh yeah, they only have a few seatings and a bar type stool area. they take credit card but charge a couple of cent. Definitely San Francisco's best pizza place. It's cheap and delicious. I go there every time I go to the city. I highly recommend their famous ""Ja Pasta"" It is to die for. Its Feta cheese, pesto, and tomatoes. They also deliver and are open crazy late. after recently coming in from a long flight from Ft. Laud and a couple delicious cocktails at B&B, BF and I were famished and a wee bit too tipsy to get behind the wheel. Milan Pizza the rescue, huge slices, awesome crust, great sauce which make or break a pizza in my book. one lil thing is i noticed they used canned mushrooms which is a big no no but cant complain about any of the other veggies. + a couple waters and we were as good as new! wahoo! milan pizza, ohh what to say about this little pizza shop. good reasonable pricces, friendly service and late hours will definatey keep you coming back, the crowd that comes here are whats nice about the place; right after a nite out on tha town this is a usual spot for alot of SF residents, usually you'll see someone throwing up outside on the sidewalk or a big circle of strangers just conversing about how their night was. . . the pizza isnt going to win any awards but its delicious enough to keep on coming back. not going there in tha daytime tho, rather be there latenite I just ate here,yesterday night. . I think it was a quite delicious pizza. . and the slices were big enough to make you full. . i think i will go there again. . Great pizza! Delivered at am during our visit to San Francisco Today, almost a year after my first review, someone commented to say that ""Rush Hour to Treasure Island has no guarantee"" and ""if they make a mistake they will fix it"". I want to again reiterate that my initial order was placed at : PM which is by NO DEFINITION rush hour and at almost  O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING , they  still hadn't fixed the order or offered any acceptable remedy, brought a cold pizza, and didn't bring the entire order. Mahmood, if you'd like to sell your business as being customer oriented, respond prior to a year after the fact and don't ignore the facts of the situation. Moreover, if you want to say that ""Treasure Island delivery isn't guaranteed"", you should do so at the time of the order and only during rush hour. And perhaps you should look into what ""rush hour"" is defined as because it isn't after PM. You should also be aware of things such as ""google maps"" and ""traffic. com"" that allow people to look at traffic in the city and on the bridge so they can know quite clearly if you botched their order (like you did with us) or just hit traffic (which you didn't since we had  different guests arrive in  different vehicles over the course of our  hour pizza debacle. And, yes, one of them was kind enough to bring us dinner). WORST DELIVERY EVERY! They are VERY rude on the phone and just straight out lied both times on the phone when we were trying to figure out how long it would take! They didn't even bother to apologize or compensate for the inconvenience and the rudeness. What a great experience for using them the first/last time. If you're hungry and you want to order in, DO NOT go with this place. I was looking for just a slice of pizza and I found the perfect place! The pizza was delish and the slices are huge! I ordered  slices and couldn't finish it all. It was reasonably priced and the service was great. I liked that they had some seating inside too. This place is ok. They have decent pizza, burgers, and less than decent appetizers, but they are open til am which is a plus. I've seen some of the bad reviews. Okay, the staff is not that intelligent but they get the job done and the food is good so who cares. Ordered this pizza for delivery recently. The man who answered the phone was cheery and friendly, which was a good first impression. There were lots of good coupons on their menu and website. The pizza came quickly ( minutes ish?) and was VERY tasty! Thick crust, tons of cheese. . . delicious! I have a couple favorite pizza places in the city, but I think this will start to join the rotation more frequently! Milan Pizza deserves five stars in my book, and my book is the one that matters, so why am I only giving them four stars?  Well, I break my own obsessively crafted and revised Yelp rules all the time, and I give plenty of businesses five stars when really they only deserve four, but pizza is another category altogether.  My pizza reviews are bigger than me (insert pun here), and so I feel especially conscientious about getting the star level correct. OK, story time. Remember Our Friend?  You don't?  Why, he's the guy who used to own Divisadero Farmers Market, the non farmers market farmers market on Divisadero, silly.  Well, his three main employees were Rafik, who now works at Rose Food Mart in the Mission, another guy who's now a limo driver, and Ahmad. Why is this relevant?  Well, because I've run into all three of these characters in other places in SF.  First, it was Rafik.  I've already written enough about him in my Rose Food Mart review.  Soon after reconnecting with Rafik, I saw the other guy standing in front of his limo outside of Divisadero Farmers Market.  I asked him how he was doing, and he said all right.  He randomly asked about Rafik, and I told him I had actually run into him. OK, here's where it gets better.  The same night I saw the other guy, I ordered pizza from Milan Pizza for the first time.  When the delivery guy showed up, it was Ahmad, the third guy who used to work for Our Friend.  He asked how I was doing, and we talked about Rafik and the other guy. I've ordered pizza from Milan Pizza a bunch of times, and almost every time, Ahmad has been my delivery guy.  He's always really friendly, and he tells me how things are going.  His cousin, who also works at Milan Pizza, takes the orders over the phone, and his voice is very similar to Ahmad's.  For a long time, I thought the guy on the phone was Ahmad, but I had a surreal experience of talking to that guy on the phone (I was calling to find out when my pizza was coming) and seeing Ahmad get out of his car.  It freaked me out for a second because I wanted to say, ""It's OK, Ahmad; Ahmad just got here. ""(Cool.  Lightning in San Francisco.  So rare and beautiful.  Tuesday, January , ,  p. m. )The pizza itself is really solid.  It's not amazing, but it's consistent, and the toppings are fresh.  They have some pretty good deals on their website.  The more often you order from them, the quicker their service.  I believe this is because Ahmad specifically visits me first when he has multiple deliveries to make on one run. OK, I lied in the beginning of this review.  Five stars it is.  I'm such a softy. SLOW delivery and my order was incomplete and cold when it arrived.  I didn't like the food, and I won't brave the long wait again. hey, i love this place! The guys at the register are awsome, very nice friendly guys. Usually there is a comedy on the TV set near the register, so there is always something to look at while waiting for your pizza. I usually take out, and am always satisfied with my thick delicious slice and its reasonable price. After coming here several times a week, every week, pretty much ever since I moved to the 'hood LITERALLY, I can't help but write an update. This is the bf's go to spot whenever we're at my place, or when I'm on my way to his place. . . The bf: ""Shaybee, can you get me pizza? You know what I like!""Me: ""Yes, I know [along with all the guys who work there  pepperoni and sausage and a combo slice the usual (both for $)]. . . how many slices? Two. . . okay. . . see you soon. . . "" *CLICK (not that phones actually make ""click"" noises anymore that was so the 's)* Once, I came in alone and owner knew who I was picking up for and told me to tell my bf that he's lazy! As if I didn't already know this. . . I love these guys I wonder if anyone else comes in as much as we do? Things I try not to think about. . . don't judge! Fantastic salads and pizza!  The owner and manager and very generous and help out good causes.  Delicious pizza.  The cheese melts in your mouth. Reading the one star reviews of Milan is like reading the  star reviews of Vessel coming from people who tried to get in at : on a Saturday night. Please try and put things in perspective before you Yelp, OK people?Milan offers the finest pizza by the slice in all of the Tenderloin.  How am I qualified to make this call?  Two simple reasons:) I have, actually, visited every PBS place in the TL) Each one was visited while soberThe slices are large and competitively priced ($.  for cheese) with a  solid crust, just the right amount of cheese, and my favorite part  their sauce which has a nicely tangyness to it without being overwhelming.  To top it off, the guys running it are friendly.  So whether your sober or drunk, starving or moderately hungry, look no further than Milan.  It's worth walking the couple blocks and dealing with the sketchy characters on the block. Conveniently close to Rye, Swig, Ambassador, and most importantly, home, I've come here often enough that it feels like a Sex and the City Miranda/Chinese restaurant moment where the staff knows exactly what I'm going to order before I even open my mouth to ask. Over the months their pizza has improved. I'm usually not a fan of thick crust, but theirs has a delicious bread like taste, mixed each day in that huge monolith of a Kitchenaid standmixer in the back room. Slices are large and toppings are generous, but not so overwhelming that it sinks the slice like the Titanic when I hold it in one hand. Just one slice and I'm satisfied with a full tummy and the nostalgia of all those late night noshings a certain stressed out college kid used to do on midterm nights. And considering the amount of OT hours I've been racking up lately, I've become quite a regular here. I usually ask for the veggie pizza slice, add chicken, and I love how it doesn't taste greasy. Depending on who completes my order, I sometimes get an additional sprinkling of cheese on top, and they'll always give it a quick pop in the oven to re warm it and make sure the bottom stays crunchy. In addition, the guys that run the place are always extra nice to me. From what I've seen they've been very accommodating to picky pizza eaters wanting their slices done a certain way, but get confused easily when someone orders an item others rarely pick (like the antipasto salad).  stars, although I haven't tried their delivery services yet. I wish i could give this place zero stars. Pizza meh. The people that work there. . . well lets just say i think the pizza has a higher IQ and understanding of how to run a business. Basically just don't even bother trying to order a pizza, just walk your fat ass over there and throw your money away. This place is the entire reason that my awful night was somewhat salvaged.  The massive(ly annoying) crowds at Ambassador had me so mad I decided I was going to leave. . . alone. Not a great idea in this area of town at night, you know?!After circling the block a few times, I decided that maybe some pizza would cheer me up.  And it totally did the trick.  A nice warm slice of pepperoni with crushed red pepper.  I sat there with my BlackBerry and read Lance Armstrong's tweets from the Tour de France, eating pizza, and helping inebriated people dispense water from the cooler next to me. Not too greasy and total comfort food exactly when I needed it.  The workers were so efficient and friendly.  They also had gelato.  Just the fact that it was there in case I needed some mint chip was uber comforting.  A neighborhood gem for the people who need a time out of Swig, Ambassador, and the other local establishments.  But not sure I would frequent this place in the daytime ; )Four stars at night after a couple of cocktails.  Unrated when the sun is still out. Late night pizza tastes so good! I thought maybe it was good because I was a bit buzzed, but I had saved some for the next day and reheated it, still good! Tried the combination and the tomato pesto, all very good. The crust was crisp and soft on the inside and the cheese was oozing with lots of toppings. Big slice for a small price! Extra stars goes out to the friendly and accommodating staff there. Great place to come grab a slice after the clubs. My second time here and I have no complaints. The guys who work here are very friendly and nice. Milan offters HUGE slices of pizza for $.  and they are piping hot, fresh out of the oven, cheesy goodness, loaded with chunks of toppings. YUMMO!Caution: Watch out for homeless guys who say they're hungry and you give them the best part of the pizza (the crusty part) and they toss it on the floor right in front of you! =( I'm feeling more than generous as I write this review.  Still in my basil gimlet happy feeling state from Rye next door, I was sitting on the counter munching on a slice of hot out of the oven Hawaiian pizza.  For $. , I  got a big enough slice to soak up the alchohol currently running in my veins  with enough cheese, salty ham and sweet pineapple. It was so good!I was shouting YIPE all the way to the car, when my bf grabbed the keys and said, ""I'm driving!"". I don't know how our conversation went after that ,but even in my alcohol induced state I remembered saying something fierce like:  ""hm. . . maybe I'll give you a something something!""*He puts on a big smile that stretches from ear to ear *""OKAY! Now?""I give him a disgusted look. ""can't you wait until we. . . . . get home. . . . * hic * z. . . . . Big slices, friendly guys who work there. Open really late. Delicious!  Today we decided to try Milan during a working meeting and use a coupon for a medium pizza,  topings,  soda cans and a house salad.  Milan said deliver would be between min hr.  Our order arrived in  minutes, steaming hot pizza, ice cold sodas, fresh garden salad enough for  people. . . all for $.  after tax!  So good! Perfect prompt, tasty pizza well suited for finishing a long night of drinks at Swig and Rye. The pizza is pretty good. I mean, it's not Cybelle's quality, but definitely a step above the other terdy pizza joints around the Tenderloin. The phone order can take up to about  minutes because the people working the phones probably shouldn't be. Once they mistook a Dew and a Dr. Pepper for two Root Beers. Then they got our number wrong, so we didn't get a pizza for over an hour. But such is life, right? My boyfriend and I get some coupon deal with a medium  topping, salad (chock full of olives + red onions), and two soda pops   bucks or so. Not bad. love me some pizza at  in the am wtih my buddy!good price, good tase, yummy!The slices are pretty big.  If you can get a fresh slice it tastes so much better (with any pizza duh)They have the usual slices like supreme, hawaian, cheese ect. You can always request your random topping combo too though which is really nice. The crust/bread/dough is very good.  It's nice and crunchy when you bite so it's not a sloppy pizza.  The staff is very nice.  Small joint, few people but very very good.  Not a lot of place to sit so it's a place to get pizza and get going! They brought some of this crap to work for a working lunch. . . so bad.  I am usually a fan on NY style thin crust plain. . . just cheese.  Anyway, so the fiancee got us some little star with toppings last week.  I had to admit pretty good with toppings.  This pizza was near crap.  Lots of toppings, if you're into that, but very little flavor, oily, and a little too doughy. Bah. . . won't be back. . . pizza ain't that tough, I'll go elsewhere Pretty good pizza. Fast and tasty, but not the greatest i've ever had. There's plenty of pizza joints in nob hill and they all taste about the same. Milan's is a tad bit better, but I have to say the OWNER gets  STARS! He's great and i keep coming back simply to hear ""how are you doing my friend?"" Good pizza that fills me up every time! tonight i made friends with MO and AJ. . . they are the most awesome pizza guys. they totally took care of me and my roomie when we needed our pizza and wings fix. and then they told me that they deliver. . . I'M IN HEAVEN. when you go there tell them that jamie part two sent you. Good stuff! It's bad news for the other pizza joints that the first place I ordered from in my new neighborhood was so tasty. This is the first place I ate at in San Francisco and it was good.  For some reason my dad really liked the crust, but he puts ketchup on everything so sometimes he's not to be trusted.  Not amazing, but not bad. This pizza is like a good  of Steel Reserve Malt liquor.  A slice of supreme is cheap (.  for a HUGE thick slice loaded with cheap toppings), and you know it's gonna make you feel good. Unfortunately as I'm chowing down on a greasy slice, it reminds me of those alka seltzer commercials where they show the loaded welfare cheese nachos and  chili dogs. Just like the oz, the chili dogs, or the nachos, the aftermath of this ain't gonna be good. Ok. Here are some things that you should know about me:. Not really a fan of pesto (don't know why because I love all the ingredients. . . but seperately). I don't usually eat the crusts on my pizza, esp thick crusts. But there's something about this place that made me change my ways. When it comes to pizza, I'm as vanilla as can be (nothing makes me happier than a slice of ooey gooey cheese) but when my cheese wasn't available, I settled on their pesto, tomato and spinach slice and you know what? it was GOD. And I killed that shit, crust and all. Maybe it was the alcohol I had previously but I'm pretty sure I'd like this with or without the champagne.

The Mayflower Restaurant 0|3.5|Vietnamese in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|107|0|4.2| I don't usually go to chain restaurants while on vacation, but we had already checked out of the hotel and had spent the day in china town, so we were tired and wanted something that we knew of. food was excellent and the staff was beyond excellent. it was a great ending to a great trip. Very sweet waitresses, small but good. First time here, I'll probably come back when I'm back in town. :) I like the people here, they're quick and friendly. Nice restaurant. Great breakfast for $. My partner and I usually come in for a wonderful breakfast here every once in a while.  We moved closer to the city and miss the wonderful family that works here. A small hole in the wall diner located alone Ingleside. The concept of it being a traditional American breakfast house, as well as serving Vietnamese is pretty cool, if you ask me. Pros: The waitresses are the sweetest people here.  Despite the old and somewhat gloomy interior, there's a strange homey feeling to this place as well.  Menu has variety, but it also stays simple and doesn't have an overcrowded menu.  Close to CCSF, Ingleside Public Library, Wholefoods Market, and Yogurtland.  Walking distance or you can take the K metro muni.  Their french toast is nommies.  Rootbeer float. Some cons: The interior is super old. Gloomy and dimly lit.  The prices for certain things aren't worth the price.  The portions for some dishes are less than what they're worth. Definitely one of the spots to go to if you're in the mood for American or Vietnamese styled breakfast.|3|98|1|Routine Inspection| Improper storage of equipment utensils or linens
The Mayflower Restaurant 1|3.5|Vietnamese in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|107|1|3.0|" This place has a very pleasant old school feel to it. Their food is quite good, especially their small Vietnamese portion. Honestly you can have a better omelette elsewhere but that's not the point; this place deserves the good business that it gets because the staff is always very polite. The Mayflower has a niche in their French Toast and we can confirm that. Their Vietnamese chicken noodle soup was delicious as well. Come give this place a try and see how you like it. Surprisingly a really decent breakfast spot wasn't to sure how great it was gonna be it looked a little sketch having just moved into the neighborhood wasn't sure how good was gonna be with a half Vietnamese half American food menu. . It all honesty it was pretty good just an all around simple breakfast cafe spot to hit up if you don't feel like cooking Price & Quality The food here tastes fine, it's their portions that are irritating. I've came here about  times in my life but no more. I ordered eggs with sausage and steak before and it was like a kids meal. Only reason I ever came was on tuesdays where I forgot Pho Ha Tien was closed. The Pho here is ok, but you're better off saving your money. Service The service here is ok. Nothing bad, nothing great. Vibe The place has a nice little set up in terms of its diner vibe but eh it's not my place. Should you go? Unless you're dying to have pho and Pho Ha Tien is closed, no. I am aware that this diner has changed hands in the recent past, but I have been going here for almost  years and haven't noticed any major changes in quality, service or food.  At least one staff member is the same one who served me the first time I went in.  This place is seldom packed, and so I have found it is good for groups.  In addition, since they serve brunch, lunch and Vietnamese food, it is a crowd pleaser.  Everyone can find something they will like.  Best of all, even at the peak of Sunday brunch time, I have never had to wait for a table.  I enjoy that they ask how you would like your bacon cooked.  Their Vietnamese coffee is strong and flavorful like it should be.  The eggs Benedict was surprisingly good.  The pancakes are fluffy and don't taste like a mix.  The Pho and vermicelli are both decent.  Who doesn't want a side of lemongrass chicken with their bacon and eggs.  I highly recommend this place, especially for the price and not having to wait for a table. I had eaten here twice in my life. First time it was pretty decent.  Two month ago, I went there expecting same place. BOY!  Was I in for shock!  It changed hand to some Vietnamese family. I like Vietnamese people, my experience always has been positive. (Inclusive of these people who had taken over reins of Mayflower restaurant). I had one of their breakfasts with eggs fish and rice.  It tasted well. . . hmm. . . . okay, (mediocre). I have to tell you, two hours later when I left, I suddenly became violently ill. I threw up on pavement on Ocean Avenue (near Franciscan Hobbies) Sorry folks at FH, nothing against you!   Plus I felt very weak. I almost was very close to calling for ambulance!  But I managed to get Muni home instead. After half hour of being back home, I suddenly had to literally drop everything and had to make SPRINT to bathroom, this was bowel EMERGENCY!  I had such explosive (non bloody thank goodness!) diarrhoea that wound up being unrelenting and persistent day and night for full week!  That along with intestinal pain, cramping (and noise), bloating and gas. Plus I was malaise and fatigued from / need of toilet.  I was one sorry mess!This was so bad I wound up having one massive unexpected bowel accident at home on kitchen floor (as I went in for replenishing fluids such as orange juice).  This must be one of worst cases (if not worst ever) of food poisoning I ever have had in my life!  Again, I was so close to contacting , but still somehow resisted (for fear of embarrassment and high cost of ambulance ride) I finally  to my total amazement  make full (?) recovery. NEVER, NEVER. NEVER shall I EVER eat at Mayflower ever again!  They may be nice owner, but my God!  They most certainly do NOT know how to keep clean place and you are guaranteed to get severe case of food poisoning!If I were responsible for giving them health score, it would be flat ZERO! . . . Or 'F '!Spare your intestinal tract, please AVOID Mayflower restaurant at all cost!  Wow! I'm generally a pretty generous person with the yelp stars. . . but these people will get no love from me. Not cool that on their door, and on yelp it says they're open till : but when we walked in, we were told that they were closed. It was :. Their neon sign still lit up ""open"" and people in there were still eating too. So much for all the quarters we put in the meter. Oh well, it's OK, the place was super dark. . . darker than a dive bar and we wouldn't have been able to read the menu anyway.  And I wouldn't call it ""old school"". The place is just plain dingy. Mom and pops neighborhood gem? Hrmm. . . they treated us just like the way they do at Delfina. BoWe won't be back. Solid breakfast food in a very divey old school looking spot. Has that old school diner feel to it. Not good for dates though, lol  then again Ocean Ave in general isn't really a datesy spot. My BF used to work here about  years ago and claims the breakfast food is really good. I had my doubts but after taking a bite, I converted. Pretty cheap and hearty portions!Omelette  is huge and full of fillings. Pho  SKIP IT. Maybe their other Viet items are better??I'd like to return for more of the breakfast items that the BF and everyone else raves about! This spot is a little gem!This is what you call your local mom n pops breakfast joint run by some lovely Vietnamese ladies. I don't know what they do to their french toast but it is one of the best! Crispy and soft. . . perfect texture. I have yet to try their pho but I usually come for their french toast with lemongrass which is also delicious. The ladies are super friendly and it is usually filled up with regulars. They make an effort to remember what is your usual order too!Parking is a plenty, if not found on Ocean there is usually parking off on the side street. They have recently repaired the broken seats in the booths I believe, so they polished the place up a bit. Can't wait to visit again!"|3|96|2|Routine| Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 10/15/2014 ] Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils  [ date violation corrected: 10/15/2014 ]
The Mayflower Restaurant 2|3.5|Vietnamese in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|107|2|3.74157303371|" I have only been here once and will go again to try the Pho. If you are looking for a place with fast service this is not the place. Its more of an diner atmosphere where you go and plan to spend a while there catching up with friends. Got number  French toast (eh nothing special), scrambled eggs and bacon (over cooked)But its a nice place and seems like a lot of people go there so I shall give it another go! Taking long for our food. . Waiter seem like she was in a rush to take outlet order. . Still waiting. . . . my first visit to this place wasn't so great but i've come back a couple of times and decided that i like this place. they do a solid breakfast for cheap and my friends who ordered their vietnamese food said it was pretty good. the interior needs some major updating but there's always three little kids running around so i think redecorating is the last thing they're worrying about. Amazing breakfast, and extremely affordable!  Make sure to try the French Toast! American diner with pho and lemongrass chicken on the menu! Interesting combination. I've been here a few times for breakfast/lunch, and the food has been average. Nothing too exciting or special. Price isn't over priced compared to other diners, but I guess they don't impress you with quantity like other places either. Service is very friendly!The place gives me a vibe of a ""local lazy weekend breakfast/lunch diner run by local people. ""I've been there a few times, and I'll come back while I'm around in the neighborhood :) Four stars for food, two for service. The mayflower omelette is excellent, but I shouldn't have to get up multiple times to get my coffee refilled. Pho and traditional American food! I love their French toast so yummy. . . The place is decent it has both Pho' which hubby loves & American breakfast I really look forward to from a long night out. However, my husband feels the portion isn't enough and parking is just terrible :( Im glad I found out about this place because they make a good variety of food! From American to Vietnamese whatever you choose on the menu is good :) Service is great and the workers are friendly! Definitely going back more often because its down the street from CCSF and its a good place to go to during my breaks! I have eaten here a number of times before getting on to yelp to create a review. This place is really homey. It's a part of what makes Ocean so great. It's a local business, family run, and they have the best concept ever. . . Pho and traditional American food! I haven't had the pho, I let my girlfriend enjoy that. For me the breakfast is the way to go. That's why I come here. The pancakes, French toast, grits and eggs are all lovely. I enjoy the omelets too as well! Their hashbrowns are cooked just right, a little greasy like at home too, but at least their not dry. Dont be turned off by the outside look of the place or be intimidated by the dated interior. Everything is clean and sanitary! The food is ok, but for a prized reviewed restaurant I am a little surprised there wasn't more ppl. Namely anyone else besides me and employeesBut foods decent Starvin that day. . . Came here on holloween at pm walks in their door is open also says they're open on yelp waste of gas going around to find parking then the lazy owner tells us that they're closed . . . really?? Then put up a sign and lock doorI mean, i seriously looked them up yelp came all the way here to then find parking and finally get inside. . they tell me no service. . . . Yelp says they're open too.  Poor buisness ethics. Don't think i'll ever want to try here anymore maybe i ordered the wrong thing, but dont get the pho here I recently moved back to SF after living abroad for the last  years.  One of the things I really craved was French Toast for breakfast, they just don't do it right in the UK.  So I looked around the neighborhood and found this little gem. I read it had american breakfast food, but when I walked in and saw it was Vietnamese I was a bit confused.  Then I realised it is great for BOTH!  Ok, so it is a bit dark and not perhaps as clean as it could be but the food makes up for it in my opinion.  I've always been experimental when it comes to food and when I saw you could order lemon grass chicken AND french toast together, I had to give it a go.  Both were delicious!  And some of the best Vietnamese coffee I have ever experienced.  I have since been back for phò and it was fantastic. They give you everything you need to spice up your phò how YOU like it and the broth was so lovely.  Definitely a place I will frequent.  Just don't let the interior appearance deter you. I don't think there is any other restaraunt in the area that serves pho and pancakes which makes this place unique for me (If there is, please let me know), But that does not give them an excuse to have horrible customer service and mice sized portion. The only good decent plate they have here is the french toast, which is pretty hard to fuck up. Other than that, The eggs benedict hollandaise sauce was sour, the pho broth was not cooked long enough, and the hash browns were soggy. To top it all off, I ordered a pork chop and rice to go, and to my surprise, they gave me one little chop, what looked like a head of lettuce and enough rice to fill a family sized rice cooker. When finished with my food at the restaurant, the lady walked over with my bill with her iPhone still in her hand laughing her ass off with her friend on the other line and tossed it on my table. She came back with my receipt the exact same way. Not coming back here again. This place looks like a bar that went out of business and decided to convert into a vietnamese restaurant. Great, filling food.  Fantastic concept.  Looks kind of ugly and dark inside, but it's interesting nonetheless.  Lemongrass chicken was superb and really nice compliment to my French toast. The interior of the Mayflower is a reflection of what it was like and not what it is now.  It has a s look with wood paneling and a ship design (presumably the Mayflower). The booths have s formica tables that are clean.  There are stools on the side for those that prefer eating at the counter.  The holdover decorations include pictures of Becks, Coors, and Stroh beer, even though beer was not offered on the menu.  It was quiet without the pounding music that many restaurants now employ. The restaurant serves traditional American breakfast and lunch along with Vietnamese dishes.  It is open every day, except Monday, from : AM until : PM. Our waitress was a charming Vietnamese woman who provided good service. Since reviewers remarked on the french toast, we both order french toast ($. ) and french toast with eggs, and pork chop ($. ).  The chop was pretty tiny and had a hoisin sauce taste.  The french toast was very good. The coffee was $. /ea and looked rich and dark, but according to my companion tasted like dishwater.  There is nothing really special about this place though it , though it was clean and comfortable.  I may try the Vietnamese dishes next time.  . The owner was so nice and friendly. I got the french toasts. It tasted so delicious. But just need to wait a little while to get the toast done. So I will absolutely come back for breakfast next time. (   ` ) Lunch and breakfast. I had the french toast (excellent) and a veggie omelet. I have been here several times. Service is very nice, coffee is solid (unlike many other diners I've been to, they do not burn their coffee!), and french toast is very delicious. I am also a fan of the lemongrass chicken. pho aND pancakes!?! haha. they serve vietnamese food and breakfast all day. ive never tried the vn food. im vn food, and i find myself to be pretty picky so i just opt out of places that seem like they may be 'iffy'. the breakfast, i wiLL vouch for. they serve a solid french toast, and pancakes. ive tried quite a few things off of their breakfast menu and theyre all pretty good. had lunch here with a friend the other day. this restaurant doesnt have a tap bit of vietnamese flavor. if youre looking to have breakfast then this is the place for you. other than that find another real vietnamese restaurant to serve you I was incredibly surprised when I came here for lunch with my friend. I just finished working out at the nearby  hr fitness and my friend told me about this place and suggested we eat there for lunch. He told me it was really good and the prices were reasonable so I decided to give the place a try. Ordered a steak and fries and it only cost around $ which is really cheap compared to a lot of places that serve steak. The service was also great and the waitresses were really cool. I would definitely come back another time for lunch! Kitschy spot but they've got all the comfort foods covered. . . . and yep, those pork chops are off the hook.  Pass on the salad if you can call a couple pieces of lettuce, salad. This place is hands down the best and cheapest place for breakfast. Go ahead and wait in long lines on Sunday for your breakfast. . . I'll be here eating the best French toast in the city! Seriously, the best French toast. The decor is straight out of  at first i wasnt too sure about the place because of that but now i I find it awesome. I love the ladies who work here, it's a family run joint, they are so nice and remember my order and my husbands and they love my daughter too. We always feel so welcomed, full and spent under $ with tip for ! OMG, there was  food on the walls!  Like the last customer turned to sneeze and pieces of pancake or whatever splattered on the wallpaper like some sort of Jackson  Pollock with maple syrup. I was so hungry I still ate.  I wish I would have read the reviews for the frenchtoast.  I saw the Vietnamese staff and assumed I should get a vietnamese favorite.  I ordered rare beef and meat ball pho. Thats what I get for being a racist.  It was god awful! The beef tasted chewy and old and the broth was way to salty.  The funny part is I am so fascinated with the filthy seventies mayflower themed decor that i will probably go back and try the french toast. Vietnamese food NOAmerican Breakfast/Brunch YES!!Cute spot for locals and families, great service, and fair prices but below average vietnamese fair. Stick to breakfast and you'll be aight. Funky, basic worn 's decor, no frills. Just right eggs, big portion of crispy hash browns, well cooked sausage, crispy bacon, toast w/butter  jelly.  Everything cooked just right, not greasy.  Sat at the counter with various young members of the family run cafe and enjoyed my hearty breakfast.  If you are looking for strictly no fuss, no fancy decor, plain and simple, friendly, not trendy & unpretentious then this is it. Before it used to be good now the quality and love they used to put in has wiltered. What else is there to say. . . =( I went here for breakfast couple weeks ago. I wasnt sure what time it opened (:am) but my gf and I got there at :am. They owner was nice enough to let us in  minutes early. =] Good start to a good review. after reading a lot of reviews about the french toast, my gf wanted to try that out and i settled for pancakes and hash browns. I was more than happy. A big portion of the food is served and the pancakes are nice and soft with a nice golden look to it. The waiter and waitresses were super nice and friendly. The restaurant is cozy and from what i saw, they had a lot of regulars coming in for breakfast which means that they must be doing something right. =]I think the total was about ish. Not entirely bad considering the portion sizes. with Jerianne Guillermo:) yummy French toast!!I really really like their french toast! I have a very sweet tooth and their french toast is sweet. Mm =) The ladies (or maybe sisters) were very friendly towards their customers. I'd love to come back for more french toast asap. =) I was paying the city a visit and while walking around me and my friends got very hungry. We looked around for interesting little eateries and we decided on this one. Once I entered I was waved at by the sweetest woman ever and felt incredibly welcomed. I enjoyed the atmosphere and I liked how the place had a certain low budget but charming feel to it. The prices weren't too bad and I dug the food. If I ever find myself back in the city and roaming around Sunset I'll be sure to come back. I'm kind of ""meh"" about the Mayflower Restaurant. The food was okay, but not stupendous, and the same goes for the staff who seemed bored and while not unfriendly, rather resigned to their fate as restaurant workers. I have yet to try the Vietnamese food here, but they do stock a good breakfast variety, which was perfectly adequate fare, and filling. The prices likewise are perfectly reasonable, which is good. Honestly, this has the potential to be a really cool place. As of right now, it's just dull. The whole place is dark, and everything from the walls to the chairs are just brown and boring. The only sign of 'life' was children's drawings that had been taped up on one of the walls. Otherwise things were bland and uninteresting which just set the mood for the whole meal; the mood being ""meh. "" There was a TV playing an infomercial in the background, and even that just seemed muted and dull. This restaurant has been around since the 's I think, and I don't think any sort of redecorating has happened since. It's dark, and quiet (quiet in a bad way, rather than good, unfortunately) and just needs to be revamped. Also, the menu was a little unorganized, and like the rest of the establishment, could do with a little sprucing up. This is a cute place close to City College and could be an awesome place if someone would just get in there and make it happen. I feel almost bad giving it only two stars, because its got so much potential, but as of right now, it's nothing special. (also, parking is a pain on Ocean Avenue, be advised) Hands down the best Pork Chops & Lemon grass chicken ever! Either u are going to have those options with rice and salad or egg and hash browns either way its the best EVER! dont know any other way of explaining it! thanks to tha hubby for introducing this lil hole in the wall gem!! holy cow i think this is the first place ive been to where the asian waitresses were actually friendly! what a pleasant suprise ahah. so basically the food is only three stars but hey ill throw in another star for giving a good name to asian servers :) I got the lemongrass chicken which was good but the portions were quite small. I had on piece of chicken cutted up in noodles. There wasnt that much vegies in there either. I mean im a short skinny girl and finished that with no problem. I felt like it was a snack or something. The place does look alittle old, set up to be like an old fashioned dennys or something. I was suprised they served mainly american food such as french toast, burgers, pancakes and etc. . Although it looks old it doesnt look all that run down. Just not so modernized as the restaurants these days Came here for breakfast once.  If you want a hearty meal at a good price, this is your place.  This decor is not chic but the service is fast and very friendly.  I haven't tried it yet but they also offer Vietnamese food here which is cool. Pork chop is bomb! Already feel like this will become a regular spot for me. Service is great so far and the menu has an awesomely unusual assortment. It's got the nice homy atmosphere that reminds me of dive y diners at home in Montana. parking can be stiff here. i only had the breakfast and decided to come here because i was having something done with my wheel to my car next door.  if you know which place i'm talking about, its a rip off.  this restaurant is NOT a ripoff. i came in, the lady was super friendly.  i love that. the food was more than adequate so i don't know how to rate the breakfast.  you can't usually screw it up so i can't give it more than an A OK. but next time i'm gonna try that vietnamese food everyone says they have.  then i'll edit this review. it wasn't very expensive. Where can you get lemongrass chicken with french toast and grits? MY FAVORITE combo of things to order. I was always scared to review this place because I was afraid of non sf native people coming to my hood and calling it ghetto. Then the same people taking over my beloved avenue and calling it theirs, but loving the food, followed by a ridiculous wait for my food. But I love the food so much I want droves of people to come into this greasy spoon, in an good ol' working class neighborhood and a fall in love with it. I love the chicken and french toast. The toast is so airy, and sweet. The chicken, flavorful and savory. The grits   my buffer between the two, with hot sauce.  The place is just old, wood paneled, and family run, but I like it, its very comfy  you could come from a workout, from church, from another neighborhood, and it's still all good. I really like being inside here.  It's very dim and small in here but the staff is very friendly and their smiles are so welcoming.  I've never actually tried the American food here because I don't like pancakes and other breakfast items but I really want to come back so I probably will.  The Vietnamese food is nothing great, but the service is what makes you comfortable and glad you came.  I recommend coming here, if you're in the area,  for coffee/brunch and bring something to read. French toast already sweetened with something, i forget but they have powdered sugar! enough said! Decor's pretty dark and old, but I don't care the french toast is great! The great thing here is that you can can get Vietnamese style meat (lemon grass chicken) with your breakfast as well as the usual american breakfast meats. Everyone there is VERY friendly! While dining in there, I noticed they remember many of their regulars. OK  I'm updating my review and upgrading a star because I tried the pork chops. Oh my God. These pork chops!! Not the thick variety, but these were TENDER as all get out, and the seasonings? I don't even know what to tell you, I tasted lemongrass and all manner of yumminess. Oh so terribly, terribly good. And I had previously been a pork chop for breakfast virgin, but I am deliriously converted to this brilliant convergence of goodness. There is a chance that there is MSG in their food  not sure, but my bf gets a headache after we eat here and MSG gives him headaches. MSG doesn't bother me much, so I can't say I really care too much, but beware if it bothers you. Otherwise, try the pork chops. Then send me a thank you card. Good offering of Chinese food. They have small dim sum plates and they have the standard chinese entrees. This place is great! The spicy chicken is a bit meh, not very spicy but I didn't expect it to be. The staff is nice, they're quick though that maybe because this place never seems overly busy. The interior is nice, just the right amount of darkness and no annoying lights that keep the room bright. The best thing is that one time when me and my friend were eating her, our third friend didn't want to eat but she still got a fortune cookie. It's the little things that matter. Easily my favorite diner in San Francisco.  When I lived in the neighborhood it was hard not to come for a late breakfast every weekend.  Now that I live a bit farther away I still trek for the awesomeness. The food is good, plentiful, and cheap.  The staff takes the time to remember you, so it always feels like home.  In fact it looks like a down home kinda place:  wood paneling, booths with ripped up vinyl seats.  Comfortable. Good chocolate shakes, too. Go here. Get the french toast. You will not regret it. Oh, and don't worry about the lack of decor. . . just see it for what it is: yummy and cozy in a  pre gentrified San Francisco way. They stopped serving Pho, and other soup as well!  I used to always go there just for the Pho, and now their menu just contains unhealthy deep fried Vietnamese food or really unhealthy, carb overloaded American food! Since they took away my staple dish, I doubt I'll ever set foot in there again since there are two Vietnamese places within a  minute walk that I can go to and get my Pho fix! I usually order breakfast here. My usual frenchtoast (or pancakes),  eggs,  pieces of bacon and sourdough toast. If I feel like eating Vietnamese food, I'll order Pho, Bun, or Lemongrass Chicken. Their Vietnamese food is really good too! They also have burgers and sandwiches here. As I skimmed through their menu. . . . I KNEW IT! THEY DO HAVE FRIED CHICKEN HERE!  I needed my fried chicken fix for the week. The last time I had fried chicken was about  weeks ago at Farmer Brown.  I was starting to go through fried chicken withdrawal. Thanks Mayflower for saving the day!My fried chicken came with a side of salad and french fries ($. ). yelp. com/biz_photos/CxEd…  I wish I got rice instead. It probably would have tasted better. The fried chicken was actually pretty good. It reminded me of chicken that your mom or someone else's mom would make. It was quite tasty and very flavorful. If you're expecting it to taste like FarmerBrown, Hard Knox, or Front Porch's fried chicken. . . . you'll be disappointed. Cause it taste nothing like their fried chicken. Like I said, it taste like something your mom would make at home. I'm usually here at least once a week with my boyfriend. The ladies here are super nice and they always remember how I like my eggs and bacon cooked. Not sure if I'll ever order their fried chicken again, but I'll be back for their breakfast in a week or two. Thank god I live close by. The fried chicken was more like a . I gave them a  cause I love this place and service is always wonderful. Great breakfasts. I lived in the 'hood for a good three years before venturing down to the Mayflower for Sunday breakfast. Very good french toast and hash browns, good and flowing coffee. Eggs were okay, nothing earth shattering. Service was very attentive and friendly. I like knowing I can get a cheap and tasty breakfast right down the street. im really missing this place right now. i haven't been here in a while because i moved across the bay but every time i get a chance i hit this spot. . delicious breakfast. i had french toast, eggs, and sausage while my dining companian (  year old sister) had the pancakes, bacon, and scrambled eggs. good prices and REALLY good french toast/pancakes. crappy diner decor but what the heck ever, i don't give a crap about that. additionally, they have a BOUNTIFUL vietnamese section of their menu which i plan on taking FULL advantage of very soon. This place is a favorite with students. . . The place needs an updated look, but don't remodel the breakfast. . . Strangest bathroom set up I've ever encountered. . . Discovered today during CCSF's stupid fucking campus wide fire drill.  My anatomy class was so rudely interrupted during a freezing morning.  Now when the fuck am I going to learn all about arterial supply to the lower limbs?  Really. My friend Rich and I met up and bitched for a while about the cold and disruption.  Our anatomy instructor came by and said ""see you guys in lab.  Don't bother coming back to class. ""  I guess that means we're getting lunch then!Rich: I think I want French toast. Me: I want pho.  Do you want to come with me?Rich: OK!We walk down Ocean a bit and peek at Mayflower.  Eh, the sign says ""PHO"" but the atmosphere connotes ""DINER. ""  Can that possibly be good?  We kept walking but my usual pho joint on Ocean is closed Tuesdays, so Mayflower won. Did you know that Vietnamese food and American diner food can peacefully coexist?  That it can be served on the same table?  That it won't re enact the Vietnam Conflict in your tummy?  That's it's GODDAMN BRILLIANT TO HAVE GREASY DINER FOOD AND VIETNAMESE FOOD IN THE SAME PLACE?Yeah, it is. I had pho bo with rare steak and beef balls.  Rich had pork vermicelli.  Both were yum.  The pho choices are pretty limited (I want tripe and tendon, dammit!) but tasty.  Broth was spicy even before I dumped in my jalapenos.  OK, so neither one of us got any of the traditional American fare there, but it looked GOOD.  I'd come back and get some of that.  I am just so easy when pho is involved.  I can't tell it no.  I could totally eat pho and fries, though.  Fuck, that sounds good.  Is this place  hours?BTW, not to be confused with the OTHER Mayflower restaurant. I had breakfast there on a Sunday morning  service was fast and friendly. My vegetarian omelette was a little over cooked but still good and you cant beat the prices! MAYFLOWER SHITS ON DENNYS OR IHOP ANY DAY!the pancakes taste like my moms homecooked ones and the french toast makes my mouth water thinking about it. the people inside are really friendly. the only thing that sucks is that its not open late but hey the quality of the food is top notch. Also, i never noticed this place because it doesnt stand out and looks really old. Parking isnt that hard to find and theres a candy bowl with jolly ranchers which is always cool too. IHOP SUCKS BALLS COMPARED TO THIS PLACE. ACTUALLY, IHOP SUCKS BALLS PERIOD. GO MAYFLOWER! My family has been coming here for over  years. All the locals know that if you want a great breakfast, lunch or dinner cooked in the 's diner way, you come here. This is the perfect place for weekend breakfast or brunch, and the Vietnamese specials are delicious. One star off because the interior decor is stuck in the 's and needs some serious updating! Ain't no need for ya'll to be cheap! Food = good. Mostly, except for their imperial rolls (too greasy and flavorless. )  (I have not tried their American fare, only their Vietnamese section. )  Service = friendly and efficient. Prices = dirt cheap.  Decor = circa s. . . lol Plain. I have been going to the Mayflower for over  years and this place has THE BEST french toast I've ever had.  I always go for the # french toast with a side order of hash browns on the side.  Very delicious and extremely filling.  I haven't been there in a couple of months but my memory is that for eggs (any style you want), bacon, sausace,  french toasts and a side of hashed browns is total $ including tip.  Very reasonable for a hearty breakfast!The restaurant has transferred owners one time since I've been there and its from one family to an inlaw family.  They've kept the menus, the recipes, the style of cooking but have added a Vietnamese menu over the years.  All the locals come here and you start to recognize faces after a few visits. The interior decorations aren't the most appealing.  It's dark and the tables/benches probably haven't been replaced since the restaurant started. . . the place could definitely use some updating.  But the friendly staff and the welcoming family feel creates a sort of charm to the restaurant.  try it!  you might eat the most amazing french toast you've ever had :D Warning! I am surrounded by the reviews that make me realize that Yelp is not yet the perfect site I always wish that it is.  stars for this restaurant is absolutely ridiculous. Disclaimer: I had the ""American Breakfast"" so no Vietnamese food review here. The Good: The french toast is good. But that is all. Best in the city?? That is just ridiculous. Reasonably priced. Service was friendly and great. What else? Ok that is all. The Bad: Sausage was way overcooked. . . at least I think that was sausage inside the crusty charred exterior. The hash browns were undercooked, and both looked suspiciously like something I would find in the frozen food section of my local discount grocery store. My scrambled eggs were hard on the outside and runny in the middle. . . odd and disappointing for scrambled eggs. The actual restaurant was leaning dangerously close to dirty and rundown instead of the ""cute mom and pop place"" I expected from the other reviews. Please understand this review was based on one single dish, but I won't be going back. Two stars = Friendly and nice and ok French Toast. French toast with ca phe sua da is the best! weird.  vietnamese flavors and brunch food.  but delicious. i personally would avoid the lemon grass flavors and go for the five spices.  five spices w/french toast.  i guess it makes sense that it would work.  french/vietnamese.  i guess i'll just echo the rest of the reviews.  french toast FRENCH TOAST french TOAST FRENCH toast.  get it. Hidden gem. . . for sure. This place is a hole in the wall, but goodness. . . they have the best French Toast!  I think I'm in love with the place.  I would definitely go back.  and somehow, the # DOES work!  Lemon grass chicken + eggs + french toasts. . . . m. Plus, you can tell this is definitely a mom and pop shop. . . . and I really respect it when people work this hard to provide for their families. . . it's the ""American Dream"". . . while you enjoy your breakfast. my favorite diner in san francisco.  i used to live near it and ate there just about every sunday.  i don't think they need a make over; i love the shitty decorations and tv which barely works. the staff is wonderful and usually recognizes me, which i take as a big deal because i'm white and they aren't.  i realize we all look alike. the chocolate shakes are the bomb, as are the omelettes and french fries. never tried their vietnamese, but i imagine it's good too. # French toast,  eggs (over medium), and sausage+and a vietnamese iced coffee=breakfast of champions!!FRENCH TOAST here lives up to its reputation! and service here is super friendly. If you like french toast, get the french toast. If you don't like french toast, get the french toast you'll be converted.  words  GET THE FRENCH TOAST!!If you like pork chops, the # is for you.  French toast,  eggs and pork chop. Perfection! This is a Vietnamese American restaurant. So you get the best of both worlds here. I have been going to this restaurant for months now with my friend so the ladies know me by my order. The best place to get breakfast in between classes. I go to school and work on campus at CCSF. My friend and I love to have breakfast here, the french toast is delicious, and so is the rest of the menu. She loves the pancakes, their noodle soups, and salads. I had their Vietnamese style salad with shrimp and that was good too. I also tried their sandwiches and burgers and those were cooked just right. My friend loves their portion sizes so if you are worried about your diet you don't have to when you go here. Oh and order the Vietnamese coffee either for here or to go. It is the best! It isn't on the menu but if you ask the sweet lady that takes your order she will gladly make it. Service is great! But don't forget to tip. These ladies work hard and put up w/ a lot of BS from people. But they still give their service with a smile. for my first proper American breakfast since my return from the Philippines, my friend took me to The Mayflower Restaurant. it's a standard American Diner, owned/operated by a Vietnamese family. . . so you have the fantastic option of getting pancakes, eggs and bacon (cooked to your heart's desire), or pho. It's cheap, the service is great, the coffee is strong, the eggs and bacon were perfect (eggs were over medium, and bacon were medium well!)  They serve Darigold butter in those single serve pats, which is the perfect and most useful packaging for butter. The clientele are mixed: families with children, huge football player type dudes, Filipino grandmothers catching up on the news of the day, old dudes. . . . . pretty chill place with nicely prepared, no fuss food. (  ) I love Mayflower for many reasons: its great food, its personable dining experience, its interesting but homey decor, and its convenience!  They serve traditional american and vietnamese.  I've had their vermicelli, burgers, and their breakfasts; i know, pretty much everything on the menu! They are all very good and their food service, quality, quantity is extremely consistent.  I believe they specialize in bbq, maybe burgers? I can't remember but they never fail to deliver!Love this mom n pop shop! I used to love this place, now not so much. Great diner with tasty food. I like that it's family run. Imperial rolls and pho are delicious. So is the French toast. I love this diner and the family who runs it. truly one of the few things I miss about San Francisco. The French toast is the best I've ever had. The burgers are super burger ific. The chicken noodle soup is comfort in a bowl. They'll even make birds in nest if you ask nicely. I love counting the different colors and textures of faux wood paneling that holds the walls up here. I miss Sunday mornings at the Mayflower, may it never close. It's a bit dingy inside, but the people are real nice and the food is decent. The theme is mayflower, like the sailing ship back in Columbus's time. Anyway it was a decent mouthful of food, and I left full and without any stomach pains which is a good sign. The French toast hit the spot and the omelette's are very tasty. Being right near my house, I'll want to go back there again soon. It deserves three stars because it can use a little clean up and maintenance. ok. . . so I don't HATE this place.  But, I am a little peeved that I let my friend talk me into eating breakfast here. The service was ""ok"". . . it wasn't terrible.  But, the chick serving us, kept asking if we were ready and that was annoying.  I was with a friend that I don't get to catch up with very often and we were gabbing and really enjoying each other's company.  I was talking to her about my CHEATIN EX (Pooh) and she was telling me about her LOUSY LOW DOWN EX too.  See where I am going with this??  It was bad juju for her to keep buggin' us. Anyway, we finally decided on an order even though the place needs some paint and probably disinfectant really bad.  Upon ordering, we expressed that we did NOT want runny eggs.  We just don't like them. So, we got our food and the eggs were burned. . . hella burned.  Why is the solution for runny eggs to just burn the hell out of them? Whatever.  I kept having the nastiest burps for the rest of the day.  My breathe was TART for the rest of the day and I kept wondering if I had swallowed a cock roach hidden amoung my brown eggs. I won't go there again.  They can keep their burned eggs and pushy waitresses.  . . . and my CHEATIN' EX (Pooh. . . . yeah that's the one). I Love ''MAY FLOWER"", I've been going there for about  years, Ive moved around a few times within this time, but its always been close to home. The food is good, home like and of course reasonable anyone Ive brought, hasn't been disappointed yet. I agree with, not getting a check sometimes till you ask, but its because they like to let you relax. Also it is family owned there all very, very nice. An the original manger ""Kim"", Has moved to manage another family restaurant, so that might be a part of it. There good to me an always remember my name & yes my situation , an i appreciate the little things so ill always be back! P. S. , If you go on a weekend Brunch it will be a Little packed, they are under staffed an the place isn't to big, its a popular place after church in this area. Nice family owned restaurant, comforting and affordable. My friend and I came here quite often after getting out of class. I literally ordered the same thing every time  The Mayflower Omelet with a Coke. It's quite a delight. Well, I broke my streak once, when I ordered pho. But I didn't quite like it at this particular place. The atmosphere is kinda gloomy and depressing. But the great food and friendly service makes up for it. They don't accept credit  cash or ATM only. And for some reason, they never, ever bring me my check unless it's asked for. . Fabulous, tasty, inexpensive and clean diner.  Friendly, excellent service.  Great Vietnamese and American fare.  I have lived in the area for  years and I regret not going here before now.  French toast is to die for. This place is nice. The food is mediocre, but they have a REALLY tasty french toast. It's different from anywhere else I have tried. The service is alright. Sometimes, it gets too attentive when you're the only customer in the restaurant. They just kept looking at us while we were eating. Strange feeling _ ""It's good to eat there for breakfast and burgers for a quick meal for ya. As weird of a concept it may sound, it works. You get true diner food and a diner experience with the availability of authentic Vietnamese food. I dream about the breakfast food here it's straight up for reals and they give you pretty generous portions with diner prices. The wait staff if really sweet and this place has a lot of loyal regulars you can tell. Everything about this place is diner until you see the Vietnamese portion of the menu. The people who own this place are actually Vietnamese a good sign. I've only tried their pho and while it's good, the portions are small the only downside. I guess you wouldn't come here solely for the Vietnamese food. I love this place.  They're sweet enough to remember your name, your face, your car, and your situation.  Yeah, it's just a small diner that recently added some VietNamese selections to the menu, eclectic like that.  Hey, diverse 'hood, diverse food, right? Can you dig an Imperial roll with your Denver Omelette with a side of grits? Don't be afraid of that VN coffee, y'all.  That stuff is better than rocket fuel.  No jitters.  No worries. The menu is inexpensive, simple, and just enough to get you going.  Looking for ambiance, cloth napkins and a valet? Get the hell outta here! I did take out here for some awesome lemongrass pork chops. A bit schiesty on the meat, but still filing. They're all friendly over here. A dive. A back flip,  / somersault, quadruple gainer, hit your head on the bottom of the pool dive.  Diner food in the a. m. and Vietnamese cuisine in the p. m. , and anything goes at noon.  Honestly, if they added a $ ""Remodeling Fund"" charge to every bill, I would gladly contribute. The people here are very friendly, food inexpensive, and tasty. I wouldn't try to impress a first date here, it's more of a comfortable spot for comforting food. The fried chicken, porkchops, burgers, and chicken sandwiches here are good. I'm pretty sure it's all one family who works here because you definitely get that feel. Which is refreshing especially if you are often at chain corporate ass restaraunts. I've also noticed it's been a neighborhood spot that is thought highly of by residents. I mention this because I remember a guy with his new wife talking to the waitress thanking her for  what shes done for him in the past. He was telling his wife on how he used to go to the mayflower when he used to be homeless and was never mistreated or turned away. When I overheard that I was telling my boyfriend at the time how it seemed as the people here cared about their customers. That's what it seemed like to me anyway. I absolutely love this place!  Their french toast is TO DIE FOR.  Delicious! And their bacon is crispy and not oily.  It's kinda like eating chips.  The place is inexpensive and the main lady that takes orders is very nice.  Although, their vietnamese food probably isn't the best because my friend found an ant in her pho. What a funky little place!  Lemon grass chicken with french toast?  Admittedly, the lemon grass chicken was pretty stellar.  I can't say that it looked like the cleanest place around, but the food was good and the atmosphere is definitely quirky.  Not sure I'd go out of my way to go back there but I wouldn't run screaming, either. Where else can you have Pho (without MSG!) with a club sandwich on the side? The neon Pho sign is what caught my eye, but what keeps me coming back is Lil' Kim cooks with fresh ingredients and she always remembers that I need scissors to cut up my noodles. It gets really crowded on the weekends during breakfast time. And on the weekdays, it  seems to be pretty popular among the City College kids. Lemon grass chicken and pancakes?  Wha?  My cousin and his wife (and their ridiculously cute daughter) recommended this place for brunch. I swear I thought they were lying when they told me, ""They serve diner food in the morning and vietnamese at night"". . . but it's true!I had the french toast, which was seriously good, very fresh and not too eggy, served with real maple syrup.  My friend had the lemon grass chicken and pancakes a very large breakfast!  Their prices are great and the owners are super nice they even made a special dish (scrambled eggs and avocado) for my lil' couslet.  So nice! :) It's a great little mom and pop place where you can find a decent breakfast and pho in one place. My brother and I enjoy going there because they have amazing pork chops and grits. The service is great (the ladies are very attentive and never leave your coffee cup empty!) and you can't beat the price! The ambiance isn't what this place is all about. It's a neighborhood restaurant that serves good food simple food at a great deal. I love this place.  I go for breakfast about once a week to this family run diner.  They serve cheap standard american breakfast and lunch plus vietnamese fare. I don't agree with the other reviewer who claims that the place is dirty.  Sure, the decor hasn't been updated and the wall decorations don't get cleaned much, but where it counts I see them clean all the time.  I also like their customer service: very friendly.  The clientel is a great racial mix.  I enjoy that everyone is represented. (.  Stars) Man, this place is a local spot and is the reason why I support it. . . decent for a greasy, cheap breakfast.  Although thinking about it. . . don't expect too much, even for that. The French Toast, Eggs and Porky Chops were so yummy. Especially the french toast! I see that some are saying its not the cleanest, eh, its cleaner than some of the other asian places in SF I had eaten at this past weekend (eg. D&A Cafe, drty)At least this place had some good food. I would definately go back again! I'm pretty fond of this place. It's not the cleanest, but it has charm; contrary to most not so clean Asian run restaurants in this town, that are plain dirty, but lack charm. The Pho is great, best broth in town. The breakfast is your common american eggs, bacon, pancakes etc. I've been there only once, but I pretty much enjoyed myself. They're also one of the friendliest places I've been to in this city. If greasy, American beakfast and Vietnamese beef broth is what you like, then you should definitely give this place a whirl."|3|91|2|Routine| Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 10/31/2013 ] High risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 10/31/2013 ]

The variety of dishes available makes it difficult, but not impossible to find the right combination of the selection of meats to accompany a plate of rice, beans and other condiments to satisfy your hunger.

And, you can eat the tacos with your hands as they prep them correctly.  Burritos are also wrapped properly.  NO MESS. My only real complaint isn't the fault of the restaurant, but rather, the neighborhood.  Every time my partner and I come here to eat, some homeless person from off the street usually walks in up to our table to ask for a handout.  That's annoying. (yeah, yeah, I know.  They're homeless.  But sometimes I just want to enjoy my meal without trying to save the world from itself) best mexican food in sf! Best Al Pastor I've had in San Francisco. Friendly service, cheap, and fast. Avoided this restaurant for years due to its location right by the Safeway parking lot. Not any longer. . . I go for the Chile Verde burrito or plate. It's not high end cuisine, but I've never been disappointed with the quality or serving of my food. A regular and good burrito place. Should I venture further off into the menu, I'll update and let you know what I experience. Staff is always pleasant with me; my smiles get returned. This is my go to Mexican Restaurant in Bernal Heights. Good food, decent service, good price. The carnitas here is some of the best in the city, crunch with lots of flavor. The lengua, and cabeza are also tasty, and a regular burrito is less than $. Try their smoked chipolte salsa as well, lots of flavor without being to hot. The burritos are great, the enchilada plates are filling, the guacamole is fantastic, and the chips are thick and crunchy!  The food is always reliable, and the price is great.  Parking is easy at the Safeway parking lot.  It's a great local neighborhood place.  Love it!"|5|87|4|Routine| Improper food storage  [ date violation corrected: 8/29/2013 ] High risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 8/29/2013 ] Low risk vermin infestation  [ date violation corrected: 8/29/2013 ] Wiping cloths not clean or properly stored or inadequate sanitizer  [ date violation corrected: 8/29/2013 ]

Altena Restaurant 4|4.0|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|39|4|3.73076923077|" I live nearby, and to me this is the tastiest and most consistent of the local taquerias.  The highlight for me is the Burrito Mojado  their sauce kills the nearby Taqueria Cancun's sauce.  the restaurant is clean, the service is quick, and they are open late. Pros:. Decent prices for Mexican food in the city.  . All of the food I have had here looked and tasted great.  . Very quick service, my food was served to me almost immediately even though the place was busy.  . Located on the southern side of mission street it is away from the touristy hustle and bustle of northern mission street making it much easier to get to.  . A nearby safeway provides easy parking. . Unlike many taquerias in the mission district this place was clean and very well maintained.    Cons:.  Although the food was great like many taquerias much of it has already been prepared. Bottom line: If you are looking for cheap, fast, and authentic Mexican food then this taqueria is the right place for you.  Although Altena offers pretty much the same menu as all the other taquerias in the area the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the restaurant set it apart. The taqueria is operated by same owner of the Mission and nd location. But I enjoyed this location better than the other location. The food is better. Neighborhood is cleaner. The staffs are friendlier. But the décor from this location is a bit blander with a lack of any cultural knick knacks. But I don't care; I just want to eat.  With all the recent unhealthy meals that I've been eating, I was craving for Super Nacho. For $. , I get a choice of meat, (I got the carnitas), scoops of unhealthy guacamole, sour cream, cheese, refried beans, chopped scallions and salsa over a bunch of crunchy corn tortilla chips. The toppings on top of the chip's nest were tasty and stayed crunchy with all the unhealthy crap on top. I also enjoyed my dish with an iced cold MGD bottle for $. . The taqueria is located next to the Safeway. Finding this place is effortless. Cash only! I wanted something quick and cheap. Definitely an experience. The night I went in, there were a host of various characters (a mariachi band on break, a mid aged man at the front corner table singing a low toned ballad to himself and surrounding patrons who gave a wink and a smile when I exited, etc. ) Hilarious! Quite entertaining, none the less. Anyway, I ordered two veggie tacos which came with stone ground tortilla chips and several mini containers of salsa. It was actually pretty good. I spent less than $ and it was quite filling. For a quick cheap decent meal in the neighborhood, I would definitely go again. Cheap and delicious! I happened to find this place late one night and it seriously turned out to be the best quesadila ever! The quesadilla was pretty a small burrito. I think there is a regular one and some type of supreme one, go with the supreme! It includes cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and a whole lot of goodness! I thought the chips and salsa were again solidI decided to try their Carne Asada Torta, but this time, it came with bits and pieces of Carne Asada. Which was completely different from what I had previously where there were whole chunks. Again, still a solid and cheap place, it was enjoyable, but the food was better in my previous experience This place is awesome!  I agree with Brittney G. , my wife is vegetarian and we usually split a $.  veggie burrito which fills both of us up; Also great b/c they are open late and they are always super fast and nice.  It is near our apt and we stop by here alot, I've tried the chicken/steak burritos, but wouldn't recommend it, so based solely on the veggie I give it a . Not an especially spectacular burrito, but it certainly knows how to TCB. It is tasty, cheap ( super burritos will run you less than $) and big as all get out. Can't find a bad thing to say about it. Comes out quickly, too. The place is pretty much textbook taqueria inside: advertisement posters for Mexican beers featuring skanky chicks in stiletto heels and mini dresses, handwritten signage all in Spanish, and one of those picture menus with weirdly lit photos that make the food look less appetizing than in real life. The crowning touch is the series of portraits of Aztec emperors hanging along the  longest walls. My personal favorite is Itzcoatl, a. k. a. ""El Serpiente de Obsidiana"". Best. Nickname. Ever. Bonus Review: One star for Pau Gasol's disgusting armpit of a face. Great tacos and salsa. . . The grilled chicken is tasty and the lengua doesn't taste too gamey. . . Tacos are a bit pricey, especially with Gran Taco Loco a few doors down selling them for only a dollar each. . . awesome super carne asada burrito. damn. . the asada. I know that cancun is right down the street, and if i'm in the mood for al pastor, I'm probably going there, but the asada reminds me of my grandmother's . . . but it's not quite that amazing. I'll give you that the nacho cheese isn't the greatest, but they nail the spanish rice. and the chicken enchiladas, oh and the torta de asada are excellent. I had the worst nachos I've ever had in my life in this place the other night.  Why on earth would anyone use that orange fake liquid cheese in a restaurant?  Even in a dingy taqueria?  Need I say more?  I picked at it for a few minutes, trying to salvage a few beans from the miasmal swirl, and then gave up.  See my uploaded photo as evidence. Because of all the other positive reviews, I will dare ONE last time to try a burrito. Altena takes the my prize for the best quesadilla in SF.  Solid food and a low price (this place is like a half dollar sign).  Jukebox is always playing your favorite norteño hits.  Don't park in the safeway lot, though.  Those a holes will ticket you even if you go eat after shopping there (it was also the last time I've ever shopped there). been a huge fan of this spot at first because i could get some food quickly after hittin up the safeway right next door. nothin all that special about this joint compared to others but i do dig the atmosphere inside. lots of tables and chairs, and they usually have the juke box blasting. everytime ive been there, there has been plenty of drunk dudes hanging out (but the festive type, the type that you actually enjoy talking to while waiting for your food). sounds odd, but im puttin this down as a perk for this joint. anyways, they have all the standard stuff from burritos to nachos to fajitas to quesadillas and they're all average if not better. i will say that if i had the choice id probably rather mess with cancun, but if im in bernal this place always crosses my mind. Good lord how many altenas do they have in the mission!?  Went to review this place and like  altenas popped up.  Anyway, I have to say I love this place.  This was the very first restaurant I went to when I first moved to the city.  I'm from so cal so I'm down with the taquerias.  This place is especially awesome because it was close to my pad and open late!  YES!  Food I don't have to make late at night.  So yes. . . anything I have gotten there. . . no matter what it is has always met or exceeded my expectations.  I've had soup with my sick friend, tacos, quesadillas, fajitas.  You name it.  I tear it all up!  If it says anything about the food (which is the whole purpose of this review), nothing goes untouched.  Its cheap and fast and tastes good and open late (yes this is a major plus for me).  Plus you can get away with parking next door at safeway for   min and leave with you your food and car intact.    Check it out peeps This is the biggest, most veggie filled veggie taco I've ever gotten in SF:two corn torillaspinto beansricecheesesour creamlettucesalsacilantrocarrotseven a slice of tomatoThere is no way you could pick up this veggie taco and eat it with your hands. Fork required. You'd be hard pressed to find a more filling meat free taco in the area. I wonder why no one is ever in here? Why would anyone go to Cancun when you can go to La Altena? Probably because they are too drunk to walk half a block. This place rocks. Its my go to burrito in Bernal Heights. And its one of the last burritos for under five bucks. Are you kidding me? I get change from a five? Plus you can easily park in Safeway and get away with it for five minutes. Word to the wise, I think they use lard in the refried beans, so if you are veggie or just squeamish (you wuss) go for the black beans. The salsa is pretty righteous. I think its more on the Salvadorean end of the spectrum, which I prefer. Another warning, don't be surprised to be the only gringo.  / stars. Was going to Cancun, but couldn't find parking, so ended up here. Great for burrito after late night drinking. Not a gringo in sight. Always a good sign.  I asked for a wheat tortilla, but this ain't no gringo burrito place. (you won't find the sun dried tomato pesto tortilla here)They put it on a flour tortilla, which of course, is made from wheat, so technically, I got what I want. Pollo Asado grilled to perfection. Excellent spicy salsa. Fresh tortilla chips. Hit the spot! Pleasant service. Spartan latin american decor. Mexican soap opera blaring overhead. Nice. Cancun is pretty overrated anyway. This was arguably a better burrito. Came here after a drunken night with coworkers.  I had a carne asada taco and an al pastor taco.  The carne asada was grilled perfectly and was very flavorful.  They put a lot of cilantro which I love.  However the al pastor was very disappointing.  The taco didn't even taste like pork.  The tacos are pretty massive though.  Stay away from the pork. My friend got a quesadilla from this place that was overloaded w. guacamole (guac, not avocado) and sour cream (sour cream inside a quesadilla?  I would've thought on the side. . . . . ).  I told her not to go here, but she'd forgotten. I want this place to be better, but will never go back to find out if they've improved. Offset the disappointment that was Cilantro (yelp. com/biz/cilantro me…). Massive, massive burrito, tons of grilled chicken (and not an extra splash of oil in site), lettuce at no charge, credit cards accepted, dirt cheap prices ($.  for this goodness) and super friendly service. Once again Mission/Bernal taquerias show the rest how it's done. Not so good. I was in the mood for Mexican and since my gurl was on the phone I rolled around checking different potentials.                                                                            I settled on La Altena. Not really for any particular reason other than I was hungry and found a parking spot right in front. The place was clean looking and the service was fast. I order a chicken torta ahogada. . . basically a mexican sandwich(refried beans, meat of choice, avocado, maybe some onions) drowned in red sauce. The girl ordered a coctel de camaron.  We also order two tacos: al pastor and lengua. The flavoring was just off on my torta. I felt like it was missing spices. The salsa was just kinda bland. The girls coctel tasted like they rinsed the shrimp and then used that same water to make the cocktail. Again the cocktail lacked spices and flavor and no amount of Tapatio could right it! Even though we paid $ for it, we couldn't finish it ; (The al pastor tacos was the best thing we had, but even then not enough to bring me back. The taco de lengua was a bit gamey, which is characteristic of it being slightly old or just overcooked. Bo. . . . not a good dining experience and I so wanted good mexican food. When we got home I poured us both two shots of Jose Cuervao Tradicional(this stuff is the bomb) just to make sure we killed any stomach viruses we might have picked up. I got some super nachos here and they were SUPER, as in huge.  I couldn't finish them all.  It was just a massive pile of food.  way more than any burrito anywhere.  Yum. personally this place beats out Can cun, the food is fresher and of higher quality and the tortas are amazing.  but really, how hard is it to screw up a sandwich?  i suggest the pollo asada.  i pretty much only go here now when im in my neighborhood this is now my favorite burrito joint in the city. i have not tried anything else here, because the burritos are so good. i get the super burrito, with chicken or carne asada. all the flavors and ingredients are perfectly balanced. they're generous with the meat, and with the spices. taqueria cancun has a more fresh tasting burrito, but it seems bland compared to la altena. i eat half the burrito, then save the other half for later. it still tastes fantastic warmed up in the toaster oven. this burrito made me sweat. meat density was high, price was low, spice levels were awesome. not much to look at on the inside, but it's what you take away that counts. This is our favorite taqueria in the city. Get a veggie burrito (super, picante, no rice) and a small container of guacamole, it will only be $.  or so, and it's so big that two people can easily split this. The nachos are out of control and fantastic. Be careful when you are returning home after the bars close (the restaurant stays open until am on weekends), you may find yourself getting an order of nachos to go which you will voraciously devour. It must be   calories of pure mexican greatness. This place looks a little odd from the outside, the music is always blaring or they have spanish soaps or news on. Put some money in the jukebox and hit random buttons until you've selected all the songs. Then sit back, eat your delicious cheap food, listen to the wonderous sounds of mexico, and dwell on your good fortune."|5|92|2|Routine| Inadequate food safety knowledge or lack of certified food safety manager  [ date violation corrected: 4/4/2012 ] Moderate risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 4/4/2012 ]
Great Saigon Restaurant 0|3.5|Vietnamese in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|69|0|3.4|" Really sucks. I don't even know how they have stayed open! Worst Vietnamese restaurant ever! And they charged me $ for extra blood in my Bun Bo Hue, which was the worst I have ever had btw. Thai tea was watered down, nothing good! Went here for lunch yesterday and we were able to be seated quickly.  My mom ordered the crab and pork noodle soup. . . but she couldn't find any crab (not ordering that again). I ordered chicken and mixed veggies rice plate  pretty good! May I add. .  tge place was very tight and small, not ideal to go with + people. Very welcoming and attentive staff. Ordered vermicelli rice noodles with BBQ pork and imperial rolls. Big portion but the BBQ pork and rolls were smaller than I thought. Very good though! They give way too big of portions. Noodles for days. It's a little overwhelming. This place is decent priced and it takes card!Only problem I have with them is their soup isn't very consistent. Sometimes it's got way too much star anise, other times it's not as flavorful. It's kind of a toss up. $.  lemongrass pork vermicelli, less than  min wait. Very small shopb about  tables? set pretty close together. Staff was very nice. Clean restaurant. Nice decor as well. Honestly have to say they made the dish really well. The pork was marinated well and the meat wasn't burnt. Fish sauce tasted like it had a BIT of sriracha in it. When I opened my takeout box, I was like WOW! Two things: . huge full box. . very little meat. If they didn't skimp on the meat, I would have given them  stars. Sorry but I like my meat. For $, better be a mound and not a small handful! I gave this place  stars because I found hair in my food and I kindly told them about it. She took my plate and then brought it right out that she took the hair out. I didnt make a big deal because the food was good. The pork chop was real good. Also, get their fresh lemon drink. Great Food!  Had a great bowl of Pho. Loved the imperial rolls. Prices were great and service very quick. I was well pleased I came here for lunch the other day per co workers suggestion.  I ordered the chicken pho and I have to say the pho had a ""lightness"" to it that I enjoyed very much compared to the majority of other places where I ordered this.  I also really liked the type of noodles they served.  It was very thin, like the vermicelli rice noodle we would get at a Chinese restaurant but still taste like the regular pho.  Very interesting, I thought. Likely will return.  At the very least I will like to see what there the soup for their beef pho is like. Food was overpriced and mediocre. On the bright side, food comes very quickly and the restaurant looks pretty clean. All I have to say is. . crab. noodle. soup. OMG, SO GOOD! It doesn't have crab chunks, so don't be fooled. It does have pork, and my oh my will it fill you up even on your hungriest days. About $ with tax, and the lunch crowd is always poppin in this place. The waitresses are super friendly, but super busy. I've also tried a few other dishes, and they were very delicious as well. I'd say this is your best bet if you'd like to try Vietnamese food, or just want a good bowl of pho. Highly recommend this place. P. S.

Great Saigon Restaurant 1|3.5|Vietnamese in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|69|1|3.7|" Great on a cold day. The Vietnamese pancake is bomb! Slightly sticky tables, and pho is going to be a bit oily, but the broth is really good. It's a little more expensive here compared to other Vietnamese restaurants.  I've eaten at over  Vietnamese restaurants and this place was definitely below average. Just to clarify, for me, Vietnamese food is just whatevers.  So I never have high expectations.  I usually want something soupy, quick, and affordable.  But this place. . . it was not even close to mediocre. When they say it's a beef noodle soup on the menu, make sure you ask what else is in it!  Mine was spicy beef noodle soup and it came with pork feet and pork blood too. . . . . . . . . The noodles are bad here.  I had like  TINY pieces of beef in a huge bowl.  I stared at it for  minutes, I waved over the waitress and I was like, what's this?  Why is there no meat?  Well of course with their broken English, they didn't know what I was talking about.  Or maybe they were playing dumb.  Anyway, pho with no meat?  I was ready to walk out. The second time I came I had the shredded chicken soup.  Broth was good.  Noodles were better this time.  But again, I got just  small pieces of shredded chicken meat.  My meal was really just noodles and soup.   small pieces of chicken doesn't even fill half of my mouth if I stuff all of them in at once. . . . . I'm SO DISAPPOINTED.  Not coming back. O speaking of broken English. .  I asked for more napkins and they gave me pepper.  I asked for a piece of scratch paper to scribble some things down (gesturing with pen in hand) and they brought me more pepper. . . Haha. Good, cheap Vietnamese near FiDi, Chinatown, and North Beach. Portions are good size and the meals are cheap and tasty. Pho is legit. Clay pots are legit and the combo plates are pretty good too. Most meals are under $. . Cheap and tasty. What more can one ask?  My old standby in the area is the House of Nanking, but I was on an extreme budget so I was browsing for something that cost next to nothing. Well, I found it with their hot and crunchy BBQ chicken Vietnamese sandwich for only $. !  Can't tell you about anything else on the menu, but if everything else is as good as the sandwich. This place is a find! I was walking with a friend around dinnertime in sf on Kearny street and I was looking for a good place to eat. Since fellow yelpers seemed to agree that this was a good place, and I was craving phò, I decided to go to this restaurant. We were looking at the menu options, which were posted on the front of the restaurant, and the lady(the owner) asked us if we would like to try some Vietnamese food. The food:I decided to order the empirical rolls for an appetizer. They were okay. Not great. They tasted dry and not very fresh. The sauce was good but the rolls themselves seemed very overcooked and not very fresh. For the entrée I got the sautéed beef noodle soup. Great choice! It made up for the rather dry and tasteless rolls. The beef was delicious and so were the noodles. It had some tomatoes which were alright. The rest of the vegetables were tasty. It had a little bit of a spicy kick but nothing compared to some foods I've had in the past. The service:The lady was really polite and helpful. I had to ask for more water, but overall the service was pretty good. Facilities:Seemed to be well kept and clean. The bathroom is really small and the sink seems to be designed for a very small person. I could barely seem to wash my hands in it. Never in my life have I seen such a small sink. I would come here again for the phò! For no apparent reason at all, I didn't feel like eating today. It's completely out of character considering I would normally fantasize about trying something new for lunch, especially after having a dull breakfast of cereal or yogurt. But you gotta eat, so what do you do? Play 'food volley' with your co worker who's in the same funk. After  minutes of food suggestions back and forth, Vietnamese food struck a chord with both of us. (you can tell work is a huge priority for us) =)Enter Great Saigon, a new place that we both haven't gone to yet and it is close to the office, next to the Quickly I frequently visit. The restaurant has good reviews on Yelp so why not? Beef pho was on my co worker's mind but I couldn't get past the clay pot rice (so authentically Vietnamese. . . NOT), it draws me in like a moth to a flame. I had a spoon of the pho broth and it was very good, not too salty and very flavorful. My clay pot rice shows up and looks and sounds terrific. (if you want neighboring tables to stare at you, order the clay pot rice and people eating their silent bowls of noodle soup and vermicelli bowls will stop and marvel at your clay pot rice sizzling and steaming in front of you) The clay pot is loaded with crunchy burnt rice, chicken, shrimp, Chinese sausage, onions and mushrooms. A craving well satisfied. Of course, this dish can't compare to the original creation in China, but walking  minutes to this restaurant beats a  hour flight back to the motherland. Sorry, I couldn't get a photo of the Beef Pho, my co worker pho' blocked me; pretty pho'd up if you ask me. I made her buy her own Quickly drink. =P Unfortunately greatly disappointed in the place, I'm Vietnamese and the food here is definitely not Vietnamese. Pho has too many Chinese spices and even curry taste, taste like Indian Chinese soup. The cha gio( spring roll) are the size of a toothpick, more rice wrap than filling. I would not recommend the place, go down the street to the Vietnamese restaurant, it look a bit sketchy but more authentic than here. I will be back again and again to this Pho house. The Pho broth has more cinnamon than I am used to but that is part of the charm of Vietnamese food. Although the recipes have a base set of core ingredients  Vietnamese cooks add their own special flair to make the dish their own. If you ever visit Vietnam on your travels if you get Pho from Hanoi or Hue or Saigon they will all taste slightly different but all will be delicious. The fresh spring rolls were huge and delicious. I will be back again and again whenever I stay in downtown SFO. I'm there every week with my co workers. Love the E Sup! (The special beef. ) The portion is huge and delicious. I don't really remember how the other items taste because it has been a while since I got anything but the special beef  number . My parents and friends come in from abroad and this is one of the places I bring them every time. I think prices have gone up since some of the reviews on this place. I got a claypot because I had been craving one for awhile. My friend got a pho, which was quite a generous portion. The claypot I got was very flavorful, but it was deceivingly small compared to what I was thinking in my head, and the rice is not served in the bowl either, which is what I had been hoping for. They give you steamed rice on the side of the claypot. The meat and onions in the claypot were really good, just the amount of saltiness that you want to eat a bite of rice, so that you can continue to eat more goodness. But, I was disappointed with the amount of other vegetables in the pot. It was essentially just meat and onions, lots of onions. I wish there had been something else to break up the monotony of meat, because there are only so many onions that I can eat. But, for meat lovers, this may be the spot for you! bbq chicken with imperial roll and rice noodle taste really good. I just wish the imperial rolls are larger, but for the price it may be too much to ask. Came here with a girl friend yesterday after work for a casual dinner.  I got the bbq beef with grilled shrimp over vermecelli and she got the bbq pork with imperial rolls over vermecelli.  Both amazing!  The food is fresh, non greasy, and has great taste!  Will definitely recommend and be back again! Their pho is delicious if you are looking for hot noodle soup with meat  especially on cold days when the fog comes withering in!I ordered up their beef balls with rare steak in rice noodle soup and it simply hit the spot while also fulfilling my pho craving!Their imperial rolls can be improved.  It was not the usual meaty packed rolls that I like, but these egg rolls were rather thin.  I didn't care for it at all.  However, do try or order it if you are craving for egg rolls!They only take cash.  The restaurant is small and cozy with friendly servers. Good food at reasonable prices.  For some reason this place isn't as busy (yet) as very similar Vietnamese places nearby, which is fine with me.  The service has been good everytime I've eaten here and the food is good.  The combo plates are just right with a good mix of food but the pho is probably the best deal.  The ""Special Pho"" is the typical everything beef but without the tripe that so many other places load up on  this is how I prefer it. Give this place a try. seriously good lunch spot. the food here is delicious and the prices are very reasonable.  for a large lunch portion, you get a good sample of food with their combo plates.  their bun rieu is very good, they don't skimp on the noodlesmy fav is combo c, a little bit of everything under $sai's is closer to work, but it's worth the walk to great saigon just for those two items i mentioned above.  service is ok, but since they aren't outwardly rude and they are always swamped, i try not to hold that against themlooking forward to my next noodle fix :) love this place.  so many options, good quality and inexpensive, quick friendly service. I would recommend # satay beef pho (a bit spicy), any of the clay pots, veggie rolls, mongolian beef, i don't really like vermicilli bowls but their vermicilli bowl with half chicken/shrimp is delicious. Love this place.  The portions are very generous and the staff is extremely friendly.  They are one of the few Asian restaurants that take card and not exclusively cash.  Prices are very cheap  less than $ per person.  I would recommend the crispy imperial rolls, the beef pho and their chicken and vegetable rice dish.  After sampling several Vietnamese pho restaurants around the area (My Canh, Vietnam, etc. ), I would say the pho broth here is more on the salty side.  I noticed grounded black pepper in their broth  which I personally love because it gives an extra kick.  However, this subtle nuance is something to take note of. Conclusion: for how inexpensive this place is, there's no excuse not to give it a try Hmn. . Let the boyfriend go order Chinese tonight when we checked into our hotel.  Oops. . He picked Vietnamese. A place that makes excellent Pho. But the combo fried rice was not even fried. Just steamed rice with bay shrimp, cheap chicken and beef, and some veggies. Totally bland. So was the small portion of Mongolian beef. But hey the dog liked it. . LUNCH ONLY Quick serviceGood pricesHUGE portions (it's only one size for pho)Broth was very good, chicken was very juicyGood, quick lunch spot! We stumbled across this place while wandering around Chinatown. The food was amazing, and the service was great, and even better for the prices. This restaurant is owned and operated by Chinese, so they might not understand you if you bust out your Vietnamese."|5|90|3|Routine| Inadequate warewashing facilities or equipment  [ date violation corrected: 2/11/2014 ] Inadequately cleaned or sanitized food contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 2/11/2014 ] Foods not protected from contamination  [ date violation corrected: 2/11/2014 ]
Great Saigon Restaurant 2|3.5|Vietnamese in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|69|2|3.77777777778| Bottom Line: Good vietnamese cuisine smack in the middle of town for reasonable prices. After passing Quickly's not far from here, my friend and I decided to come here since it had been a while since we've had vietnamese food. For SF, I thought this was surprisingly cheap. My meal came out to be under  dollars (seems like a rarity here). I had the House Special Beef Noodle Soup (first one on the menu when you look for Pho). For being a guy in Indiana without Pho for the longest time, I was pretty satisfied with the Pho I had here, especially when it doesn't really put a dent in the wallet. Would come here again. I often get take out from this place for lunch. It's a convenient location and their spring rolls (both shrimp and vegetarian) are soo good. I tried their chicken pho last week and was sadly unimpressed. The broth was pretty bland. Sometimes it takes a while to get my order (even when it's just an order of spring rolls) but it does seem like they are always busy during lunch. I was walking by here on my lunch break and was drawn in by how packed the restaurant was in comparison to its neighbors.  I ordered a # clay pot. I wasn't very impressed with it and was only going to give the place  stars but the service was excellent.  I even left my headphones inside and they found me outside to return them.  The soup on my neighbors bowl looked amazing so I'll be back next week to try it. Overall: quick and good service, average food at cheap prices. This place is right across the street from my work, which makes it easily accessible. Take out takes about  minutes. Note: It is packed around :pm. I went there for the first time today and ordered the curry beef stew pho. The broth tasted good, but the meat was not my thing. I'm a texture person and the meat was mostly fat and looked veiny and odd. The container they put the food in to go was way too small to eat out of. I ended up spilling all over the place. I would eat here again, but I would try maybe the chicken instead. Or even one of the vermicelli plates. Until next time. . . . . We stumbled across this place while wandering around Chinatown. The food was amazing, and the service was great, and even better for the prices. I'm only in town for a week, but I plan on returning at least once more during this trip. Just had dinner here tonight. Nothing really wowed me. I was disappointed with over all overall meal. I ordered the # (imperial rolls, # (combo soup) and a iced coffee. The rolls are smaller here than in other places I've been to. And there was not enough lettuce to wrap my rolls. There is not enough water with the condensed milk. The coffee was too strong to enjoy so I watered it downed with the funky tap ice water. The soup portion was huge but it lacked in spice/flavor. There was salt but it lacked the richness great pho has. Also, the jalopeno pepper were not cut in small pieces. I took a huge bite of the peper and torched my tongue. It did satisfy my search for comfort from the  degree weather. I did not pack wisely for this trip to Sf and walked here from union square with t shirt and jeans. They charged too much money. They gave too much noodles on my lemon grass chicken vermicelli there was a lot of sauce at the bottom of my plate. And when we ordered a side of fried chicken, they only gave us chicken wings! They charged .  for every refill. The water they served had a weird taste to it. I don't think I'll come here again. EXCELLENT. I've lived in North Beach for + years, there are  restaurants I go to consistently and this is one of them. I used to drive all the way over to the Sunset or Daly City for good Vietnamese soup, and this place is even better than those. It's not high class, but it's good food, good prices, and authentic. Best part: you can be proud not to be part of House of Nanking herd next door.|5|93|1|Routine| Unclean hands or improper use of gloves  [ date violation corrected: 1/30/2013 ]
Great Saigon Restaurant 3|3.5|Vietnamese in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|69|3|3.76923076923| If there is anything great about saigon, you definitely won't find it there. Ordered chicken salad, the guy with prison tattoos took my order and soon I had it in my possession. The chicken meat tasted awful, just old boiled meat from like rib cage or something similar. Trip to bathroom later, just avoid it. Not worth the risk I came here twice this week for lunch and loved the Vietnamese Clay Pot rice but wasn't that impressed with the seafood noodle soup.  The clay pot was flavorful and good portions for a good price, but the noodle soup had cheap ingredients and not much flavor.  Get's really busy during lunch and the service could take some time.  Overall I would recommend for an affordable lunch. I  come here at least one to two times a week for lunch. All of the dishes I have tried have always been delicious and worth it. The pricing of their dishes is very cheap to fair. I feel the quality here is way above Sai's. I would definitely recommend coming here if you are in the area. for $.  i highly recommend the clay pot. If the line at Sai's is crazy long, it might be worth it to walk a couple of blocks up  where you might find a good alternative. Great Saigon Restaurant holds its own against other lunchtime Vietnamese joints. You get big portions here for your money. Big bowls of soul warming noodles and broth are what I've had here and I enjoyed every slurp. The beef pho (yelp. com/biz_photos/kIp…) holds up against other famous luminaries. If you want to switch it up a little, the satay beef noodle soup (yelp. com/biz_photos/kIp…) adds a little spice and crunch  a nice variation from the usual clear pho broths.   Lunch at Great Saigon Restaurant is a good choice considering you get pretty good vietnamese food, and a lot of it, for a couple of dollars less than other places. Worth the extra walk from the Fidi plus I've never been in a lunchtime line here before and they take cards. the food is so great and yummy the price is very cheap and a lot of food too , and the people work there very friendly , i go eat there almost everyday the best restaurant ever it just like my house . The best Pho I've had outside of Ho Chi Minh City! And, I eat a lot of pho. Servers are fast and friendly and attentive. Crispy imperial rolls were very good too. Man, now I feel bad for not getting any sort of bbq'd meat option here.  But, I had #, the special beef noodle soup pho bowl.  $.  for a rather large bowl of noodles, meat, meat with chewy stuff, and meatballs.  The broth was. . . SUPER hot.  I practically burned my tongue from it, but after a little bit, I re tasted the broth, and maybe. . . just maybe it was because my tongue taste buds were gone from my burn or their pho broth just lacks. . flavor.  I didn't taste any super cinnamon taste like what someone else said, nor did I taste super much salt.  Just kinda. . watered down pho like.  Average.  I was sad there wasn't any tripe in the bowl.  But yeah, average pho. They do give tea here though!  In a nice mug, and they walk around with a tea pot refilling it like it were ice water.  Wish I knew beforehand that they did that, cause I was kinda conserving on my tea drinking.  Nice place, clean, sorta average pho, and probably better bbq stuff. Oh! and I did spy beef satay noodle soup on their menu! Mm. .  stars!The food is good, lots of variety like bbq ch. The waitresses are nice (they're chinese; at least, the one's I've encountered don't speak Viet). The place is clean and modern like, even though the store is a bit small. Usually when I come here, it's empty. I just dicovered this gem directly across the street from my office.  Upon lunch at and from there two days in a row I declared I want to get lunch at/from there every day.  So many choices done right, so affordable, meat and seafood grilled to perfection.  How was this under my nose for so long and I'm just dicovering it?!  Thank goodness I did! This place is really good. They're BBQ chicken is really delicious and its pretty cheap for lunch. Small hole in the wall viet restaurant right outside of China Town. Had the beef pho which was pretty darn satisfying. Hooked up quantity and the beef was perfectly grilled and very, very tasty. Definitely some of the best beef I've ever had with any pho. Only complaint is the broth was a little bland. Great prices, very clean, and very, VERY yummy! I think this place is fairly new, so it wasn't too busy. But our waitress, Nancy, was so wonderful and nice, and really took care of us. Definitely recommending to my friends and family!|5|92|2|Routine| Inadequately cleaned or sanitized food contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 1/30/2013 ] Foods not protected from contamination  [ date violation corrected: 1/30/2013 ]
Great Saigon Restaurant 4|3.5|Vietnamese in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|69|4|3.8| I came here twice for a dinner break for a work training near by with some co workers. Definitely, it was worth the pricing and large portions! There were  of us and we ended up helping each other finish the plate.  If I am ever in the area this place is worth going to.  The place is pretty clean and they have good food selection.  I believe I picked combo B with the BBQ beef.  The second time I ordered was the Spicy Sesame Chicken.  Pretty good too but it was too much to finish.  It was worth my experience. =) Only tried their beef noodle once but I will never come back. TOO MUCH MSG!   MSG is not very everything. Good soup base is made of good ingredients plus time and patience not only adding MSG! this place was chosen randomly as we were attempting to have dinner at another restaurant nearby.  we decided to give this place a try. . . i ordered their bbq chicken and imperial rolls w/ vemicelli noodles and an order of chicken fried rice. . . it was both VERY good! i got the bbq pork salad which was delicious (though hard to go wrong. . )the salad was a little too flavourful though. there was too much salt/vinegar and i was starting to get sick towards the end. but overall very enjoyable lunch. i bought it to go and it took ~ minutes for me to get my order. . they have a small kitchen so if you're eating with a big group of people (we had about ), there's gonna be a long wait if you're getting lots of grilled things. I had a solid lunch here. I ordered one of the beef phos which was good & came out fast ,   although they don't give you the side plate with sprouts , jalapenos ,and basil .  Cleaner than Vietnam up the street  on broadway.   Definitely a mix of chinese / vietnamese I don't think Ive seen fried shrimp at a vietnamese restaurant before.  Place is relatively inexpensive also.  I would come again. This place took a long time to open up. . . we still miss the old place. It's new and cleaner but the setup is about the same.  It was empty when we walked in, which is what we wanted  away from the crowds.  The menu has the basic Vietnamese items, as well as a few Thai dishes and some Chinese ones.  Their focus seems more on the BBQ items. We wanted hot soup noodles  as soon as hubby pointed out they had Bun Bo Hue, I was done.  Of course, that doesn't stop me from going through the menu.  What we had:Shrimp and pork spring roll  $.   you can two chunky ones cut into halves with a bowl of very gooey peanut butter sauce, which I really didn't care for.  The roll itself was good, the bbq pork adds a nice flavor. Special beef noodle  $.   hubby had this.  The soup was on the salty side and too much of a cinnamon taste.  Unlike other places, there's no choice on size.  Instead of the white bowls at other places, they serve in a black bowl w/ red interior  reminds us more of Japanese.  Same goes for the spoons at the table. Bun Bo Hue  $.   see photo.  I asked for extra extra spicy, as I always do everywhere else.  As you can see, it's less spicy than other places standard.  Very disappointed.  I asked if they can give me some hot sauce on the side and got a bowl of the orange tart chili sauce.  They don't have the authentic sides with the banana flowers but at least they have finely shredded cabbage in its place.  Taste was ok.  They were generous in the ingredients  there were  cubes of pork blood,  pieces of pig feet and a few pieces of beef shank.  We noticed the lady behind the counter is one we've seen at the Vallejo location  same owner or did she venture out on her own?  If we return, we'll try the clay pot rice and either the curry or satay soup noodles. i've been goin there aleast x now. . the foods taste great,combo plates,bbq pork,beef , egg rolls and the pho too. very clean and friendly service. . would go back soon Above average food (well, maybe not the BBQ beef) and cheap! Love the imperial rolls and the shrimp. I have tried this place twice already. The decor and restaurant is all new, all new fixtures, furniture, and lighting. . . it's really nice and comfortable inside.  They have a lot of menu options as well. What was tried so far:The combo plate B which comes with bbq pork, salad, imperial roll, fried shrimp and rice.  I don't think their imperial roll was that great or their fried shrimp, I didn't care for this.  I'd rather have had a friend egg.  BBQ PORK is really good. The bbq chicken and imperial roll vermicelli bowl bbq chicken was good, very tasty the bowl was also good, they put salad mix as the veggie option along with bean sprouts. Satay seafood noodle soup light and spicy, they put enough satay sauce to give you a hot little kick but not enough to overwhelm the soup lots of good seafood  fish ball, fish cake, shrimp, calamari, immitation crab meat.  good portion of each item DEFINITE repeatRice plate #, bbq pork chop, bbq chicken and fried egg other than they overcooking the egg so there was no runny yolk, this was also a great dish. All in all, the portion sizes are very generous, it's very reasonably priced, it's clean, service is friendly.  This is my favorite pho place in the FIDI/Chinatown area. Will go back to try either the pho or the claypot next time. We happened to walk past this new Vietnamese place and stopped to look at their menu and one of the ladies welcomed us in. The place is all new. . very thing from furniture to floors to fixtures. We tied the BBQ pork sandwich and a BBQ pork combo plate complete with imperial rolls and butterflied  shrimp. Good portions and flavors. The sandwich though was low on filling, no cilantro/pate/daikon. . . which was a bummer. Will go back since they have a ton of different options on their menu.|5|89|2|Routine| Unauthorized or unsafe use of time as a public health control measure  [ date violation corrected: 1/6/2012 ] Inadequately cleaned or sanitized food contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 1/6/2012 ]
Taqueria Mana 0|3.5|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|181|0|3.41666666667|" Quite possibly the worst pork burrito I've ever eaten. The meat was literally unchewable, had to keep spitting it out. Got a few bites in and threw the full thing away. Maybe I just got unlucky, but I can't say I'm eager to ever try that place again. I get the lunch special baby burrito once a week, shredded beef no rice extra beans.  Great customer service! i had an awesome experience here! friendly workers, and AMAZING carnitas! the burrito was bursting with flavor. imho, they're on the same page as burritos in the Mission. i recommend this joint! This might be the worst Mexican food I've ever had. The only reason I tried it was because of the convenience and it was available for online ordering pick up. So the food I ordered: cheese enchilada plate, shrimp plate, carne asada taco, shredded beef super nachos  and chips & salsa. The enchilada sauce was bland like straight from a can, shrimp had no flavor and was over cooked, rice was dry like from days before, nachos didn't have enough chips for the price, and the chips were stale. Overall bad food I general, not coming back. The carne asada super burrito is the best I've had in this area! They are super fast and friendly too, a lunchtime favorite in our office! Good selection of food with American options. Chicken sandwich was yummy and mini tacos were okay. Menu on yelp was very helpful, because it covered the specifics decently. Wall menu had no details. Guy behind counter was giggly. . . He got my order right, so it's cool. Closed sundays. Right below the Bush overpass so you can take the stairs down. Close to liquor stores and bars. This place is awesome!  When I'm not in the mood from a BLT from the liquor & deli nextdoor, I usually come to Taqueria Mana on my lunch break.  The food is always delicious (I've had their tacos and sopas) and you never leave hungry!  The prices are more than reasonable and the staff is always cheerful and friendly.  The salsa they provide on the tables is also incredibly delicious. Note: The noise level is usually quiet, but average with the world cup going on! (: Terrible delivery experience! Ordered a large lunch order for work at  and food took  HOURS to arrive even though the seamless confirmation email said it would only take   min. They also appeared to charge my credit card multiple times and even automatically charged a tip for themselves! Burritos arrived cold. Didn't even come with chips/salsa. They ran out of the Snapples we ordered too. Awful customer service and manager said ""do you still want the food?"" after we had already waited an hour and they hadn't even started making the order. No one from the restaurant called to say it was going to be late. Since the order was for an office event, everyone was hungry and the food came well after the lunch hour. Zero stars. Negative stars! I ordered the carne asada burrito from seamless. com for my lunch order at work. Was the grease seeping through the foil to my desk? Yes Was it delicious? YesI got the OJ on a whim as a 'healthy' chaser, it's fresh squeezed, win! I am conflicted about this place.  Crispy tacos here are excellent: flavorful and tasty. The machaca likewise is great.  The burritos, unfortunately, lack meat and are mostly rice and beans.  After bringing them home for the family a number of times we've concluded this was no fluke and decided to go elsewhere for burritos. When we lived nearby, we ate Taqueria Mana at least twice a week. Quick, good price. If you get chicken, make sure you ask for the grilled chicken. Massive plates of nachos, gigantic burritos. Wish the chips were made in house  my only complaint. This place was pretty good, I got the chicken nachos w/ everything and was very pleased and satisfied. This is more of a .  ratingThey're pretty good but I've had better, I am definitely a fan and will return The guy Screwed up my order. I requested a BLT sandwich and  chicken flautas. I only got  flauta. He tried to get us to order drinks, but walgreen's has $ oz sodas. Therez also a liquor store  stores dwnIve ben here x b. Look for the women workers, more polite and gets the orders correct. Would have bn  stars but if u cant get the order, itz not deservin I've trie the grilled chicken and their carne asada but nothing comes even close to their el pastor. Their tacos are perfect and the baby burrito is perfect as well without making you feel like you ate a brick. They don't sell any beer which is awful but there's a lquor store  feet away : ) I had never been here but I ordered food from Taqueria Mana through Grub Hub. The food arrived earlier than expected, was tasty, the portions generous, and the price right. The mini tacos were delicious and so was the wet burrito. Five stars for fast Mexican food. Found this place on Yelp and saw how close it was to where I work, I thought id give it a shot. After a short .  minutes of walking, I walked up to this restaurant (very easy to miss if you are driving) and stepped inside. I was greeted to a few tables, chairs, colorful decor and friendly staff. I had ordered my food online and paid in advance, the online ordering system is very well organized and user friendly! The staff had my food waiting so after picking it up I walked back to my office and it took me all but  minutes to down the burrito! This place has some really good Mexican food and it def. will be a to go spot for me when I am craving some Mexican food! If you are in the union square/financial district area and want some bomb Mexican food, def. give this place a visit! Amazing chicken tacos fresh and delicious. One of the best pepper hit sauces I've tasted. Not too hit, but a ton of spice and taste. Service is super friendly and food comes out quickly. My burrito was barely filled with anything, / of it was just a tortilla. It was very dry and the carnitas were just  massive chunk that was hard to bite. It was obviously microwaved and not actually cooked. It's a great and cheap place. I like the food there. It's super clean and CHEAP. Good is food. Definitely should try their MANA BURGER! Dropped by for a late night snack after Tunnel Top. Being super buzzed, the baby burritos were the perfect size for one person and the mini tacos and fries were great for sharing with the group. Food was . / but they get a bump for being friendly and quick with filling/affordable portions. Most of the menu starts around $  and costs a little more for add ons, which is pretty good for downtown. Why can't I give this place zero stars?!  We called for a delivery order *the day before* for our :pm staff meeting.  At :, we called and they said sorry for being late, they were really busy.  At :, the meeting was over and still no food.  We called and they apologized, saying that they will start on our order right away.  WTF?!? Absolutely unacceptable!!  Who does that?  Just let us know you're incompetent to fulfill our  burrito order and we'll go somewhere else.  Never again. . . Came here on a rainy night because it was close to our hotel. Really nice people and surprisingly yummy. # super burrito w/carne asade. Worth the walk in the rain! I had the Torta here. It was pretty chewy. I'm not sure if I just ordered the wrong item on their long and extensive list of choices, but it was okay. The meat was pretty chewy and it was diffcult to swallow. I got fries with the torta, but it didn't think it was enough. I suggest serving food in smaller plates if they want to give less fries, because on a bigger plate, you really notice that stuff. My Coworker liked it, and he said he'd come back if he was in the area. Fat tacos. Fat burritos. Simply delicious carne asada everything girl YES!The freshly squeezed orange juice tastes just like when my grandma used to squeeze oranges for OJ for me. It's a dope spot right underneath Bush St, on Stockton outside of Union Square. I've eaten there and have taken out of towners here between   times and never had a complaint."|6|79|6|Routine Inspection| Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils  [ date violation corrected: 9/9/2014 ] Improper storage of equipment utensils or linens  [ date violation corrected: 8/26/2014 ] Food safety certificate or food handler card not available  [ date violation corrected: 8/26/2014 ] Improper cooling methods  [ date violation corrected: 8/26/2014 ] Moderate risk vermin infestation  [ date violation corrected: 8/26/2014 ] Inadequately cleaned or sanitized food contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 8/26/2014 ]
Taqueria Mana 1|3.5|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|181|1|3.8|" Came here for lunch, since it was recommended by a doorman of a hotel nearby. Super burrito was about ~$, and came packed with toppings. I'd guess that it was in in diameter, which comes out to ~. in in radius. The complaint that I have is that it was thick enough that eating the burrito I had different strata of the burrito. (i. e. on the left was cheese, on the right was the meat. . . etc)My meal was very quick to prepare. They do take credit cards. They don't exactly have a large grill, so meat is pre cooked and kept warm. Tortillas are heated and stuff is added. Guacamole was great, should've asked for more. This is the best Mexican food in the district and the people who work there are so friendly. They have a rather extensive menu and the food is reasonably priced. My favorite dish is the steak ranchero plate. Speedy service and quality food, you can't beat that! I got a burrito and it was delicious!  The meat was well flavored and fresh.  Having just moved up from SoCal and expecting Mexican food to not be as good up here (especially in the financial district), I was pleasantly surprised.  The only downside is that their lack of carne asada fries on the menu. :) I work around the corner and have started to frequent this place. I've loved everything I've ordered and they work fairly fast. Veggie Breakfast Burrito  REAL VEGGIES Pressed OJ mixed with Carrot Juice  cheaper than the other places you can get fresh pressed juice around here and big cup, great value basicallyChicken Taco Salad  A lot of food if youre hungryVeggie Quesadilla  Once again, real veggies like sautéed mushrooms, peppers, onions. . . its great Hmm. Coming from Southern California this was a disappointment.  Carnitas was dry, avo was brown, and food lacked flavor. Hot sauce was bomb to say the least. A little restaurant near the tunnel.  Best suited for takeout, though there are a few tables there.  Fish burrito was really great.  A bit pricey, though, at close to $ with tax. Visiting California for business and wanted Mexican. Found this on GPS and looked at reviews. Was a little worried at stars but tried it anyways. I got nachos they were excellent and friend got quesadilla they were both amazing. Best taqueria food in the Financial District. If you work here, then this is all you need to know. No, it isn't as good as the Mission. No, it isn't as convenient as Chipotle. No, they don't have the best salsa/chips/etc. Yes, they have milkshakes and hamburgers on the menu. Yes, this is your best option for Mexican. This is a great place for good Mexican food at great value.   I've had a few items from this spot and they have all been solid.   The sopes are very good. . . . and I too enjoy the chicken caldo.   The food is fresh and has great flavor. This place is great!  I had the ""Super vegetarian nachos"" with black beans and it hit the spot.  Very fast and friendly service.  It is definitely in a random location and has a hole in the wall vibe, particularly from the outside.  Try it out anyway!  I will be back for more. Had them deliver food to our office in SoMa last week and it was spot on. Prices were great and everyone enjoyed the food. I was craving Pozole, so I ended up getting that, but wasn't too impressed with it. I must try their chimichangas next time. Also, I love their online ordering, but you can't substitute or personalize the orders. Inexpensive, close, delivered in / hour (through Eat). . . oh, and the food was unbelievably delicious. The Chili Relleno is a star  barely breaded, 'cuz it's got nothing to hide  deep, dark green chili with tender flesh, and just enough seeds for heat. I may have an inappropriate dream about it. Hire a new delivery boy,  hours to find a door bell is not acceptable! This place is right around from the office, so it's one of my go to's. Food is always good, staff is friendly, and I LOVE their salsa! In the mood for Mexican? That wont cost much? This is your place! Taste good! Fast & local! Last night in SF and I wanted Mexican.  Compared to a lot of places around union Square i didn't want to spend much but want to munch down.  This place hit the spot!! The food was more nutritional and healthy then other greasy Mexican Joints.  What I ordered:Super Quesadilla$. Flour tortilla, cheese, meat, sour cream, and guacamole. Served with rice, beans, sour cream, lettuce, and salsa.  Meat Choices: Boiled Chicken, Barbacoa (Shredded Beef), Carne Asada (Beef), Lengua (Beef Tongue), Grilled Chicken, Carnitas (Pork), Carne Molida (Ground Beef), Chorizo (Mexican Pork Sausage), Chile Verde (Spicy Pork), Pastor (Marinated Pork)The Quesadilla was hot and served fresh! There was more food on my plate than I can handle and best of all it had healthy substitutes! So yummy! I must admit it is in a random spot but I bet you will enjoy as much as I did!"|6|82|6|Routine| Improper thawing methods   [ date violation corrected: 8/19/2014 ] Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils  [ date violation corrected: 8/19/2014 ] Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 8/19/2014 ] Moderate risk vermin infestation  [ date violation corrected: 8/19/2014 ] Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 8/19/2014 ] Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities  [ date violation corrected: 8/19/2014 ]
Taqueria Mana 2|3.5|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|181|2|3.57142857143|" I am from LA so I appreciate some god authentic Mexican food. It has been surprisingly hard to find in SF but I'm so happy I discover this place. I usualy get the carnitas burrito which is delicious and I've also tried the nachos, also really good. Its right under the stockton tunnel near sutter so if you're around union square its really easy to get to. Yum On the bright side, this place is super cheap. And the people are nice, friendly and helpful. Everything pretty much goes downhill from there. I had the big burrito (# on the menu) with carne asada. The meat tasted like it was day old, or maybe worse. It was super dry and nearly rock hard. Not good at all. The rest of the burrito was passable, but the rice and beans had obviously been sitting around for quite a while. The enchilada sauce was okay, but not overly flavorful. The ""salsa"" on the tables had a good kick to it, but absolutely no flavor. It reminded me of an Asian pepper sauce, more than a salsa. The restaurant is kinda dirty and run down and just not all the comfortable. I was really bummed out that THIS was my last meal on this trip to San Francisco. Oh well. . . lesson learned. FINALLY a good Mexican joint. It's right before (or after) the Stockton tunnel depending on which direction you're walking. Food is pretty good, the cashier guys are super nice, and the service is quick. Seriously, what more do you really need?If you work in the area, you can also order online (or just call them too). Big win. Definitely gonna make this my go to Mexican spot for lunch I live in the Mission but work right next to this place and I kinda love it. It's a little greasy, so don't mind the fat and calories.  It's worth it. Also their chocolate shakes with cinnamon are pretty much my favorite thing ever.  So great. ** STARS** relative to:Mexican taqueriasI had the super burrito with carne asada and wasn't impressed. That's too bad because I was expecting a good burrito. The burrito was decent but didn't have me wanting to come back to try other things. The rice in my burrito was not warm, like it had been sitting out for a while, and the texture was gummy and clumpy. The meat was greasy and wasn't of great quality. All in all, I was disappointed with my burrito for $. , and I would go elsewhere to get my burrito fix when I'm in downtown. Breakfast review only here!  The breakfast burrito at Mana barely had egg in it so I started off a bit disappointed.  Then the potatoes were also a bit hard and the burrito overall was a bit dry so I wasn't too impressed with it here.  Hopefully they can improve, but alas, it's not a good option for the breakfast burrito IMHO. . . I don't know what I ordered but the picture on the wall looked good. So, I just said I'll have that. Well, ""that"" was really good. There was so much of it that I couldn't finiish it. Yeah, I'll be a repeat customer."|6|76|8|Routine| Employee eating or smoking  [ date violation corrected: 7/9/2013 ] Permit license or inspection report not posted  [ date violation corrected: 7/9/2013 ] Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities  [ date violation corrected: 7/9/2013 ] Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 7/9/2013 ] Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 7/9/2013 ] Moderate risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 7/9/2013 ] Improper food storage  [ date violation corrected: 7/9/2013 ] Inadequately cleaned or sanitized food contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 7/9/2013 ]
Taqueria Mana 3|3.5|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|181|3|3.84615384615|" Couldn't muster up the energy to leave the house tonight, and I was craving some Mexican food. I searched Mexican on Seamless, and found Taqueria Mana with the best reviews. We ordered a Shrimp Quesadilla and a Steak Ranchero, Coke and a Mango Kerns for $. I wouldn't say it was pricey, but for the quality of the food, I would say it was definitely overpriced. This was subpar mexican food. I've had better TexMex parading as Mexican fare. Everything was flavorless, the rice was overcooked, but underdone (I don't even know how you can accomplish that). The steak was tough and gristly and drowning in tomato paste. Shrimp quesadillas were soggy and the shrimp overcooked. Everything came in paper take out boxes, which were totally soggy and structural unsound by the time they arrived at the house. And a thing about the delivery: the average delivery time is estimated to be between  and  minutes,  yet our food arrived over an hour later, just shy of  minutes. And to top it off, they subbed peach Kerns instead, and didn't even warn me. Needless to say, my little man was disappointed. Cold, flavorless, and unsatisfying. If you have no idea what mexican food is supposed to taste like (mr. New York who gave this place  stars), then you will be pleased with the cheap eats. If you want real mexican food, stop being a pussy and get your ass up and go to the Mission. You'll be sorry you didn't. I was. *grumble* I LOVE THIS PLACE! I've been here once every   weeks for the past  months. I came here when I did a no carbs diet (ordered the fajitas without rice + tortillas), when I stopped caring (Super Burrito with everything and marinated pork), when I decided to cut my portions down (Baby Burrito), and when I decided to try Pescetarianism (Shrimp Burrito). A lot of diet changes in a few months, but Taqueria Mana has always tasted good no matter what I restricted (not restricted) myself from eating. One bowl of Menudo + a can of coke +  small tacos = about $. I got  small carne asada tacos which had a lot of flavor and was good especially with a squirt of lime on top! And the menudo was good, too. The size for the menudo was decent for about $. There's really not much to say. I paid, I got my food piping hot, and that was that. :D Trying this place for the first time, their super burrito is AMAZING.  Best burrito I've had in a long long time, maybe even best in the Bay. Everything me and my coworkers have ordered from here is really good. That says a lot since we have some picky eaters in my office. A simple bean, rice and meat burrito tastes amazing! Not only is the food amazing but the customer service is top notch! These guys made a mistake on my order and corrected it with a smile and exceeded my expectations in terms of correcting their mistake. I've been here many times and there will be many more times! Thanks! Love these guys.  Super tacos and quesadillas are great.  Prices are great too, $ for a super taco.  What a deal!  Perfect for a working gal's lunch.  Everyone is SUPER nice and remembers me when I come in.   My co workers and I all go there all the time.  Oh, and the chicken soup hits the spot like no other, with huge chunks of chicken, not too salty, lots of cilantro, and some nice zing from the lime wedges they give you. Total hole in the wall, but solid home made food for cheap and nice, friendly staff. Oh, and the random stuff on the TV makes the short wait kinda fun. How can a meal that was cooked  minutes ago be cold? I ordered  grilled chicken tacos, when I brought it to my office it was lukewarm. All of their ingredience are ""precooked"", so nothing is grilled to order. They just melt the cheese on the solf tace shell on the grill. I am so glad that ""chipotle"" just opened up. Eventhough it's a chain restaurant, it is way better. . . This is super tasty hole in the wall cheap burrito place near Union Square. I highly recommend Taqueria Mana. . . look for the specials which are impressive deals. Beware of this restaurant! Unfortunately, I received food poisoning from this restaurant on Monday night.  I ordered their chicken burrito. Not only was I severely sick to my stomach for the next  hours, the delivery was  minutes late AND when I called about my delivery, no one spoke any English besides telling me ""Call back  minutes"". Do not order from here. Wow, big portions for the price! I got a wet burrito, so full of carne asada, that it lasted me  lunches. Also got a side of chips, all for a little over $. Not bad. The location is just a bit hidden; you have to take the stairs to get below the pedestrian bridge. this place is close to my work and home, so i come pretty often. not the best mexican food, but pretty good, their salsa is very good too, i usually either get lamb or carne asadathe prices are super cheap. . . decent size burrito $, street style tacos $ In San Fran for work, needed a quick meal as I had just arrived at hotel.  Yelped up casual Mexican near my hotel and found this place.  Steak burrito was excellent, all ingredients pretty high quality.  Could see this as a regular lunch spot for me if I worked in the area.  NYC  particularly Manhattan, lacks solid Mexican food, so was especially enjoyable. I am hooked on PASTOR CALIFORNIA FRIES. I don't think it's on the menu. It's straight up stoner munchie food and yes it's high in anything that will pack those fat on your booty but just sit down and let me tell you about it: Juicy, spicy, pork al pastor salsa guacamole sour cream cheese beanson top of fries. Fatty talk!

Taqueria Mana 4|3.5|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|181|4|3.63636363636|" This is my second time here. The first time I ordered a Chimichanga and I was not tasting anything. . . Is it really supposed to taste like nothing? My taste bud did not like it at all!I came here again thinking my first visit, it could of been the chef making the food was bad, so I ordered a mojado burrito to give this restaurant another try. So a couple things wrong with food order that I ordered to go. Mojado ""WET"" burrito means you shouldn't use a paper to go box that does not have wax finishing so your sauce does not make the box soggy. When I was eating my burrito, I got a good dose of fiber from eating the soggy box. . . OR you could of put foil in the box so it doesnt soak up the sauce. So the food. . . Nothing to really rave about. I was quite sad because this place could of been better. YUM! I tried to this place for lunch while waiting to check into my room. The food was very good although, I think I picked the wrong beans to put on my taco (refried). The young guy at the register was very sweet, patient and nice. The service was fast and I can tell that this is a family run business. The lady making the food seems to really put effort into every dish. This shows and comes through in the flavor and taste of the food. This place is great for a quick bite and definitely hits the spot. It also isn't a bank breaker. I took off one star for the location and noise coming from outside of the restaurant. Other than that, I will definitely be back during my next San Fran stay! Was it the best breakfast burrito ever?  Well, it came mighty close. After I finished up my physical at  Shudder Street I was starving and needed food and caffeine stat.  I headed into Taqueria Mana and chose a breakfast burrito with ham.  the other choices were chorizo, bacon or veggie.  The burrito was stuffed with chunks of tasty, salty ham, tons of fried potatoes and nice fluffy eggs.  My only regret is that I didn't ask them to add salsa to the inside of the burrito, which is the way I like it. $.   a pretty good deal for a really good burrito! I have been there just the  time.    Nice Peeps,  Good prices,  aa short  block walk from my building.   I ordered a Steak regular Burrito, spicy.    Pretty Darned tasty! Delicious burrito. Very juicy, packed with gauc. Coming back for sure! Fresh & Flavorful. Taqueria in my backyard? Why not. And the second you order your meals, is the second they start up the grill to rustle it up.  Chorizzo and Queso meal w/ black beans, cilantro, and rice Carne Asada Plate  Beef steak with grilled pepper, onions, mushrooms Fresh Orange JuiceAnd PS? The fresh OJ felt like it was literally, picked from the back and squeezed before my berry own eyes. it was delisioso! Surprisingly good, for being in a touristy spot downtown. A little expensive for what it is though. I've had dried out, unpleasantly crunchy carnitas here before but the barbacoa has always been great. Way better than I was expecting. I had the carne asada super burrito, and it was delicious.  The key to a great burrito is that every bite has to have a good mix of flavor and ingredients.   Every bite had that perfect mix of black beans, rice, meat, sour cream, guac, and whatever else was in there.  The price was about right, and totally worth it.  I will be coming back here soon for more. A microwave? Really? You have signs bragging Fresh Authentic Mexican Food and then pop my meal in a microwave before handing it to me??Despite that, the taste was there. The food is good but a $ dinner place shouldn't be thrown in a microwave. Delicious veggie super burrito and a veggie taco that was the size of my face for $? I aint mad at it. It's literally a hole. in a wall. the man and woman behind the counter were super nice and accomodating, and the food was pretty damn good! its two blocks from my office so here's to hoping i can contain myself :) Shockingly good!The Beef Quesadilla is a winner for me, though the best part are the re fried beans. I'm guessing there's a ton of lard and salt. Nothing healthy can taste that good!Normally I do not like Mexican food, and I've unwillingly dined at many, many, many a taqueria. This place deserves my return visit."|6|80|6|Routine| Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 3/15/2013 ] Improper food storage  [ date violation corrected: 3/15/2013 ] Foods not protected from contamination  [ date violation corrected: 3/15/2013 ] Inadequately cleaned or sanitized food contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 3/15/2013 ] Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities  [ date violation corrected: 3/15/2013 ] Moderate risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 3/15/2013 ]
Taqueria Mana 5|3.5|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|181|5|3.61320754717|" I fell in love with this place!  I saw my Orthodontist and asked the ladies in the office if they knew a good Mexican restaurant near by. They sent me here, to this little hole in the wall, one block from the office!  Near Union Square!!  I had a cheese enchilada, salad, rice and beans, for  bucks!!  It was so good! Minus one star for no limes :( maybe next time I will ask. Three mexican street (or mini) tacos, $ a piece, and a side of rice for $. , I am a happy camper. Great good, great taste. A delicious hole in the wall under a tunnel, and you probably walk by and don't even see it. This is becoming my new favorite lunch spot. I just stumbled on this place yesterday. I had the chorizo torta. It was FABULOUS! Crumbly, spicy chorizo spilling out of the sandwich, crisp fresh onions, yumalicious tomato. Best of all  they asked if I wanted sour cream or mayo! Now, I know purists will react with disgust, but I can't eat sour cream. And yes, I love mayo. AND the torta comes with french fries! Mayo and fries at a taqueria? Horribly Americanized? I prefer to think of it as low rent fusion cuisine. I'll definitely be back to try the burritos, etc. , but also the burgers and cheesesteaks. Yes, a taqueria that makes philly cheesesteaks. Again, some people will consider that just plain wrong. But for me, it's food heaven. And I've finally found  a good taqueria downtown! I had a unsatisfied craving for a steak burrito so I ordered a steak burrito online. The burrito was a ok but it didnt really satisfy my craving. Most items that I've ordered have ranged from just barely good to not good. It does in a pinch but it's not my fave place. A coworker told me about this place many years ago because I would tell him I'm craving a burrito, but I dont want one of those fancy pants burrito places (i. e.  degree burritos)  I wanted a home made ""real"" taqueria!  And around Union Square all these fancy places were popping up. No Bueno!  So I went here and its a small family owned place thats an authentic tacqueria. No frills and fancy meats.  It was very tiny before, but now for a few years now its much bigger and the menu has expanded.  They serve everything from burritos and quesadillas to menudo to huevos rancheros!  Yes. . . . awesome place to go even though they've raised their prices from before.  Its understandable. . . its close to Union Square.  Rent isnt cheap.  My favorite is the super burrito mojado.  Its a super burrito drenched with enchilada sauce, but I always asked for the mole sauce which I like better.  A nice place for something quick and easy and real mexican food! I force myself not to eat here cause it is so great, I would eat here again and again, EVERYDAY!I have had the Super taco (any meat and you are good), the mini taco (good for a quick snack) and the nachos. All fabulous and such awesome prices. The mini is only $, and so much meat! Hurry hurry hurry! It is so good there. Don't let the outside scare you away. Average burrito.  Slightly gross little place.  + for having chimichangas and for being one of the only burritos around there. I don't understand how they can expect people to shell out $.  (with tax) on a shitty burrito.  I have suckered in to paying that much a few times out of desperation since there isn't another taqueria in the area. El Faro on Kearny doesn't count. They are even worse. The meat is always chewy and stale tasting, they skimp out on portions ( I mean if they expect people to pay this much for burritos, it should be HUGE).  The icing on the cake is that they charge for chips. COME ON. However, I do stop in and purchase the Inca Cola and that's about it. Maybe you wanna come in for a breakfast burrito?NO. It's just a bunch of eggs, raw potatoes and SALT. BLEH. This is the best burrito place (close to mi casa). So I'll give it a solid four stars because I eat here like twice a week. Plus it seems unjust to leave a place I go to that often anything less. That being said, I've tried the asada and carnitas and I don't think they scratch the surface of the pastor! So good! So quick! Breakfast burrito is really good too! So I'm chowing down on my super pollo asado burrito with wheat tortilla, when I suddenly clamp down on something small and hard. It felt like a tooth. After reminding myself that I definitely lost all my baby teeth years ago, I cautiously fished out the culprit: a tiny black rock. Disgusting! If you're wondering whether I kept eating the burrito, the answer is yes, because it would take a lot for me to go out and buy another lunch when there's a delicious one sitting right in front of me. But I did feel a little grossed out with each bite. I guess I could say their burritos rock, but instead I think I just won't be eating there anymore. Without a doubt the best taqueria downtown.  Don't waste your time with El Fartolito, or those taco trucks this place serves up good, authentic food.  My only suggestion is that if they want  stars they're going to need to install a salsa bar and start giving away some chips. Nothing beats the taquerias scattered throughout the Mission district, but the food here will satisfy the cravings enough if you're trapped in Union Square. My recent meal here consisted of a super chicken quesadilla with black beans and rice and an extra side of guacamole. I didn't like the chicken too much. . . mostly white meat that was on the dry and flavorless side. Everything else was tasty though. Next time I'll try the carne asada or carnitas. . . perhaps in an enchillada or over nachos. .  stars. Tried the regular carne asada burrito st try and thought it was just mediocre. Then nd try I tried a super pollo asada burrito and was very impressed. Usually I'm not a big guac/sour cream fan but Mana definitely has some quality sour cream and guac! On point and blended very well with the scrumptious grilled chicken. And the customer service is quite good. Friendly, quick and offer plenty of room for you to sit down and enjoy your food. As being the th person to review this location I'm on the fence on this place. I ate here almost  months ago. It wasn't that bad, BUT it could have been better. Portions are ok & the food needed more flavor I guess. If I'm ever in the area again, I may give them a nd chance. The food here is not bad. The place is clean, the employees are nice. I don't like California style Mexican food, so I only gave it  stars, but they do California style Mexican really well. Reasonable price for the location too. Was less than  bucks to get chips/salsa/entree. Yum! I like Union Square options a little better now. I would not have found this place without the help of a Square push notification. It is on Stockton just before you go under the bridge. Pollo taco w/black beans was big & chicken was moist and well seasoned. Carnitas mini tacos are not too mini and have all the right fixings  cilantro, onion, hot salsa, no beans. Guacamole and chips were very fresh and tasty. After finishing up a good day at the Asian art museum, myself and a notably picky vegetarian friend, found ourselves in dire need of sustenance, and lo did the iPhone tell me of the Taqueria Mana. We went there, and ordered what appeared to be your average Carne Asada burrito with all the fixings, and for her, a vegetarian taco plate. What came was deliciousness, and it was good. Her taco plate came with more than just beans, cheese and rice, but also had guacamole and pico de gallo. My burrito was juicy, the tortilla heated just right, and stuffed fully of meaty delicious goodness. If you are in the area, find this place, it's tiny, and they don't really heat the place, but damned if the food is worth it. So i had a craving for nachos a couple days ago. and seeing as though i dont live anywhere near the misson, trekking out there was out of the question. I also didnt want to go to el sotano and pay a million dollars for one chip and nothing else. Taqueria Mana. im really starting to like this place. Ordered the supreme Nachos with ground beef. yum. i got so much food i was able to eat it for lunch and dinner (by then the chips were a little soggy but still good) i also have a tiny stomach which explains why i could eat twice. but seriously. good eats. alright price for where its situated. Hidden but worth finding. Had a really good grilled chicken burrito, light on the oil, heavy on the grilled veggies. The latter makes their take on this standard slab distinctive. Wheat tortilla and black beans are both available, and it comes wrapped in friendly, quick service. Awesome. Reminds me of legit Mexican in San Luis Obispo and San Diego. I give: stars for incredibly fresh & delicious guacamole at pm (they close at pm), tasty black beans, fresh salsa w/ chunks of garlic in it, fresh squeezed cold orange juice (we watched them squeeze it) & a happy boyfriend (apparently his baby chicken burrito was great) stars for their actually being a taqueria in Union Square.  stars for fast & friendly service. / star for the hilarious Telemundo program they had on & / star for the bad painting of Moses. Then taketh away:Minus  stars for stale chips & crunchy rice b/c it had gotten hard from sitting out. Minus  stars for the cost  $ for a super veggie taco, side of rice & beans, baby chicken burrito, side of guac &  drinks. . . anywhere else I know that's cheap, but this is SF where I can get a good taco for a $ and a smile. Bottom line:It's a downtown taqueria off the Powell St. BART that isn't scary to walk to & is open til pm on the weekends. The guac is seriously the bomb  it was almost the consistency of butter. I would never go out of my way to eat here b/c The Mission is a less than  min walk from my house, but it gives my taco lovin' heart peace to know it's there. Menu is vast but the food is just OK. good luck getting the same price for the same item on different days. While this place may look authentic, it ends there  you can't even smell good food inside the joint!We had a super pork taco w/ refried beans, salsa, sour cream and avocado  $  pork wasn't very goodhorchata  no flavor, just sweet chips  ok, doesn't come w/ anythingUnless we are desperate or super hungry like we were, no way will we return for less than decent Mexican fare. Dump. I think I may have found some meat in my gristle taco, but I'm not sure because the whole meal had no flavor. Pretty sub par for a taqueria and it's not even cheap by taqueria standards. It is on the other hand less than a five minute walk from my house, a lot closer than the mission and any other taquerias that I know about. Enchiladas are blah. The burrito isn't horrible, the carne asada is chewy and the ingredients are less than middle of the road. The alambras are the best thing I've had from here, probably just over seasoned to mask the true flavor of the ingredients. The torta was barely edible as the carne asada was almost impossible to tear and chew it was so rubbery. If this place was two blocks further, I would never come here, but it's so close and quick I still go. I also find it very strange they have a tip jar and a jar for ""babies"" college fund. I don't know who baby is, but I have accidentally funded her education instead of tipping several times. Finally a good burrito place in Union Square, nothing spectacular but pretty consistent. Quick, cheap and close to work! I used to love it here! Very flavorful burritos and super fast service. However, today I got food poisoning about an hour after I ate here which clearly ruined it for me. Too bad too, because this was my go to in the area. Pretty solid Mexican food in the Union Square area! They have the standards covered from burritos to tacos to nachos with every possible type of meat and even veggie options. One favorite I recently spotted on the menu is chilaquiles! Not too many restaurants offer this, so I'm excited to try it. They are quick, extremely reasonable for Union Square, and authentically delicious! Food: I had shared a carne asada burrito and nachos from here.  Was pretty good.  Usual authentic Mexican food. Decent Mexican joint in Union Square.  The owners are evangelical Christians, hence the giant mural of Moses parting the Red Sea, which is cool. . . but one time, they had *Chick Tracts* sitting next to the register. Chick Tracts (google them, read them, be converted. . . or profoundly disturbed) are little cartoon booklets made by some weirdo who is about as doom and gloom as it gets.  Topics include Jews going to hell despite the fact they were good and noble people because they didn't accept Jesus as their lord and saviour; gays ruining everything; Satan posing as a Fonz style cool cat who gets you in train wrecks and tells you ""YOU GOOFED!"" as he commits you to the fiery pits of blackest hell, etc.  Kind of surprised me to see them there. Available reading material aside, the food is pretty good: it's WAY less greasy than what you generally find in a quick and easy taco bar.  The guac has always been adequately fresh, and the staff is friendly.  The burritos come really, really fast: a few times, by the time my credit card went through, they had it sitting on the counter!The fresh salsa that they have on the tables is amazing, way more flavorful than the stuff they have prepacked in the fridge. Went here today. I got the Super Vegetarian Burrito. It might have been the best burrito I have ever had. . . no lie. First off this place is pretty cheap for being downtown, plus you get a lot of food. My burrito was huge, bigger then the ones at Chipotle and it was more put together then the ones at Chipotle, meaning at the end I wasn't eating the burrito with a fork because the tortilla had fallen apart.  I will be back. . . a lot. Good, fast, and cheap. A nice place to have in the neighborhood. Popped in for a super vegetarian burrito for the first time, and it was ok.  It's surprising how much veggie burritos can differ from one taqueria to another. . . My previous visit to Taqueria Mana was about  years ago. . . maybe even . Back then I ordered a super carne asada burrito and, to this day, I remember how terrible the meat was. I had to pick a piece of gristle out of nearly every mouthful. Which explains why I hadn't been back in all these years. I found myself walking past Mana at lunchtime today and on a whim decided to give it another shot. I was encouraged by the much nicer interior; they had really spruced up the place from what I remember. Would the food be better as well?I ordered the same burrito and I can say that there has been an improvement in at least the texture of the meat. It was much more tender. Unfortunately, though, I detected an unwelcomed hint of gaminess. Granted, it wasn't bad enough to keep me from eating the whole thing!If Mana were in the Mission, it might be a  star taqueria; however, the scarcity of places to get a burrito on this side of town bumps it to a  by default. um let's see here. . . the place puts the word hole back in hole in the wall, the chips were stale (and  cents extra), and the salsa was all spice and no flavor, BUT THE MINI TACOS WERE F**KING DELICIOUS. I'm so glad I work in the area now. Get some salsa habanera for the torta.  I ate sopes too, before a homeless man asked me for my leftovers. I had this for lunch and dinner.  I love lengua. It's better than barbacoa or chicken. I liked watching Spanish PBS and I never had to clean a table. I love the red sea mural but some Asian office worker was eating in front of it. I recommend this if you have Mexican cravings in Chinatown or Nob Hill. My boyfriend loved the Mexican Coca Cola. The carnitas burrito is okay but try the chimichangas!  The strawberry shake is good.  The workers are friendly. They top of the rice  drink with a lot of cinnamon because it's a little watery.  You have a choice of mayo or sour cream on the tortas. Great find, Great Mexican food burrito joint at reasonable but not dirt cheap prices. It is a true Mexican place. . . not some random restaurant that happens to throw up a Mexican name and make tacos. Nachos are great, burritos are awesome and the guac is real good. . . It is located next to the Stockton tunnel and you feel a bit like you are entering a shady massage parlor (which happens to be next door, I think its called Green Hands something or other and is open  hours. . . ) The chicken torta received was EXTREMELY small, but it was pretty delicious, saving this place from a humiliating one star. The religious context of all the flyers kind of creeped me out too. Take the time to get some good Mexican food away from Union Square! Nice find in an odd location.  Very small place with quick service and a big menu.  I had tacos of course (el pastor) and they were solid.  Exactly what I was looking for.  I dig the fact that you can order them a couple of ways:  simple with onion, cilantro and lime (my favorite)  or a couple increasingly more unattractive ways (cheese, avocado, etc. )It's tiny, it's fast, you may have to clean a table before sitting down, you'll get really good tacos. Who knew I had past this place a few times without ever trying it out. A friend from SF State told me about it and when I'm in the area for tacos or a super burrito, this place is great. rating based on the pork mini tacos, with hot sauce & cilantro toppings.  nice crispy pork, but still moist and very flavorful. other dishes the folks I was with had looked and tasted just fine, but wou;dn't have rated better than a .  the pork tacos were hands down the best thing on the table. best burger ever.  that's all i need to say.  and their breakfast burritos are pretty good too. Charged  cents for stale, oily, and hard chips with no toppings. The Super burrito was soggy, and the meat inside had alot of fat. Charged      me ~ dollars? Definitely not recommended.  stars for location. Next time i come around, i wouldn't even want the nachos even if they were free. Simply the best!  I had them cater our trunkshow event at American Rag and the food was delicious. Also Jose was very helpful and friendly. . . Exquisite Flautas ~Mexican and red Salsas ~Chips~guacamole . . . etc  yummy! Gracias Taqueria Mana! I will use them every time I have an event in San Francisco. . . :) I rate this place so high because there just isn't another place around Union Square that serves up some good ol East Side Mexican food. The chili could have been a little hotter but I bet I can get that on request. Not many places serve sopes and every thing seemed fresh and tasty. Good service from the cute girl at the register and probably a good place to catch some noon time sports. World cup lunches here I come. There a number of reasons why I decided to give this tacqueria four stars.  First the people who own the restaurant are friendly, and make the experience more enjoyable.  Second, the service is prompt, and there is very little wait (the restaurant is sort of in tucked away right next to the stockton tunnel. . . so not much traffic).  Third, has more to do with location more than anything else.  While the food is good, it probably doesn' t warrant four stars by Mission standards.  However, it is not in the Mission, but rather the Financial District, where the competition is scarce.  This is a great choice if you want Mexican food, and don't have time to go to the Mission. I was a little hesitant about eating food from a restaurant almost in a tunnel, though my taco cravings got the best of me!  Each taco is served on a double corn tortilla (not freshly griddled, but from a bag) with the meat of your choice, onions, salsa and cilantro.  They offer about nine fillings that could be added to a variety of Mexican dishes besides tacos.  The tacos tasted like something from a Mission taco truck: authentic and good value for the price, but no competition to the more gourmet nouveau tacos popping up around town.  It's an OK place; they do a decent job of taqueria food just as is done at many other decent taquerias. Carne Asada: At least the cubes had a good singe to them.  The flavor was lacking and it was a bit tough. Pastor: Nice crispy cubes of pork with loads of seasoning.  Probably my favorite here. Carnitas: Achieved the difficult task of having crisp portions and moist portions.  It was tasty, though a little bland. Chorizo: Super rich and full of spices.  Good thing the meat portion is kind of light in this taco else I might go on grease overload. Barbacoa: Enjoyed the texture, it was like carnitas but without the crunch.  A little bland though. this place is just what this neighborhood needs. some yummy mexican food!ive had lunch here a couple of times, the carne asada tacos are delicious as is the chorizo and eggs breakfast burrito. and the fresh salsa they put out on the tables makes the meal complete!next time i have to try the sopes they looked pretty delicious! Our last night in San Francisco. . . we were looking for something close and quick. Yelp led us to TM and we were not disappointed. Didn't see exactly what we wanted on the menu but the guy behind the counter was very kind and made our carne asada tacos just as we like them. Quesadillas that the kids ordered were stuffed with cheese! Our tummies were delighted! I can't speak for most of the dishes as I really only get the Chile Relleno, and it's definitely delicious.  They use a block of salty, hard mexican cheese, which is definitely what I like, none of that runny cheese.  It's close to work, pretty cheap, and fast.  Plus, they don't skimp on the condiments. I discovered Taqueria Mana while sitting at the bus stop at the bottom of the Stockton Tunnel. Wedged between a liquor store and a massage parlor (yeah, not the kind where you'd have a spa day), it doesn't look promising from the outside. However, Mana had dropped off menus in my building and the food looked pretty tasty, and was delightfully cheap, so I decided to give it a go. The inside is clean and festive, with soccer blaring away on the TV. The service was quick, and the staff friendly. I ordered a chicken chimichanga, and perused the beverage cooler while I waited. They have a big selection, with your usual standards, Jarritos sodas, and more exotic fare like peach nectar. I got my chimi to go, and was surprised by how heavy the to go box was. It's definitely enough for two servings, and the ingredients were fresh. The downside was that there was no spice or seasoning to the chicken or salsa, and the guac was runny. I'm sure if you ask they can make it spicy, and it's not that anything was bad  it just isn't as good as many of the chimichangas I've had in the past. Clean, Reasonable prices and excellent food.  Large portion sizes and very tasty!!  I will def. come here again when I am in the city.  The food was VERY good. Taqueria Mana satisfied my lunchtime carne asade super burrito craving without forcing me to trek to the Mission. Alright so I work right around the corner from this place but I've never really popped in to check it out. From the outside it didn't quite look like anything special so I never gave it a second thought. Today I ordered some food from there and MAN OH MAN it was AMAZING. Great prices, very kind people  and it was fast as all heck. I ordered veggie quesadillas and walked down there give or take five minutes later and my food was in a bag waiting for me I swear it's like they knew I was gonna call and made the food for me through some telepathic understanding. Anyway  HIGHLY recommend it. Great place to get lunch. I've seen this place so many times, and yet never popped in. Today was the day . . . At first I was a little overwhelmed with this place, as all the menu items (more or less) are arranged around the top of the walls, up against the ceiling. I didn't even notice the menu on the wall at first. I had a veggie burrito, to go, and it was prepared with astonishing speed. Like, they were ready to go. Maybe it was because I ordered in Spanish? I dunno. But you rarely have such short turnaround time for a good burrito. And this burrito was mighty tasty. Now that I know they can do burritos well, I am encouraged to try their other items. Since they offer everything from hamburgers to Philly cheese steaks and quesadillas, I'm sure this place will be fun to sample over the coming months. The bomb explosive. I go here all the day walking home from Powell Muni. It's nice to brush up on my Spanish with the blokes there. It's not cheap but it's not expensive. My buddy came from Philadelphia and said it was the best Mexican food ever, and he knows way more than me. I only know that I like it and eat it all the time. That's what she said! Ask for anything they make to be extra spicy and it will be done!  Just how I like my food. What trumps charging $ for a disturbingly average burrito? Having the audacity to charge an extra ¢ for a cold, greasy bag of chips. While there are few options in the neighborhood for Mexican food you are much better off making the trek to the Mission or settling for some pizza from Uncle Vito's. I won't be making the same mistake again. I've been looking for a good taqueria within walking distance of the office since my first day, and Taqueria Mana is my salvation. I actually wandered into this place by accident while taking a Sunday morning stroll through Chinatown, and was somewhat disappointed at first, because I made a cardinal error: when they asked me if I wanted a super taco, I told them no, I just wanted a regular taco. What I *should* have said, as it turns out, is that I wanted a mini taco, which is what I typically envision when I say ""regular taco""  a couple little torn tortillas, some meat, some onions, some cilantro, some salsa. Here, ""regular tacos"" are the same as mini tacos, except that they have beans on top, which is a *terrible* idea. The bean juice soaks into the tortillas and makes 'em all soggy, and beans are inferior to delicious meat anyway, so it's not a great scenario. But, once I realized how to correct my mistake and also factored in how close this place is to the office, I resolved to return. And they did not disappoint. Every kind of meat here is actually pretty good. None of them particularly excels, but none disappoints, which is more than I can say about a lot of taquerias  their lengua, their al pastor, their carnitas, all traditional and tasty. I'd give Taqueria Mana three stars if it weren't for its location, but when I keep in mind the fact that I'll be going here about three times a week for the next few months, I can't help but go for four. If you're in the area and want good tacos close by, Taqueria Mana's probably your best bet. i found this place by reading reviews on yelp. the best carne asada mini tacos EVER!  it was $.  per mini taco.  it had hot sauce, cilantro, and onions on it.  the workers were very nice and gave me plenty of lime for my tacos.  the carne asada was so good! Only had the mini tacos (and they are, indeed, quite mini)  carnitas and chicken  but they were most definitely delicious. Where to start my review?? Well I was in Union Square to buy a suit from Banana Republic so I wanted to grab something before I went. Looked on yelp and nothing really jumped out until I found this small place. Decided to try this place out and fast forward to eating here. Took BART downtown and walked around a little bit and decided to head over to try out a burrito. On the way, right before I get to the place this guy just starts pissing on the sidewalk and my head just goes WTF!! My appetite is slightly ruined but I have hope that at least a decent burrito will satisfy my hunger. Step into the place and just order a regular burrito with steak and black beans. Once I take the first bite, I just go ah!! Continued to finish my burrito and I appreciate the fact that they have a lot of pictures up so you can see what a lot of the items look like which is helpful. I'm definitely eating here if I want some Mexican near Union Square whether or not somebody is pissing on the sidewalk. Pork tacos, chicken fajitas, steak fajitas, house made carne asada yum! Everything tasted really fresh and overall left my group feeling full and satisfied. There are so many Mexican food places to choose from in the city, this one is good. The prices are a little high, at least for my group it was, but I would definitely eat here again if I get the craving. an average burrito joint. $.  for a super burrito and coke. I've seen this place many times when heading up Stockton St, but it always looked sort of scary in it's dirty little corner near the tunnel next to the happy ending place.  This definitely falls into the ""don't judge a book by it's cover"" category. I got a chicken super burrito without sour cream.  Once I sunk my teeth into it, I couldn't believe I didn't discover this place sooner.  The whole thing was juicy and delicious I mean juicy rather than greasy. . . and I do mean delicious.  Chopped onions, melted cheese, succulent chicken, delicious white rice, and a bunch of other stuff.  I've never had such a juicy burrito, and it was perfect.  Nice, hefty size too. The guy at the register was friendly too.  I'll be coming back here all the time. I don't know if it's my discovery of other taquerias or if the place has actually gone downhill, bu t the last few times I've been here the burritos just haven't been that great.  They don't melt the cheese, or even put it next to hot ingredients so that it might melt by the time you eat it.  Instead, they put the rice, beans, and meat down, then the veggies, then sour cream, and then the cheese. The ingredients are still pretty good, and the guys are friendly.  And they still have great chips and salsa. This joint is the epitome of ""hole in the wall"". It's located right before the tunnel, I almost missed this place as I was catching a bus to fort mason right at the entrance of the tunnel! It's close to Fidm too so I can run here for a great lunch as opposed to all those expensive restaurants in the mall. FOODGASM, I swear, I am in love with this place. You can order any dish, you will not be disappointed! The workers here are all so very nice. This place is perfect. I don't even know how to get into detail without writing an essay. . . I love this place. Period. Of course I love this place!  Open late, good prices, friendly staff and killer mural on the wall.  Reminds me of Sunday School! south side stockton tunnel entrance. . . dive mexican joint situated. . . counter order and few tables. . . standard mexican burrito options. . . some added typical tex mex fare. . . torta, burgers and philly cheesesteak availability. . . order of carnitas chimichanga. . . . deep fried burrito indulgence. . . request for no bean fillers. . . wishing for more crisp, but tasting fine. . . plated and topped with sour cream and guacamole. . . spoon on smoky hot salsa and splashing of tapatio. . . meaty hefty burrito to the max. . . pricing higher, but sizing fairly large. . . . roughly $ten for burrito and soda. . . . noticing ""baby"" burritos looking more manageable for lunch. . . . a fat person or a skinny person?. . . super burrito or baby burrito? Oh so scrumptious.  Wandered to Taqueria Mana from the office for lunch and was delighted to see this hole in the wall place (kind of trashy looking from the outside) yield the best burrito I can remember having (shrimp).  The spice was right and the salsa was great.  Oh yes and the beef taco on the side was also good.  Wish there were more places to sit, however.  Get there before noon. This place is alright. I keep coming back with Jen B. since its close to her work. Its a different atmosphere and taste then Orale or Mercedes. I guess I would say its more ""authentic"". . . . Today we both had a Super Burrito with Carne Asada and black beans. Their burritos aren't overly huge where you're going to barf while leaving from finishing a whole burrito. The carne asada tastes pretty good but I think the burrito could use more meat a tad less rice and beans. They give you a little dish of chips when you dine in and they leave their salsa on the table. The salsa is awesome! Its spicy and has onion chunks in it.  I thought this place was cash only since there is an ATM machine right in the door way but maybe i'm wrong after reading some other reviews. I think if they had better chips (and more of it) I would come more often.  The chips are so so but the salsa rocks! They're located just a few minutes from the hotel we're staying at. We ordered Super Nachos, which were HUGE, and a  Enchilada plate. The prices were pretty reasonable, and they offer free delivery with a $ minimum order. The best was that they were here in less than  minutes! The food was delicious and the delivery guy was really friendly. I was in the mood for some Mexican food so I decided to cross through the tunnel from Chinatown. I ordered the Al Pastor Super Burrito. All the ingredients tasted fresh and tasty. The Al Pastor had a crunchy texture which I loved. I ordered it to go and I also received a bag of chips. The red sauce which they had in little cups was absolutely addicting. I would say that it was up there with La Vics orance sauce. I would go there again and try some tacos or quesadillas. A dingy little Mexican restaurant that screams bridge and tunnel, whose food is so grub that even the posh visit to mack a 'Super Baby Burrito' in shades and Hermes scarves, so as not to be noticed by 'the little people'. HA! You're not fooling anyone, Karen! This place is the gem of the city and for Mexican lovers, its has been known to satisfy even the naughtiest cravings. I like this place. :) I am a fan because of  reasons. The food was pretty good & the guys behind the register were extremely nice.  Excellent customer service goes a long way. I had a Carne Asada Burrito, Carne Asada Chips &  Flautas.  Not bad from a long day of shopping.  This meal wasn't just for me though, this was shared!  Hhahahahhaa. . . .  I really like the salsa here and you can have as much as you want if you dine in.  It's not like McDonald's regulating on how much barbecue or sweet & sour sauce you get or charging an extra quarter for it.  Haha!I'm definitely coming back when I have the craving for some Mexican Food. Okay, this review is just for the plain burrito since it's the only thing I've ever ordered here.  I work nearby and have been to Mana over , times.  I've found that when the man with the bushy moustache is working, all is good.  He really hooks it up and always makes my burrito big and tasty.  When he isn't the one making my food it's always sub par, so going here is somewhat a gamble.  When I enter the door and see him standing there I know I'm glad I came when it's someone else I just prep myself for a mediocre meal.  They don't give you chips with your burrito anymore, but it's still a good deal. Oh, how I love Taqueria Mana. The man who seems to always be working is really sweet and you can watch your order be made fresh! When I ate there (before becoming vegan) I had only had the super chicken burrito (yum!) and the chicken quesadilla (mega yum!). Your order comes with a little bag of fresh tortilla chips, too. The best part is that it's not a really popular spot, so the line usually has only one or two people in it. I would recommend taking your order to go, the inside is a little cramped. But aside from a pricey, sit down situation, it's the best Mexican you can get downtown. I work around the corner and eat there at least twice a week. great food and great people. every once in a while they make chile colorado (it's not on the menu) but it is out of this world. chips are marginal, but the salsa is killer Man oh man. Do they have different cooks or something? I just went back to the place I loved last I was there. . . and the mini tacos hurt my stomach. The tortillas were tough, the meat was tough, and the salsa was all spice no flavor. I love spice. I need flavor. Now i'm thinking I may not go back. How sad! But i kind of want to go back to see if it just depends on who's cooking. . . I've walked down the Stockton tunnel a dozen times, have fought the traffic on Sutter St. even more so on my bike, and I can't believe I never saw this place!An impromptu lunch date with my older brother brought me here today, and it was a choice selection for some comida sabrosa.  And indeed, the mural of Moses parting the red sea is quite ""dope"". I had the burrito mojado, which was quite tasty.  The marinated chick is delicious with a good peppery warmth to it.  I think the mole sauce they drenched the burrito with could have been spicier, but perhaps you just gotta ask for it. They're open til pm, so next time I'm downtown and need something to fill my tummy, this place will definitely be on my mind. Quesadilla al Pastor is a goody, Carnitas taco and Carne Asada, Breakfast burrito good too.  You're pretty much stuck over here but it's ok. I Probably eat here  times a week.  Update. . . somedays are better than others but I'm pretty stoked on the burritos. Mission style taqueria just off union square. The pastor is incredible and the pollo asado is very good (made fajita style, with peppers and onions). I've had mixed experiences with the carne asada. If you're hungry, the burrito mojado is HUGE. . . I usually have trouble finishing the super burrito as it is  without a heaping serving of ranchero sauce, guac and sour cream. Other tasty options include the torta (mexican style sandwich) and the quesodilla suiza. Wet burrito! Yes, I ate the entire thing, okay? Stop staring. But yes, I had a giant wet burrito about the size of my head filled with delicious al pastor, covered in enchilada sauce, guac and sour cream. All for ~$. The al pastor is some of the tastiest that I've had in a while. A hike from the office and closely located to the Stockton Tunnel, it's worth the long walk. The place is small  about  tables and seating for ~ish people  so best not to go with a big group. Best carne asada burrito I've found downtown(ish). Steak is pre cooked, like most other places in SF, but still tastes pretty fresh. The rice, beans, and guacamole all taste great. They've messed up my order a couple of times, but I've been here a lot, so I guess that's not too bad. It'd only be  stars if it were in the Mission, but it gets an extra one for being within walking distance from my work. The Sutter/Stockton parking garage  I've parked there many a time on my occasional weekend shopping trips to Union Sq. and never once have thought to try out this Taqueria. It is right across the street from the garage. (It's right next door to Green Door Massage  don't act like you've never seen that sign)I ordered  super carnitas taco. (Trying to save myself from the usual ""why did I eat all that"" remorse. )  But after ordering it I see someone pick up their fish tacos and I thought to myself , "" Self. . . those fish tacos look good too. "" You know where I'm going here. Carnitas Super Taco. Delicioso. Fish taco (regular). Pretty darn good. Though next time I will get the ""super"" fish taco. The regular had fried fish, iceberg lettuce, and sour cream. (ai dios mio! lots o' sour cream)Dos tacos and a bottle of agua = $. It's a smallish joint but if you are in the area and craving Mexican. . . this is your place. P. S. I had a slight mix up with my order and the manager was quick to make sure that everything was cool. Gotta love that. Not really an update as much as an observation. Did anyone else notice how dope the mural of Moses parting the Red Sea is? Ever since I started this whole Eat Right For Your Blood Type, the eating out options have been tough, but luckily for me, Messican food seems to produce a few tasty options that make it possible to go out to lunch with friends and not look like a soy eating freak :)Today, I did my own version of nachos, with corn tortilla chips, refried beans, shredded lettuce, tomato free guac and chicken and ya know, for not having any of the usual yummy elements associated with Messican food it was really good. And the best part is, I don't feel like I gained  lbs and am not in need of a nap. Maybe this eating plan ain't that bad after all. Major props for this place for accommodating my annoying requests and I will definitely be back to alter the menu again soon :)On a side note though. . . what's up with the parting of the red sea mural? Weird. The super chicken nachos baby. . . Number .  That's what I get. That's what I like. If you take the nachos back to the office you get double the amount that you would if you ate it at the joint. Either way. . . I like this place. I am not a regular Mexican food eater but I love nachos and they make em  pretty darn tasty. Add jalepenos for extra kick! I'm torn between two and three stars. The burrito was tasty, however, it was pretty small compared to what many are used to in the Mission and other parts of the Bay. That wouldn't be a problem, but these are $ burritos. It makes sense: the rents are high in this 'hood, but come on. Come here pretty often as it is on my way home from work.  I stop in and grab two mini tacos.  LOVE THEM!  Heat up the corn tortillas, drops either pollo or carnitas some onions cilantro and hot salsa on top.  Free chips and all the salsa you can handle, usually get some jalapenos on the side too.  The staff is very friendly  let me change the station to ESPN when i dine in. Pretty good for a downtown burrito. . But, $.  for a veggie? Would be worth it if maybe if it was twice as big and half as bland. I'll stick to the $ burritos I buy on International Blvd next time I'm feeling the urge for Mexican food with flavor.  And I never thought I'd have to specificially ask for hot sauce  because I sure as hell didn't get any with my order. . Came here the other night when my husband and I wanted something quick. We both ordered the Super Burrito with chicken which was very good for the most part. The menu did not mention it had cilantro in it, which I can't stand  so I tried my best to eat around it. The burritos were huge though. . I'd go back but ask for no Cilantro next time. Quick & friendly service, and free chips & salsa too! Stars for being the only place in the area serving menudo daily  for those who like menudo!  Only a limited quantity is made so come early.  No hominy, but nice evenly cut pieces of tripe and lots of oregano and cilantro.  Tortillas plentiful and friendly service. I have to disagree with the naysayers. This is one of my regular stops on the way home (I've actually forced myself to stop going here as frequently so I branch out more) and it simply rocks. I've had the burrito (granted I'm picky and switch the salsa for cheese), Carne Asada plate, and two other plate's which for the life of me I can't remember the name. They're the two next to the Carne Asada plate on the hanging menus (short people beware, you're not going to see over the cabinet to read the names). The three guys who work here (there are three, one works the day, usually with a lady, then it's mustachio man [who's mi Amigo] and a newer guy who looks a little greasy) are all good guys. To those who spent maybe  minutes here watching them, I say BAH to your reviews of their hand washing. EVERY TIME I show up they wash their hands if they haven't been handling food. Usually grease man is handling the cash while Amigo is rocking the food. If vice versa the hands are washed. The Carne asada can come out a little dry, but it can do that at any authentic Taqueria, and I've eaten at tons both in SF, Mexico and other Latin American countries. In the Burritos it makes for a fantastic burrito unless you like a sloppy joe of a Burrito. In that case I'll recommend El Farro where your burrito subscribes to Carl's Jr. 's former advertising campaign of ""If it doesn't get all over the place it doesn't belong in your face"". The Carne Asada plate is phenomenal if you ask for it spicy. I ask for as hot as they can make it (and it still isn't quite hot enough) but it's ridiculously tasty and good. I eat here at least twice a week and never have had an issue with the food, cleanliness or anything else other than the Muni drivers using the bathroom without buying anything. Additioanlly, what other Taqueria is going to offer you, flour, corn, spinach, and about  other types of tortillas for your burrito? I've yet to be offered that selection anywhere else. The spinach tortilla's are fantastic. Taqueria Mana, a little slice of Mexico near Chinatown. Their hamburgers rock!Hamburgers at the taco shop you ask. . . WTFYup thats right. Their tacos and breakfast burritos are just OK but their burgers are the best on the square. Better than Bistro and way cheaper and better than Cafe DelaPressing. I am now inspired to make my first list.  If you like burgers this place is a GEM! I made a note to myself to review this place after traveling to San Fran last week. The people that work there were really nice, and I liked the super burrito I got, despite all of the salsa, cheese, and guac being down at the very bottom of the burrito. It was close to where I was staying, so I went back another time and tried the super quesadilla, which was not only a major ripoff, but I watched the guy totally palm the cheese and the rest of the ingredients and then the same guy took my money without washing his hands. Ok, I thought, maybe he washes them after money but before food? I watched for the next order and he did not. So disgusting! I'll preface this review by saying that it's possible I'm biased to Mana because I live in the neighborhood, but damn it's good. This was the first taqueria I ate at when I came to the city and I thought initially it was OK. The problem was I had the ground beef, which isn't the greatest compliment to their burritos. For the next few months, I went here off and on just having the chicken, ground beef, or carne asada. Nothing too special. Then one day. . . I saw this item called chile verde. Thinking of the literal translation, I thought I would be ordering a veggie dish, and wanted something different from chicken and beef so chile verde it was. And oh boy, chile verde it would be for weeks to come! Damn, their chile verde is so freakin' good. I thought this pork dish I had just discovered was so awesome I had to try to find different concoctions from other taquerias. Unfortunately, every other one has been a disappointment when compared to Mana. But I always knew where to turn for the next few months for some great stewed pork. My chile verde bliss would soon end one day. I came into the place and saw the guy behind the counter making a burrito but there was nobody in the place. He told me it was for himself. I asked him what was in it, and he said carnitas. I asked him to make me the same. The first bite of this burrito showed me what awesome was. Since I have gotten the carnitas almost every time with the exception of a couple times when chile verde seemed like an acceptable alternative. Here's my go to lineup:Super burrito: carnitas (of course), black beans, pico and hot salsa, no guac. The no guac is up to you. Me I don't want it in my burrito. Just my thing, it is good though. I like the chips, love their salsa, and the man behind the counter and I always have a short friendly conversation while I'm there while he makes my burrito from memory. If I move in May (which I want to), I will surely miss this place. Taqueria Mana is the best taqueria in the FiDi!  Each time I've been to this taqueria my supreme veggie burrito has turned out delicious!  I completely recommend this place to people who work or live in the area. Bonus: The two guys who run the place are really nice and friendly. Two stars because the guy behind the counter was really nice. . . but other than that the shrimp burrito (my fault for ordering, but it shall NEVER happen again) ruined the next two days for me.  It was relatively clean and very close to Tunnel Top bar.  However, sitting in the San Jose sun watching the USA vs China men's soccer friendly trying to hold down the prior night's seafood/mexican burrito made me want to be dead. ABSOLUTELY one of the better taqueria outside of the mission!wherever I can find barbacoa meat always makes my day.  The nachos are great and the tacos and burritos are so mouthwatering.  The owner Jose is a cool cat with his cell phone always on.  Try some of the Honest Tea in the fridge for a crisp pick me up after a full meal.  Seriously try either the Carne Asada or the Barbacoa. . . . and tell Jose the beer guy said hi! ;) There's really no store front on this little strip of Stockton that can overcome the overwhelming atmosphere of urban yechiness.  I mean, the store is next to ""The Green Door"" massage parlor and there's always a homeless person sleeping  feet away in the stairwell.  That being said, this little restaurant overcomes it's location's shortcomings with friendly staff and good food value.  I live above the tunnel on bush street, and for a long time I forgot that this place was even there.  One of the restaurant's interior wall is painted in a mural of moses parting the red sea; a motif that at first glance is kinda cheesey until you notice that it's dedicated to the passing of ""mama"", then it's just endearing.  I highly recommend the burrito mojado: a two meal burrito covered in enchilada sauce and trimmed with all the fixin's.  All and all, I'd say that this is the best burrito in a  or  block radius, but probably couldn't compete in the Mission (but then, what can?) i never though i would meet a burrito and say ""totally not worth it,"" but now i have.  very average food and pretty overpriced.  the menu is lso very limited. . . ""Sketchy"" is a likely first impression for somewhere this close to the Stockton St tunnel and its homeless regulars.  But as has been mentioned before, the lack of good Mexican food downtown is indeed astounding, which one day combined with a desparate nacho craving to push me through the door.  I was more than pleasantly surprised.  The carne asada was tender and marinated to perfection.  Since my first visit, I've been making my way through the menu on a try not to pig out on tacos every day basis (you know the cravings).  So far I can also vouch for the burritos and the flautas.  Yum. Update //:  Whoa there with the grisle, Mana.  Went a little bit crazy with the crappy parts and thought the marinade would cover?  Well not cool, my friend, not cool. this is a cool little taqueria right near union square. their burritos are okay, I'm just pumped because its next to my house. it located right next to those gross steps at the mouth of the Stockton tunnel. its gonna be about  bucks for a burrito and a drink which is not terribly bad, its just no La Corneta Taqueria at  Diamond St, San Francisco,  phone: ()   If you're in Union Sq. and craving Mexican food, Taqueria Mana is the place to go. Dont be alarmed by the small store front or the location. All the meat is cooked well, the vegetables are fresh, and the food is great and the prices are right. You will usually find a bunch of the retail folk here on their lunch break as it is easily accesible to the square(right in front of Sutter Stockton Garage."|6|85|4|Routine| High risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 2/29/2012 ] Unapproved or unmaintained equipment or utensils  [ date violation corrected: 2/29/2012 ] Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 2/29/2012 ] Inadequately cleaned or sanitized food contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 2/29/2012 ]

JT Restaurant and Catering 2|4.5|Filipino in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|13|2|4.11111111111|" This place really is a hidden gem. Authentic, delicious Filipino food cooked by one fantastically nice mother, tucked away in a random office mall suite on a block with few other things worth stopping for. Portions are generous, and everything was great. I got the beef stew and beef chunks, while my friend got the lumpia and chicken adobo. The chicken adobo really stood out in flavor, I would definitely get that again. Price is very reasonable, cash only. And I always love pointing out when places have no wait because that's such a rarity for decent weekday lunch in the city. No wait!! And the seating area feels like a tropical cafeteria wonderland. Tess is really nice.  When I go there to pick up food, it feels like I'm talking to a filipino version of my mom. Lots and LOTS of food for  bucks, I really like the ground beef thing, not sure what it's called but it's ground beef with carrots and peas in a gravy like sauce.  So good.  The longanisa is great too, too bad it gives you the longanisa burps.  Good thing I do all my work over the phone so no one has to smell it but me. Great place for lunch on days I want to stuff my self silly My co worker and I have been talking about going to JT's as it's right around the block from work so we finally made it out last Friday.  JT's is located inside this building called the Mint Plaza.  Walking in, it felt like your typical ""Turo Turo"" style resto, where you point at the item that you want.  But at the same time, they sold some dry goods and yeah, it felt like a living room in there with the TV, entertainment center, etc.  Any non Filipino who walks in here would say, ""WTF"" whereas with us being Filipino were like, ""This feels like my Auntie's house!""They offered a nice variety of hot food, about ten items to choose from.  They have their everyday offerings such as Chicken Adobo, Pork Adobo, Pancit and such but they also have their daily specials, which was Kare Kare, Pork Sinigang and something else.  I did the two item combo and had the Chicken Adobo and Kare Kare, my co worker also got the Kare Kare but got Lumpia Shanghai as her second item.  Tess, the ""T"" in ""JT"" helped us out and was super friendly, she said just to eat first and pay later.  Before I forget to mention, Tess piles on the rice, she apparently knows her clientele and was so hospitable the entire time we were there, not just to us, but to all of her customers that came in. We sat down and dove into our food.  The Kare Kare was pretty good!  There was generous amounts of oxtail and meat, and the sauce was nice and creamy.  My Chicken Adobo was also good, everyone has their own recipe for Adobo and although it didn't taste like what my Dad cooks or what I cook, it was on spot.  Evenly flavored, not too salty, I can't complain!  When everything was said and done, two  items combos and two sodas came out to $. , not bad at all. Overall, you'll get some legit, homemade Filipino offerings here and it'll fix your lunch time craving. I love Ate Tess & her authentic Pinoy cooking. She makes you feel at home. Food tastes great and at a very reasonable price! Love this place! As someone who works in the TL and needs a little escape from the craziness for lunch time JT restaurant is perfect. The owner is extremely friendly and the atmosphere is like being in someones home. The food is simple but good and inexpensive. . . along with the low key environment it is a perfect lunchtime hideaway. My co worker just showed me this place and I have been working in the neighborhood for  years and passed by it many times. . . . place has a homey feeling with colorful tables and tons of plants all around, you get the feeling that you are eating at your mom's kitchen. One side with rice is $ and two sides with rice are $. . Home cooked pork, beef and veggies that are supper tasty. The woman at the counter is super sweet and friendly. Please, support this local business. local. sfgate. com/b… Decent sized place tucked away in a small strip mall with fast food style service. You walk up to the counter and there is a variety of dishes with the option of either a  or  item combination with rice. I believe it's $ for one item and $ for two items which is a great deal in my opinion, especially compared to the ridiculous prices of other places in the area. The lady at the counter is a sweetheart. I was deciding between two entrees for a  item combo and she offered to scoop a little of my second choice in the box so I could try it. The chicken and pork adobo are delicious and full of flavor. I will definitely be back to try more. Contrary to the first review and in fairness, J T restaurant and Catering, this is not the former New Filipinas Restaurant which was owned and operated by another entity.    J T  Restaurant and Catering is now   under a totally new  owners, husband and wife team Juan and Tess, thus the letter J T stands for.   Food is presented fast food style or in Filipino,  'Turo turo ( all dishes are cooked fresh daily in the morning and afrernoons) with no short order dishes on demand unless requested in advance. J T  Restaurant and catering offers an array of authentic Filipino cuisine,  the way it is prepared in  the  Tagalog region of the islands. The cost of a combo meal is  fairly and easonably priced for the amount of food that is being served compared to most  competitors.  They also cater food for banquets and special occasion as well as office lunches. . In fairness to the establishment in reference to  the comment  made  for the         'adobo 'dish was not fairly discribed . Traditionally, the skin is cooked to add flavor to the stewed dish. , all chicken parts are usually used.  The customer may have gone at a time when certain parts were left at the time. Adobo is among the most popular among Filipino fares next  to 'Lumpia;  There are various iterations on how the dish is prepared based on what region of the islands one hails from. All dishes are prepared based on recipes from the  Manila and Northern  Southern Tagalog regions of Luzon ( The main island of the Philippine archipelago. Aside from lunch and dinner fares,  other Filipino delicacies for  'merienda' (A (afternoon snacks) such as Bibingka (Sticky Rice cake baked in caramelized sugar qith coconut milk)  Turon, ( Fried bananas in egg roll wrapper and caramelized with brown sugar) and 'Palabok' a  noodle dish with achuete sauce(, an alternative to the traditional noddle dish 'Pancit' )and of course l vegetable lumpia and Lumpiang Shanghai (cocktail sized pork lumpia with sweet and sour sauce dip). Each day two specialty measl are offered aside from the regular dishes such offered such as adobo ( Pork stewed in vinegar,soy sauce and a lot of garlic), sinigang ( pork with tamarind base flavor) fried marinated milk fish, and other standard dish popular among Filipinos. Located next to the S F Chronicle building to the left in a little mall strip. On th and MIssion walking distance from the Westfield Shopping Center.  I am a regular customer and have nothing but the satisfaction of having a taste of  'Mom's home cooked Filipino Food. I recommend you try it while shopping or visting the SOMA area. I thought I was going to New Filipinas but was surprised to find something in it's place.  Still Filipino food and still being run by someone named Tess makes me think they just changed names.  What I got was definitely not worth $ (the lunch combo is usually $.  but she didn't bother giving me all my change).  The Chicken Adobo was all dark meat; a bunch of broken, boiled chicken legs with the slimy skin still on.  The sauce was like a watered down, bland brown gravy.  Thankfully, lumpia can never be too bad."|4|86|5|Routine| Inadequate food safety knowledge or lack of certified food safety manager  [ date violation corrected: 8/1/2013 ] Improper thawing methods   [ date violation corrected: 3/8/2013 ] Improper storage use or identification of toxic substances  [ date violation corrected: 8/1/2013 ] Unclean or degraded floors walls or ceilings  [ date violation corrected: 8/1/2013 ] Unclean nonfood contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 3/25/2013 ]
Los Guanacos 0|4.0|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|33|0|3.0| I lwould recommend the zucchini pupusas, yuca frita, and horchata. I love this place. I always order the pupusas over the phone but yesterday I decide to dine in with my wife and son. It took the waitress about  minutes to bring menus and another  minutes to take our order. Then my wife notice that the waitress was helping put the order to go right after she had handed cash without washing her hand. After about   minutes we got our food. The pupusas were decent, not as good as before. But my wife stake with onions was terrible. it smell like the meat was starting to go bad and it taste weird. I know that the economy is hitting everyone equally but some of this place cut too many corners and it's a shame because I'll never go back to Los Guanacos. If you happen to read this, please wash your hand after you have touch money and for haven sake throw away bad meat. You can get in a lot of trouble serving bad meat. I did not said anything because the place was starting to get busy.

Los Guanacos 3|4.0|Mexican in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|33|3|3.92857142857|" Cheap, authentic el salvadorean food. The pupusas were overly dense and greasy. The waiter brought my friend the wrong drink, and when it was time for the check, he left us sitting there for fifteen minutes (and it wasn't busy). Also, I asked if the beans were vegetarian, and when he said no, I specifically asked for pupusas without beans. And yet, when they arrived, one of them had beans. But the first one was so terrible that I didn't want a second one anyway.  star rating cuz these are the best pupusas i've had!The pupusas are made fresh as they always should, which is partly the reason as to why the food takes a little long. . . but who cares if theyre worth waiting for right?! The first time I got a plain cheese one with my Plato Tipico. It was REALLY good. I wasnt dry or overcooked and tasted amazing with their curtido. An El Salvadoran friend of mine says that each restaurant has a curtido that works best with their pupusas. I beg to differ because this is some of the BEST! Do get the pork and cheese one when you go because its even better, with juicy pork adding tons of flavor. The pastels on the plato tipico, which can be ordered as a side, are pretty big and, when eaten hot with their red salsa. The El Salvadoran tamale (which comes in a banana? leaf as opposed to a corn husk) was very big. It was masa with a meat filling. While it wasnt bad, i just didnt care too much for it. The only other dish I've had is the steak with french fries. The steak was overcooked BUT the seasoning on it was really good. Id probably give it another shot, especially since the fries (which are probably just frozen ones) are not bad either. The service is kinda slow here, but its kind of expected with everything made fresh and only one or two people working at a time. Parking is not too difficult either as it is in a part of Mission that is not very busy. Being Salvadorenio, pupusas are as much a part of my life as TV, video games, and cheeseburgers are to the Average American. My family has been coming here for many, many years (so much so that the ladies behind the counter know me on a face basis), and have always ordered the same thing:  pupusas de queso,  revueltas, chilate con nuegados, yuca frita, and a huge tub of horchata. Unlike other things I've constantly been given to eat (hamburgers, pizza, burritos, tacos, etc) I've never once gotten tired of any of the food from this place. Nuff said. The pupusas here are good BUT the other stuff they serve here has been gross when I come here. Stick to what they do best which is the pupusas THAT'S IT THOUGH. carne asada plate was gross & disgusting, yuca frita was horrible & tasteless, salad mediocre. Don't come here if you can avoid it. Unless your dying for a pupusa and dont have a choice. Service also needs some improvement. holy man. . . . I just got stuffed for . Went back and bought more food for home for later. on the last two reviews I went in and tried the Pupusas. . . wow they were good. Made to order and packed with flavor these disc shaped beauties are now on my list for cheap great eats. I rarely order soups from restaurants to go cause they never taste that great. The chicken soup here is literally made like my granma gadie used to make. The stock was flavorful and made the old fashioned way. . . by putting chicken parts into water. The soup had a large leg and a breast, skin and all in it when I opened it up. The chicken fell off the bone, was very juicy and really tasty. The veg was also fresh and complemented the soups light yet hearty stock. Service was also kick ass, the guy behind the counter was nice, courteous and friendly. I will be here again and again, I want to try the other dishes on their menu. This place is great, check it out if you are in the area. this is my to go for place for pupusas! they never fail me and it is always so good! I love their pork & cheese pupusas and their cabbage is made to perfection. I actually ate here once and who would've known just plain steak and french fries can taste so god together! Another big plus is it is not as hard to find parking as the mission. If you are looking for the best pupusas this is the place to go! I would've given this place  stars if it weren't for the service. Otherwise the pupusas were on point. I had dinner at Los Guanacos tonight and it was delicious! it was a little pricey for a family of .  (baby don't really need a whole meal). Up near $. but it was well worth it. The Lengua plate was really good (my mom's is better), and the Pupusas were really good. I'm going to make sure i visit again real soon. Wow, Los Guanacos  what a pleasant little surprise. I will tag onto the rest and say the pupusas were great. This place felt like a home, not a restaurant. From the moment you walk in you can tell this is bound to be authentic. It tasted like a home made meal growing up, and I ordered one of my childhood favorites  Milanesa. We sat back with a few Coronas, tried several things on the inexpensive menu, and were satisfied. The friend plantains are a must too! This restaurant is excellent! The sauce was spicy enough and that's the way we have it in El Salvador. I can do without the chips, as they are mainly a Mexican treat. I still love them, though. The restrooms need updating, but other than that, the food is what made us come there from Chicago, IL. The pupusas are great, the tamales were tasty, the pastel was delicious. The fresco de ensalada very good and best of all the salvadorean beer: they have both Pilsener and Suprema. We crave Los Guanacos pupusas! We have friends that come from iner Richmond for these pupusas.  We always order cheese and/or loroco AND fried plantains with beans and salsa crema.  By the way, they are not deep fried they are handmade cheese filled chewy masa that are fried to perfection.  Then you top them with a vinegary chopped cabbage salad.   Hum V's comment that the ladies who run the place  are ""aloof"" may be the right description, but they are not rude or unpleasant and they run a clean, deliciously prepared food restaurant. I will preface this that as someone who comes from salvadorean ancestry living in the SF, you will not find ""GREAT"" pupusas. It does not exist in this city, and the closest you will ever get to it is by avoiding revueltas all together and just sticking to cheese. Why? Because it is so painfully obvious that ALL pupuserias completely drop the ball in prepping chicharron(pork). How is this possible? Because . they dont put enough tomato in prepping . found this out tonight, but adding garlic is KEY is making great revueltas, and . in the efforts to save money, pupuserias do not fully fry their pork, resulting in a colorless pork. That''s why revueltas end up having a watered down orange color to it, instead of a darker brown look to it. I've had some pretty bad pupusas, but guanacos stood out because not only were their revueltas just tasteless and bland (and almost completely void of any pork at all), but their cheese w/ beans was even worse. They actually used pinto beans, which is a no no when it comes to pupusas. Again, to those who know anything about pupusas, this is another cost cutting (and time saving) technique. I wont even get into their curtido. . . . damn, at least make  thing decent. But to the hundreds who dont know any better, you wont notice a difference. . . but to those who have had the pleasure of eating great pupusas at some point in their lives, avoid this place like the plague THIS IS MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT EVER! I been thru a lots of Salvadorian  restaurants and I have never have better pupusas than the ones they  make here and trust me im Salvadorian I know how real pupusas tastes like. The customer service is nice and friendly too.  star instead of  why? Staff or owners does not give you a warm welcome first of all, (this is my second time). I felt kind of unwanted, I had a non  speaking Spanish friend with  me. The waitress was aloof, from beginning to end. I said thank you as i  was leaving, got a nonchalant thank you. The food was good tho. I'm a white guy. My Asian GF and I got stared at so hard by the customers here I felt like I was back in the loathsome Philadelphia suburbs. Kinda weird because there was already an older white guy there. Maybe it was just that we weren't regulars. But who cares? The waitress was fine and the food mostly delicious. The carne asada plate was first rate. Offered either medium rare or well done nominally, and ordered medium rare, it was actually at least medium, but none the worse for it. Yummy. Nice big piece too. Perfect crispy fluffy fries.  Pupusas are as great as their rep. Best I've had. The tamal was soggy, though the meat and vegetables inside were tasty. A deep fried orangey meat n pastry thing came with my Comida Tipico platter. It was really overly fatty tasting, in stark contrast to the fries and pupusas. I've gotta disagree with the $$ price rating, especially relative to the Restaurante Familiar down the block (listed as $). I have the impression that the prices are actually lower at Los Guanacos and the food better prepared and presented. I'd rate LG a three and a half. (While R. Familiar probably wouldn't merit a return trip) I always get the same two things here: either cheese & loroco pupusas or plantain with black beans & sour cream. Definitely the best pupusas I've ever had not greasy at all. I am just picturing the perfect bite now: a bit of the pupusas topped with the cabbage & a squirt of spicy salsa(yes, squirt. . . the salsa comes in squirt bottles. ) I've been coming here for years & the food is always delicious. It's a no frills type of place and you may have to repeat your order twice, but the food speaks for itself & its well priced. If you comes here once, you'll want to come back. It's good, authentic, simple food. Always get the papusas here and they are so good and cheap.  Also a big fan of fruit drinks.  Good place to go on a cold night to just hang out and enjoy really good food. I love pupusas.  Deep fried masa filled with cheese, pork and cheese, beans and cheese.  You name it.  I love it!  Los Guancos makes their pupusas to perfection.  With each bite I happily accept the fact that I am plugging up my intestines with deep fried joy.  Oh all the damage I am doing to my arteries, but that won't affect me for at least another   years so I am good to go.  I am not a fan of their curtido though!  I like my curtido to actually taste like it is made with vinegar and theirs always taste like it is watered down.  They will, however, give you as much curtido as your little heart desires.  The restaurant itself is no thrills.  And the lights are the brightest lights I've ever seen.  When you drive by on Mission St. you surely can't miss it.  If you have an ugly date or are self conscious yourself, maybe go get your pupusas  ft down the street at Restarante Familiar, which is cheaper and the curtido is better.  (Three wins there. . . you're welcome. ) The place for pupusas and not just in the Excelsior maybe even the Mission. Since the son and his wife took over they really cleaned up the place and the service is as fast and friendly as ever. The pupusas are the best I can get anywhere and I love the black beans with plantains (platanos con frijoles negros) and the soups are tasty. One of my favorites! This place was really close to my high school so I used to go there at least  times a week. NEVER EVER got tired of this place. Now I am Salvadoran so Ive had my share of pupusas and out of all the places I have tried this is on my TOP. I think everyone who has never had pupusas before or LOVES pupusas should make it their business to go to this place! Clean and simple place.  Great juke box which seems to be out of place with the jumping music it plays, but good to have because it livens the place up. Great pupusas. But the service is slow and sometimes confusing. The thing is, you can order  pupusas which could mean  order of pupusas. So if you order over the phone for take out, you frequently get the wrong number of orders. Service is polite but nothing beyond that. However, I still go there because the pupusas are great! Yummy non greasy pupusas! Within  minutes of ordering I hear the pounding of the flour from the kitchen and in another  minutes, the pupusas are sitting in front of me. But tell me why it takes so long for the soup? Of all the items you order the soup will take the longest to be brought out. The fried plantains with sour cream is a fav. The steak is pretty good esp with the spicy seasoning/marinade they use. The salsa is mild and made fresh, no pace salsa over here!The service is efficient, there's's only one waitress that works there so you have to be patient. You cant beat the prices. If you're a single guy who wants cheap home cooked food, this is your spot. It's easy to eat here on the cheap.  My roommate and I split a bunch of food (fried plantains with beans and sour cream, some fried pork with rice, and a couple of pupusas), and our bill ended up being $ or $.  I'm a big fan of the pupusas, and the salsa is DAMN good. These are some pretty damn good pupusas. I can't say they are the best, as the pupusas made by family members take that honor, but these are very close. Los Guanacos is an interesting place. Walking in with my extremely white Polish girlfriend always gets weird looks, but once I order (in Spanish, of course), we all end up talking shit with each other. The food does take a little while, as the pupusas are made from scratch (as everyone else has already said), but it's definitely worth the wait. However, the last few times I've gone, they've screwed up my order. Whatever I end up getting is always delicious, but one time when I ordered an order of bean and cheese pupusas, I got loroco. When I ordered an order of cheese with rice and beans, I got beans and cheese. I love surprises, but sometimes I just want to get what I ordered. A Guanaco, for those of you who don't know, is a llama like animal, but is also a derogatory term for Salvadorans, which pretty much means they are stupid and lazy. My mom made a joke saying ""well it makes you wonder why the place is called 'Los Guanacos' since they keep getting your orders wrong. "" It's okay, though. She's from Nicaragua and there pupusas refer to the vagina. This is the place to get yummy, hot pupusas.  Man and their red salsa is on hit. . . nice and picante with a great taste.  We usually take  or more to go. . . so it takes a good  minutes. . . but  they are always nice and hot!  They also give you extra salsa and a lot of curtido.  Yum Yum!! Like another reviewer said ""Best pupusas ever. ""I have been going there for +yrs now and they have never given me a bad, wrong or cold order. I mainly now order for pick up but the sit down is just as good. Friendly staff that speaks both Spanish/English. Fees are not too bad and parking is usually right outside their door. Best pupusas ever. It takes a while to get your order since they make them fresh as you order them (meaning: they don't make a ton in the morning, stack 'em up in the fridge, and heat 'em up on the fly) but it''s the kind of thing where you gorge way past fullness cuz they're so marvelous. The cabbage is fresh and zingy too."|4|90|3|Routine| Moderate risk vermin infestation  [ date violation corrected: 1/11/2012 ] Improper thawing methods   [ date violation corrected: 1/11/2012 ] Improper or defective plumbing  [ date violation corrected: 1/11/2012 ]

The owners and employees are very respectful. They have pupusas, tamales, and various other variety of Guatemalan food. We go to San Francisco specifically for there food. I had the rellonitos tonight and they were perfect. Sheer hospitality: that's what these kind folks offer to their customers. I organized a meeting for  people here yesterday, and not a moment was lost in making sure my group got seated quickly and comfortably, with tables specially arranged off the cuff. Several factors could have made it more difficult, including the rainy weather, the date happening to be Easter Sunday by chance, and many other locations nearby being closed in result  all of which could have made reserving  seats a hassle. Quite the contrary here! There was a gracious man outside, umbrella in hand, amicably ushering in people from the wet atmosphere on Mission Street's exteriors. Good signs from the get go!Most of us ordered at least a small dish, but our primary goal was to discuss business matters over light food. I remember ordering their Longanizas (Guatemalan pork sausages), which were served over a bunch of lettuce and tomatoes, with rice and beans, plus a horchata beverage. It did exactly what I was hoping for  filled me up without getting over stuffed, and the consumption process did not itself consume the business meeting, which was quite the success!Also, if you're wise with the menu, your individual meal can be under $!Got a tad loud by the end, but with so many people enjoying the holiday with eventual live music, how can one not continue to smile? : )|5|86|2|Routine| Improper cooling methods  [ date violation corrected: 10/17/2013 ] High risk vermin infestation  [ date violation corrected: 10/17/2013 ]
Palacio Latino 2|4.0|Latin American in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|24|2|5.0| I never tried this corn soup before, it was sweet and creamy! I loved it! Absolutely a must try, there was a long line for and for good reason. I chased that delicious soup with a sugar cookie and it was a experience  must have  in the mission.

Palacio Latino 3|4.0|Latin American in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|24|3|4.0| My friend and I discovered this place a few years ago. We were so in love the first time, we vowed to go back again and again. The burritos are pretty damn good. I always get the vegetarian burrito for $. . The sauce totally makes it. And I like how they melt the cheese right into the tortilla. Yum. But they also have a wide variety of guatemalan dishes too. Make sure you save room and grab a cup of one their hot drinks to go at the end of your meal. The rice one is my favorite, but the corn one is delicious too. You really can't go wrong either way. And if you're like my friend, you can opt to get a gigantor container of one to take home. . . or both. Oh, and the horchata is so good, you could drink  like  or  glasses. It's the kind of drink that's so tasty, you just want a constant flow of it into your mouth the entire time you're sitting there.|5|81|5|Routine| Inadequate and inaccessible handwashing facilities  [ date violation corrected: 9/19/2012 ] Moderate risk food holding temperature   [ date violation corrected: 9/19/2012 ] High risk vermin infestation  [ date violation corrected: 9/19/2012 ] Wiping cloths not clean or properly stored or inadequate sanitizer  [ date violation corrected: 9/19/2012 ] Improper food storage  [ date violation corrected: 9/19/2012 ]
Palacio Latino 4|4.0|Latin American in San Francisco, CA|Under $10|24|4|3.78571428571| I've live in the Mission for a while now, and never before noticed this spot. I plopped down at the counter and looked at the limited menu and the instant coffee and was ready to tough it out and give the place one star. I waited forever for my food. The whole time I was thinking, am I just a yuppie? (Well, yes, definitonally. ) I started thinking about my upbringing, and how my family really seems to like places based on ambiance. It was quite interesting to have so many tangents of thought. So, I got my food and I was actually quite impressed. It wasn't organic I'm guessing, but everything was tasty, well seasoned, well cooked  I especially loved the corn tortillas on the side  so fresh. Also, I observed fresh orange juice. I'd go again. Stopped in while killing some time waiting for mission chinese food to open next door. Only ordered some desserts: Banana smoothie, fried plantains, plantain bread, and chips and guacamole. Also had some tostadas. Everything was decent, but not exceptional. For the price I would recommend it, it was completely satisfactory if not overwhelming. I'm not qualified to comment on the authenticity of Guatemalan food, so I won't try. Not quite the Guatemalan food that I grew up with, but close enough to satisfy cravings when they hit. Guatemalan flavors skew significantly milder than Mexican ones, so don't come expecting food that will knock you out of your seat. Highlight is the Pepian, a rich, tomato based chicken or beef stew that goes great over rice. Unfortunately it's only served on weekends. Also make sure to try the super Guatemalan tamale de chipilin, which is great with a side of sour cream. My boyfriend and I have been searching for pupusas and we found them. So delicious! The mixture of beans and cheese was perfect, the masa wasn't too thick and it came with a side of rice and beans. We've marked this one as a favorite. Stumbled upon this humble place a while back; hands down the best hen soup in the northern hemisphere, even without the chicken. Huevos Rancheros and fresh OJ. I think this is a great place to go alone and bring a book. Its never too busy, the waitresses are amazing, and the food is the real deal. We wandered in here after my granddaughter's ballet lesson around the corner on Shotwell.  My daughter found a fantastic parking lot for $.  all day, I can't reveal its location bec I don't know you like that.  We were looking for Chinese, because the little one will only eat noodles. But she was starving and I needed coffee, so we walked in here because it was am and it was open!  The menu was double sided and after a while I realized that both sides were identical.  Because of the lack of coffee.  There was a slight communication problem.  It wasn't packed or even slightly full, but it took forever to be waited on.  Who cares what I ordered?  It's the SIDES that rule.  The bean dip soup thing was impossible to not fill up on.  The torta comes with this fresh tomato sauce that must be slurrped. The tortillas are thick and corny.  There's a wedge of cheese and a good big spoonful of sour cream that you will never finish. The coffee was AOK.  There were plantains and a litte chorizo in addition to your scrambled egg based main dish.  The service is very slow and it took me forever to get cream for the coffee  I kept asking for crema until someone kindly pointed out that what I wanted was leche.  Come here because you're in a leisurely mood and want some simple but delicious home made food.  I suspect the lunch and dinner menus are more than a couple pages.  I also suspect that the regulars know something us newbies don't know  a kid at a nearby table was eating a hamburger, but maybe that's because we'd been sitting there for an hour and they start serving lunch at .  It's worth it to come back and find out.  Ambiance is funky, homey, cozy, and family friendly.  And the tvs were turned down low.  Also, there are pastries at the front of the store.  That's what the little one ended up eating.  Plus all of our cheese and most of our sour cream and a couple of tortillas. We stopped to pick up an order of special Guatemalan style sweet tamales for Christmas Eve  & got lunch while we were there  Very friendly staff & happy friendly patrons & a nice selection of mexican, guatemalan, & el salvadoran dishes service was a bit slow, but we weren't in a hurry  a very tasty sopa fideo with a bit of epazote in the broth was brought out gratis  as always super friendly to the kids  pupusas & the platanos con crema were perfect, but they were out of tamales de elote  the curtido was fresh & just a teeny bit spicy  re other reviewers: I don't know about cash only  we paid with a credit card.  Also, I didn't think this place seemed dirty at all  and yes, the tvs were a bit loud, but only when it was a telenovela  didn't seem as loud when it was futbol. I will definitely be back. This is a great family place. My husband is from Guatemala and we go there when we go to SF. He has tried other Guatemalan places and he thinks this is the best. I like their chile rellenos, very well seasoned and tasty, but make sure you eat them there because they tasted funny when I got them to go. Their prices are a little bit on the high side for a Guatemalan/Salvadorean place but most of the dishes I have tried have been good. I liked their breakfast because they serve you the eggs, beans, sour cream and fried platains. It's also a good thing that they have sweet Guatemalan bread. Finding parking difficult but I guess that how it goes. The students at my school always get pupusas from this place to sell at Food Fest.   They are SO  good!  I always buy extra to take home and eat for dinner and then crave more.  I love the cheese ones with cabbage slaw and salsa, so yummy! Guatemalan food in San Francisco. I don't know where else you can get that. I brought  Guatemalan natives (and I very much appreciated their assistance in ordering en espanol) and they were very impressed that the food was true to its roots. I loved the platinos fritos. The only complaint made by one of my compatriots was that the tamales where a little too firm. Though this gringo didn't mind. i brought an out of town friend here with me.  he was craving mexican and i was craving salvadorian.  we came across this place.  he had the huevos rancheros and fresh squeezed orange juice.  i had two pupusas de loroco y queso, which were pretty on point, and agua de tamarindo.  all the food hit us just right.  if you're lookin' for a latin joint, this place does just fine.  maybe not the greatest, but definitely good. I went in because I saw that a lot of Mexicans/Latinos were eating here  I figured it had to be good! I was hoping cheap too, but it wasn't that cheap. A meal costs over $. Mexican/Salvadorean food in the Mission to me is supposed to be cheap, much like how I don't like to pay double digits for a meal in Chinatown. Anyway, back to the restaurant. The food was good, but not worth it. My grandparents like to treat us here every now and then on sunday afternoons when the marimbas are playing and when it tends to be jammed packed. Only once we had to wait about  minutes to get a table. The food is alright, I've tried the pupusas with beans and rice, beans are good! and fish dishes; grilled and sauteed shrimp with beans and rice. They have shakes; melon, strawberries, and horchata. They also have pan dulce at the entrance. And there's a travel agency inside.|5|82|4|Routine| Unclean or unsanitary food contact surfaces  [ date violation corrected: 3/9/2012 ] Food safety certificate or food handler card not available  [ date violation corrected: 3/9/2012 ] Permit license or inspection report not posted  [ date violation corrected: 3/9/2012 ] High risk vermin infestation  [ date violation corrected: 3/9/2012 ]
