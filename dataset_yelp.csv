State Bird Provisions 0|4.5|Tapas/Small Plates in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|1051|0|4.363636363636363|" unfortunately, this place did not live up to the hype.  the food was good, not exceptional.  i did enjoy the granita and the olive oil ice cream sandwiches, but that's about it. Stellar, Absolutely love it. Every Dim Sum we had was amazing, and the main courses that we had were great as well. The people working there including the head chef were extremely friendly and create a very homely atmosphere. It doesn't feel like a upper class restaurant, but the food is better than any in my opinion. My wife was coming into the city and we decided that lets see if we can get in State Bird, abide it was Monday night, the host, extremely friendly and helpful, let us know that they will have a table for us in an hour and half, we went around 6:00. so we walk around Japan Town for a while and then went back and were seated at the Chef's table, Best seats in the house, promptly at 7:30.Best things about the Chef's table is everything comes out right in front of you, and you can decide if you want it by the time they come around to you. Now about the Food, every bite consists of awesomeness, We order Cumin Lamb(a must have), Kimchi Yuba(good, not great), corn Shortstack pancake(good) for entree, had the the herbal tisane tea (highly recommend), and got Beehive Mousse (Good), and Granita(just Ok, won't order it again)Dimsum: dumpling in the broth, the best broth i have ever had, we got 2 first and then wanted like a dozen more, you have to get this dim sum. Duck liver mousse - i don't even like duck liver and this was great, Halibut - Great taste and perfectly cooked. This has become my #1 restaurant right now, will be coming back if i can ever get a reservation or will try my luck at walking in early on weekdays. . We were too full by the time the seafood cart came around, but they looked so good, i would definitely wait for it. I will be coming back here soon. A restaurant that truly lives up to its hype.  Fantastic meal, dining experience,  and a few gifts from the chef.  A great concept pulled together perfectly. I love eating in SF, it makes my travel life easier to deal with. This was a reservation which was epic to secure, getting 8 or 9 people into state bird for a tasting menu was a challenge. Thankfully everything aligned and when we showed up they gave us this awesome menu with loads of items on it. We weren't sure if we were supposed to choose but soon learned that they were bringing the whole thing. I will actually post the menu since I took a picture of it. Needless to say it was an epic meal, including awesome beer and wine. There were so many good items, I can say nothing was bad at all. We even ordered more dessert since it was so great.The service was excellent on top of the food. The place could be decorated a bit better, but I wasn't paying attention to anything else :) Stand-out meal in SF.   The chefs were too cute to handle, and the entire experience was wonderful.  We approached the logistics of getting a table straightforwardly:  the restaurant opens at 5:30pm, we arrived 45 minutes before and were about 20th in line.  A few people seemed to take the tactic of waiting on line as we did, and then putting their names down for a reservation later that evening.  We weren't sure if that was by choice, or if we were one of the last for the first round of seatings.We were immensely lucky to have been seated at the bar, with a direct view of the chefs in action.  This is not only extremely entertaining, but offered a real benefit in viewing the dishes as they were made, before they were offered to the seated patrons.  Sometimes the chefs leaned over after completing a dish and offered them to us first.The real challenge here is not over-ordering, or saying ""a thousand times yes!"" to the first dozen dishes that are presented to you.  There is a regular menu, and every day they create and pass around new plates dim-sum style.  My suggestion would be to order 2-3 items that you absolutely must have from the regular menu, then try the ones that are passed around.  If you have not reached satisfaction after a few rounds, then you can always order from the regular menu as you go.  We ordered the CA State Bird with provisions off their regular menu which is a small, delicately fried quail (California's state bird, without much irony).  It was flavorful and juicy, everything you'd want in fried quail (or any poultry), and it was with great restraint and to our benefit that we ordered the smaller portion. One of my favorite dishes was a brothy concoction with a variety of mushrooms and herbs.  Sashimi bites served on thick, crispy seaweed was a favorite of ours.  My friend was visibly upset when, just moments after declaring defeat and readiness for dessert, we were presented with pork belly.  My dear friend is incapable of saying no to pork belly, and I cannot disagree with her.  It was a good decision, even though the dish sat there for a good 15 minutes while we mustered up the courage and stomach space to enjoy it.  Lack of restraint brings us to our dessert course, where yes, I insisted that we get both the black sesame ice cream sandwiches (with the peanut milk shot) and the olive oil cake.  No regrets here.  The ice cream sandwiches are somewhat of a marvel - if you like a traditional sundae I would skip this. This is far more ""modern"" if taste and texture, which is neither a good nor bad thing.  I like sesame and enjoyed the unique texture of the ""cookie"" part of the sandwich, it was light and almost meringue-like in texture.  Think chewy macaron.  The olive oil cake was a far more airy and light, with delightful rhubarb accompaniments.  I didn't love all the dishes here - some of the seafood was less memorable and the steak tartare, the peacock of the dishes with the impressive red endive leaf, was not extremely flavorful.This was one of the most fun I've had at a meal, and I will be back for my next SF visit. Absolutely breathtaking meal, all the hype surrounding this place is well deserved. The food is whimsical, the service is sensational and unsuspecting(food comes from the cooks at points), and the atmosphere is warming yet elegant. What we ate:Sweet Corn Pancakes State Bird with ProvisionsPorcini & Duck Fried RiceRed Trout Bacon Curry with SweetbreadsSalmon CollarRice porridge with guancialeDeconstructed shrimp louie Pork Belly with plumsPotato croquettes with beef tongueYeasted butter cakeOlive Oil ice cream sandwichFrom start to finish I was blown away, the Trout was the best piece of fish I ever had.  The crispy skin mixed with the sweet mandarins and nutty hazelnuts was so perfectly balanced I was at a loss for words. The duck fried rice was equally impressive, my favorite part was the porcini aioli they topped it with. The beef tongue was also super playful, put me right inside a classic jewish deli. Everything was perfect, I've never had such an amazing meal. Every element of every dish is well thought out and you can see the hard work that's put into every morsel. Its truly a one of kind restaurant and I recommended every foodie to make a visit. Wow.  Super talented chef.  Very creative. We loved most of the food except the desserts. Honestly, for $100 plus per head, this was a disappointing experience.  We were forced into doing the tasting menu because we had a group of 6 people, therefore, while we absolutely adored some dishes and were basically fighting over the last morsels, others were barely touched because they were a little too experimental for our tastes. If we had been able to order for ourselves we would have been better able to order appropriate amount of some of the amazing dishes that we did truly enjoy.  Thus, some in our party were still a bit hungry when we left. Second, we felt like we were consistently being rushed through our meal, even though we had to wait 5 months for our 5:30pm reservation on a Saturday.  There was no time between courses to sip our wine or chat before the next set of dishes were brought out. Would maybe come back for the state bird, but definitely not the tasting menu. I am a big fan of the atmosphere and set-up of State Bird, and I'm ever grateful for the restaurant saving up to 50% of its space for walk-ins like myself.What you can expect:- Mouth-watering small plates with works of art floating around, literally trying to seduce you. - Knowledgeable servers who take time to explain each dish and its special qualities - A semi-open kitchen, where you can sit and admire young, energetic chefs cooking up a storm- A very patient and helpful hostess who will do her best to accommodate you, even if you haven't made reservations months in advance.I say - well worth the wait, and the price. For me, the green garlic bread was a must-try, and the state bird didn't disappoint either! Diary Of A Crazed FanMay 2014:  Heard the hype about State Bird Provisions, ignored it.June 1, 2014:  Suddently decided that I had to eat at SBP NO MATTER WHAT IT TOOKJune 2, 2014:  Took a napJune 3, 2014:  Read the Yelp reviews and discovered that they reserve over half of the tables for walk-ins.  Are you kidding me?June 4, 2014:  Took another, longer napJune 5, 2014:  Called friend in L.A. (""Pepper"") to ask if she wanted to wait around in line for an hour to eat food at hot, trendy restaurant in SF.  Pepper agreed enthusiasicallyJune 5, 2014:  Contemplated my life.  Query whether slacker friends are enabling me.June 6, 2014:  Took a nap but woke up halfway through to eat browniesJune 19, 2014:  Prepared for SBP dinner by working out, then taking a nap.June 20, 2014:  TODAY IS THE DAY!  SBP opens at 5:30.4:15 PM:  Arrive at State Bird Proviions.  There's no sign but we see a line of people who look like they would wait in line for overhyped food.  Get in line behind 2 other parties who are already waiting in line.  4:18 PM:  Get bored.  Chat with other people who are waiting in life, who are all CHEFS.  Good sign.  Watch the chefs inside work,  get more hungry.  Drool.4:20 PM:  Observe our new friends, in line ahead of us, going across the street to get beer.  Damn they are smart!  Follow suit, ordering Pepper to purchase beers.  Pepper buys bottled beer.  We didn't have a bottle opener.  Bad Pepper!  return to store, use bottle opener.  Enjoy the juxtaposition of drinking beer out of paper bags while waiting to eat at fancy/schmancy Michelin-starred restaurant.  4:50 PM:  Notice that a LONG line has formed behind us.  Drunkenly befriend everyone in line. 5:00 PM:  Notice that there are nervous, older, conservatively dressed people milling about near entrance to restaurant.  Suspect that they are trying to CUT IN LINE.  Share suspicions with entire line, thus creating angry mob.  Only to realize that the older nervous people are responsible individuals who made reservations, not the zany walk-in crowd in line.  Feel sheepish.  Drink more beer.5:30 PM:  Game time!  Got a seat at Chef's Table, watched them prepare food.HOLY CRAP THIS FOOD IS AMAZING! Seriously, this food is really delicious, the concept is innovative, the service is very attentive and warm, and it was generally a fun experience.  I would choose to eat here rather than at Michael Mina or Gary Danko because it's different, relaxed, fun and I like the concept.see you in line!P.S.  Pepper and I were idiots and didn't get dessert (full from our 11 courses).  Bad move. The food here was pretty good.  We had a pretty diverse sampling of different dishes.  I like the format a lot. Literally, ""as good as it gets!""My fiancee and I arrived early for our 5:30 reservation. Luckily, he called to find out that people who have reservations do not need to stand in that ridiculous line to get in. Once we were in, the magic starts.We got the nectarine and the spiced cherry soda. The nectarine was better. The corn pancakes were to die for, esp w/ the tasty Mt. Tam cheese on top. The state bird w/ provisions was good, but not good enough for us to order 1 full bird. Only 1/2 a bird next time. There was a smoked trout and chips dish on the seafood cart that was absolutely divine. And a salmon ceviche dish that was so tasty. We started to realize the dim sum serving style was great but we were overordering!I'm glad we got to try everything we wanted to. There were definitely some dishes I wouldn't get again. But that's not because they were bad. It's because I'll save my stomach for the other spectacular dishes. The service was also great and very attentive!The only negative thing is that we had to literally wait on the internet 2 mins before midnight to make reservations. I'm glad we were able to snatch up a reservation! Totally worth it! I had to wake up at 3:55am 2 months in advance to get a table on Friday night at 7:30pm. MY LORD. So as you can imagine, I had high expectations. Our party of 2 arrived a few minutes before 7:30 and we were promptly seated. Let the show begin. What we ordered:Duck liver mouse with almond biscuitsPork spare ribsSpicy dungeness crab, kimchi yuba and smoked eggHamachi on nori crostiniQuailChawanmushiOystersChips with dip (avocado puree of some sort)Sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino and ricotta pancakesQuinoa and tabbouleh saladChocolate ice cream sandwichBlood orange and mint granita with honey creme fraiche The most notable ones were the hamachi, quail, pancakes, quinoa salad, and the deserts These are a MUST TRY! The rest were just OK. I was a bit disapointed because I was expecting each dish to be mind blowingly awesome, but they weren't. As for the dishes that we really enjoyed, they were delisssshhhh. Both innovative and packed flavors. Service was spot on and really helpful, especially for us first timers. I'd recommend coming here at least once to try! Whether it be by reservation or walk in. It's an affordable way to try a michelin star restaurant as well! It was so good. PERIODDim Sum style American food...why didn't I think of that concept! We ordered almost everything on the menu, and everything was cooked to perfection. We sat at the bar right in front of the kitchen (highly recommended because I'm a visual eater...meaning everything I see, I want to eat) We asked the chefs/waiters: ""what's this, what's that"" and they were all happy to inform us. They were super attentive too. We had the duck liver mousse with almond biscuit. you had me at  duck liver. The garlic bread with burrata is ridiculous and a MUST. The ahi & halibut tartare was really good too, I love the fried Nori chips.I'd definitely come back again and again! Woohoo! I have finally had my much anticipated inaugural State Bird Provisions meal, and it did not disappoint!Review from a vegetarian dining at this restaurant:- The hearts of palm, avocado, and nectarine salad was a party of flavors in a single bowl. There was crunchy, creamy, sweet, salty, and tangy, and yet it all worked beautifully together. Definitely my favorite dish of the evening.- The sweet corn and tomato salad was simple, light, and refreshing. Loved by both carnivores and herbivores alike.- If you're looking for something a little heavier, the corn pancakes are a good option. I thought they were tasty, but not spectacular.- The garlic bread + burrata is a must-have here. It's a tad salty, so you need a good glass of water with it, but the creamy burrata complements the crunchy garlic bread very well.- DESSERTS! Definitely save room for these. Those ice cream sandwiches are so perfect for the end of the meal, and we also got to try their new menu item which was a butter cake with tomatoes and peaches. Very unique flavors. Worth a taste.Note for the non-vegetarians: Although I didn't try it, it was generally agreed upon at my table that the pork belly and plum salad was amazing. Think of every line you have stood in for whatever reason.  I'll argue that whatever you waited for was not as rewarding as waiting in line here.  Willpower is required. If you can't say no to good food you will roll out of there a few pounds heavier.   State Bird has redefined Michelin star service for the better.  Aprons have replaced ties and conversation is the new explantion.I heard Ryan Gosling showed up a few weeks ago.  That's the least exciting thing about this place. The kind of place you don't want to like because of the fact you can't get a reservation, plus the hype.  That being said, this was one of the best dining experiences I've had in the city.  From the host greeting you at the front door, the friendly, unpretentious server explaining the format to the dim sum cart servers.  I loved it.  I think that the dim sum part was the best....athough the fried quail and burrata garlic bread was so tasty, it was the dim sum that won us over.  bone marrow, the steak tartar.  the DESSERT...the ice cream sandwich.  i wish i could go back tomorrow!  want to take my husband there but we'll see if i can get a rez again.  again, the host (a new guy) really set the tone.  he was so personable.  give that guy a raise:) An excellent and exceptional culinary experience. Hands down the most creative yet delectable fare I've ever had. Complexity of flavors and texture all come together beautifully and skillfully arranged on the plate. Love the concept as well; selections of starters and ""mains"" on the menu, but also about a dozen other dishes passed around dim sum style by cart or tray. The fare is outstanding and you should come with a sense of adventure, while knowing nothing other than delicious food will be served to you.  I have been here twice and I'm looking forward to experiencing it again the next time I'm in the city. Food: My mouth is watering, just thinking of it again. It's an East meets West tapas restaurant, where they serve food like yam cha or dim sum, on carts. But there was an option for a tasting menu, which I was guess were for larger groups that were harder to access by cart. It was my friend's party, 8 people. So we got the tasting menu rather than choosing from the cart. Everything that was on the tasting menu was excellant. I'll load up photos at the end of the review. A couple of my friends have been here before and highly recommended the seaweed crackers, which was included in the menu and I was so happy. I usually don't eat fish, but if there are a scattered few pieces I'll definitely eat it, especially for this price point. All 1-8 course I found delicious, but as it got progressively more Asian (I'm Asian, I tend to not eat a lot of Chinese food when I'm out with friends, just because that's all my parents love to eat when we go out together) I wasn't as excited, but they were delicious too. Service: Excellant, our server was attentive and personable. We were a group where only two of us were drinking some sort of extra beverage, and only 1 was alcoholic. But he consistently visited our table and filled our waters, they were never empty. At the start of the meal, he made sure to ask if there were any dietary restrictions, I, oh horrible genes, have a shellfish and peanut allergy. Luckily when I sat down I took  a look at the menu and it looked like there was only 1 conflict, the clam & potato okonomiyaki. And he proceeded to do the same after I had informed him. The person who had planned our dinner had put down his card to hold the table, and when our waiter dropped off the bill, and we had paid our friend. I had to make sure we weren't skipping out on the bill, because my friend had not signed any slip and I didn't see an authorized copy. So we asked our waiter to clarify so we weren't just jumping out on our bill, even if they had his card on hold. Which our server politely went to check on. So the hold card is not charged when you are reserving a party, once you receive the bill you have a choice of paying in cash or using the hold card or another card if you prefer. Do not walk in,  unless you have time to wait and are lucky. It's a 2 hour limit per table. I had overhead from the hostess that it was a 2 month reservation book at this point.Ambiance: The friend, who's dinner this was for, didn't enjoy the pop of color that some of the paintings had, thought it was out of place. It was pretty loud, we had to speak loudly across the table and it was hard to hear what my friends were saying. We were in a small alcove so all the body heat was bouncing around. Probably why we were drinking so much water. A guy who was inline with me for the restroom from San Diego had commented that he felt like he was always in someone's way in restaurants in SF. Which was the case at SBP, you'll have to side step and excuse your way around. We had a reservation at 6, and we got seared right away when we arrived. Love the way that it is dim sum style where they bring around different dishes as well as the menu you can order from. Wait staff super awesome and informative, can flag down anyone and they would help you. On to the food: Really like the pancakes - we tried the corn and duck ones and they were both amazing, probably out favorite dishes of the night.The garlic bread with barrata cheese was so good we got another one at the end of the meal. We also got the steak and salmon tartares. The steak tartare was good but pretty standard. The salmon tartare was about the same except the roasted quinoa was a really nice touch.The Kimchi yuba was interesting but not sure if I'm crazy about the combination. The cumin squid and lamb was good, very strong cumin flavors and left us wanting some rice to go with such an Asian inspired dish.We got the poppy cake and ice cream sandwiches for dessert and they were AMAZING! Best part of the meal!Things that were just meh - The hen dumpling broth was a bit too salty, the green beans with bay shrimp was not memorable at all, lacking flavors. The state bird was fried quail that was just too dry. Overall an amazing experience and will def come back if I can get a reservation again but will likely stick with what I know I liked.o Everything we tried was fantastic. Crispy pork belly and plums, air-dried beef and garlic chips, roasted bone marrow and panna cotta for dessert...plus so much else that went around, dim sum style, that we just couldn't try. Pete, Jesse and John were all great. -Go at least a 1-1.5 hrs early and be prepared to stand outside until they open. -Arrive with a complete party. -If the line is past the hat store, it may be too late. -Make a reservation IF you can! Best meal experience of my life. From the food to the enthusiastic servers, state bird is unrivaled! so good! too good! What can I say that hasn't been written already? Not much.Great spot. Unassuming. Inventive. My recent dinner only confirms the wisdom of the great sage, Peter Griffin, who even as a mere cartoon character knew that ""The Bird is the Word"". Through a computer reservation glitch and a friendly reservation agent, I was able to secure a reservation at SBP. We arrived early to explore Japan Town and by the time dinner rolled around there were about 60 people in line trying to get a table. The answer to your next question is, yes, it is that good. The concept of a cart and passed trays of food options combined with a small menu of standards is brilliant and is executed flawlessly. Nearly everything we tried was unique and well flavored with creative combinations of ingredients. Winners were any dish with duck and the pancakes. The only weak link was a green bean concoction that didn't really pop. For the quality of food and the interesting concept, prices were very reasonable so snag a res and head on down. What a fun spot to eat! We were lucky enough to get a reservation and it was well worth the wait.The staff is so warm and a joy. Every dish has a creative spin and really is such fun to order, eat, and to see what else will come out of the kitchen. I love how the restaurant has a very low key vibe but takes its service and food very seriously. Unfortunately, there was no Ryan Gosling sighting while we dined here.  We went here for my friend's birthday with a group of 16.  The prix fixe menu was awesome because we got to try EVERYTHING that was on the menu that night.  Stuffed full of greatness.  I would go every month if it wasn't impossible to get seated.  Well worth the wait! fun, different and tasty! another thing that added to my great experience was the staff. its gets 5 stars for 1. great, innovative food (not to mention dim sum style- love it), 2. excellent service, 3. parking wasnt THAT bad, 4. CLEAN and aesthetically pleasing, 5. the ambiance (loved that the kitchen was part of the dining experience). my fave would have to be dessert and that says a lot because im not quite the dessert person. be sure to get the ice cream sandwiches and the poppy seed cake- it wasnt too sweet and everything was perfectly balanced. As far as the savory portion goes- im not sure what to rank because they were all just too good. ENJOY Good luck waiting in line for an hour or two to put your name down, only to wait another 2 hours for your reservation time OR trying to get reservation online, if that, are about 2 months out. Unless of course, your Ryan Gosling, then which certainly, you'll be seated without a wait.Aside from the ridiculous test of your patience, the food is definitely worth trying! The state bird - quail - was sooo delicious, I know to get the bigger serving next time! The burrata bread - Wow, I was hesitate to send $4 on what looked like a cheese and bread roll (I mean, it's what it is) but of all dishes, I can't get this off my mind!!!!The Dim Sum style carts are a nice touch. Everything is nicely plated and all-in-all was a great experience. You get to see your food prior to ordering and the waiters are helpful in describing the goodness. TIP #1: You're unlikely to snag a reservation. Get in line around 4:30PM--as long as you're not past the hat shop next door, you're golden!TIP #2: Beer and wine only, but there's a huge selection.Worth the wait. That's really all you need to know because as you're standing in line, shivering as the fog rolls in, you will, inevitably, question your sanity and doubt the awesome reputation of State Bird Provisions. Just know that it's worth the wait. Every few minutes while dining at State Bird is another chance at a culinary excursion. The plates are as delicious as they look. The waiters will happily explain a dish, give their recommendations, and take requests for more. It's quite a hustle and bustle, as waiters push their carts and hawk their wares, but the large space and high, generous skylights make the experience communal and grand. It's exciting, and everyone around you is just as excited as you are!Give everything that piques your interest a try, and be sure to save room for dessert! This place is worth the hype. The tapas style food is reasonable priced yet still sophisticated. The only dish our table really didn't like was the duck liver moose with almond biscuits. The biscuits were so so sweet the really didn't go together. My favorite was the State Bird Provision and the Poppy Seed Cake.  Everything we ordered off the menu was fantastic. The servers come around VERY frequently with other dishes offered. It felt like a Brazilian steak house that is constantly bringing meat to the table. We were joking that we wished we could put the stop sign out because it was becoming over whelming. Overall dinner was a great experience, good ambiance and relaxed atmosphere. There's not much I can say about State Bird Provisions that hasn't been said by foodies that are way more eloquent than me. The only thing I can add is: This is the best Michelin Starred restaurant for the buck, period. Food is great, service is good, ordering bits and pieces of everything so you can sample the entire menu = AMAZEBALLS. Definitely worth the visit, and the wait, to get onto the walk-in wait list. I have heard a lot about this place and finally got a chance to try thanks to my friend who booked this place 60 days in advance. The food was tasty, but what State Bird really stood out was their creativity and service. Our waiter was awesome along with every single staff we encountered at the restaurant that night. They serve their food dim sum style (you can order al la carte also); some come in the little dim sum carts and some come in a tray. The dim sum style is great for sharing so everyone gets to try more variety of food. The 3 of us ate 17 dishes including dessert and none of them were disappointing, although some were definitely better than the others. If you eat like a bird or simply cannot consume everything they offer, then definitely try their porcini & duck fried rice, guinea hen dumpling, state bird with provisions, beef tongue and guanciale chawanmushi, and the panna cotta and poppy seed cake for desserts. Ate here last night. I now want to eat here every night. We sat at the left end of the Chef's Counter, which are by far the best seats in the house. Everything coming out of the kitchen gets offered to you first. This is a blessing and a curse. The blessing part was, of course, the food. You get to watch everything get prepared meticulously. You get to smell everything as it comes off of the line. And you get the entire kitchen telling you exactly what to eat and why. The curse part was trying to will my stomach to digest food faster so I could, in turn, stuff my face with more delicious things. We had to stop after trying 18 dishes. I think I could've done 20, but I also think I might've ruptured something by then, so I quit while I was (mostly) ahead.It's basically a culinary orgasm, over and over with each new dish. Pickled this, fermented that, added into this other thing you may have had before, but never prepared like this. Yes, it's near impossible to get a table here. But you should try. It's worth every ounce of effort. This place is amazing, and unlike many places of its caliber -- actually lives up to its hype (at least in this yelper's opinion!).  As many have mentioned, the wait is infamous -- particularly on a Friday or Saturday.  I got to SBP at 5 p.m. (they open at 530 p.m.) and there was already a line out the door, leaving our table of 3 an opening at 11 p.m. (their last seating).However, the staff are clearly well-versed in getting everyone situated for a SBP reservation and handled everything very smoothly.  Once there, the food did not disappoint.  Just as food is served dim sum style, the composition of the food itself is clearly a fusion of different cuisines and ingredients.  My personal favorites were the guinea hen dumpling, the pork belly with plum, steak tartare, tofu and pork cheek (there's a fancier name but I forget it now), and CA state bird with provisions.The bill was extremely reasonable as well, and with two glasses of wine plus a round of dessert, it came out to be ~$160 for three people (including tax and tip). Definitely a staple on the often crowded and hyped San Francisco food scene, and one I look forward to going back to time and time again (esp. as they source seasonal fruits and vegetables and have rotating menus based on it), even if it does end up being at 11 p.m. :) A very worthy 3 months wait.  We feast on this new American dim sum style with nothing to disappoint. Ben, our server was awesome,  he knew just what to recommend to us.  But everyone is very friendly from the hostest to the entire wait staff.  Great vibe, fun and electic ambience.   It would probably be fun to sit at the counter and watch how food is prep.  Perhaps next time!Amazing food.  We venture out and tried 15 differences dishes, all were great but my favorite are: whole state bird, the duck livermouse,  the bone marrow,  the cast iron quail eggs, the duck pancake,  chip and dip, and off course Kushi oysters.  For deserts both the poppy seed cake and the icecream sandwich was delicious.We also order a bottle of Palazzone Therra, a Santa Ynez Valley Cab blend that paired quite well with all our foods.  For the non alcoholic drinker the Cherry Soda is also a great choice. And the best part is the price is right!Well done State Bird! Well done chef! We will be back as soon as I can get ourself back on the reservation,  sorry I don't do line ;) although I heard that's the best way to get in. One of the hardest places to get a table in the city but so worth it every time we go. How can so many dishes be so darn tasty! I'm mystified in the best way. Ingredient combinations that should not work do. Last night we went got my birthday with a group of 8 so we sat at one of the large tables. The serving style is different with a set menu and everything brought family style. It's a bit overwhelming but we soldiered through the four courses. The highlights of the appetizers were the trout chip and dip and the poke-style halibut on a black sesame chip. Both seriously addictive. The second round top dish is the duck fried rice. And you can't forget the burrata in garlic bread. Heaven. We were getting stuffed by round three. This is when my fave state bird, the fried quail appears!  Yum. Red trout was also delicious. For dessert, the hands down best was the finger ice cream sandwich with lemon verbena chocolate crunch. The service is great. Even with the crazy popularity, they manage to stay friendly and attentive. This place is worth the effort and justifies the hype. Loved this American dim sum expierence, I didn't make a reservation just waited in line when they opened. I would suggest doing that if you are in the neighborhood. Prices weren't as bad as I thought it would've been. We were full paid 86 bucks for 2 people including drinks. And we tried most of the items brought to us. Would definitely come back! Meh.. We gave up a reservation at Gary Danko's to eat here because a friend's friend was raving about it. Queued up at 4pm, which I didn't really mind. There were already around 6 parties before us. It was nice that you could peek into the window to see what the kitchen staff were up to. Was cold in the queue (1 month ago) but there's a Starbucks 100 ft down the road which you can pop into to thaw / get a hot drink. I honestly thought the food was only ok, not great. We got quite a lot of the ""dim sum pushcart"" options, plus others on the paper menu. Not going to go into the details of exactly what was great and what wasn't, but overall, I thought it was only ok. Can't get over the fact that we could have eaten at Gary D instead. Of course, they are at different price points, but... Wahh. I was seriously hoping that I would be able to give this place a 5 star rating, but unfortunately, that would require for me to break the Golden Rule of Yelp. Thou shall not lie on Yelp. While the food probably would've earned them a solid 3 stars, the service sucked ass. Let's start with the wait. My dear friends got there at 5pm to line up for a spot. Of course, we made the rookie mistake of having a large party of 6. Now, I wasn't there to witness this, but from what I heard, my friends were told to step aside while the hostess tried to figure out our situation for 6. Meanwhile, the people behind us got on the list ahead of us. No biggie about that though, we eventually got on the list even if it meant dinner at 9:45.At 8:40, I decided that I simply couldn't wait any longer. Here's where the State Bird Provisions staff failed to impress. The hostess was unwilling to accommodate. When we told her that we would go from 6 people to 5, she gave us a really hard time. Telling us that a table was ready for us, even though this was the first we've heard of this and we didn't receive the promised text. To avoid any issues, I decided to stay for dinner. It literally took less than a minute to let her know that it will be 6 after all, but apparently that wasn't quick enough, because we've lost our chance at the table. Funny though, we stood by the door and no one was taken back to be seated at the table that was ready. Then the hostess unpleasantly asked us if we would be open to splitting up because we would have a better chance to getting a table sooner. Otherwise, we would have a table for 6 at 9:45. We said sure, we're open to splitting up, but if we're waiting till the end, we'd like to sit together. It was a celebratory dinner for my friend who's back in town from med school after all!We were seated roughly at 10:05, making us the very last group to be seated. No apologies for seating us 20 minutes later the initial 9:45 timeline. In fact, the hostess acted like she was doing us a favor by seating us at all. If we were 20 minutes late, we certainly would've lost our table. But you know, this is our time vs. State Bird Provisions time. By the look of things, they have no consideration for their customer's time at all. On top of that, she split up our group. She had the nerve to say ""This is what we were talking about, remember?"" NO. We don't remember. Don't try to play us like this is what you've been telling us this whole time. It just seems like she would rather split us up and not let us sit at the large table because that would mean we would have to wait a bit longer and all of the staff would have to stay later. I'm pretty sure that all of us couldn't have misheard. I can honestly say that my interaction with the hostess was one of the most unpleasant experience I've had with anyone in the service industry. She had a fake smile on her face when she talked to you and would literally scowl when you walked away. #thoushallnotlieonyelpHow about the food? I'm not even going to go into detail about that because my experience was so terrible. Let's just say that the food is their saving grace, but certainly not good enough to redeem them from the horrible service. The flavoring wasn't so unique for my Asian palate. In fact, my tastes buds recognized most of the flavors - although admittedly, I'm used to them in a different form and consistency.I'm likely never going to be back again. I have had the privilege of eating here twice now, and I can't wait until I get another opportunity to come back. Their tartares are absolutely worth ordering (forget your squeamishness over raw food and just trust me on this), as well as their ice cream sandwich dessert (whatever the flavor -- just do it, but ESPECIALLY if chocolate's involved).The highlight of the meal definitely had to be the salmon tartare (sadly not pictured), the ""constructable"" with the halibut tartare (those of you who love the nori seaweed cracker dish of old, this is it's newest incarnation and it's to die for), and the ""shortstack"" with the smoked duck. I'm pretty sure I cried when I bit into that food. I'm so sad that they took the smoked trout, egg and potato porridge off the menu!! State Bird, please bring it back (and keep these other ""commandables"" on there too) and I promise you I will gorge myself and die happy.For three people, sharing ~10 dishes and 2 of us ordering drinks, the total was roughly $120-130 (I don't remember exactly; I was sort of in a food coma). Not too shabby! Thank goodness getting reservations here are next to impossible -- I don't think my waistline could take that kind of abuse regularly! Sometimes you find a hidden gem and you're one of the first Yelp reviewers. Or sometimes you just pile onto the existing accolades for a well-deserving food haven. When my friend offered to share a reservation her friend could not use, I approached with a healthy dose of skepticism. No place could merit this much hype, right? And do I really need hen inside my dumpling or duck & porcini mushrooms on my fried rice? Turns out, yes, YES I do. Everything we tried, from the oysters to the fried rice to the 'chip and dip' salmon tartare was sublime. No, it was F-ing delicious! The partly dim-sum style of service means the food comes fast with lots of chances to try stuff that may not appeal on a menu description. We had a tiny bit of room for dessert and the mini choco crepes perfectly closed the meal (even though we were still staring at what we didn't try on passing trays). And, for a place with so much hype and people making 5am reservations three months out, the bill was surprisingly decent -- around $90 including 2 glasses of sparkling wine. I will be back -- just gotta find someone else who has a friend giving up a highly sought after reservation. Thanks Kimberly and whomever you are, Angela Yi. I was excited to try State Bird as I was driving and humming ""bird is the word"" song on Family Guy on REPEAT.I had a hard time finding the restaurant. The entrance is discreet but I'll let you guys figure it out.Dim sum style, I enjoyed everything that we ordered - the oysters, duck liver mousse, hen dumpling, steak tartare, ca state bird provisions, porcini and duck fried rice, smoked trout-avocado chip and dip, king salmon tartare with bone marrow, and lemon verbena chocolate crunch ice cream sandwich.recommend:stmoked trout-avocado chip and dip with compliments well with king salmon tartare and the lemon verbena chocolate crunch ice cream sandwich.avoid:duck liver mousse - it was AIGHT, and steak tartare. lets just say, i had a queasy stomach the next morning. how did i determine the steak tartare contributed to the queasiness? my gf and i ate everything we ordered but the steak tartare since she does not eat beef - so there you go! overall, service was fantastic and attentive, and the food MINUS the steak tartare was excellent. I'm going to keep this short since it's not like this delightful place needs any additional accolades.  Here are my tips:1) If you're going to forgo waking up at 5am to make a resi online, then arrive EARLY (I'm talking 4pm) to get in to the first seating at 5:30. I know it sounds crazy, that's because it is. And I can't event believe i'm saying this but--IT'S WORTH IT.2) Bread rolls with burrata. Words would not do this godly creation justice--but it's perfection. order it now.3) Pork belly4) They allow you to order a ""half dessert"" it's amazing. So now you can order half of everything.5) You will leave FULL because of the dim sum ""eyes-are-bigger-than-my-stomach-syndrome.""6) I felt that for everything we got (including an $80 bottle of wine) the bill was surprisingly lower than I would have been willing to pay for such a delicious meal.I want to go back again and again and again. (and i'll get smart and order at least 3 of those bread/burrata things) My second time at State Bird (post-renovations) was a much more pleasant experience! Our waiter was very friendly and was on top of his A game - he checked up on our table often and was a pleasure to interact with throughout the night. The food that we ordered off the menu was delicious (the trout and the smoked duck pancakes - wow!) and came quickly. The ice cream dessert was out of this world, and was again my favorite dessert. But my favorite dish remains the deconstructed seaweed cracker (formerly the nori seaweed cracker). We ordered a large ($22) amongst the three of us and I was in heaven with every single bite. I LOVE State Bird! It's a good thing that reservations are hard to come by or I would gain so much weight and be so poor from eating here all the time. :) the best part is the wines by the glass. not sure the food is as spectacular, maybe we ordered the wrong things. some dishes just seemed like they were trying to hard to be 'inventive' by throwing random bits of food together. the concept is fun, and sorta shakes up your traditional approach to ordering/dining. it does make for a v large bill at the end, tho. Good but does not meet the hype. The one amazing dish is the ice cream sandwich dessert. It's unreal. I know, doesn't sound like it, but just try it. If you want a spectacular dinner, go down the street to SPQR and prepare to have your mind blown. I love the food. But the entrees aren't really entrees. Just order two of everything to get a normal sized dish. Its expensive but cash money lifestyle you hurr me. James Beard Award for Best New Restaurant 2013One Michelin StarMade Reservations On LineI've been wanting to try this place out and I'm glad I was able to get a reservation.  It's your American Style Dim Sum type place.  Staff comes out to your table with trays/cart of different dishes.  We arrived about half an hour before our reservation.  To my surprise, we got seated right away.  The night started off really SLOW.  We sat at our table for about 5 minutes before getting acknowledged.  Then, we waited for another 15 minutes for the first tray to arrive and another 15-20 minutes after that.  Thank goodness for our server, who noticed and got things moving along by having staff come to us first.  Great service to him!The food was really TASTEFUL.  I had lots of favorites that night and was amazed as to how much flavor those little dishes had.  My taste buds were awaken that night!  I wish I had room to try desserts, but my husband and I kept trying everything they brought us.  My favorite that night was the Guinea Hen Dumpling w/Aromatic Broth, it was so good!  My least favorite was the Duck Liver Mousse.  The biscuit was good, but the mousse, just not my thing.  Here is a list of what we had (missing a few since I have more pictures than what I have listed, lol).My Favorites! -CA State Bird w/ Provisions (Fried Quail) this was perfect! -Guinea Hen Dumpling w/Aromatic Broth (savor and taste every bite, it's so good, my mouth watered every time they walked passed our table) -Spicy Steak Tartare (this was spicy but really good!)-Smoked Trout-Avocado 'Chip & Dip' (yummy!)-Pork Belly Plum Salad (OMG so good!! all I needed was rice)-Raw Oyster w/Spicy Kohlrabi Kraut & Sesame-Garlic Bread w/BurrataWe also had these dishes, which was okay, but my husband loved.-Duck & Fontina Croquettes-Guanciale Chawanmushi-Duck Liver Mousse w/Almond Biscuit Good food, but I would call it mind lowing. Def worth a try. Dumplings, oysters and custard were really really yummy. Very disappointed though with steak tartare . Dessert was great! As for the derive - superb! And helpful with the wine list! Food's ok but nothing memorable.  A bit of a feeding frenzy as trays keep appearing and you keep saying ""yes"" hoping each new thing will be the magical concoction you were expecting but I was almost always disappointed. The oysters were weird. The hen dumplings bland. The pork belly with plums boring, the ice cream sandwich just plain silly.  Good wine selection however to make you forget it all.  Before coming I stopped at Palmers for happy hour and had their meatballs and that was the best thing I had last night. This place is freakin' amazing.I have to admit, after hearing all the hype, I was expecting something to be a little bit off. Maybe the service would be a bit pretentious. Maybe it would be good, but not worth the price. Nope - everything was on point. Service was gracious and professional. Atmosphere was also great, you don't sit on top of other parties and you don't feel like you're being rushed. The food was amazing. I loved so many of the dishes that I can't pick a favorite.  And, the price was right for the quality of the food and the experience.I went with three of my girlfriends and we all agreed that this was one of the best meals we have ever had. If you have the opportunity to eat here - go. HYPEEEEEEE........I hate it when I get tricked into hype. The only cool thing about this place is that they serve food Dim Sum style. You can choose foods that you want or pass on to the next cart. But that's like all Chinese Dim Sum restaurants. Was the food mind blowing? No.They were different, yes, but did not mesh well together. No need for reservations, get there a little earlier to line up and you're most likely to get a seat. We visited early Spring without a reservation through their online reservation system. In hindsight, I should've asked the concierge service on my Amex to book it.If you fail at getting a reservation the old fashioned way like I did, don't fret as they accept walk-ins. The trick is arriving early before they open: we arrived at 4:30 pm on a weekday and they open for walk-ins at 5:15 pm. i.e. you're waiting in line outside so prepare for colorful pan handing and bring a book. Food: AmazingStaff and Service: AmazingReservation process: Does it exist? If you can come early and don't mind waiting in line, this will likely be the best way to get seatedSee if you can be seated at the bar by the kitchen area - the chef(s) will engage you and you can see whats coming next on the dim sum style menu. I give it 3.5 stars but rounded up because of the yummy ice cream sandwich and tartar. I have had my eye on this place for over a year and I just thought it was impossible to ever come here because you cant call for reservations and doing it online is impossible unless a spot magically appears on a weekday night. It says there are not reservation for months ahead so that seemed pointless. My sister had gone one time and waited an hour for the open seating and it worked so I tried that as well. Just like Orenchis status, I got in line at 4:30pm on Sunday, an hour before opening and stood in line. Our group was probably the 7th party so we had to be seated. That hour is pretty miserable since it is cold but I guess you can watch them make the food. Origin SF is right across which I hear is the next poppin club. You wouldnt even know that it is State Bird because there is no sign. I wonder how Ryan Gosling found this place haha. I wonder which godly seat he sat in when that photo circulated among my friends. The doors opened and I am not sure if the huge line behind me was able to all be seated. If not, it would suck because the second wave would have to wait until someone from the first wave finished, which would be 90 minutes later. I say if you miss the first boat or you know you wont make the first round, save yourself some time and come around 7 or so because by then there were a few empty seats. I am not sure if those would be used for reservations or for walk-ins but there was no line outside when I left at 7:30pm. So at 5:30pm we were seated at a booth and it actually looked a lot more modest looking than I expected. I was imagining some fine dining but it felt quite hipster SF in there. It is dim sum style so people come around with trays and a cart. You can also order from the menu which we did as well. The waiters are attentive and nice but it is sorta hard to catch their eye when you want one of their dishes. The items definitely started to add up and each of the six ended up paying $40 including tax and tip. We got the following from the dim sum items:1) Beef strips- we ordered two of these and only one was necessary. Tasted good but nothing crazy.2) Mushroom ravioli- One order comes with one ravioli so we cut two into four pieces each. I dont think the tiny size allowed me to really appreciate what I was eating. I would pass. 3) Oysters- there was some ginger type thing on top that none of us liked so we just ate the oyster. It was fresh but it was $3 for a tiny one. Dont think the size/taste justified the price. 4) Tar Tar with some type of fish- I thought this was good because the quinoa was crunchy and added great taste and texture. I recommend. 5) Mushroom porridge- Not my fave. 6) Garlic bread with burrata- Not my fave. The burrata was just way too much. 7) Fried pork belly- this is just fried fat with some pork. It is like what you would get at a Chinese restaurant. 8) Salmon- The presentation was nice since it was a long strip of salmon but it tasted average. From the menu:1) Fried Quail- this is what the restaurant is named after and I couldnt really taste the quail since the fried breading was just too much. Unfortunately not my fave. You can do half orders since each order comes with four so we did 1.5 orders.2) Duck Fried Rice- This was one of the better dishes since the duck was flavorful but you can probably get this at another Chinese restaurant. 3) Halibut tartar- this was my favorite savory dish. The seaweed was the perfect holder of the tartar and it was so crunchy good. I loved mixing it with the fish and the avocado! Great dish and I highly recommend it. 4) Poppy seed cake- this dessert comes with little cubes of this cake that has a denser texture than a regular cake. It was good but by far my most favorite item was the ice cream sandwich. 5) Ice cream sandwich- I LOVEDDD this. You can do half orders as well but we just did one order that came with four pieces. The sandwich part is like rice crispies which is something I have never had before. It was a great texture. It was vanilla ice cream with chocolate chunk pieces within the ice cream. Ahhh it was heavenly and I loved it!I have had tapa places and I feel like because of the appearance of exclusivity, it has been a little overhyped. Some dishes were a hit but others will make you feel confused on whether you are judging the dish correctly.**TIPS**1) Come 45min-1 hour before opening so you can snag a spot in the first round. If you know you cant make it, just try at 7pm hopefully.2) Go with a group so you can try different things. If you only go with one person, you can try to eat everything since the dishes are small but you wont finish it all and you wont be able to try as much. I think a good size group is 4-6 if you dont mind splitting multiple little dishes. It will add up though.3) You musttt get the Halibut tartar and the ice cream sandwich. I would throw in the duck fried rice for funsi I like eating weird food as much as the next guy. But when you go over the top, you just lose me.Pointing at SBP.First off, getting a reservation (via the traditional sense) is near impossible. In other words, it's impossible. But if you have a credit card that has a concierge service, go that route as they will make it happen. Don't get me wrong, I liked the food here. But it just didn't blow me away. I did like the fact that eating here is also a learning experience. Color me stupid, but I had no idea there was seafood in kimchee. The service is 5 star and the staff right on top of things. My take, if you are just DYNG to go here, I'd say go for it. But if you are just looking for a nice meal out without having to think about what you're about to consume, then just head elsewhere. I really would give SBP 3 1/2 stars, and I am in no mood for rounding up. The Bold Italic recently featured a study claiming it's harder to land a reservation at State Bird than to get admitted to Stanford. Does any restaurant, no matter how good, deserve this much hype?I was lucky enough to have an insomniac friend who happened to be awake at 5am so she could book us a dinner date 3 months in advance.But I was skeptical at first. Any restaurant that tries to churn out ""East-West fusion cuisine"" for high-end prices leaves me with low expectations. Even more so once I stepped foot inside, and spotted the playful (almost childish) decor. I was definitely expecting something a little more fancy.But as soon as I started my meal, everything all started to come together and make sense. Cute waiters were carting around little dishes -- just as they would at any real dim sum restaurant -- and you could just order at your leisure. And I have to say that the Asian-inspired (yet still distinctly Western-flavored) dishes were TASTY. Say what you will, but State Bird is incredibly creative and fun. Every bite I took was filled with unique bold flavors and layers of texture.My friends and I shared the following:- duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - garlic bread with burrata- tombo tuna-avocado and seaweed cracker (by far one of our faves)- State Bird (we had to! of course it lived up to its name)OMG and so much more that I can't even find online. Definitely don't skimp on the Chinese-style pancakes -- again, I almost didn't get this as I couldn't imagine it would taste good, but I was pleasantly surprised. I've since learned that you can't go wrong with anything here, so order whatever appeals to you.State Bird is the kind of restaurant that makes you proud to live in San Francisco. Keep up the good work, SB! so many great things about this place! however, minus one star for the terrible allergic reaction i suffered hours later (i've never been allergic to anything in my life...until now lol. and i can't even pinpoint to what it could have been since we ordered 10+ plates). but honestly, i'd say that the food/ experience was worth the $150 copay to the ER... i probably will never go back to state bird though =(.. haha!do yourself a favor, set your alarm at midnight to make a reservation 2 months from now. The line looked ridiculous and i felt like i was hot shit being let in first right when they opened. my most favorite plates: 1) crispy pork belly. sooooo yummy and all of the ingredients really did mesh well together. (plum, vinaigrette sauce, bronze fennel) 2) bone marrow- there was a ton of shit in this plate...i couldn't tell you what exactly, but it was perfect with the sea salt. everyone says the ca state bird with provisions is the best, but honestly i thought it was overhyped. it was tasty, but not the highlight of my meal. just tasted like a different type of fried chicken. the waiters/waitresses deserve 5 stars. they were extremely attentive and knew every detail about each dish. we ordered about 11-12 dishes that were split between 2, the bill came out to around $110. not bad considering i was pretty full and i have a heavy appetite. i'd like to say that i'd come back, but i fear the itchiness and rashes. would recommend it to anyone anyday though! I was so lucky to score seats to such a highly rated restaurant! Reservations are done months in advance (thanks to my boyfriend's brother) and it makes the whole seating process a lot quicker. Without reservations, you would have to wait outside as if you were at Disneyland waiting to ride Splash Mountain. A section of their seating is reserved for walk-ins, and as long as you line up at least an hour before they open (yes, there is already a small line outside by 3:30pm... and they open at 5:30pm), you can get seats. Also, this isn't the place for large groups. I don't recommend you to bring your kids neither. I would say parties of 4 at max. Better yet, go with 2. Perfect date setting.The décor is extremely plain but yet also nice at the same time. Maybe its because of the lighting? But the walls are just one of those plain walls with holes that you can place hooks on them  (sorry for the lack of vocab). The place is pretty spacious, despite a packed house, with servers running around with trays or carts of small dishes. The servers would come around and explain everything in the dish, giving you a few moments to decide before moving on. They also list a price on a little stand so you can definitely decide if you want to take the dish or not. The quality of the food was phenomenal, and everything was really delicious. Pricing was more on the expensive side. I mean it is good food but the portion was small, but then enough to share. There are 12 items that are served around by the servers, and the rest are on the menus. We didn't get all 12 dishes though. Where to begin with the food? It's tough, as everything was good! Let's start with what I really liked.-- Raw oysters with spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesame: I love the fact that it was not too large like Boiling Crabs. Sounds crazy right? But I enjoy eating smaller size because it lets you enjoy more of other flavors rather than a chunk of blob. The flavors mixed so well together where you can't taste the fishiness. They were fresh as well. -- Steak tartar with jimmy nardello ranch - Really delicious and I didn't realized that I was eating raw beef because I thought it was tuna or something, until my boyfriend told me. The entire dish was well put together.-- Salmon tartar with pickled turnips - A better choice for tartar over the steak version if you don't want to eat raw beef. This tasted a lot lighter and this time you can tell that it is seafood, not beef haha.I guess its more on the normal side of eating something raw.--Ca State Bird: This tasted soooooo good! The cheese and onions went so well together with this and I just gobbled the whole thing down. The smell was great and the taste was even better! My boyfriend's mom keeps putting onions on my bird but turns out it was cheese and I felt so fat after eating it lol-- Corn & quinoa 'tabouleh' -A really fresh dish that looked super healthy. The flavor and satisfaction was all there for me. I can eat quinoa every day!-- Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - (not my favorite, but it is my boyfriend's brother) I only like the biscuit because the duck liver was too overpowering for me. This was one of our first dishes, and we were left wanting more after finishing every last bit of it (well they boys wanted more of everything.. I just wanted the biscuits)-- Roasted bone marrow with mushrooms & pink peppercorn: For people who like bone marrow, this is for you. The flavor was a little too rich for me but still tasteful. The size was just right for 3-4 people to share, unless you really like bone marrows and you want the whole thing to yourself...feel free.--Garlic Bread With Burrata: I'm sorry, but this was the only meal that was gonna bleh to me. It tasted way too cheesy and garlicy for me that I totally lost my taste. I only took one bite and I was done.Dessert-- Birdseed bittersweet chocolate crunch, caramel cloud cream, blueberries - A great end to an excellent meal! The chocolate crunch was really light. I wanted more after each bite. The biscuit was so deliciously moist and soft. The cloud cream was so fluffy and cold. I love how it was served on a random piece of wood.-- Green tea granita with ginger-vanilla tapioca & roasted strawberries- It has an icy/ slushie taste, which was really nice as well. Nothing too special about this but it was very light and refreshing.For the amount of food we ordered, we could have easily paid a lot more than what was on our bill. Our bill came out to be a little under $200 for 4 people. The food was really enjoyable and quite memorable. Dining at State Bird Provisions is an experience, and it definitely lives up to all the high reviews. I just reserved another time for me and my brother! We followed Yelper's advice and arrived a bit before they opened to get our name on the walk in wait list. The couples before us receive the last 7:30 slot, therefore, we got the 8:30 slot. Damn.  I wanted to dine here for a long time, so I felt that it was justified waiting three hours to eat. First question that popped into my head, after dining here, was it worth the wait? Nah. Second question would be, was it delicious? It was indeed.I love the restaurant's concept but hated the stool eating area. My boyfriend and I complained that our back hurt after eating there. I am guessing it's due to the seating arrangement. However, sitting on these damn stools afforded us an awesome view of the kitchen, the very tiny kitchen. They explained their dining procedures; it is very much like dim sum eating. I love this concept because we were able to taste a vast array of food items without having to order a full order. We did order some menu items, which was the bone marrow, the oat covered sweetbreads, and quail eggs. HOLY MOLY! I enjoyed all three. The sweetbreads were freaking delicious. I never eaten sweetbreads before but I have heard that if prepared well, they are great! They prepared it amazingly and the broth added a nice flavorful touch to the crunch of the meat. The quail egg yolks added such a nice coat of flavor on your tongue. The eggs flavored well with all the ingredients in the dish. Finally, the bone marrow was the best one I have ever eaten. The bone was heavy with marrow and the red peppercorns added such a nice flavor. The mushrooms in the marrow added a meaty texture that married well with the oily meaty marrow. All the dim sum type things we ordered were okay. I cannot even recall the five items anymore. They were not as remarkable as the meals we ordered. I remember one of them being oysters, I have had better oysters elsewhere. Oh, one thing I do recall is their garlic bread. Get that. That was crunchy, soft, garlicky heaven in my mouth. The desserts? Get the milk shots. It was like peanut butter milk; it was absolutely refreshing and delicious. We ordered the dark chocolate crepes. That was a nice finish to the evening. It was sweet but not overly sweet. The pistachios, strawberries, crepes, and sauce all worked well together. It had all sorts of textures that were extremely pleasing to taste buds. State Bird Provisions is making a huge fuss.  I didn't want to believe the hype, but i my predispositions were pleasantly overturned upon dining here.  The standalone menu offers a variety of tapas that you can pair with their extensive (in both price and breadth) wine list.  Excellent service and delivery.  Really like the ambiance of the open air kitchen where you can see all the magic happen.  Alongside the standalone tapas, chefs will swing by your dining area with freshly prepared daily specials, much like a contemporary dimsum.  The cuisine here can be classified best as fusion.  The flavors offer a melting pot of influences that really demonstrate the chef's knowledge of local and international flavors.While all dishes were fantastic, here is what was particularly memorable:-  Raw Oyster with Spicy Kohlrabi Kraut and Sesame-  Duck Liver Mousse with Almond Biscuits-  Tuna TarTar & Seaweed Crackers-  Pork Belly Plum Salad-  Sourdough, Sauerkraut and Percorino Pancake-  Bone Marrow Roasted with Trumpet MushroomsPROTIP:  Do what you can do score a reservation.  I was wowed by the value put out by SBP.  Bold flavors, and even bolder pricing.  The michelin star here is completely warranted.  I'm excited to see them push the culinary envelope in the coming years. Truly an amazing dining experience. If you live in SF and you haven't eaten here yet, just go already!When we were there, the menu was very heavy on seafood. We had chips with roe and creme fraiche, trout tartare, uni pancake, crab kimchee soba (absolutely fantastic), beef riblettes, and french bread with burrata.Zero complaints, zero issues. Can't wait to eat here again. The most amazing Chinese concept of dim sum turned modern American!  My favorite items were the ceviche style halibut with the fried seaweed, bone marrow, state bird, duck croquet and ice cream sandwich!The fried seaweed was a perfect salty crunch and scooper for the Ceviche halibut was refreshing and light.Bone Marrow- melt in your mouth! I scooped every morsel out!Duck croquet-fontina cheese and shredded duck with almost a hoisin style sauce.  Felt like a roast duck enrobed in cheese!Ice cream sandwich- similar to a French macaron shell with lemon verbena and chocolate morsels inside. Topped with a plum and chocolate sauce!  Yummmm!!I just ate there last night and I'm already having residual palate needs for the statebird and halibut this evening!  *SighHence the daunting line-I will be back!!! Like a culinary playground for your mouth!  So many textures and favors that you don't get bored. However I felt there were so many heavy tasty bites that I found myself looking for something refreshing to reawaken my palate. Very cool concept. The food overall was pretty good and it was nice to try so many dishes! The portions are so small that even if you don't like it then it only a bite or two :). Go in a group of four so you can try more stuff. I've never waited in line for so long before but it's worth the wait! Eating here is an experience! I love that they serve dim sum style and everyone is super friendly. Their entire menu is so unique and creative that you just want to eat everything that comes around, but don't worry the portions are perfect so that you can try a lot of the small plates that serve you just enough to satisfy you. Also, don't forget to look over the menu that you can order additional items from! I know that making reservations for State Bird online is almost like a lottery, or registering for classes that you're in dire need of, but I hope that doesn't discourage you from ever trying this place! Parking is also fairly easy around the restaurant. If you have to, you can easily use the Japan center garage that's just across the street, but street parkings should become free around the time you come for dinner! Wow. FAN.TAS.TIC. This is absolutely one of my favorite meals I've ever had.  Good luck getting in...but totally worth the time and money.  The food was beyond words! There are no words in all the world's languages to describe how phenomenally, exquisitely and sublimely delightful this place's food is. It is, by far, the best meal I've ever had. It's also the most expensive meal I've ever had, but it's just so mind-blowingly amazing I would've gladly paid double.The pork belly and plum salad, paired with a 1979 bottle of cab (yes, the year's correct), danced along my taste buds like a culinary ballet, melding and meshing to create an earth-shattering mouthgasm like none other.Oh, the kimchi was also amazing, as was the smoked salmon tartare. To top it all off, the dessert shot tasted like a liquid Reese's pieces.I took pics, but refrained from posting them. Pictures simply do not do this food justice. It'd be an affront to the food to even entertain the crazy thought that a mere picture could capture the divine essence of these epicurean masterpieces (impeccably presented as they were).Simply put, you need to experience this for yourself. Whether you book a reservation months in advance, or walk in and brace the four hour wait, I can assure you it's worth every minute of the wait, and every last, solitary cent.Will definitely be returning. Amazing dimsum-style fusion restaurant. Just say yes to every dish they offer you and you can't go wrong. Possibly the best place I've ever eaten. So good. Amazing. We got in line at 4:30 p.m. on a Monday to get a reservation. Worth it. Got a reservation for 9 p.m. Worth it. The hostess is possibly the sweetest person ever. Even got a selfie with her. Once 9 p.m. arrived, we were seated and immediately greeted. Place a few orders, and then the food started coming around. What a fun, crazy experience. I have never experience anything like it. Different waiters begin bringing around different dishes to purchase as they are created. So fun. Have a drink or two, and you will have the greatest time of your life and try a lot of amazing food. The pheasant was great, and wow, the BONE MARROW (OMG!!!) so good. We laughed, ate great food, drank awesome wine, and made some great memories with new and old friends. Loved it. Worth the wait. Totally. Wow. FAN.TAS.TIC. This is absolutely one of my favorite meals I've ever had. Here we go...THE WAITNo reservations available online. We arrived at 4:30pm on a Friday - ended up being  around the 12th party in line. Got seated once the doors opened - there were only 2 of us. A group immediately behind me in line had 6 people, and I saw them sit down after we were done eating which means they might have waited 2 more hours AFTER the place opened. Crazy. SEATINGIt was larger than I expected inside. I had read that sitting at the counter was the best seat so that will be my goal next time - plus then you can see all the dishes and know that you've seen everything. My friend kept wondering if more food was going to come around and what she was possibly missing out on. Anyway, we were seated at a booth in the back. Very comfy and great view of the whole place. We also had no problems getting to see each dish. Nothing ran out by the time it got to us, or if it did, it came around again later. No need to worry - they will feed you!THE FOOD! THE FOOD!Where do I begin??? Getting in on the first seating is great because you are starving (after waiting in line) and everything comes out super fast and the flow of food is great. But you also get super excited and want to order EVERYTHING. (Warning: Pace yourself! It's okay to say no to a dish - chances are good that it will come by again later or you can ask your server to bring you some if you decide you want it later.) You can also order off a menu. Here's what we had, and I don't remember the names, so I'll just describe. Mind you, everything here is worthy of being alongside the best tasting menus in SF in my opinion, but I'm rating in comparison to the other dishes that night:-Beet salad-type dish (3 stars): This was the first thing that came by and I was just so excited and hungry that I ordered it, but it wasn't too memorable. -Duck mousse w lil dough balls (4.5 stars)-Croquette with duck & fromage (5 stars) -Pork belly w nectarine (4.5 stars)-State bird w provisions (5 stars) - Got the half, but recommend the whole. But I don't think I got the best part as we split it and it tasted a bit gamey to me.-Pancakes: sourdough & sauerkraut (3.5 stars) - My friend LOVED it; I liked but not love.-Dumpling in lemongrass broth (5 stars) - Flavor explosion-Oysters (4 stars) - I'm not a huge oyster person but these were great, not too fishy tasting either-Trout & avocado mousse w chips (4.5 stars) - We were torn between the trout & salmon. Both looked & sounded amazing.-Garlic bread w bur rata (5 stars) - OMG. Love.-Dessert: Berry tart deconstructed (4 stars) -Dessert: Ice cream sandwich (3.5 stars) - Ice cream was great, not sure I liked the combo with the rosemary cookie thing; might've preferred to eat them separately-Dessert: Green tea granita (2 stars) - Odd taste combo; not a fan-Dessert: Chocolate cake (2 stars) - We didn't actually order this, but they gave to us by mistake; not really chocolate-y, seed part was not my preference, and just another oddball.Overall, desserts were a slight let down, but also because the savory dishes were so ridiculously fantastic. We didn't order a few things because we were getting full but I wish we also got the quail eggs and bone marrow. Next time!SERVICEExcellent! We had the nicest server and he was helpful in guiding us along and suggested half orders here and there as we wanted to try EVERYTHING but weren't sure if we had enough stomach space! Very attentive and stopped by to check on us enough to be considerate and not overbearing. THE DAMAGEBill came out to about $120 for two of us, which included 2 glasses of wine. SO WORTH IT! In the end, was I full? YES, comfortably full. But we still thought about eating more because it was all so good but we stopped short of painfully full. I felt like I'd be hungry again in another hour, but actually I wasn't hungry at all the rest of the evening and we ate at 5:30pm. Overall, I loved my experience here. It lived up to the hype and more. As we were walking out, I really wanted to leave our name to come back later that night to do it all over again. I've always wanted to try State Bird Provision but didn't have any luck with the online reservation system. On Sunday afternoon, I decided to try my luck and wait in line for a table. Arrived at around 4:50pm, and I could already see 30+ people standing in line. It wasn't until 5:50pm when I finally got to the front of the line, and was told that the next seating will be at 9:45pm. After waiting in line for an hour, I was just happy to get a table. How do you spend 4 hours waiting? Well, you can catch a movie at Sundance kabuki theater, walk around Japantown, enjoy some live music at Yoshi's.Finally 9:45pm rolls around and the restaurant is still packed with guests. We waited again until 10:20pm before we could get seated. At this point I'm starving, and could eat an entire village. We tried the following dishes:1. CA state bird with provisions (whole)Very tender and delicious. I gobbled the entire bird as I was starving. Highly recommend ordering this.2. Duck liver mousse with almond biscuitReminds me of foie gras, but less solid in texture. Delicious.3. Raw oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut and sesameWe were told the oysters were from virginia. Not sure why they wouldn't just use Bay Area oysters. The oysters were just OK, nothing spectacular4. Duck & fontina croquettesIt was hard to taste the duck, it's just like eating regular croquette.5. Garlic bread with burrataWas disappointed with this one. Taste like dough-y cheese puffs. 6. Pork belly plum saladMy favorite dish of the night. Tender, crispy and moist pork belly in a fusion of amazing flavors. This is one dish you must try!7. Roasted bone marrow with mushroom & pink peppercornIt's good but a bit too salty for me. The odd thing is they give you a tiny plate of salt in case you want to add more salt 8. Cumin lamb with squid,snap peas, Thai basil & datesThe squid was tender and delicious. The lamb is tender and flavorful. Love this dish.Overall, the dishes were creative and delicious. There were exceptional dishes like the pork belly, duck mousse, and fried quail. However, the rest of the dishes taste too salty (and fatty) for my taste.Would I wait another 5.5 hours for SBP again? Probably not. First off - if you don't have reservations, make sure you are there at least 1 hr before the restaurant opens. You will not regret it. As a group of three we got two seats + 1 standing space by the kitchen. It was the best spot near the kitchen and incredible food that came pouring out. The unadvertised tapas were as amazing as the ones printed on the menu. The duck liver mousse with tiny corn breads were delicious. Actually everything was awesome...you can't go wrong. So this is what tapas mean, very small plates.  No need to try the wonton, please skip, not worth $3.00 for one wonton.  Use that money to get dessert.  This dining experience requires your taste buds.  Beef tongue tasted like pastrami.  Garlic bread with burrata (mozzarella and cream), a little heavy.  It reminds me of a bread puff.  Didn't taste any garlic.  Pork Belly (Crunchy on the outside and cooked perfectly) was my friend's favorite.  They had bone marrow and it was a good size bone marrow.    My favorite was the asparagus with whatever cream sauce (tasted like reduced blue cheese?) and shavings of cheese.  We had the root veggie tapas.  There were quite a few dishes with figs, but I've forgotten which dish came with them.  The thing with these food is that you should have the menu in front as a cheat sheet of what you are eating.  We loved our waiter, Ben, who was patient to explain every little dish that came by our table.  My friend wanted to acknowledge Ben.  I have to say the wait staff really makes the dining experience fun.  In this case, I felt like we were in a test kitchen being the taste testers.  We should hand in our evaluations and raise our number paddle like Dancing with the Stars!  10!  The Blue Bottle Coffee ice cream sandwich with macarons cookies was a 10!  The lamb dish was a bit salty.  The blueberry/strawberry meringue tart was my friend's favorite dessert.   Having dinner at 9 pm was not our first choice and leaving full and satisfied at 10:30 p.m. made me more alert.  I had to wake up at 4 am to make this reservation 2 months ago.  Was it worth it?  YES.  Once we got there, we didn't have to wait long to be seated.  The place had no door signs, so look for the portholes.  They had remodeled and I am so glad that they opened up their dining area with bench chairs.  Their last seating is at 10:00 p.m. and definitely, there were plenty of seats for those who want to come late.  The bill came and we didn't feel ""robbed.""  I felt like we got our money's worth and I didn't have to stand in line or drive 2 hours to Napa.  The atmostphere was very relaxing and we can actually hear each other talk.  The chef bid us good night as we walked to exit, so all is well. Sunday evening. Arrived at 5:00pm for the 5:30pm opening. Long line. Was able to score a 7:15 pm seating for our group of three. Returned after beers and snacks at nearby Japantown establishment. Seated immediately at the chef's counter with a great view into the kitchen. Love that. Service was, over all, attentive considering the packed house and full waiting area nearby. I won't go into the dishes since so many Yelpers have done that. What I like about SBP is the experimental feel to every dish. Since they cost between $8 and $15 for a a sharable plate, it's not as though you're out a lot of money if any one of them just doesn't work out well. And that described three or four of the 12 or so dishes we enjoyed. Nothing was bad and some were outstanding. SBP is a cool concept. I'll be back and soon. No surprises, it is really Bomb.comCasual, unassuming and very good, unique dishes. I would love to go back. We lucked out and got a reservation a month in advance for a Friday at 5:30pm.The line for walk ins when they opened at 5:30 was very long. No line at 8pm - wonder if the wait is shorter for a late dinner. I suggest trying that.Our favorite dishes were BY FAR:State bird with provisions (friend quail) - get a whole not a halfPork belly dishBuratta garlic breadcoffee ice cream ice sandwichEverything is good - we loved it all and loved being able to try different things. The staff are warm and friendly and there are a lot of them around, keeping things moving.Wines by the bottle are on the expensive side but food is not expensive - great date place. Note: There is no sign on the door, so keep a lookout for the address and/or a fancy silver door next to a window where you can see chefs cooking.After waiting forever to get a reservation at State Bird Provisions, I was finally able to dine here (then promptly sat on writing my review for half a year). The food at State Bird is definitely unique, and I loved a lot of their complex combinations of flavors and textures. However, there were also a few dishes that I didn't enjoy. Reservations are highly recommended, unless you don't mind coming early (before they open) to wait in line for the tables reserved for walk-in guests. If you have a reservation, you get to bypass the line and walk straight through the doors to check in with the hostess, who then seats you promptly. They have a menu of dishes you can order, and also servers who push a cart or walk around with trays of other dishes that change daily. We tried:-Raw Oyster (w/Pickled Kohlrabi, Togarashi Oil, $3/ea, yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): This was good, but not amazing. The oysters were fresh, but I didn't love this and probably wouldn't order it again.-Duck Liver Mousse w/Almond Biscuits ($6, yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): I loved the chewy almond biscuits more than the duck liver mousse, and would order this dish again just for the biscuits. Highly recommended!-Guinea Hen Dumpling (w/Aromatic Broth, $3, yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): Just ok- the dumpling skin was thin, and the broth was flavorful, but not amazing.-Garlic Bread w/Burrata ($8, yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): Yum! The burrata was delicious, and I liked the texture of the garlic bread.-Hamachi w/Avocado Sauce on Nori Cracker ($9, yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): Ok- I loved the freshness of the hamachi pieces, but it was awkward trying to balance the pieces of fish on this large cracker.-Mushroom Risotto (yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): Ok, but really heavy. This dish had good flavor, but really fills you up.-Crispy Pork Belly, Grapes, Jalapenos, Vietnamese Herb Vinaigrette (yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): Yum! The pork belly was really tender, and I liked the flavors of this dish.-Glazed Pork Spare Ribs ($20, yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): Just ok- I had higher expectations for the ribs. The sauce was sticky and on the sweet side, and the ribs were tender, but I probably wouldn't get them again.-CA State Bird w/Provisions ($16, yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): A must order- this is the most amazing dish on their menu, and I would definitely come back to have this again! The quail is perfectly crispy and super flavorful.-Lobster Salad (yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): Yuck, this was my least favorite dish, and I didn't like it at all. Skip!-Sourdough, Sauerkraut, Pecorino, Ricotta Pancake ($8, yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): Pretty good, and you get a huge portion for the price. I thought this dish was interesting, and would recommend trying it, but it really fills you up.-Buckwheat Bao, Coconut Cream, Carrot Jam, Maple Pecans ($8, yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): Eh, disappointing. The bao looked really pretty, but it was hollow inside and very bland. Also, I didn't like the coconut cream/carrot jam combo- skip!-Eggnog Ice Cream Sandwich, Almond Macaron, Cocoa-Sherry Coulis ($8, yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): AMAZING. I wish they sold this ice cream sandwich in stores, because it was so delicious, and this is coming from someone who isn't an egg nog fan. This is a must order if/when it comes back on the menu!-Bittersweet Chocolate Ganache Tart, Brown Sugar-Oat Crust, Olive Oil ($8, yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…): Just ok, but I don't think any dessert could live up to the eggnog ice cream sandwich. General Manager Ryan Anderson has called my criticism inappropriate because I don't think the staff should count money in front of the guests, or to not offer the full menu because you want to close, or have the kitchen staff walk by the table with sanitizer buckets that smell like chlorine while you finish dinner. Gee, Mr Ryan Anderson; Who is inappropriate? You claim to be General Manager yet you don't manage your staff. Why is it appropriate to pay the same money when only a portion of the menu is offered, the kitchen staff ruins your dinner with chlorine, and you get to watch the staff count all the tips in front of you?So Mr. Ryan Anderson, sorry for calling out the faults of your Michelin rated restaurant, but if they saw what I saw you would have got slammed. I don't know why you couldn't have let well enough alone. I gave you four stars to be nice, but after your passive aggressive response using an owners account (Nicole K.). I have to tell the truth about an overrated restaurant. WOW!  Yes, I still am in hearts with SBP.  I was on the wait list for a table of 6 and I was able to get in - I was beyond excited.  It was $60pp and we got almost everything on the menu.  Great deal & great food.  I highly recommend going with others so you can try more.  Bravo! 4 STARS for the creativity of their restaurant. Call me crazy, but I was one of those people who woke up at 4AM just to make a reservation. The reservation date (May) was 60 days from when I booked it (back in March), so I decided to take this advantage to take my parents here for an early Mother's Day dinner. Was it worth it? DEFINITELY.State Bird Provisions offers tapas style food served on dim sum carts and trays. Loved this concept because I thought it was pretty creative and different. There's a small menu that lists pancakes, commandables, and desserts. There are also other dishes offered on their rotating dim sum trays and carts. I'm not going to go deep into the details of the food we tried, but just the gist of it.---Rabbit Pâté: Kinda reminded me of the duck liver mousse, which I preferred more than the rabbit. It had this interesting taste that I wasn't too big of a fan of. :(Duck and Pea Croquette: Just OK. Not my cup of tea.. :(Duck Ham-Maitake, Pecan Pancake with Kumquat Mustard: Originally, I thought it was just going to be a regular pancake but with duck. I was wrong. It was actually pretty unique and tasty! There were so many bursting flavors. All the ingredients just meshed well together! The duck wasn't too fatty nor gamey. Garlic Bread with Burrata Cheese: Garlic bread was just OK, didn't really taste the garlic in it.. But loved the burrata cheese! Big portion of the cheese.Beef Tongue and Potato Dumpling: Beef tongue was OK, but really liked the potato dumpling! Chewy on the inside, but crispy and fried on the outside.Duck Liver Mousse with Almond Biscuits: Really enjoyed the duck liver mousse. Smooth and flavorful. The almond biscuit complemented it very well.Egg Custard with Sambal and Green Onions: Pretty interesting and tasty. It was like a soup but with egg custard in it. Really liked the kick to it. CA State Bird (Whole): State Bird = Quail. Just OK, had a little bit of crisp to it. Roti of Curry Rabbit: JUST OK. Not too memorable. Presentation was eh...Crispy Pork Belly: I love pork belly and I liked how it wasn't too fatty nor oily. Had that crisp to it. Hamachi on a Nori Chip: YUMMY! Hamachi was very fresh and the nori chip was very crispy. It was not too heavy.CA Black & White Bao, Saffron Custard, Golden Raisins, Pistachios: The bao was just a regular bao.. Nothing too special.. However, I did really enjoyed the custard meshed with the raisins and pistachios. Chocolate 'Ice Cream' Sandwich, Smoked Meringue, Spicy Cocoa Nibs, Strawberries: Sad, we missed when they were serving black sesame or the poppy seed ice cream sandwich a few weeks ago. :( This dessert was a bit too sweet for my liking and a bit too normal. :(---Overall, I do not regret waking up at 4AM to make this reservation. Definitely worth the experience. Service was excellent and the staff were pretty friendly and accommodating. The total bill was about $150 for 3 people, which was not bad at all, especially since we got to try out so many different types of dishes. Plus, my parents both enjoyed it since it's something different from the usual. If you do plan on giving State Bird Provisions a visit, I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend getting reservations IN ADVANCE!!! :) This past Saturday, we lucked into a friend of a friend giving away their 7pm reservation for State Bird. We snapped up the reservation without hesitation, and man am I glad we did. As far as SF eateries go, this experience is easily in my all-time top three.Our waiter recommended ordering at least three items off the menu and filling in the rest of the meal with dim sum... an approach that I highly recommend. Everything was delicious and memorable, but my highlights were the pork belly with pluots (two of my favorite foods, magically meeting in one exquisite dish), the guinea hen dumpling, and the hearts of palm salad.As for the non-food elements, the waiters and waitresses worked as a cohesive unit and were all knowledgeable and quirky. The decor was understated on the exterior (which made it a little difficult to locate), and was charmingly modest and unique on the interior. It's refreshing when a place lives up to the culinary hype without being pretentious. State Bird, you make the Quail proud. I have long been a huge fan of State Bird Provisions, but my dining experience last night was so disappointing.Most dishes that were passed around never made it to our table, so there were a lot of things we couldn't try.  Our server was so preoccupied that we barely got any attention to request any dishes.  All the other staff remarkably seemed to dodge any eye contact whatsoever. The oysters were mediocre, the chips and dip were so-so, the quinoa salad tasted like it came from whole foods, the duck liver mousse was just okay this time (very, very gamey), the guinea hen dumpling was insanely salty and chewy, and there were probably a couple more that I'm forgetting.The anchovy pancake was the best thing of the night, but it wasn't that great and it took a half hour to come out.The sweetbreads were disgusting.  They tasted like fryer oil and breading, and were unpleasantly chewy rather than tender and creamy.The hearts of palm salad was so salty it was inedible.  We had to send it back, but that took 10 minutes because we couldn't get anyone's attention.  Really mediocre meal and bad service.  State Birds, I'm pretty disappointed, and I'm not sure I want to come back. This place is a fun experience! Even the wait wasn't too bad as they took our number and texted when a table was ready. I really enjoyed the use of ingredients in a different way, like tofu skins as pasta. The duck mousse with little muffins were also very tasty. I will definitely return to try some other dishes the next time I am in town. What? No more canned beer here? Well, that's cool because the food is still excellent, albeit the very difficult reservation. Dim-sum concept will please everyone but sometimes they get a tad aggressive with the delivery. Still, better to have a duplicate dish than spontaneous table fight over a spoonful of tantalizing, umami-packed goodness!Every time I've come here over the last few years the menu has always changed. The best suggestion: go with your gut... any dish no matter how unique--think pancake w/powdered sauerkraut--is going to be outstanding. Only real question is when to stop?A restaurant is most divine and sacred during it's first incarnation. Case in point, Slanted Door and even Bar Crudo. Even with the recent remodel, the vibe at State Bird has been kept close to its core. I am thankful for that. I was lucky enough to have a friend who had scored reservations back in October, and was able to get in on a Saturday night. We had a table of 6 and therefore there is a set menu, where we got to try almost everything in the menu. The meal was served in four courses and everything was not only delicious but very inventive. I also heard they got their Michelin star recently, so I'd go sooner rather than later! You will not be disappointed. Yep, this place is the real deal.  Since eating there last week, I've been scouring my calendar for the next available date to get back.I could waste your time by using the rest of this post describing each dish we had, but why bother?  Just go.  Try everything.  You won't be disappointed. 14TH MICHELIN STAR EXPERIENCE: BEST VALUE OF ANY ONE MICHELIN STAR RESTAURANTI've been to several one Michelin Star restaurants. I've never been to a two Michelin Stars restaurant. Before heading to a two Michelin Stars restaurant I wanted to go at least one more one Michelin Star restaurant. (Even if I do go to a 2 Michelin Stars restaurants I will go to a one Michelin Star restaurant if it's worth it.). There are two (2) one Michelin Star restaurants I wanted to try before ""graduating"" to two Michelin Stars: State Bird Provisions or Gary Danko.Last Thursday I decided to go to State Bird Provisions because last year it won the James Beard Award for Best New Restaurant. With all the provisions, which are items that are served in a dim sum style-service, provided there are so many items to choose from whether they were from the menu or the provisions. First I had to be strict and picky. Since California's state bird is quail from the menu I ordered the State Bird and the half dozen quail eggs. For the provisions I had a wait and see approach; I didn't want to get the first few items that were served to me. If the items where what I had before then I wouldn't choose them in fear that I might get too full too early. Also each provision item cost an average of $9 if you're not carefully the cost can add up too quickly. The first two provisions that I passed were steak tartare and tuna tartare. I passed them because they were too ordinary. I've had steak tartare in the past however I regret not having the salmon tartare because I never had it before. The other provision I item I regret passing was the grill asparagus Caesar-style. If I was going to eat vegetables the grill asparagus would have been the dish. The first provision item I ate had Chinese influence - the guinea hen dumpling. It had the texture of a won ton soup. Then the first item from the menu was the State Bird. Though small with its heavily breading it resembled fried chicken. Yet despite a small dish the quail was very favorable. Instead of ordering a whole quail I only ordered half a quail; I regret not ordering the whole quail. The next provision item I ate was beef tongue pastrami, a clever dish of taking beef tongue and cooking it like pastrami. The fried potato was a great compliment for the beef tongue. One of my ""kryptonites"" at restaurants is bread. My third provision item was garlic bread, which was deep fried, topped with burrata. This item is so bad for your heart but tastes so good. I can never see garlic bread in the same matter again. Just like Anthony Bourdain, he and I have the same weakness when it comes to a specific item. My other ""kryptonite"" is pork. The two provision pork dishes I had were ribs glazed in their own juices and pork belly salad. Growing up I was used to ribs glazed with barbecue sauce, but having ribs glazed in its own juices enhances the flavor of the ribs unlike barbecue sauce where it tends to hide the flavor of the ribs. Since I passed on the grill asparagus I felt the pork belly salad would add some vegetable to my dinner. LOL. The remaining provision item I had was almond biscuit with duck mousse. The duck mousse was smooth and rich. It had a texture that was similar to foie gras. The half dozen quail eggs were the final main item from the menu. The texture of the quail eggs was similar to gazpacho. This dish was very refreshing. For dessert I choose between the ice cream bar and CA black and white bao with saffron custard. I choose the latter. Even though it was nice I regret not taking the advice of my server who recommended the ice cream bar.In the past when I went to ate at 1 Michelin Star restaurant I would have to worry about how much I would spend. There's a Business Insider link (businessinsider.com/chea…) that lists affordable one Michelin Star restaurants in the Bay Area. For those restaurants I would order items that would result in a bill that would be under or match the suggested meal price on that link. The problem was that I felt suffocated because I was worrying more about the price instead of the meal. At State Bird Provisions I felt liberated as I didn't have to worry about overpaying because the provisions cost an average of $9. That means you can enjoy your meal without splurging. For nine items I paid $85 a hell of a value. And most of all I was stuffed. Being stuffed at a Michelin Star restaurant for under $100 - priceless. It was delicious, efficient and fun. My favorite is the green tea granita with tapioca pearls. Everything was super YUMMY! !! It was like American style ""dim sum"" the staffs were friendly!! Must try the spicy kimchi, pork belly, duck liver moose. And the ice cream sandwich! ! The waiting line wasn't long. But it was definitely nice that we had a reservation.  Will definitely be back soon! This is a fun place to hang out with friends, at least three or more, but not a place for fine dining. Their dishes are similar to an un-orchestrated firework, a chaotic combination of everything that tickles your taste buds, plenty of cilantro, mint leaves, garlics, and vinaigrette. With all these ingredients to dress up pork bellies, bone marrow, and other fine selection of meats, you have to be a nincompoop to mess it up.I said it's a fun place to dine because you get to order their many samples and share them among your friends. Much like Chinese dim sum, each dish is different from the next, that keeps the conversation alive on the table. But unlike Chinese dim sum, all entries in SBP are new inventions and we customers are like Guinea pigs, that's how I feel. This place cost twice as much as fine Chinese dim sum, I guess the extra money goes to the service, the cleanliness of their kitchen and toilet, which are notoriously poor in any Chinese eatery. My dad raves about this place. Is it worth the fanfare and absurd 2 hour plus wait outside? To a certain extent it is. I think the long wait may boost the entire experience and for some, over bake expectations. Go with a small group of hungry friends and you should have a good time.The interior has this kind of hip whimsy that you'd be more likely to find in Oakland. You can see chefs running a kitchen in the front yet I think the real entertaining chaos is reserved for the back kitchen. The space dining area is only large enough to keep that exclusive feel.Food service is a la dim sum style. Food runners will carry food trays to eat table for diners to either accept or decline. The diversity of food and wait time is on par of most dim sum spots. The excitement of the food runners and energy of the patrons gives State Bird a lively atmosphere.The food is a little hard to explain. All I can really say is that it's contemporary-fun California cuisine. I imagine this is food that chefs would feed other chefs. The food is whimsical and fun. It may sound and look somewhat strange but it's all about the flavors and textures. You will definitely not see any of these dishes coming out of most restaurants. I felt like I was eating the first or second draft of a food dish, but it still was unique and tasty.____Is it novelty or is it genuinely delicious? It's both. So.  We were in San Francisco for 2 days and asked the concierge of the hotel we were staying in about State Bird as we had read about it on a food magazine that I had bought in London.  ""Most popular restaurant in the whole of the USA"" we were told.  ""just won a James Beard award"".  Well we are from London so no idea what that really means but we thought as it was a Sunday night we would give it a go as a walk in.After we found it, we got through the door into a packed little lobby.  On chatting to a few people in the queue, they asked us how many months ago we had booked or whether we had started queuing at 4pm that afternoon.  General laughter when we explained what we were trying to do.  We rocked up at 8.30pm with our daughter.  Anyway, to cut a long story short, 10 minutes later we were sitting at the counter in the kitchen.  Best seats in the house if you like food.  Just proves its always worth being nice to the hosts.So after a great chat with the sous chef who was working the station directly in front of us we understood how it all worked and had a bit of the background.Our take on the food was this:Fried bread and burrata.  Really not very good if you are from Europe and can tte hold of Burrata.  This was a Californian product that the chef readily admitted it was not real burrata.  So all in all rather odd and not very tasty.But that was the only duff dish that we had.  The quail was good but we really enjoyed the pork belly , the salmon tartare and the pancakes ( which were outstanding - we tried 3 types).  All in all I think between three of us we tried 18 things, so we made a pretty good dent in the menu.I have to say the service was outstanding.  Sitting at the kitchen meant we got to have a really interesting chat with the kitchen team, all of whom were absolutely charming and very happy to chat whilst cooking.So, in summary, a really interesting concept that had a fun buzz about it and delivers good to very good food.  We are very happy we went. This place changed my life and how I view the eating experience. It was like being a little kid again and your parents taking you out to eat for the first time! The style is so new and refreshing...the service is unbeatable, it's as if you're distant cousins back in town and they want you to have the best meal of your life! The food needs to be experienced, words can't give the smells and flavors justice. I only hope I get to eat here again. Thank you state bird. This spot was good...but I don't think its worth the hype. Will I come back and eat, yes. Will I wake up at 4AM to magically get a reservation? No. Sleep is precious.I came with a few friends, after our friend got her boyfriend to wake up at 4AM to get the reservation. On a Friday. At 7:30. Needless to say, it took more than 1 night of getting up to get this reservation. I bask in the prize without having to pay in. Sweet.We had a ton of different things. Of which there's no way I'll remember them all now. What I do remember:Almond thing with Pate: Yum. I love pate. =)State Bird: Interesting, but not super impressive.Bone Marrow: Was really good, but bone marrow tends to be pretty awesome. This wasn't the BEST I've had, but pretty decent.Salmon (raw) with fried quinoa: was really good. The quinoa added great texture to the dish. Garlic bread: I had this at LaCocina,and it was pretty good then too. Love that cheese!Pork things: something fried. Pork. It was soo good. Seriously. Dumpling/won ton: it was aite, but not really amazing. But the broth was pretty solid.Chocolate cake thing (dessert): pretty good.Grapefruit slush thing (dessert): Pretty good.Overall, the food is really good for what it is. However, the wait and the overhype makes me push it to a 4 instead of 5. Because although their service was awesome and food was pretty solid, the over hype killed it. I'm sorry. Its one of those times that popularity works against you. At least...you still have Ryan Gossling... 5-stars period, enough said. Ok but for those who don't know me I'm a carnivorous foodie and this place was EXCITING, inventive and edgy! We'll be back, no questions asked. We tried pretty much every dish that came our way as well as a few things from the menu (including all of the desserts)... And I loved everything! So rare for that to happen! Flavorful, well-prepared, creative, beautiful dishes.  The duck liver mousse, halibut on seaweed, duck-fontina rillettes, ricotta pancakes, burrata garlic bread, state bird, pork belly, and bao w/ saffron mousse were perhaps standouts, but get whatever looks good to you! You won't be disappointed.Also, friendly & professional service.  I just wish that  my sparkling wines had been in a flute rather than a regular wine glass, but not a dealbreaker. Great restaurant! Delicious food and the staff here is awesome! I love talking to them and vibing over the food since they love it as much as all of us! 4.5 Stars.Enough has been said about SBP:  It is dam good. Go early. Order most everything. Most common word used in this establishment: YES .Now that I have that off of my chest. I am so impressed by Stuart Brioza, his vision, his crew, their humbleness in the face of huge success. They treat the customer so well and are so nice this made a huge impact on me. Yeah Ryan gosling ate here and so do a ton of well to dos......but everyone is treated with love and respect here.My hat is also off to Stuart for not going nopa soma fidi or what have you...but doing something in a neighborhood that could really use it. Yeah panda express, sushi boom II, and Poppeye's doesnt really help the area..imho. It could have been rent considerations.I appreciate that Stuart came by the table raving about his anchovies and taking the time to explain where they get them, what they do to them etc. BTW...I have never had anchovies like this....they were amazing. The man is a genius.Ah the details. This place aint cheap: Four people was roughly $260 (this is without tip so add another 20%) and that is with me bringing a bottle of wine! But you pay for what you get and what you get is handcrafted, unique, beautiful quality food, in an amazing atmosphere.Okay my tips to you:If you want to get in without a reservation get there at 4:35 ( I know it is crazy but it is what it is). If you are 14 or less in line you will get in no problem. I love that they only reserve half the tables....this is what I mean about treating everyone right.If you can get in before the close ( not everyone wants to eat at 5:30???_) say 10 minutes to 10 they will offer you the same show...all the carts and all the food....again treating the customer right.They are expanding to next door so that should take some of the pressure off reservations.Thanks Stuart and crew, Chuck, and Anne...it was ahmazing!!!Definitely worth eating here!!! I was lucky enough to be invited by a friend who scored a reservation to State Bird.  I wasn't really sure what to expect since I've heard lots of praise, but also lots of claims of overly-hyped food.  So, I tried to go into this dining experience with an unbiased palate, and I honestly thoroughly enjoyed my meal.  I didn't feel it was over-priced.  Between 4 friends we probably tried 10-12 dishes and each had a glass of wine (or two in my case), and the bill came out around $70/person after tax and tip.  The things that stuck out for me were the duck liver mousse (so, so good) and the smoked trout and avocado chip & dip. Love the dim-sum style service - instant gratification when the food is ready as soon as you see it!  The only bummer was I heard Ryan Gosling was there last night, and I missed it ;). Absolutely amazing. After getting lost trying to find the entrance cause of a huge line in front of the Fillmore we found this food paradise.  Most award winning restaurants have a snooty unwelcoming environment this however was the complete opposite. Stepping in you could tell this place was different and you can smell all the amazing food from outside. We had just got paid so me and my girlfriend wanted to buy everything so we did. We had 15 different courses and a majority of which were outstanding. The pork belly, quail egg, state bird, dumpling, and all of  the deserts were out  of this world good.   PS Don't leave without trying the pork belly it has so many different complementing flavors in one bite. WOW. This place is seriously incredible and well worth the hype. I've been looking forward to the meal since I made reservations at 4am 60 days in advance. It definitely did not disappoint. The dishes our group of 4 ordered were (in order of preference):State bird (quail) with provisionsHamachi avocado on seaweed crackerPork belly blood orange saladSmoked trout avocado chip n dipSalmon tartareGarlic bread with burrataRoti of curry rabbitStone-ground oat-crusted sweetbreadsPlus the chocolate ice cream sandwich for dessert. My only regret is not ordering double portions of the quail and hamachi (pretty small portions). I seriously can't wait to go back. What an amazing idea! What a great little place. Ok, if there was a 4.5 stars, I would give it only because of their reservation rules (5 people max) and we actually had to get someone to wait in line for us for 2 hours to get a table and then when we were there at 8pm (our reservation time), they made us wait for 10 minutes. But, that's fine. I will give it 5 stars anyway because the food, service and ambiance more than made up for the hitches up front. Love the concept of dim sum style tapas. We got so so many things between the four of us. Off the menu, we ordered the outstanding black cod pancakes and quail eggs and the delicious but not extraordinary kimchi noodles and the state bird. Off the carts, we got many things I probably can't remember but the mushroom porridge, some veggie medley with goat cheese, oysters, rabbit terrine, the fantastic duck moose with almond biscuits, garlic burrata bread, smoked salmon, some quinoa medley. Everything was very very good, some things outstanding. The only disappointing dish was also the most expensive dish ($12) - the pork ribs. We also got every dessert on the menu and while the almond milk and blood orange granita weren't my favorites, I loved the CA black & white bao and ice cream sandwich the best. The service was prompt, friendly and very pleasant. Our server even ran 2 blocks after we had left to return my scarf that I left in our booth. Very nice guy!All in all, great experience. Highly recommended. Two months ago, I woke up at 4am to make my reservation online. Boy, am I glad I did! It felt awesome to walk to the front of the line and get seated right away. I normally don't mind waiting in line, but to find out that the people at the front of the line were not guaranteed a table, and also that their seating window was anywhere between 7pm-10:30pm, made me grateful I set my alarm for 3:58am lol.Here's what we had:Mushroom farro spezzato with whipped ricotta- Delish!! What a great start. Highly recommended.Snap Peas with homemade sambal chili- I don't like snap peas, but M loves them. I liked the homemade sambal, but M didn't. At least I tried! If you are a fan of snap peas, you'll like this dish. Salmon tartare with cucumber- I like cucumber but M does not, so I had it all to myself. He did, however, enjoy the crispy quinoa on top. It was too crispy for me. See a trend here? lol. I wouldn't order again. Garlic Bread w/burata- Yum! I liked the saltiness of the bread. It wasn't as garlicky as I had hoped but it was still good. Loved the cheese. I'd get this again, but maybe later towards the end because it's very filling.Fried Pork Belly- The first two pieces were great. Loved the sauce. The other two pieces we had were practically all fat. We couldn't finish it. Not sure if I'd get it again because I felt a little gross afterwards. Stone-ground oat-crusted sweetbreads with favas & ramps- My favorite of the night. The breading on the sweet breads was very crispy and I loved the vinaigrette that came with it. I didn't care much for the fava bean puree, so of course, M loved it. HahaCA state bird with provisions- There isn't much meat on the state bird, but the meat I did get was good. I'm glad we only got half an order, because we were getting full by the time we got it. Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - What a terrible way to end the meal. I really wanted to love this one, but we both agreed it was nothing special. The almond biscuit was very buttery, but that was it. It wasn't great. The mousse had a consistency like butter, but unsalted. It didn't add anything to the biscuit. There was a long period of time between the first carts/trays of food and the second, so we decided to get the check. We had poor timing, because they brought out more food after we got our check. Perhaps this is done on purpose to get people out. Haha jk.We'll be back to try other things like the bone marrow. I'm glad we ventured out to the city to try this place. Make reservations! I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. We were walk-ins and got a table at 9:30pm despite lining up at 5pm (it was a Sunday though). Regardless, it's totally worth it and I'd do it again. We were seated at the ""chef's table"", right across from the cooking station, and I sat where all the dishes were being passed from the kitchen to the servers. This is a great spot to be at... you got to see everything as they came off the line, piping hot, and we even got to chat with the restauranteur Stuart Brioza quite a bit, as well as the line chefs. The food is impeccably prepared and it's awesome to watch them do it. Everything was delicious. A standout dish for me was the almond cakes + liver. The place has a great casual atmosphere, unpretentious and comfortable. They could fit a few more seats in here, but it's nice that it doesn't feel crowded. It's probably the best value Michelin star restaurant I have ever been to.  For the quality of food and service it's actually quite a steal. Can't wait to go back. I decided to get State Bird Provisions another try to see if they live up to the hype and still think they fall far from the one Michelin star that they've earned.  First off, from a service perspective, I can't remember the last time I've had service as bad.  Even in my $6 hole-in-the-wall ethnic joint, I will at least get attentive service.  To start with, I had a 7pm reservation.  We were probably a few minutes late, but no matter, the table wasn't ready.  Wasn't ready until after 7:30.  What's the point of having of a reservation?  And walk-ins that literally just waltzed in got seated before us.  Seriously?!  I understand that some restaurants keep certain seats for walk-ins but I think they need to figure out how to be more accommodating for customers that had pre-planned and made a reservation.  While waiting in crowded front area for a half hour, we were offered a drink menu, but never actually to order a drink.  Then when we sat down, we were essentially ignored.  No offer for drink orders.  Good thing the food comes around to you or we would've never gotten any food.  Finally, I managed to flag someone down to order drinks.  I asked about a 2011 Cab Franc, wondering if it was too young to drink.  He said, oh, I can absolutely recommend a 1979 something by the bottle.  Are you kidding me?  2011 is a little young, so you jump back 30 years and probably charge me over $300 for the bottle.  I wish I had gotten this server's name because he was just ridiculous.  The food is fine.  It's not fantastic and definitely does not make up for the service glitches. It was good but not worth the wait and money. I have been to much better restaurants with much more unique things but everyone should try it at least once. I definitely would have to go if I had a guest in town that really wanted to try it otherwise there are so many other places. It truly is OVERRATED!!! Believe the hype!The food is superb. And for a place this worshipped, it is surprisingly unpretentious. Be sure to get the Stare Bird with provisions -- definitely one of the most consistently delicious dishes. An amazing dining experience in every way. Unique. Fabulous service. Delicious food. A must for anyone up for a little adventure! Delicious tapas were fed us, for the first time in this restaurnts. Good location and pretty awesome customer service. They are so inventive and outstanding friendly with the us.There was no late getting foods.Prce is affordable here.I highly praise their hard work.I will be trying. Friends told me there has been a lot of fuss about this place. My first SF review or restaurant review for that matter. I'm bored atm so here goes. Obviously I had to try so I'd have something to write home about. ""Dear New York....""Did a walk in and got blessed with the Walk-in Karma. Hostess is WAY COOL. Anyway... some dishes were good, not freakazoid OmFGGGggggg but good, cool. Like, I enjoyed it going down my throat and I smiled. or Like when you get a compliment for wearing something that you weren't even trying with. I'll take it! Some dishes were... hmm... trying too hard? Mixing up all these flavors that if I were a judge on Top Chef I'd wince and ask, ""why did you do that?""We got a lot of dishes. They all started to bleed into one another. I have a favorite from the night:Curried Scallop & AvocadoWith Crunchy QuinoaI expected more for the buttermilk quail. I'm a southern girl at heart so I know my fried chicken (or [insert bird]) and the batter was not that tasty.I know some ppl will say oh well the dishes change daily so maybe it was an off night. No, I pretty much think overall it's going to be the same range of ""goodness"", or else what you're telling me is this place is inconsistent? Value-- overpriced for what you get. I've had better for cheaper. I wasn't fulfilled. Just don't get your hopes up. OR of course, maybe I just have bad taste in food.I wouldn't go back but I did very much enjoy:1) atmosphere- so ""cool"" to feel as if I apparently made it to an Oscar's party.2) all the sexy tattoos on the waiters' arms. 3) concept- dim sum without the chicken feetTip: Don't sweat it if you haven't gone here. Tip 2: Guys, maybe you should bring dates here. They'll be impressed I'm sure either way-- that you got an rsvp, or your creativity in picking a restaurant with a cool concept, or because you footed the bill! =) Get it!!! I went with a large group of people (I have no idea how they got that reservation).  The service and food was great.  Modern, well done food that should be the standard for SF restaurants.  it is much better than most similarly priced restaurants. Very tasty, and surprisingly, not that expensive! The dim sum concept makes for a great, memorable night. The best thing is how happy the chefs seem to be working there. The dim sum style of service makes the kitchen less hectic, so the chefs were actually very friendly and chatting with us while they cooked. Head over at 5 to put your name on the list, then go around the corner to Fat Angel for a few drinks. Would I make a bot to hack a reservation, though? No. When we left around 9:30 on a Monday, there were actually open seats at the bar. I think that I had really high expectations of this place.With all of the hype and a 60 day wait for your reservation, what do you expect but high expectations.  4 stars for service.  It was very efficient, had a generally good balance of professional and casual, but some times a bit too casual by some staff given the vibe and higher end feel that the place is portraying.There were two exceptional dishes, most were excellent, and a couple were just average.  If you see the smoked trout quinoa, get it right away.  Don't wait for the server, pick it up and put one, two, maybe three servings of it on your table.  The dishes and dining experience were definitely fun and creative.  I will definitely be back again. I hear getting a reservation is a nightmare. Good thing I didn't have to deal with that as a friend did it for me.The concept is great.American style dimsum.The prices are excellent for the quality of food too.The layout is exciting and fun.The consistency of flavor of the food is sometimes lacking as some dishes tasted the same as if I made it at home.. with the exception of presentation.Overall, I was very pleased with the dishes, I just wished I wouldn't catch a glimpse of disappointment in the faces of the person (chef) bringing the food around when I decline... Amazing meal! We reserved a large group table 2 months in advance. The anticipation was great but the payoff delivered. At the large table, a set tasting menu is served rather than the dim sum style offerings. This is to prevent constant interruption by staff. Instead, the table is delivered every dish on the menu, served family style. It came to about 15 courses all in all. Epic. The restaurant itself is pleasant looking but a bit spartan. Nothing lavish. The focus is on the food. The service is very professional and friendly. I was impressed that the waitress knew quite a bit about the wine I brought. Sadly, the bottle was damaged so we ordered off the very reasonably priced wine/beer menu! Icing on the cake: $100 per person inclusive of all. Wow. A grand experience I hope will be repeated. Don't shoot me, but this place is definitely not all that and a bag of fries. I cannot comprehend the hype that's gone into this place, to warrant a reservation months in advance or the only other option, waiting in line an hour before the restaurant opens in hopes to either get seated or get a reservation for many hours later. We did the latter and got right in at 5:30pm, thankfully! We had: -Chowan mushi-Beausoleil oysters-Steak tartare with rice chip-Garlic bread with burrata -Sourdough sauerkraut pancake with ricotta-State bird with provisions (quail)-Chocolate icecream sandwich with cacao -nibs and apricotMany of the items, like the chowan mushi and the oysters had a very Korean taste to it, and you'd think a Korean herself would welcome this but I don't know if I was all 'bout it. The garlic bread was sadly underwhelming and not very garlicky, in my opinion.  My favorites were the pancakes with ricotta and the state bird with provisions, but the bird was so very tiny. The ice cream sandwich redeemed a lot of the meal.I'd say everyone should try it once to say they've gone, but you'll see what I mean. Sat at the bar.  Every dish we had were well prepared and creative!  Definitely a great value per michelin star ratio!  Before drinks the food bill before tips and tax was about $40 a person.  Had multiple conversation with the young chefs,  all willing to share their tricks.  My favorite dish is still the hamachi on top of a very crispy seaweed.  Just to die for.  Only down side is it is still almost impossible to make a reservation.  But I will be back next time to walk ins. Thought it might be hype, but no! Really amazing and tasty menu. We tried a variety of dishes during a dinner party for 8. Standouts included: oysters (didn't think I liked them), hamachi, pork belly (really), quail eggs, and state bird - of course. Memorable dinner. No wonder the line's always 50+ ppl deep! When the hype is this high (over the top), & you've waited 6 weeks for this reservation, all expectations invariably go through the roof.  It's inevitable.  It's just not possible to meet these unrealistic expectations.  I walked into State Bird basically expecting my panties to drop.  They didn't.  But that certainly doesn't mean that SB failed or that I was unhappy.  There's a couple things I really enjoyed, but I can't say that my heart was stolen...yet.The oysters: Straight up, oysters are not my thing.  This was my date's pick.  They were ok, but that's just me, & not a reflection of the restaurant.The duck liver mousse w almond biscuits: The smooth as silk mousse juxtaposed w the almond biscuits; very nice & different.  Just so good.  If you usually do a pate, order it.The garlic bread (affectionately known as ""sex bread"") w burrata: I anticipated to be blown the eff away w this, because if it's called ""sex bread,"" it better be mind blowing, right?  Well...if this is sex bread, then you're just not having good sex.  It was VERY good, yes.  Sexual?  No.  I love burrata, so it was a must order.  And the burrata was well done.  A staple dish for sure.The State Bird: I basically expected the heavens to part & God to come down to my table & shake my hand when I bit into this dish. Did that happen?  Of course not.  But, I love fried bird.  So it was a win with me.  Nicely seasoned, crispy on the outside, tender inside.  Didn't bowl me over, but it was tasty & I will order it again.My date, on the other hand, was very dissatisfied w this dish.The ice cream sandwich: Ok, come on.  It's an ice cream sandwich, albeit deconstructed.  What's not to love?  Again, my date did not appreciate this at all.  But, in retrospect, I'm starting to wonder if he's not a little cray cray.All in all, I feel I need to dine here a couple more times, to try more dishes, before I make any proclamations.  Like State Bird & I are dating, & this was only our first date.  I said yes to a second.  The ingenuity of the dishes, the dim sum style service, & even the hype make it worth a visit for sure.  I'm looking forward to date #2. Fantastic food, fantastic experience. I went alone on a Saturday night at 6pm. I had to wait an hour for a seat and they were able to squeeze me in for an hour between reservations. The food was creative, interesting, and delicious. The service was excellent. I've eaten here twice now and each time, I had a completely delicious and positive experience.  The staff is awesome. So friendly and helpful with any dietary restrictions (I am hopelessly lactose intolerant!).  There are so many choices and each dish is absolutely perfectly executed, seasoned, and presented. I dont remember all the things I ate...there was a pork belly thing, some interesting and tasty ceviche, several salad type dishes...there was so much! But what I do remember is that with every bite, I was totally happy. Went on a thurs night, got there shortly before 4:30 and was second in line. Probably could have walked in at 5:30 and still gotten a table for 2 on this particular night. Although it was fun to watch the sous chefs prep for the evenings dishes during the wait. LOVED the pancakes (sourdough, sauerkraut, ricotta and pecorino) and trout with mandarin oranges and hazelnut brown butter, mint and cilantro. Must get the trout! Both are on the menu rather than the dim sum dishes. The flavors were unexpected yet the combinations were so spot on and exciting. Sooo good. Still dreaming of the trout.We also had the duck mousse and almond cakes.. So delicious! The trout mousse and avocado with homemade chips- creamy, salty, deep --wish I could make this for a dinner party. Duck and fontina croquette and quinoa salad were interesting and yummy but not mind blowing. I was a little disappointed with the garlic bread and burrata and the Vietnamese pork belly salad-- both a little excessive with the balance of salt and fat. The chawanmushi with guanciale was disappointing because I love the delicate egg and mushroom flavor of a traditional chawanmushi and who doesn't love guanciale? But together, you totally lose out on the delicate umami and are overwhelmed with the guanciale and a spicy sauce. Maybe nix the sauce and do a guanciale dust instead? The portions are a little large for 2 ppl-- if you only want a taste of each plate in order to try more dishes. We were stuffed! Would love to come again with a group of 4 or 6. Tried to make a reservation before but they were so booked for a few months. Then one day, we finally got a chance to eat there.  We had State bird, Tuna Avocado Seaweed cracker, Spicy Dungeness crab with Kimuchi Yuba, Hamachi on Nori cracker and more. I thought all dishes are very creative and awesome. Staff were friendly. It was a happy night. Thank you! Thank you Darling for a good meal and good time! 3.5 STARSI've been trolling State Bird's reservation page almost daily for close to a year.  Yes, every time I went on my tablet, cell, computer, etc, it would open up to the State Bird reservation page.  Other than the occasional same day reservation for 9:30p that would pop up around 7p AFTER I already ate dinner, I've had no luck!  Imagine my surprise when I found an abundant amount of reservations after they moved to Open Table.  Now, you probably know what happened with that.  If not, you should read this article: insidescoopsf.sfgate.com….  I was one of the lucky ones and got my reservation reinstated after some back and forth with Open Table and State Bird.Roasted bone marrow with mushrooms and pink peppercorn: My favorite dish of the night! Plenty of marrow and mushrooms. Perfectly roasted!CA state bird with provisions: This was perfectly fried and crispy on the outside while still nice and moist on the inside. Sooo good!Duck liver mousse with almond biscuits: Yum! I love liver and this one didn't disappoint. Nice and creamy with that delectable liver flavor.Grilled asparagus, preserved lemon-green garlic aioli: I love asparagus and this was grilled nicely.Garlic bread with burrata: I love garlic bread and I love burrata. I just wished that the bread could have been a little more garlicky. Couldn't really taste it with all the burrata on top.Raw oysters with spicy kohlrabi kraut and sesame: Oysters were overpowered by the spicy kohlrabi kraut and sesame. I wanted to enjoy some of the sweet oceany taste of the oysters. Pork belly blood orange salad: The pork belly was cooked to the point where it crumbled in my mouth. If not for that I would have enjoyed this dish.Guinea hen dumpling in aromatic broth: Overwhelming taste of fish sauce in the broth.Steak tartare caesar lettuce cups: Caesar dressing was a little overpowering. The steak flavor didn't really come through. I would have actually preferred this with tuna.Wild king salmon tartare with fermented turnips: My least favorite dish. The salmon tartare was chopped to a point where the texture was just mushy.Unfortunately this is what happens when a place is hyped up. I'm expecting the place to be amazing! Especially when it's so hard to get a reservation. I adored the bone marrow, state bird and duck liver, but everything else was just okay or seemed to have a combination of ingredients that didn't quite mesh, so 3 stars for the food. Since our server was so sweet, I bumped it up to 3.5. I love this place. We went here on the off-chance they had a table available on a Monday and we got the perch by the door. That might have deterBest things about State Bird:- amazing service, great staff- awesome tapas/dim sum style of eating- delicious ingredients- beautifully presented dishes- so much choice and surprises!We loved pretty much all the dishes off-menu. The menu is great but I'd recommend choosing the daily dishes. We enjoyed the state bird, confit duck leg and pancake with sturgeon from the menu - all were faultless but we preffered the oysters, dumplings in broth, hamachi rice cake and octopus that were brought out to us. Next time I'm definitely trying the steak tartare and saving more space for dessert! I made it to State Bird Provisions....FINALLY!  With all the ""hype"" about this place, I went in with very low expectations.Reservations are suggested and need to be made months in advance.  It took me a while to get reservations here as I was trying during the day.  Turns out you need to make reservations at 4:00 a.m. in order to score a spot!  As I was standing in line waiting for the doors to open, I felt like a kid standing in line at Disneyland anxious to get on a ride.  But in this case, I was anxious and excited to get in and finally dine at this establishment.  The second you walk through the door, you are immediately  greeted by the friendly staff members.  The selling point is the ""dim sum"" concept, but in this case, it's not Chinese food that's being carted or carried around.  The vibe was fun.We ordered: Pork spare ribs glazed in it's own juices ($12) - Amazing!  For the price, you get, four generously portioned pieces and very tasty. Pork fell off the bones and would have probably gotten another if we didn't have so much to try already . The pork was very tender and perfectly seasoned.  This was our favorite dish of the night! (***)Duck and fontina cheese croquette ($4)  - 2 pieces per order and was pretty tasty.Guinea hen w/ cumin dumpling - 1 piece per order and ""A"" enjoyed this. The lemon flavor was refreshing and made it different from what he's used to. I, however, wasn't a fan as the cumin was overwhelming.Salmon tartare - ""A"" thought this dish was just OK.  Although nothing unique, I found it quite refreshing with the cucumbers.  (**)Hamachi crudo on seaweed cracker- This came on a big piece of seaweed with hamachi pieces on top. One of our favorites as it was tasty as well. (***)Roti of curry rabbit, lentils, & mushrooms  - I couldn't taste the curry, but the rabbit was tender and not dry.  Large portion and was ok, wish it had more flavor (*)Roasted bone marrow with mushrooms and pink peppercorn - ""A's"" usually not a fan of bone marrow so I have no idea why he decided to try this lol. He was pretty full by the time it arrived,  but it wasn't bad.Fried pork belly - One of ""A's"" other favorites.  I thought it was a bit too fatty, but it was tasty.  It reminded me of the salt and pepper pork chops you get at Chinese restaurants.  (**)Garlic bread with burrata cheese- Our least favorite dish.  We didn't taste any garlic and assumed it would be crunchy but it was like eating a donut with a glop of cheese on top. (*)Oyster - I thought this was just OK (*)CA state bird with provisions ($9 half order) - Fried buttermilk battered quail with a sautéed onion sauce. Although this is their specialty, I thought it was just okay.SBP Hibiscus Ginger Lime Soda - It was okay..kind of had a medicinal taste.Chocolate ""ice cream"" sandwich, smoked meringue, spicy cocoa nib, apricot ($8) - delicious.  I liked the chewiness of the brownie.  ***Must try**Really good*MehOverall, we enjoyed our dining experience.  Some dishes were a hit and some were a miss, but that's expected.  I wouldn't mind coming back to try some of the dishes I didn't get to try. It was good, however nothing I had blew me away. Fortunately they reinstated my opentable reso snafu, service was solid. The concept is smart, the offerings were non varietal. Highlight was the bone marrow dish from the menu. Wine and beer offerings are limited as well. For me, it was a nice place to try once but I doubt I would go back.They are not short of customers so they will still do well. So the problem with me is that this place was SUPER HYPED up. It seemed like everyone wanted to go so when I finally got to, I expected a lot. My favorite was the State bird (fried quail) off the usual menu and the small almond biscuits with duck liver mousse. The garlic toast with burrata was meh. I mean its bread and cheese. I also enjoyed the rabbit and cheese croquettes and I'm not a fan of rabbit. Good lighting so you can see what all you're getting into. I don't know what they could do about it unfortunately but they gotta lot of beards and bobs walking around with food and we did find a hair treat. My friend who discovered the surprise was unsettled but not one to fuss, despite the ickiness of the situation. Overall its a cute idea and if it ever calms down I may consider going back. Very lucky to have dined here indeed! Was here with a party of 7 so we got the Prix Fix treatment-Made the reservation 2 months in advance. Very daring flavor combinations, that really worked- Wish the portions were bigger as the flavors and textures were delicious, but also casual without any trace of pretense. The wine list in my opinion could have had more depth in California wines, but we managed to find a couple of gems to compliment our food well. It lives up to the hype. On the negative side, the experience was wasted on the 11 & 13 year olds we had with us, as they probably tried 25% of the dishes, as the other 75% were too ""Scary""......not ""tween or kid friendly, so you'll need that babysitter or play date. Was also very ""spendy"", but not more so than comparable establishments in this rare altitude of Gastronomic ambition. Amazing!! Just have to get in! Its not all hype, this place knows how to make some serious grub. Excellent variety and fantastic service. You really can't go wrong here, everything that comes out of the kitchen is amazing. Go hungry and DO NOT go with picky eaters. This restaurant is best experienced with around 4 people who eat and appreciate everything.  Go with friends who don't mind exploring the entire menu! No restaurant has ever brought me closer to tears... because it was so good. On a glorious Saturday in the city, I decided to drag my boyfriend to stand in line @ 4:45 to get into what I thought was a ""hyped up"" restaurant. Boy, was that 45 minutes wait worth every single second.  While we stood in the cold, the guys inside brought us out some warm, creamy, thick hot chocolate. Once the line started moving, we ended up getting a table at 7:30pm so we walked down the street to kill some time at the Hookah bar. For people without a reservation, I'd highly recommend just going to wait (think about all those times you've waited at other crappy restaurants because they were busy). 7:30 comes and we're seated immediately. First thought: holy crap these people are SO FRIENDLY!!! We got seated at the bar area and the chef in front of us was super nice and helpful. By the end of the night, we know where he's from, where he went to school, what to order, and the history of the restaurant. At that point, it's like dinner and entertainment! Needless to say, the food lives up to ALL the hype. Favorites were the pork belly and the crab kim chee. The ice cream sandwich dessert was ridiculously amazing, as well as the dessert shots (sort of like a thick milky peanut butter shot). The state bird, which everyone must try, was so incredibly flavorful due to those delicious glazed onions! At some point about 9 dishes deep, note there were only 2 of us, I realized how full I was. The food was so good, I literally contemplated hanging around until I became hungry again! I needed to make room to try everything, right? Please, if you live in SF and consider your self a true SF'er, you MUST TRY THIS RESTAURANT. You will have no regrets! Finally, finally, made it to State Bird! However, it took arriving at 4:45pm to wait for the doors to open at 5:30pm and let us in line take the tables reserved for walk-ins.The vibe was fun, everyone anxious to finally dine at this Fillmore highlight - guests around us in line and inside were buzzing with excitement. The true gem of the place is the chance to do dim sum unlike anywhere else. This is not Chinese food being carted around but unique twists of American dishes.The food is all good, nothing I found to be spectacular but food was solid and tasty. My favorite was off the menu - the sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino, and ricotta pancakes. Sadly, the renowned CA state bird with provision dish was way underwhelming. I recommend ordering the pancakes and then having fun with the dim sum that comes around. End the meal with whatever flavor ice cream sandwiches are being featured. We got luck with sesame ice cream sandwiches and they were delicious. I was only in SF for a day, and my culinary mission focused mainly on scoring a seat at State Bird on a Saturday night (ambitious, I know). I walked in at 7PM, and they told me that there would be a seat ready for me at 10:30PM -- for which I was totally willing to wait, and I got a call at around 10:15PM telling me that a spot was opening up. I hustled on over, and they seated me at the counter by the chefs. The experience was worth the wait, and the $63 bill (no drinks).When dining solo, it's hard for waitstaff to gauge whether they need to give you space or constant attention, and the friendly people of State Bird managed to strike a good balance. They give you a menu with the ""permanent"" items, and, as mentioned, everything else comes by dim-sum style on carts and trays for you to ogle.I started off with the State Bird with Provisions ($9 for half portion), because, duh. This crispy little quail died for a good cause -- the batter was terrific and aromatic, and the provisions of onions in broth with cheese shavings were a nice accompaniment, though perhaps a little soupy for the crispy fowl. The Corned Beef Tongue ($6) came by and I couldn't pass it up. Served alongside tiny potato dumplings and a green garlic emulsion sauce, this dish had great chew and savory flavor. The tongue was tender, and not rubbery, and was fairly generously portioned - good for sharing. I liked the sauce, though I wish it had been a tad more spicy.I picked the Pork Belly with Blood Orange Salad and Jalapenos ($10) off a tray, and this was definitely one of my favorite dishes of the evening. The pork belly was cut into a few large cubes, adorned with a tangy, citrusy dressing, and sprinkled with lots of herbs and slivers of blood orange. I love fatty flavors, and I enjoyed the tender and crispy parts of the pork belly, complemented well by the sour dressing and spicy peppers. A cart came to me, laden with lots of savory options, and I opted for an Oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut and sesame/chili oil ($3). Normally, I'm a big fan of the unadorned bivalve, but these looked really delicious, and the crunch of the kraut played well with the fresh, briny oyster. A solid pick, and obviously not shareable.The thing I'd been hunting for came my way - Duck Liver Mousse with Almond Financiers ($6) - and I snapped up that little dish immediately. I'm a big foie gras fan, and while their rendition of the liver wasn't the best I've ever had, it was certainly served in a novel way with the sweet, spongy little almond biscuits. This seems like an ideal dish to share, since you do get a good number of biscuits and not everyone can put back that much rich liver.Just when I thought I couldn't take it anymore, a tray showed up bearing tiny cups of Chawanmushi topped with guanciale ($5) - this was described to me as Japanese egg custard. I liked this ok, but it's not normally a dish I'd order; it just looked so cute and I was at my fullness point! The egg custard was tender and flavorful, topped with a brothy sauce and two pieces of pork cheek. Probably the least memorable of the dishes I had, but still good.I thought maybe I'd leave without ordering dessert because I was full to the point of pain, but then I thought, ""Oh, what the hell,"" and ordered two half portions of dessert ($4 each) - the Strawberry Granita with creme fraiche-honey mousse and dates, and the Kyoto Rye Crepes with chocolate-banana jam, bananas, and candied kumquats. The kitchen, apparently sensing that I was up for a challenge, gifted me with a shot of their Peanut Muscovado milk ($2). I think, of all the items on the menu, the desserts seemed most like an afterthought. They were solid and fairly inventive, but not spectacular and surprising like some of the savory options. The granita was nicely textured and went well with the mousse (it was described to me as a riff on strawberries and cream), but the dates were misplaced in this dish -- their blander flavor and chewy texture didn't quite mesh with the granita/mousse. The rye crepes were a little sodden and bland, though I did VERY much like the chocolate-banana jam... again, the kumquat accompaniment seemed misplaced. Finally, the peanut buttery-sugary-creamy milk was a big shot of diabetes, but still very tasty! It was sort of the coup de grace of my whole meal, since it encapsulated the excess and whimsy of everything I'd just eaten.The waitstaff are patient, kind, attentive, and eager to tell you what they're toting on their many trays and carts - I appreciated this as a solo diner. The ambiance is pretty casual, which I liked, and has sort of the nouveau-hipster-trendy look of a lot of restaurants in its genre. The musical selection really stayed in the background, which can be great or sad depending on your viewpoint; it didn't distract from the food, but didn't really set a mood. And, finally, I LOVED the art in the bathroom -- witty illustrations of a ""French Onion Coup"" and another food pun. Where else are you gonna find delicious food served with so much love and energy from the FOH and BOH. I enjoyed every moment of it! With the exception of those seated at the rear of the restaurant, everyone is virtually seated at a chef's table with chef Stewart standing a few feet from you, orchestrating his band, expediting his take on, ""New Californian"" cuisine.After a stroll around Japantown and the Filthymo' along with an hour and a half long wait outside their unmarked restaurant me and the lady embarked on the yummy culinary journey chef Stewart was gonna take us on. While we had no reservations we were among the first in a line that looked as though some Jordans were about to be re-released. We were seated on the little sidebar situated on the left side of the line where you get this really awesome view of the interaction between chef Stewart and his crew. We watch as a cart comes around with food, and being in close proximity to the kitchen we get first dibs! Fu*k yeah.. So you have the option to order off the cart or the menu, a la dim sum style. I start to get all food nerd dumb with excitement like some kid at a Gamestop as I try to match the pictures I've seen on Yelp to the treys and carts passing me by.Nearly everything I scarfed down was pretty bomb. Clean, flavorful and balanced. Wasn't too impressed by the State Bird though. I suppose I didn't like the broth taking all that nice bit of crunch from what already is a tiny bird. Having dined a few days earlier at some of Wine Country's gems, this here once jaded culinary worker ended it by proclaiming State Bird without a doubt the one of the best and most unique dining experiences I've ever experienced in my life. That sashimi seaweed cracker thing, the shisho leaves drink, the seemingly mundane sourdough pancake, and that tres leche were all just mind blowing. I'm talmbout Ho Lee S#!+ good.Working in a professional kitchen it was such as breath of fresh air to hear the very knowledgeable head server Emily (who was also main bartender of the night) explain to us that they rotate positions to cross-train each other in order to ultimately appreciate each other's position. While this maybe nothing new to certain industries, however for mine is fairly unheard of considering I'm used to working in kitchens with a more a structured, traditional, highly militarized approach where you pretty much put your head down, shut your trap and go to work. As opposed to State Bird's seemingly more open-minded, democratic approach to cooking. To hear that during family meals they are all working together trying to conceptualize new ideas instead of some stuffy head chef who won't take no for an answer and to see their GM, Mr. Anderson come up to you and take his time to see how you're doing while he's out there bussin' azz while bussin' tables you quickly realize that they truly are passionate about what they do. You have some cats that just talk about their ""love"" of the craft then you have the crew at State Bird Provisions whose actions speak louder. It's all beautiful. Poetry in motion. To simply gauge SBP by it's food without taking into account its service, business concept and execution from the bottom up would be an extreme disservice to as the restaurant truly reflects the Bay Area's ever changing, evolving, open and diverse way of living. Chefs Stewart and Nicole make for the best one two combo if I've ever seen one.I left amazed, excited and inspired once again. Crazy good food. Every bite is like a party in your mouth. Worth every minute of waiting in line. State Bird-Okay, like, Statebird sucks!  I hate to say it, but the hype is like ridiculous I can't understand what it's all about, living in the neighborhood.  I would not recommend this location, unless you could easily get in just to try a couple of things.At the same time, the hostess was an absolute sweetheart, and our server was knowledgeable, friendly, and exceptional with respect to, the finer points.  The real disappointment was the food...The Bird... It sucked, tasteless, boney..lame.  Major let down!  The pate, any-bar USA, the oysters...blah, and ice cream sandwich, (how could it suck?) it did!Gonna go back for kicks, way down the road, I'm sure. I think most of the other reviews already tells you everything you need to know. But I'll review some of the best things that helped me. So here goes:Reservations online are impossible and waiting sucks so you have a few options for same day seating:1. Hire someone on task rabbit to wait for you (or hire them to stand in line and then  make a reservation for you later in the day such as a 8pm.)2. Pay your unemployed friend a six pack and tell him to wait for you.3. Get there 60 mins or (75 minutes to be safe) before they open and wait for open seating.  I was #5 inline.   It seemed that most people behind me (about 20) also got in. It's like Chinese Dim Sum but with American food. Yes that's exactly what it is like!1. Just like Chinese Dim Sum don't get suckered into getting the things that you don't like or doesn't look good. 2. If it's not popular it'll come back to your table much faster than the good stuff.3. Toward the end of your meal you can request to see the complete menu and possibly order anything you haven't tried.4. Prices vary greatly from $2 -$14 per dish but don't focus too much on the price, it'll ruin your dinner. 5. Try lots of different items, as many as you can afford or eat.  (we tried almost all of them)1/3 awesome1/3 good/great1/3 okay/not goodI think if we were a little more discerning we would not have ordered the dishes that we thought looked okay, and in fact were just okay/not good.  But lesson learned, next time we'll be more picky.  But then again that's part of the fun. Dilemma!Overall food was great and they had some really interesting items.  Very creative and mostly delicious.  And since it's always changing you'll probably never get the same thing twice. Lastly, the service was great!!! 5 Stars all the way.  And for a nice restaurant I think that service is very important.  Why spend all that money for good food only to leave with a bad taste from the service?So figure out a way to get in, you won't regret it. Came here a week ago after many failed attempts(hard to get in). Was worth the wait and didn't disappoint!! Do yourself a favor: come hungry and do it dim sum style. We were gonna order off the menu, but kept getting distracted by the multiple trays of food coming by, which was not a bad thing at all: it was f*^king awesome!!! We opted to go that route instead. It forced us to be adventurous but also the anticipation of what else might come our way was exceptionally fun!! Will attempt to come back... It's so called the best new restaurant in the US and it's hard to book. But I don't think the taser worth the waiting time, the food is good, and the way they present is creative. But for me it's more like a overpriced, dim-sum style restaurant. But people in the restaurant are all very funny and cool After a short back and forth the folks at State Bird chose to honor my cancelled reservation. The food was as amazing as expected and the customer service before and during my meal was also on excellent. I'm extremely happy they did the right thing and will be sure to return. Love the concept: a blend of hustlin' dim sum with quality tapas. I think its one of those must try places and go with a lot of people so you can try all the dishes!  My gf took me here for a belated meal and between the two of us, I couldn't stomach anymore of the food going around.  SO MUCH MORE TO TRY!  If you can't get reservations which seems nearly impossible nowadays, I would try to get in line at around 4:45 and go with at least 4 more.  The more people, the more food to get your taste buds tingling! Solid 4.0 stars if not 4.25 stars.I had heard about SBP from a friend and did my research on it too once my boyfriend and I had booked our trip to SF. Affordable Michelin rated food???? I had to make it a mission of mine to go while I was in SF! And having done just so, we had concluded that our asses had to be in line for this restaurant at least 45 mins before actual opening time - to be safe of course. Fast forward to the trip...When it came to the day we had actually scheduled time to go to SBP, public transportation was against us and we didn't get there until 5:35 (five minutes after opening) - damn that 38 bus route!!! The end of the line when we got there was four storefronts down from SBP's door!!!!! Every so often a lady would come out from the restaurant and inform us roughly what times we were looking at depending on where we were on line. On her third visit, she had estimated where the cut off was for that night's seating - four to six people behind us!!! That chick was money man - spot on with the estimates!! By the time we got to the podium, the hostess said it would be close to 10:45pm ( 15 minutes before their closing time) for a table for 3: me, my boyfriend and a friend. So we took it, obviously. Having been in similar scenarios before, we knew that the time they gave us was conservative, so we has decided to just grab drinks in the area just before. Then, at 9:55pm we get the text message from the hostess -- our table is ready early! BOOM!Atlast, we were seated, and within minutes time, the cart of food is at our table! We had practically ordered everything on the cart and more from the written menu like was were drunk hungry - which we kind of were - AND had ordered a bottle of wine for the table too.All in all we must have tried 10 - 13 dishes, including dessert. The everything was great, some more memorable than others. The sourdough pancakes, the pork belly, the braised short rib, the huge buratta on that fried garlic doughy goodness - were all amazing!!! The desserts - not so much. Is it worth the wait? Yes.Did it live up to the hype? Yes.Would I come back? Definitely. This place would get 5 stars if it were easier to get a reservation. The food and overall doing experience are fantastic when you get in, but we had to wait in line from 5-5:30 to be told to come back at 9:45. Next time we'll see a movie while we wait rather than bar hop ;) We enjoyed the dim sum experience and our server was a gracious host. Really loved this place. Very unique and eclectic. Will definitely go back. Great food! Great fun! My husband and I decided to see what the hype was all about on a recent trip to SF. We arrived 4:30 to line up for the 5:30 opening on a Wednesday night. We got two great seats at the raw bar where we could watch the food being prepared. Loved the small plates concept as we always enjoy sampling many different nite wherever we eat. We ordered only two items from the menu - a yummy duck-ham maitake pancake and a delicious crab kimchi yuba with smoked egg dish. The rest we chose from the trays/carts of food brought around dim-sum style. Dishes were very tasty, bright, creative, fun! Almost everything was outstanding except the pork belly which was crispy - I prefer falling apart pork belly. The duck liver mousse was decent but didn't compare to other dishes. Some favorites include raw oyster, guinea hen dumpling, a wild mushroom dish, and hamachi-avocado on a nori cracker. For dessert, the ""ice cream sandwich,"" olive oil cake and granita were fabulous! They were happy to let us have half orders of dessert so we could sample more!Well worth the wait! Love this place! unique, fun, tasty, amazing, diverse, cultured,... read the rest of the reviews i'm just rating it so i can tell people i went here. 5 stars! I am one picky eater and I was able to find lots of items that I really really enjoyed. Crab was absolutely Delish! Nice and spicy! I don't think I would wait 4 hours in line to eat here like some people did. Just try to make a reservation like a normal person. ...it's good..it ain't wait outside for 4 hours good ya feel me?! Came on Sat. Restaurant opens at 5:30pm. 45 mins before it opened, I counted 50 people waiting in line. Prob only 30 people can get a walk in table. Before it opened, prob 70 people waited in line. It was windy and cold in sf. It's an interesting experience. But it's not worthy. Only 3 stars to me. Food is innovative but doesn't taste good. Fried pork belly with jalapeños and citrus - prob second best dish to me tonight. The citrus and jalepenos flavors come out nicely. Garlic break with barrata - interesting texture for both. The bread tastes different and chewy but no garlic flavor and only pepper. Hen dumpling - waited forever for this. The broth is different and very salty. I would not pay $3 for this one piece. Chocolate ice cream sandwich - super hard and the brownies are too chewy. Hamachi, avocado and seaweed cracker - the best dish of the day. Nicely decorated. Mushroom risotto porridge - it's nice and mild but it's worthy of $8. Duck mousse almond biscuit - no almond flavors but the duck mousse is unique. However they don't come well together. Spicy drunkenness crab kimchi yuba - just kimchi stir fried with a tiny piece of crab and mostly yuba (fu zhu) which is curb bean sheet. $13. Super pricy and not that good. I was there last night...I'm not sure...I can't figure out why this place has 4.5*. Usually a place with 4.5* in SF is at least 4* to me. I think there is a conspiracy! Here is my take:-Somebody started this restaurant and gave it a weird name. I hear someone says: ""we are going to State Bird Provisions"" tonight. And I'm like thinking in my head what is that? Would I look stupid if I ask? I just Google it later...probably some bird watching place. -The restaurant found a few people, who told a few other people, who then told a few more people, that this place is ""amazing""...It's ""must go"". So somehow everybody already thinks this place is amazing before going there.-Then I can't make a reservation...so I walk there and wait around 3 hours for a table. I go to Dosa for some GREAT appetizer and few drinks and laugh, waiting for the bigger part of the night. So you already think it's a big deal.-I put in the address in my iPhone and ""you have arrived at your destination"" but um...there is no sign on the door! ooo! An element of mystery! This must be good. I already know I'm coming back here. I mean...at least have a picture of a bird or something on the door. -I am finally sitting at my table wondering what is this all about. They come around with carts, dim sum style (very cool concept actually...the only special thing about this place). -I'm starving...and everything is coming to us fast in little tiny plates...and they are ""infused"" with this name-u-never-heard-before or ""garnished"" with that-other-name-u-never-heard before. And oh, of course some trendy ingredient, like ""Quinoa"", that I have almost every day at home. Sh*t! Must be good. But it's just so mediocre. Like nothing special about it in the end.-I am not satisfied with the cart stuff and I am still trying to find the awe-inspiring factor. So I pick up the menu to order a ""real"" Tapa or meal that is more than half-a-bite. It comes...same deal...not special at all...still half a bite...like I think I accidentally swallowed it before I tasted it.-Still not giving up! Maybe the desert. I don't know...Just OK I guess.-I asked for the check...couldn't wait to get home to my jar of peanut butter.There must be another star hidden somewhere...but I couldn't find it. Maybe I'll go back again looking for it. We have been unable to dine there due to the ""reservation nightmare"" that continues.  A friend endured the wait outside and found the dishes ultimately offered to be good but not worth the long wait and ceremony to get in.  We may try later when the shine has worn off. We were waiting for soooooo long to get in.  Heard a lot about the food.  And..... Were disappointed:/( The location is not ideal.  No parking.  Doesn't feel really safe.  Ambiance.  We felt like we were seating in Office Depot, and something was not finished. Service. As soon as we set down (there were many if us) and ordered drinks, they started dropping food in our table so fast that we thought they need table for someone else, want us to eat fast and leave. Food.  The food was definately different from anything we tried before.  Bone marrow was delitious! Interesting couple of dishes.  But too many thing mixed in one.  I couldn't remember what I ate.  Price. Very reasonable.  There are many more great restaurants in a city that you can get in much sooner and spend pleasurable time, and have great food. My rating is for the food and the experience.  It was great - really enjoyed the unique experience of ""American dimsum.""Side Note:A lot of people are rating this establishment 1 Star because of the OpenTable nightmare. It's understandable but most people don't realize how complicated switching systems can be - especially for popular businesses. I worked in service for Virgin America and the switch over to Sabre was not seamless. Unless someone works in service or tech, they might not understand. Hope they'll give this place another shot because they're missing out!Continuing...I tried a variety of things but failed to take pictures of them because I was busy eating and eying everything that passed by. I did manage to take one of the desserts which captured almost one of each; they ran out of one of them (sad face).They had this reverse xiaolongbao dish - a dumpling in a small bowl in broth - sooo good!Their nonalcoholic drinks were refreshing. They have a muddled shiso leaf drink that could be compared to a virgin mojito; their guava soda is based on an in-house guava syrup - ask them about it!The servers were nice and knowledgeable. One of them introduced me to a new French wine that was great on the palette with all my food. I'll have to come again to see if it's consistently awesome but I had a great time. Thanks State Bird Provisions for great food and awesome service!FYI - this place is pretty well lit. Not sure if you care but just saying. [visited March 2014] We had been trying to get a reservation for what seems like a year. Then, we managed to finally get a reservation on line and we were delighted! We were so excited! We changed our schedules so that we could make it there at the appointed time. Then, after a couple of days, we received an email from them saying that it was all a mistake, the didn't really mean to give us a reservation. But they have this new reservation system they ""are thrilled about as it incorporates many new features that will improve our guests' experiences."" Well it sure didn't improve our experience. These people are clueless and way too full of themselves. I wish I could give them zero stars. Delicious and creative dishes presents an unparalleled experience at very reasonable prices. A new frontier forged by new American ideas, tapas, and dimsum logistics. Hipster genius. Kudos to Michelin to give SBP a star.Came here with 3 other friends. Started lining up at 5pm (30 minutes before opening) and barely got a table at 9:30pm. We went to get a drink at The Alembic and returned around 9:30pm to be seated. Excited!Ordered a few dishes off the menu and more from the carts:- Pork belly: I have had many kinds of pork belly. This was nothing new but still quite good. It's slow cooked and fried again to have the soft-in, crisp-out contrast. A bit sweetness takes the fatty edge off.- Salmon tartar with furikake: cured cucumber with tasty pink salmon tartar. Furikake seems to be home made too. The creamy salmon and crunchy furikake makes an awesome combination. Lightly cured cucumber is nice too.- Smoked trout with avocado mousse: Oh smokiness + ocean + earthy avocado mousse. The highlight of the night for me.- Black cod pancake: good filler. The fish did taste very fatty so I almost forgot it's cod. - Bone marrow: I'm not a huge fan of bone marrow, but it was not bad. Very oily and filling though. The pepper corn and herbs gave the marrow a good kick.- State bird: breaded and deep fried quail. The origin of SBP. Tender & Juicy. Delish & must have.- SBP soda - Shiso yuzu: Out of all the fried and fatty dishes that we ordered, this soda was a life savor. Refreshing combination of shiso and yuzu is just perfect.Will come back again to try more creations. I was very interested in the asparagus, too. Please keep up the awesome work SBP. Customer service fail....This is Ryan Anderson, General Manager of State Bird Provisions, writing to explain a particularly unfortunate and unexpected situation that occurred for online reservations facilitated Tuesday (3/25) and Wednesday (3/26). We have just completed the transition to OpenTable as our new reservations system, a change that we are thrilled about as it incorporates many new features that will improve our guests' experiences. We are a small restaurant with the great fortune of being quite busy, so part of this move involved migrating thousands of existing reservations to the new system -- a big undertaking that we took very seriously. Nonetheless, in that move, some reservations were inadvertently opened to the web that did not in fact represent available tables. Now, much to our chagrin, we've had to cancel your reservation because we quite simply don't have the space to honor that spot along with our existing reservations and walk-in guests. We truly apologize for the great inconvenience -- and any disappointment -- this caused. We are in the business of serving people and making people happy, so it's a huge letdown for us to have to say no this time around. We would be delighted to have you join us again in the future; please don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions about how to do that. Your understanding is sincerely appreciated, and we so look forward to sharing our food, atmosphere, and hospitality with you on one of those other nights very soon. This place ended up being a 3.5 star place for me. I love the dimsum style eating, but the food wasn't as good as I had expected.I wanted to see how this place matched up with Rich Table.First wave: Raw oysters with spicy kohlrabi kraut and sesame (oh, so fresh), hamachi-avocado on a seaweed cracker (tasted really good), sourdough, saurkraut, pecorino and ricotta (maybe my favorite), steak tartare lettuce wraps (pass), duck & sottocenere croquettes (very light for something fried), and duck liver mousse with almond biscuit (I've had better pate). The first three were the best of the round.The second wave included: garlic bread with burrata (nothing special), hearts of palm with avocado, pomelo and tahini-chili oil (forgettable), pork belly grape salad (very good pork belly), spicy dungeness crab kimchi yuba with smoked egg (definitely would get again!), and quail eggs on a cast iron skillet with apple, sunchokes and mt. tam [?] (this was uniquely awesome).Next round was the famed CA state bird wit provisions (not as good as what it should be), grilled asparagus with walnuts and pecorino (skip), red trout with mandarins and hazelnut brown butter (I enjoyed this one a lot), and grilled beef and brussel sprouts with umeboshi and bonito (everyone loved it...I thought it was ok).For dessert we had spiced cocoa nib 'ice cream' sandwiches (decent), black pepper pecans wit plum fudge (earthy), and guava tres leches with chevre creme fraiche, rhubarb and pistachio (easily my favorite). We also added on a couple other dishes.The meal was good and fun, but not as good as it's hyped up to be. The savior was the cute waitress, Penelope (majestic name), who was super knowledgeable about the menu and was super nice. She easily bumped my review up to 4 stars! Short review: we scored a Rez (hard to do!). Some of the best food of my life. Innovative ""dim sum"" approach plus a standard menu. Everything they bring surprises. I think it doesn't matter what you order: everything is so wild and good you re bound to be pleased. This surely is foodie heaven. Staff was amazing. Wow, reality lived up to the hype which is a rarity.  Not sure how I scored reservation either two days before our four person birthday dinner for my wife.  It might be due to their transition to Opentable recently and there are less bots taking up all the reservation.  Anyways, here is a tip if there is a line in front after they open at 5:30pm.  If you got reservation, just walk in to the front and tell them you have a reservation.  We waited for ten minutes and then realized that the line we were in was the walk-in line.On to the food.  Pork Riblets was so good that we had to get seconds.  We also tried the fried pork belly in some kind of citrus dressing with dill, cilantro and grapefruit.  The dressing balanced out the fat and richness of the pork belly perfectly.  Flavors on top of flavors on top of flavors.  We also ordered their grilled steak from their menu but while it was good, was not as good at the riblets or pork belly.My favorite dish of the night was their salmon tartare(?) on top of cucumbers sprinkled with some sort of crunchy benito or seaweed flakes.  Anyways, try it if you like sushi, you won't regret it.  Also had their raw halibut on top of seaweed with avocado and other things.  All in all, a great dinner for our first trip to State Bird.  I will definately come back here again. My foodie in crime who loves to try amazing food suggested we come here.We don't like to settle for ordinary food that satisfies you easily when we are together.Heads up is that you should make a reservation of 2 months in advance if you want to secure a table.Customer service:We came as walk ins and the hostess, Oozy (sorry if I spelled your name wrong) was the sweetest with her great smile and personality. She tried her best into accommodating us with a reservation of 9:45 if there was a cancelation. We waited for 3-4 hours in hopes to get a table. And I guess luck was on our side because we were seated and from there we began our exploration of amazing flavors. Atmosphere:The atmosphere was very nice, although it was very detail and decorated, it gave you a sense of at home dinning. With the bright open kitchen to the slightly dimmer and very easy going dinning tables. It's very cute because it's served in a ""dimsum"" style where they come around in a cart of tray and introducing these new food to you. And we just wanted to try everything. We just kept saying yes to everything that came our way.Braised Pork:The braised pork was amazing. I thought they used parmesan to season it however only to be surprised that there was no cheese. The pork belly itself was braised in a way where the fat has wrapped around the pork forming this cheesy seasoning on top.Salmon tartare with cucumber and crunchy quinoa:The salmon tartar with cucumber and quinowa was amazing. It was a heavenly match where the salmon was soft and it melts in your mouth while the quinowa was crunchy and gave you a sense of explosion. To top it was the fresh cucumber that made the whole sensation come with a light freshness.Black forest black sesame ice cream sandwich:It was a perfect match for each other. The sesame sandwich base has a sesame taste that isn't overpowering your tastebuds while being a bit salted. It was a perfect match with the ice cream because the ice cream's sweetness balanced out the saltiness of the sesame sandwich so you can't taste it.Roasted bone marrow with chanterelles & pink peppercorn:For myself I wasn't exactly impressed with this dish because I think it's just not really my flavor, however my friend loved it. The dish was really well made though, the bone marrow came out perfectly fine and the texture was amazing because it just melts right when it gets into you mouth. Dungeness crab with kimchi and tofu skin:This was a dish that I personally loved. It was recommended by one of the nice servers. I personally love the mix because the tofu skin and crab meat was soft along with a crunchy bit of kimchi and it's creamy spice sauce.Sourdough, Sauerkraut, Pecorino & Ricotta Pancakes:We think it was okay, it was definitely good but maybe a little heavy on the cheese taste. It felt a bit like I was eating a mozzarella cheese ball but it was fried to be a good crunch.Quil Egg:This was good, but not my cup of egg. Maybe it was the mushroom in it that overpowered it a little. It had a slight herbal taste to it also. Smoked trout, potato porridge, poached egg, nori:This was delicious.CA State Bird With Provisions:Hamachi-avocado & seaweed cracker:Raw Oysters with Spicy Kohlrabi Kraut & Sesame:We literally gained an extra 50 pounds last night and waking up still full. We will definitely come back with reservation next time in hopes to try what we haven't yet. SBP is like the hot guy whose photos you drool all over online, but when you finally land a date and meet up in person, you find out that he's a half foot shorter than you. Is he still hot? Certainly, but not everything you were hoping for. After all the struggle of obtaining a reservation, waiting for 2 months after the reservation was made, and hearing recommendations from several different people for this place, I was completely ready to fall head over heels in love. Did I discover the new love of my culinary life? Sadly no (Frances still holds my heart), but SBP is still a solid choice. I had several hits through the course of my meal here, but also experienced just as many misses. Eating here gave me a good understanding of why tasting menus and prix fixe menus are set up the way they are.  The chef is certainly not shy about flavor. Unlike most upscale places with their complex but subtle flavors, the food here is rich and packs quite a flavorful punch. This was enjoyable for the first few dishes, but after several fat filled dishes in a row, it started to become a little too much. I now understand why many restaurants will offer a palate cleanser in between courses and opt for more subtle flavors. I'm sure everyone reading through these reviews has caught on to the dim sum format so I won't elaborate on that. The price: The cart food is a little cheaper than the menu food. They range from $3-$10 each. Menu food runs $8-$20. The bill at the end for night for 2 people was $114.30 before tip and we got to sample 13 different dishes for that price. This is definitely on the more affordable side of Michelin dining. I wasn't blown away as I was hoping, but I'd be willing to give it another try in the future. Hits for the night: Salmon Tartare, pork belly, hen dumpling in savory broth, duck liver mousse with almond biscuits, and the ice cream sandwich.  Ok items: Hamachi on a nori chip, bone marrow (the bread was delicious though), peanut milk, oyster, state bird with provisions (tasted like a small fried chicken).Misses: Garlic bread with burrata (I know yelpers loved this, but I just didn't get it. Tasted no garlic at all. Just tasted like black pepper flavored bread), egg with mushroom and bacon in a shot sized cup, rye crepes (a deconstructed crepe with a sauce that was just too sweet). Oh my goodness! I am so glad I was able to dine at this restaurant last week (on a whim too)! I was trying to get reservations here (by refreshing their website over the past month), but nothing was available for the night that I was going to be in SF. Sooo...I decided to try the ""walk-in"" method on a Monday evening around 6:15 pm. I arrived, checked in with the hostess and she actually said that they will have an opening at 8:45 pm!SCORE!!!Instead of dining at House of Prime Rib that evening, my friend and I decided to wait for our reservation at 8:45 pm since it's so rare to be able to secure a spot at this restaurant! WHAT A GREAT DECISION WE MADE. :) We hung out in the neighborhood for 2.5 hours or so until our reservation time. Good thing there was lots to catch up on since I was visiting for the week. hahaWhen it was our time to check-in, we went to the restaurant and waited for about 15 more minutes as the folks (who were sitting at the bar where we were going to be seated) were wrapping up their meal and paying their bill. We finally got seated at the 2 bar seats to the very right of the restaurant and nearest the door (there were only 2 bar seats facing the restaurant windows). This location is great in our opinion because all the dim sum items get made right in front of you and you get first dibs on the dim sum cart! WOOT. :) It can get a bit loud since you're sitting near the door/people are coming in and out of the restaurant. All that aside though - our bar location was great. It was just 2 of us dining anyways.Given that it was our first time there, we ordered items from the dim sum cart + items from the menu itself. Here's what we ate:CA state bird with provisions - this is the must-get staple dish, since this item was pretty much named after the restaurant itself. everyone gets it; you can find it on the menu instead of the dim sum cart. it's quail!duck liver mousse - the little buns that come with are so dainty and deliciouswild salmon tartarewild mushroom farrow - flavorful; i should have gotten one just for myself hahaoyster w/ sesame - fresh!hamachi crunch - the crunch makes it divine!red troutblack sesame ice cream (dessert) - SO GOODtres leches (dessert) with rhubarb jam - SO GOODIn all, we spent only $90 (this includes tip too) for 2 people and felt fulfilled. It was such a great meal - just enough quantity and quality!  THANKFUL that we were able to do walk-in on a busy night and eat to our tummies delight! Had a wonderful experience here. There was probably a hundred people in line when we arrived and the host came out and called everyone in with reservations... And away we went. The restaurant was nice, bright and had an open kitchen - which I love. We were seated in the middle of the room which allowed for great views all around. There is a set menu as we'll as items that are brought around ""dim sum"" style on carts. There was such an amazing vibe in the room - both the guests and the staff.  And I would be remiss to not mention that there wasn't a member of the waitstaff that I didn't think was incredible. Okay - food. Let me do my best to remember. Off the standard menu went with the ginger scallion pancake, state bird with provisions, and the Dungeness crab with kimchi. Let me pause here - the crab and kimchee was awesome. I loved everything about it and pretty much licked the bowl.Off the carts ordered duck mousse with almond biscuits, oyster with sesame and Sriracha hoisin type sauce, nori crisp with hamachi, smoked salmon terrine with avocado,  pork belly with citrus, duck and cheese croquettes, Guinea hen dumpling with lemon oil, and beef tongue. For dessert we had some peppermint tea and the peanut milk. I can't even stress how much I loved the meal. Need to go again to try different dishes. We were so full we had to start saying no. Best dishes were the crab, dumpling, and nori crisp. I would pass on the pork belly (just a little tired of it I guess). LOVED my meal here--will definitely be back just for the hamachi nori chip (see below!)Schpeel about how this place works: Fine dining dimsum style. They have people pushing around carts with the food on them and a little price tag attached, very cute. They also have a menu you can order from (i.e. savory pancakes, meats). Boyfriend and I ordered 2 mains from the menu and around 13 dimsum dishes for a total of ~$150, and were stuffed by the end. SBP says the menu changes frequently, but both the main menu and daily dimsum items look more or less the same to me.Food (4/5)The food was very up and down--there were a few dishes that we did not care for at all BUT there was one dish that made the entire meal worth it--the hamachi nori chip. It is literally to die for. It's a thick, crispy nori chip with small pieces of hamachi sashimi sitting on top with dabs of avocado, black garlic aioli, and radishes. Literally one of the best dishes I have had in awhile. But that being said, the rest of the dishes were only okay. We did not care for the duck pancake, cumin lamb, duck liver mousse/almond biscuits, or the garlic bread at all. We did like the lobster salad, yogurt caviar, oysters, guinea hen dumplings, and the state bird a lot. The dessert was just okay.Ambience (5/5)Love the vibes here. Very trendy and lax. We had a really fun time dining here.Service (5/5)The people here are so so nice. The table that we were supposed to be waiting for took forever. The hostess kept apologizing profusely and did everything she could to make our wait more bearable--she eventually worked some magic to help us get another table. She was a sweetheart!ONLY COMPLAINT: The reservation system! Literally impossible to get a reservation (opens online at 4am daily and gets booked within seconds) but the good news is there is always a good chunk of tables saved for walk-in. But the line does start forming early, so definitely get there by 4:30pm (they open at 5:30pm). If you are in line before the hat shop door...chances are you will get in on the first seating. If you don't get in on the first seating though, they will take your name down and give you a time to return (usually around 7:00pm). They also bring you treats while you wait in line outside!Overall, will definitely be back because it's a great dining experience and the hamachi nori chip is amazing. Yes, it's worth the hype. Had a 7:30 reservation and showed up at 7:15, and were sat right down at our table. The first server who came to our table explained how things work, and said we would meet all of the other servers that night, and he was right. We ordered salmon tartare and oysters from the cart, and lots of other things that were being passed around on trays.  Just tell anybody who passes by that you need another drink, and they will get it for you.   The servers were very friendly and helpful, and the food combinations were creative and outstanding.  The food on the trays is so enticing, don't forget to take a look at the menu! Their signature dish, deep fried quail, was really really good.  We were torn between two desserts, so they brought us a half order of each. GuavaTres Leches cake and their ice cream sandwich.  If, by some miracle, you can get a table at this place. Definitely go. This was not my original #600.  It would have landed four or five spots later chronologically, but this jumps the line with good reason.  Having a busy week after a grueling business trip, my Yelp skills were rusty (translation: I was exhausted!) so forgive my lack of details.A blow by blow is too difficult given the number of dishes and the time constraints of the meal, so here's my summary:Signature dishes1) Sourdough pancakes (yelp.com/user_local_phot…) - After devouring one, understood why it is a signature.  If you're a bread person, you'll like this.2) State Bird (yelp.com/user_local_phot…) - Think mini fried chicken (it's quail though) with pickled onions.  Can't get more deliciously crispy than this.Highlights3)  Pork belly - Melted in my mouth and softened my guilt with a grape leaf salad.  Forgot to click my camera on this one.4)  Crab dip & salsa with homemade chips (yelp.com/user_local_phot…) - Remember that Lays chip commercial, betcha can't just eat one?  That's how addictive these are and with crab dip that had a perfect texture, not too creamy.5)  Black sesame ice cream sandwich (yelp.com/user_local_phot…) - A fellow diner commented that the cookie reminded her of sesame cookies from Taiwan.  Did somebody say 'ice cream'?6). Peanut shot (yelp.com/user_local_phot…) - Think mini peanut milk shake.PlusWith the number of offered dishes, it's amazing how they are able to present such a variety of flavors without being repetitious, unique in their own way.  They are also innovators in giving you choices between the set menu items and the 'dim sum' style served foods that are offered as the servers walk the room.MinusDue to the crowds and long line, a diner may feel obligated to somewhat rush his/her meal as a courtesy to both the waiting customers and the restaurant.  If you are looking for a leisure dinner with conversation, this probably is not a good choice.  We were in and out of the restaurant in about 90 minutes, amazing considering that we had about sixteen courses not counting desserts.You may wonder why the change in the review format.  I couldn't remember the descriptions and names of every item that we ate.  Age is catching up with me... what's your name again?!Overall, the experience was five solid stars.  From our gracious hosts (inside connections), the special perks (complimentary glass of bubbly and meeting the chef), the service (courteous and efficient... plus a familiar face from another Michelin restaurant up north), and the food, amazing varying flavor profiles!  Just wished that I could remember more about it.  Will I be back?  You can bet on it, but hopefully when my mind is in a better state. This restaurant is seriously as good as it gets. After finally scoring a reservation online, we finally had a late Monday night dinner at this hot spot! Oh the menu options to choose from.  From duck pancakes to bone marrow there's a wide variety of items to choose from. Plus you don't even have to order from the menu. You can just wait for the servers to come around with plates/carts of goodies. I think we had about 10 of the 17 dishes they offered ""dim-sum style"". You have no idea what they'll be serving so you'll be guessing what could be next (which I find fun!) Affordable, quality, and complex, intricate ingredients. The menu can vary, but seriously there's really are no bad choices on the menu.Here is what we tried (literally I would recommend them all).  From the Main MenuCA State bird with provisionsDuck ham-maitake pecan pancake with cumquat mustard (soooo good)roasted bone marrow with mushrooms & pink peppercornFrom the Dim Sum ""carts""Duck CroqueteRaw Glacier Bay OystersGuinea Hen DumplingGriled aspargusartichoke, quinoa & chickpea ""tabouleh"" (my partner raved about this one!) garlic bread with bur rata ( a must have)wild mushroom farro spezzatosteak tartare 'caesar' lettuce cupssmoked trout & avocado chip & dip hamachi-avocado & seaweed cracker (quite delicious I must say)pork belly blood orange salad (MUST MUST MUST!) They ran out of the pork riblets so that was the only bummer of the night. For desserts, we had the black sugar-black sesame 'ice cream sandwich, apricot ginger sauce. Sooooo nice touch to cleanse my pallet!For drinks, I got a nonalcoholic soda.  I got the Lemon Meyer Guava! Oh it was the perfect sweet drink to top off a great ight of eating. Definitely a must try for food-enthusiast! you surely won't be disappointed. I will be back for seconds, or thirds. What can I say that hasnt been already written? . . . Everything was amazing. You should go if you can.Biggest surprise though was the onion ""jam"" that comes with the fried quail:bonappetit.com/test-kitc…I cooked it at home and it was almost identical. Great item to cook at home with poultry and impress your guests. After wanting to try this place for more than a year, I finally got the chance last night.  A few tips: go with at least three other friends so you can try as many dishes as possible, line up (starts at the door and wraps to the window so you can watch the chefs preparing the food) around 3:30-4pm on weekends if you don't have a reservation (55% of the tables are for walk-ins) and there's no sign on the door or building!  If you're within the first group of 20 or so, you'll get a seat, otherwise, they'll give you a time so you can walk around and not have to wait in line.Our favorites:Homemade potato chips with roe and creme fraiche: only complaint is it only comes with around 6 chips!Hamachi on a crispy nori chip: We ordered two of these... so good.  Tastes like hamachi poke.Duck liver mousse with almond biscuits: so rich and tasty.  Be sure to ask for extra biscuits at no charge.  You'll need them for the extra mousse.Mendocino sea urchin, ginger-scallion pancake with soy-lime sauce: a little like a Korean seafood pancake with a fresh urchin on top.Tofu custard with bacon: better as a dessertQuinoa porridge with wild mushrooms and ginger: like Chinese rice porridge, but with tons more flavor. Guinea hen dumpling: Steamed dumpling with lots of flavor.  Love the mushroomy broth.Braised Pork Belly: excellent sauce, perfectly cooked skinGood, but just above average:CA state bird with provisions: their specialty.  It's a fried quail with a lemony, leeky sauce on the bottom.  Pricey and less meat than two chicken wings.Garlic Bread with Burrata: like a Chinese fried donut at the dim sum restaurants, but with a glop of cheese.Grilled beef & broccoli with umeboshi and bonitoGuava tres leches: tres leches with a side of guava jelly and whipped cream.Oysters with chili oil, sesame seeds: $2 each.  It was good, but I might be spoiled with the Hog Wash at Hog Islabd Oyster Depot.Skip:Grilled beef broccoli with umeboshi and bonito: Good, but a little tough and pricey for 8 cuts of steak.   Might want to order the bone marrow instead.Pork spare ribs: a little burnt, average flavorCorkage is $25 for a 750ml bottle, $50 for a 1.5L bottle. a tad overpriced, but good food all around.  salmon tartar was the highlight.i would give it 4 stars, but while i was eating some of the beet salad, i crunched down on a thick piece of hard plastic the size of a match and immediately spit it out.  i let the server know, and was hoping to at least get the dish replaced or taken off the tab, but nothing.  left a bad taste in my mouth, literally. This meal was everything I had hoped for - top notch, unpretentious, friendly service, and impeccable food.  There was an abundance of exquisite food I could eat even though I don't eat meat or fowl.  I wanted to try everything but unfortunately my appetite didn't cooperate.  Cannot wait to return!  It's an incredible value for the experience. Came here at 4:30pm or so on a Monday and waited in line for an hour. It was fun to see the chefs in the window trying various dishes of the day. Without a sign on the front door, I felt totally ""underground"" and cool. We made friends with others in line and took dish recommendations.I would highly recommend a seat at the bar as you're in the center of the activity and can witness them cooking up a storm. It is like dim sum or new American tapas, with waiters whizzing around with various dishes. Definitely be in an adventurous mindset when you go there!My main complaint (to echo some of the previous comments) is that it is VERY SALTY and fairly over-priced. But there were definitely some highlights such as the quail eggs, the duck liver mousse i.e. adult cupcakes :), various mushroom dishes, and a delectable wine menu -- highly recommend their viognier.For dessert, we polished off the cornbread (mild) and a layered ice cream dessert that was out of this world. Overall a really positive experience! My friend and I high-fived on the way out .... success! :) Award winning.- ""Best new restaurant."" - James Beard Foundation- ""Restaurant of the year."" - Bon Appétit Magazine- ""One star."" - Michelin GuidesProbably had the burrata garlic bread or the hen dumpling. Maybe it was the sourdough pancake topped with sauerkraut. Perhaps the quail eggs with apple and sunchokes.Then again it might have been the bone marrow topped with chanterelles and peppercorn. Or duck liver mousse with tiny almond biscuits. Might be the trout quinoa.Perhaps they went straight for dessert and the shot of peanut milk while saving room for a cocoa nib ice cream sandwich and plum fudge.In fact the only dish of the night that was remotely disappointing was the signature fried quail. Lots of skin but minimal meat. More room for everything else.Even with a bottle of wine the damage was less than $60 per person. Such a small price to pay for the delicious creative brilliance demonstrated in almost every dish.Enthusiasm of our server could not have been faked. Now see why she seemed so happy to work here. Space is alive and bursting with energy. And amazing food.Allow me to add five stars to their well earned lengthy list of awards. Gastronomic adventure of mass proportions. The food was beyond my wildest imagination: flavors, textures and all of it. Food levitation. The cooks interacted with guests at the bar table and the carts brought out gems! The wine was paired just fine. I'm glad I was here on a week day and I plan to go back. This place is hard to fine with lack of outside signage - but it's a foodie heaven, with food-porn magicians when you're on the inside. Worth a visit for any foodie.. My second times here, I gave 5 stars for service and 3 stars for food.Food is OK, nothing that special. We live a few blocks away from State Bird and have been dining there since before it got the ""Best restaurant in America"" and reservations were so hard to get. But all the hype aside, it really is as good as everyone says it is. The small plates is perfect for those of us foodies who want to order the left side of the menu...because at State Bird...you can! Small plates mean variety. The casual hipster dim sum vibe is welcoming and not pretentious at all. You will feel so comfortable here. And the wait staff is knowledgable, friendly, and well....who could ask for anything more. You can check out some awesome photos we took of the various dishes we ordered on our food website at the link below. The menu changes all the time, so these same dishes will probably not be available when you go, but it will give you a sense of what you're in for. Enjoy!eatsporkjew.com/restaura… I don't get it. Did we all go to the same restaurant?!Flavors were eh.. mostly just SALTY. I only liked one dish, I can only describe it as an egg custard (savory) with mushroom in a little sake shot glass with bacon on top. I would also have to recommend the dessert, peanut milk shots.. YUMMY!! Other than that, eh. I found everything to be extremely salty. Maybe we ordered the wrong things?? Maybe it was an off night?  But it definitely wasn't worth the price tag (Or the sleepless hours trying to get reservations at 4am). Oh and can you please put a sign out or at least the address listed somewhere near/on the door? I swear we walked past this white door several times before we actually went in. I LOVE SBP:  I prefer to stand at chef's counter, which is relatively easy to do if you do not have a reservation.  Just put your name in and hop around the corner to Fat Angel for a drink while you wait.  The chef's counter is awesome because it allows you to converse with the chefs and see everything before it leaves the kitchen.   The thing that makes this restaurant truly fabulous is its truly innovative small plates!  After trying most restaurants in the city and being an avid cook myself, sometimes I feel a little uninspired and bored with the food scene (in my budget).  This restaurant however is guaranteed to reinvigorate your enthusiasm, always surprise you..... And at a price point much lower than other ""innovative"" restaurants in the city. (+0.5) Oh god the wait. I don't think I have waited in line for so long for a meal. The end result was a mix. Some dishes were definitely delicious and some were dare I say intriguing. I imagine this is how a none asian person's first experience with dim sum must be like. Half of the time we are trying to guess what we have just put into our mouth. I applause them for such unique experience, but I think in the end I was just overwhelmed and needed a good bowl of simple noodle soup. Phenomenal restaurant. Line is a bit ridiculous, but worth the wait.One trick is to go over early on a Tuesday or Wednesday and put your name on the list and then wait until about 830 and you should get in. Came here in a group of 8 and was served 17 different dishes for $65.  There are 4 courses, and in each course, there are 2-6 dishes.  *breathe and make room*The beginning in each course was a bit overwhelming because dishes drop down quickly during the start of the first course.  But, SBP gives a nice break in before introducing the next course.  *Whew~Memorable dishes:1. hamachi-avocado & seaweed cracker.  As far as hamachi dishes go...the hamachi shots at Alexander's Steakhouse is far superior, but it was interesting to eat on a seaweed cracker.  Great presentation.2. Garlic Bread with burrata - sometimes the most simple things are the best3. Pork Belly with blood orange salad.  I think the orange salad didn't help the pork belly.  Good thick cubed of pork belly with just a tad of salt is all you really need.  Simple.That's all, even the quail wasn't even that great. Ice cream ""sandwich"" was alright...well, it was the best ice cream sandwich I've tasted, but certainly not the best dessert.  It didn't live up to it's hype.  But still 4 stars for the ""dim sum"" dining experience and value. Still love this place! If you really want to try this place and don't want to wait for a reservation three months out. Swing by after work before 5:30pm. They start taking wait list names at 5:30pm. If you have two in your party, you will very likely get seated before 9pm if not 8pm. I recently went with a group of 4 and someone put our name down at 5:45pm and we were seated before 9pm which was longer than I expected. Had we put our name down right at 5:30pm we could've been seated at 8pm. Be patient folks. Now that SBP has expanded, getting a seat is much easier. There's a reason that SBP was named the Best New Restaurant of 2013. State Bird Provisions is the ONLY restaurant in SF that 1) I will wait 60 days to dine at; 2) Continually surprises me with their menu updates; 3) Continually impresses me with their regular dishes; and 4) excites me nowadays. I've been RAVING about this restaurant to all my friends. On the two occasions that I've brought friends with me to this restaurant, they agreed that the restaurant lived up to the hype! After my three visits, here's what I recommend:HIGHLY RECOMMENDED-Any pancake/short stack: I've tried corn, duck, and uni, and their savory pancake combinations are always a winner. -Duck liver mousse with almond biscuits: essentially, naughty cupcakes for adults. Perfectly sweet almond/corn biscuits smothered in a decadent, luxurious duck liver mousse that harkens back to the days of foie gras. -Garlic knots with burrata: Simple knotted breads, crispy on the outside and doughy on the inside, smothered with silky, pillowy burrata. -Anything with pork belly: I've tried several versions of pork belly at SBP. All are usually Vietnamese style, and all delicious. -CA state bird with provisions: perfectly breaded/crunchy outside and juicy quail inside, served on top of lemony stewed onions. Small, but packs a punch and well worth the price. -Any and all desserts: especially the ice cream sandwichesOK, BUT NOT TERRIBLE (just not ""must try/must order"")-charred octopus in tomato-chickpea salsa-tombo tuna-avocado & seaweed cracker-1/2 dozen cast iron quail eggs, sunchoke & ravigote -duck neck dumplings: SBP is well known for this, but I've had enough dim sum in SF to not be impressed by their version -oysters: interesting, but i'm a purist and I prefer Hog Island for oysters A fun place to eat New American cuisine and the dim sum/tapas style dining makes it a fun place to eat with friends. Here's hoping that SBP keeps up the good work! I LOVE this place! Worth the wait? I'm not so sure if a 4 hour wait is worth it but I did have a wonderful time with some friends. We ordered a bunch of tapas to try out but I guess one of the most memorable ones is the quail. We also loved the burrata and bread there. Don't order the lobster tapa because we were quite disappointed with that. The two unique sodas were also really good. I'd go back if the wait wasn't so long! Phenomenal dining experience. Cool vibe. Friendly staff. Three words: Food flavor explosions. Probably my top dining experience ever!  Best meal in 10 days of dining San Fran. First time trying pork belly and we were blown away! My husbands fav was the smoked sturgeon pancake-note- the 'pancake' itself was a masterpiece. The caviar w/chips was amazing as well. Dessert was ice cream sandwiches of perfection. There was so much more I wanted to order. If I didn't live in Colorado this would be my favorite go to for special occasions. Lark Bunting anyone;) ? American dim sum -- BRILLIANT. Service was amazing and different than anywhere else I have been (all the wait staff is at your service - no pride of ownership.) the eponymous fish was my favorite. Sea urchin pancake and burrata dumpling close second followed by dungeness crab kimchi. Only complaint was lack of cocktail menu, but nice wine list more than satisfied. This restaurant lives up to the hype!! i have been to Statebird provisions twice. The first time, I went with a big group and the Sous Chef Glenn coursed out everything into small portions which was great!! They have a sparkling Riesling by the Magnum bottle at around 100 usd which I think is a great deal, especially if you're with a big group. The second time round, I went as a group of 4. I was devastated to find that my favorite Asian Chicken vegetarian salad was NO LONGER ON THE MENU!!!!! ---- this, along with Commonwealths salads, are the ONLY two salads I would dream about in the Bay Area. With that said, food was still good although service seemed a bit rushed.The fried ""statebird"" was not bad, very well cooked, but the highlights of both meals were:- Housemade chips, trout roe & horse radish creme fraiche (YUM!)-  Hamachi on crispy Nori- Duck liver mousse with Almond biscuits (can have 100 of these!)- Rabbit and mushroom curry with Roti (I don't usually eat rabbit but the sauce for this was just BOMB.COM)DO NOT forget the milk dessert that taste like a snicker bar in a small glass... DELICIOUS! Could have that for breakfast everyday! :D I'm a big fan of tapas and State Bird Provisions definitely hit the spot. Tapas, in general, are pricey bites to eat, and State Bird Provisions is no exception.  However, the novelty, freshness, and quality of the tapas dishes are top notch here.  As many have remarked, it's like dimsum with a western/American twist. Many of the dishes make use of local ingredients and incorporate elements from different cuisines--mainly from Asian cuisines.  My friend and I shared about 9 dishes-- our favorites being the pork belly in Vietnamese broth, the garlic bread, hamachi atop nori chip, uni scallion pancake, and the bone marrow.  All the food was prepared exceptionally well, seasoned just right, and was just mouthwatering good!  One of the awesome things I found out about this place after eating here is that it has one Michelin star. Typically Michelin star restaurants tend to be kind of pricey, but State Bird Provisions is an affordable restaurant for those who want to try a Michelin restaurant without too big of a dent in your wallet.  Overall a good experience with good food-- 4 stars! State Bird Provisions is set up to be a partially dim sum style restaurant. There is a main menu as well as dim sum carts and trays that circulate the room. The wait staff is attentive and friendly and will explain the dishes on their carts in detail. The Menu Items1. Pancake of sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta- rich, but unremarkable2. Spicy fried cauliflower salad with bayley hazen blue cheese- really really flavorful and delicious. I could eat this every day. 3. Hearts of palm, avocado, pomelo salad with tahini chili oil- I wish I could make a salad that tasted like this. It was an amazingly balanced and flavorful salad with a great tahini dressing. WOW. 4. State Bird- The caramelized onions over the fried bird were really great. It was flavorful and moist. Plus, it's the signature dish so you must try it!The Provisions (Dim Sum Items) **Harder to remember because I can't reference a menu1. Burrata garlic bread- YUM YUM YUM. I love burrata in all forms and this did not disappoint. 2. Oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesame- I can be hit or miss on oysters, but the spicy kohlrabi kraut topping was soo good that I wanted to eat several of these. I wish I could have bought a bottle of the topping to eat with crackers. The dashi type flavors were great!3. Farro spezato salad- I wish I had more insight as to what was in this vegetarian farro salad, but it was just GREAT! This is the problem with eating dim sum; it's hard to recommend what to order. 4. Roasted asparagus with walnut aioli- the aioli was really good. The asparagus were jumbo sized, but I sort of wished they had been smaller. Desserts (we got a 1/2 order of all of them- don't judge)1. kiwi granita, yogurt tapioca, dates & kumquats- I loved the granita and my friend loved the tapioca. Probably my least favorite of the desserts. 2. guava tres leches, chèvre crème fraîche, rhubarb & pistachio- The waiter said this was his favorite. I liked it, but didn't think it was the best tres leches I'd ever had. The guava was a nice touch. 3. warm cornmeal custard, chocolate crumble, mapled apricots & walnuts- I would come back to this restaurant for the sole purpose of eating this dessert. It was rich but balanced and soooo well made. YUM!4. spiced cocoa nib 'ice cream' sandwich, black pepper pecans, plum fudge- this was a nice cold bite and the plum fudge was a really unique flavor. I enjoyed it, but might not eat it again. 5. 'world peace' peanut muscovado milk shots- literally a shot of PB milk. Yummy, but not super special."|5|100|0|Routine Inspection|This inspection has no violations.|GOOD: no inspection needed
State Bird Provisions 1|4.5|Tapas/Small Plates in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|1051|1|4.347619047619047|" First off, we really wanted to eat here because of course we've heard all the buzz about this restaurant. ""Michelin"" rated and blah, blah. I happen to think I enjoy the finer foods, so eating here was exciting for us. Come to realize we waited for over an hour parked for this place to be open, not knowing there was a line of people. The reservation process for this restaurant is really lame, 60 days prior or getting up at like 4 am to check if someone cancelled. Where is the customer service for people who want to give you the business. One thing I noticed is that there is a lot secret hand shaking going on there, how is possible for you to know people by when no one can ever get in?!?how or why were people who came after us leaving before we were even called. Completely turned off by this place from the start.I thought this was american food, but they should really say Asian flavors in the menu. I like the dim sum concept. I just was not impressed by the food, I wanted explosions of flavors not a bunch of seeds and herbs mixed with quinoa an fish or in a pancake or with more fish. I think we had 2 dished that were the best out of the night not that I've ever eaten. The seared trout and the trout with potato pancake.I would of given it 2 stars but the chef there Dave was just amazing, he has amazing customer service and great cooking knowledge he earn the the 3rd star. I don't see my self waking up in the middle of the night or waiting in the cold so I probably will never dine here again. But best of luck to SBP. My friend made a reservation TWO months ago at 4 in the morning and when we saw the line as we arrived, it was totally worth it. (Though 2 months was still a really long wait!)We got seated immediately and was explained that it's pretty much dim sum style where they come around and let you know what they have and you can choose if you want it or not, and you can also order off their menu. We got:Rabbit and Fontina Croquette: I liked this. It was a small piece of well cooked rabbit wrapped in a thin layer of cheese and some crumb coating. I could have had a few more of those.Smoked Sturgeon Cream with thin cracker things: i really liked this one. It was really light and a good starter of the meal. The crackers were super crispy and when added the dip, there was a really nice light smokey flavorGuinea Hen Dumpling with Aromatic Broth: This one was pretty good. It pretty much tasted like a dumpling in a really good broth and it totally reminded me of something but I couldn't figure it out and then I realized that it kind of taste like pho, but as good as it was, I rather pay $6 for a whole bowl of pho instead of $3 for a little dumpling.Hamachi-avocado and seaweed cracker: I liked this one, but it pretty much tasted like sushi. I liked the crispiness of the seaweed (I think they fried it) and the hamachi was fresh and the avocado sauce went really well with it. My friend really liked this one.CA State Bird with Provisions: this one you have to order off the menu and I always have to try what a restaurant is know for. It pretty much tasted like a really delicate fried chcken. It's a really light bird (It's quail in case you didn't know what CA's  state bird is lol) and wasn't too meat-y. The sauce, lemon and onion that came with it flavored it really well, but other than that, it was kind of like a good piece of fried chicken.Smoked Trout Quinoa ""Tabouleh"": This one was one of my favorites. The quinoa was really good - nice and crispy and the smoked trout is an amazing flavor to add to it! YUM!Pork Belly Grape Salad: i'm usually all in for fatty meat parts, but this one was a little too much. I wasn't a big fan of the pork belly itself - I didn't like the pieces that they chose to give us, but the vinagar-y flavor was really good and sad to say, but the grapes (though only a few of them) were probably better than the meat.Garlic Bread with Burrata: I don't really know what burrata is (cheese?), but it was really good. It was super creamy and cheesy and was really good with the warm bread. It was a tad on the greasy side, but the combination of cheese and bread was really good.Chocolate Cake Roll: Super rich chocolate. If you like dark chocolate, this is definitely for you. The cake itself was light and fluffy, but it hits you with a huge coco flavor! The orange clove added a unique flavor to it. It was sweet enough so it was good, but also a tad bitter for contrast.Poppy Seed Ice Cream Sandwich: You know you're a total dessert fan when you think it's the best dish of the entire night. I'm so glad we got this one and was thinking about ordering a second for just myself. The poppy seed ice cream was delicious and whatever the sandwich part of the dessert is was lightly sweetend and chewy. I didn't really taste any of the fruit flavors it said it came with, but I was happy with just the poppy seed ice cream and it's sandwich parts.Overall, it was a cool experience. When they describe the food, they mention a ton of ingredients that i'm not familiar with or can even pernounce and there are like a ton of different ingredients in each dish! For the most part, you can just go with what looks good. They were all pretty good, though I felt despite the complicated ingredients, nothing was really thaaat unque and it reminded me of everything I've tried before. All the dishes are pretty pricey (a small dish for $10?!?) but it's worth the try if you're there anyways. The servers are super nice and helpful and the food comes around more than once so you don't have to worry about passing on any dish at the moment because they will come back. I might come back to try some different things... or for the poppy seed ice cream!! First off, I want to give a shout out to hubby for coming on this mad adventure with me on our recent trip to SF.  He didn't call me crazy when I told him we had to get to the restaurant an hour before opening, nor did he give up when we missed the first seating cut off by 2 parties and were told to come back in 2.5 hours.  I'm a lucky girl!When we finally did get in, we were fortunately enough to be seated at the bar but in our own little section with only us and the bartender who ended up being our spiritual food and drink guide for the evening.Our evening got off to a great start with a small glass of their Anchor Christmas ale.  It was dark but totally drinkable and opened up my appetite in a major way.  After that, the food starting rolling by.  American-style dim sum is how it's described, minus the pushy cart ladies and the ensuing MSG coma.We pretty much tried everything they had to offer. We had two kinds of oysters that evening, one raw and one roasted - both the best I've ever had.  I enjoyed ordering, re-ordering, re-ordering both oysters.Other standouts:Some nori/seaweed chip laded with hamachi, dollops of sauce and other beautiful garnishes.  I ate TWO.This cucumber, creme fraiche and salmon roe dishState Bird ProvisionsDessert: Egg Nog sandwich and two shots of peanut milk.  To die for.  Because there were so many dishes being passed around, we only ordered their signature dish the State Bird (half) from their written menu.  Just about the only thing we weren't TOO crazy about was the garlic bread with burrata.  It was just too dense and doughy for our taste.  Otherwise, the evening was a whirlwind of wonderful service from EVERYONE (even the people cooking would check in on us if they caught us looking like we needed something).We are definitely going to make it a point to come back here soon!! Over-hyped and over-priced. We had to stand close to the door in the cold weather because reservations were booked for months. The food was really just so-so, even though there were a couple of surprises. By no means am I a ""foodie"" and should my review mean anything to anyone, but I'm sure the restaurant would like to know how well they're doing! All these positive reviews must mean they're doing something right!My gosh, where do I even begin? Yes, we waited for 2 hours to get seated right when they opened, but I'd do it all over again in a heartbeat. We were in the very front of the line so we were fortunate enough to be entertained by the cooks who were prepping at the window. Everything about this place is amazing- the atmosphere, service and of course the food. I love how fresh/crisp EVERYTHING tasted. All the flavors were seasoned perfectly, nothing was too little or too much. Even the pricing was fair, which is hard to come by for really good restaurant located in SF. I left feeling completely satisfied.Mad kudos to the chefs here, seriously. I haven't stopped raving about this place since I went on Friday! Looking forward to going again! There are two options if you want to eat at this new michelin star restaurant. Option 1: You get a reservation. Reservations are booked 1 month in advance and it's first come first serve on their website. The reservations come out at like 4am or something ridiculous like that and there are people with programs that get those reservations. Those new money, silicon valley computer engineers. So good luck getting a reservation. Option 2: you walk in and try to see if you can get a seat for dinner that evening. My girlfriend and I showed up at 4:30pm and waited an hour in line outside the restaurant before they opened at 5:30pm and there were still around 20 people in front of us. San Francisco gets crazy when it comes to food. We ended up getting a seat for 8pm that night. We walked around the neighborhood and went to a bar to enjoy the NBA All Star game while waiting for our reservation. If you get on the list as a walk in they take your phone number and text you when your reservation is ready. Our reservation was like 30 mins early so we walked over when we received the text. We were told we would be seated at the chefs table which is right in front of the kitchen so you can watch them work. If you can, get those seats and I will explain why.The concept of the restaurant is western dim sum. They walk around with small plates and tapas on a seafood cart for your fishy options. They also bring around trays of other bites to eat in various intervals. They also have a menu so you can order kitchen items as well. From the seafood cart we only got the oysters and if you can, get around 5 or so. Raw oysters with a crunchy slaw or something on top. Good texture to start with.From the small plates they bring around and options from the menu we had plenty. Here is what you should try: Riblets (tender and with a sweet sauce), pork belly (soft pork belly with a vinegar sauce and cilantro/jalapeno and grape salad), bone marrow (just trust me bro), beef tartare (make a lettuce wrap with it and get the party in your mouth started), duck liver mousse with almond biscuits (my favorite dish of the night), hamachi nori cracker (pretty much your average tuna with avocado cracker dish at any restaurant, but it was tasty just nothing special or unique other than presentation). Items you probably won't miss out on: state bird with provisions (fried quail with soggy onions and such), bread with barata (pretty much bread covered with cheese, tasty but you can live without it), a barley or oat dish that looks like risotto? (skip this, just filler without the thriller).They make in house sodas, we got both the plum and yuzu soda. You can do without the yuzu but you gotta get the plum. It's awesome, refreshing and something new. For dessert we got everything in a half order that we could because we were bursting at the seams at that point. Desserts that are a must have: Poppy seed ice cream sandwhich (get one for yourself, dont' share. trust me), peanut muscovado milk (it's milk that tastes like peanuts, it's a trip man and it's pretty good like a milk with your desserts, nothing is better).Desserts you can skip:  the cornmeal topped with dried fruit (it's good but the dried fruit on top is too overpowering), the chocolate roll cake (just a chocolate cake with orange garnish, don't eat the orange, that was a bad move on my part), asian pear granita (it's interesting but the ginger in the tapioca is too much).Now let me go back to why you want to sit at the chefs table. Not only did we get a waiter, we were right next to where they bring out all the trays of food they bring around to people. We got first dibs on all the dishes which were hot straight out of the kitchen. We could also ask the chefs cooking the food to put in an order for us and they would hand it to us personally. The service at the chefs table is the best in the house. You sit on stools and get a hook under the counter to hand your jacket. So if you don't have back issues, sit here for sure. You get the best service and first pick from all the food and you know it's fresh since you see it being made and handed right to you.Overall a wonderful dinning experience. This is an experience everyone should have at least once. If it wasn't impossible to get reservations or inconvenient to wait hours outside for a chance at a table, I would come back again and try dishes I didn't get a chance to. I hear the menu changes every now and then so if they make a lot of changes I might attempt to come back. Come at least once to experience this unique concept and make your decision from there if it's worth a second visit. I am content with my one visit and will wait for hype to die down before attempting to come again. Solid 4 stars overall. Holy. Crap. I haven't even left the place and I'm driven, like some madwoman possessed, to yelp this experience.Come prepared to open your mind. The menu is totally incomprehensible to mortals. I told my friend that it's almost like the names were generated by throwing a handful of dice, each side bearing some random and exotic ingredient. ""Duck ham pecan pancake with chicories & ha chits persimmon mustard.""  I don't have any frame of reference for this insanity.But who cares? Because when you put it in your gob - whatever the hell it is - you're going to shout. ""What the hell am I eating?"" And in a goo way.Go. Right now. And be delighted. I got a reservation super randomly (too many people know about the 4am secret. I just randomly clicked once and got a reservation for the next day for 8pm).  Due to the lack of effort in securing a reservation and the ease of finding parking, my experience started off on the right foot.Prices were very fair, Dim-sum style makes it interactive and interesting. I'd say 70% of the food, I would order or eat again. Short ribs, uni ginger scallion pancake, roti with Rabbit, and oysters were our faves and are worth 5 stars. The rest, were not:- State Bird: fried quail. Not as good as just getting fried chicken. Not as juicy or crunchy as well seasoned as the Foreign Cinema chicken. It's also just not a lot of meat on a quail wing.- some sort of cheese balls with dipping sauce. the taste literally reminded me of the last time I threw up after my birthday party (for the record, I'm in my 20s. throwing up after a birthday celebration should not warrant more than an eye roll. Keep your ""tsk tsks"" and ""SMHs"" to yourself)-salmon tartare (it was on a dim sum cart). I can't even remember the ingredients but it was underwhelming in taste and texture)- dungness crab with kimchi. My bf loves crab and korean food, so this was a no-brainer. I don't really have recommendations on how to make this dish better since the pairing doesn't make sense to me, but it was very ""eh"" in his words. Actually, those were exactly his wordsWe'd definitely come back but would probably stick to the things we already know we'd like.  But the barrier to trial here is super low as the price point on the dimsum carts rarely stray above $10.  Great experience, can't wait to return, assuming I can score an easy reservation. A western approach on ordering dim sum style? Yes please!Reservations are apparently super tough to get!! People sometimes camp out in front of the door just to get a reservation (about 1 1/2-2 hours) since online reservations are just as tough to get.But moving on, I love this place! The service was amazing, the girl in the front got me and my date in front of the counter where all the oysters were (ironically we didn't have any, lol) and where the food got prepared! Yuuuuuuum!! And if you're a first timer like when I went, the servers will basically tell you how ordering works (again, dim sum style) and give a description of each food item. Oh my, we definitely picked a lot of food! However...there is one signature dish you must order on the separate menu: the State Bird with Provisions! This is a must have! It was my first time having quail and wow, I'm now a fan! You can either order a half or full order of quail, but since my date and I were munching away, we ordered the half order, and believe, it'll be enough! The breading was light, crispy, and *gasp* NOT OILY! The quail meat was very tender and the cheese and onions with it added a nice little kick to it. I totally want to come back! Next time I'll take notes on the other dishes since I don't remember all the dishes, just that they were super duper delicious!! Fun approachable atmosphere with mostly hits in this borrowed dim sum concept. Friendly helpful service that assists when you need it but doesn't try to over sell.Notable must try dishes:Quinoa with smoked trout (Tabouleh)Spicy Dungeness crab with Kimchi yuba noodles and smoked eggPork short ribs - simple, but good smoky flavor with a touch of backyard exoticNori cracker with hamachi crudoWarm cornmeal custard for dessert is an interesting palate adventure.2 stars is decent/good. 3 stars is very good in my book. I would go there again and recommend to friends to try some of the notable dishes. 4 is excellent - just go and order pretty much anything. 5 rating should be reserved only for a select few. Amazing. New American Dim Sum.  There are some regulars for sure and you can see via yelp the ones mentioned the most ( Garlic bread AMAZING) But think the fun is not knowing what new things they are going to bring out to you on any given night!  I have only ever eaten at the bar so the service has always been good. I guess its hard to have bad service when someone is always trying to give you food.  Reservations are hard to come by but if you get there as they open you can put your name on a list and most nights you are able to get in.  One of my favorite places in the city. Scored a reservation easily solely because I work nights and can easily get to a computer at 4 am or whatever time they open their online reservation system. Oh the perks of working nights :)  Woohoo! Anyway 60 days later, finally stepped into this highly recommended restaurant and was reminded why I LOVE my fellow yelpers. I would have never discovered this place if it wasn't for them. And the fact that the outside is not labeled doesn't help either.We were total ""YES"" men that night. We didn't turn away a single person who offered us food. Highlights of the night for me: 1. State Bird with Provisions (duh the namesake) 2. Pork belly! (drooling as I type) 3. Crispy Quinoa (don't know what they actually called it but that's what it was to me) 4. bone marrow (OMG) 5. ice cream sandwiches!I'm glad I went with 3 other people instead of just 1 cause that meant we had more room to taste a variety of plates. Total came out to about $60 each which I thought wasn't bad.SERVICE: top notch! everyone was friendly and informative. There was something wrong with our bill at the end and they happily fixed it without second guessing us :) it's been almost a year since my last visit (i went once in between). state bird keeps getting better and better, and i am on board with it being hyped.  the word that still describes them:  INVENTIVE!still impossible to get inawesome servicestandouts:guinea hen dumpling in chicken lemon broth (i could eat 10 of these)fried state birdsmoked trouthamachi on fried seaweed cracker (absolute must)also lovedpeanut milk shotsgarlic bread burrattaduck liver patepassoystersi'm excited to go back again.  IF i can score another reservation (had to book 2 months out this last time!) great fun concept, who doesn't love dim sum and people coming around with food ready to eat!?!I was looking in december for reservations in jan, hoping to take the bf here for his bday, but as I refresh the page every second, the only things coming up were already for feb! darn! but lucky me, one day i stumbled upon a wed reservation for the 12th! whoohoo, the only night we have off and the week of vday! perfect!so the two month wait began. we arrived around 5 so we could run a quick errand and there was a line already formed! but bwahaha we have a reservation so we got to walk righttttt up at 5:30.the restaurant was very new american/hipster, communal feel.on to the foodordered off the paper menu:fried quail- crispy light, but a little tooooo citrus-ybone marrow- i guess i've never tried bone marrow so i can't compare it but it was ok? salty, glutenous, buttery. eat it with toast and mushrooms. the ones that came aroundduck liver mousse- bf really liked it, his favorite of the night. very very rich, too rich for me but it was good.salmon tartare- not special but it was good, with cucumbers and crunchy quinoa. i liked this one.chips with homemade sourcream- bf chose this, but i don't like sour cream, meh filler food, skip itpork ribs- it WAS fall off the bone...but the flavor was not there...pork belly in fish sauce broth- best part was the grapes...pork belly was something our parents could make...too tough, sour...skiphamachi avocado on crunchy nori- this one is good, creamy, light, crunchy.dumpling in broth- once again was okay? and once again too citrus-y? the dumpling was different, forgot what kind of stuffing was in there..unique butttt ehchocolate roll cake for dessert- super rich, interesting rice cracker bits but nothing special. SO, unfortunately maybe I was overhyped about this place and it wasn't what we expected. The dishes all had very similar tastes and style. Citrus-y and a cream-like texture...love the concept, it was very fun to pick what we wanted to eat and to see the dishes coming around, but sadly the food didn't do it for us. Service was nice and friendly though. For two, we shared about 9 dishes, and a drink each. $150 with tip. not badoh parking is pretty easy at 5/530. oh and the place is pretty loud...kinda hard to hear anything without having to raise your voice.. Amazing explains it all.  A great dining experience that everyone should experience.Small plates that are full of flavor, fresh, and most of all, unique.The servers come around and offer delicious plates, dim sum style.The staff provided excellent service and came around often.You absolutely cannot go wrong with anything here. Ladies and gentlemen, the hype is real. I was less impressed my first time here (about 4 months ago in Oct 2013), but now, the wow factor is everywhere. Though my most recent experience was marred with a rude and lackadaisical waiter and the fact that some dishes took a longer time than expected to arrive, a few truly outstanding dishes made up for those imperfections. State Bird Provisions is special because of its dim sum style way of serving food to its customers. Waiters entice you with beautifully crafted dishes while enchanting you with each dish's long list of ingredients. It's tapas style taken to new heights, and I love it. It's an absolute must-try. Here are the dishes to get (or not to get):Bacon mushroom and chili oil (+++) Hamachi with avocado on a seaweed cracker (+++) Salmon belly with miso glaze (+++) Glazed pork ribs with tobarashi and scallions (+++) Rabbit and fontina croquette (++)Duck liver mousse (++) - get it if you really like liver Garlic bread with burratta (+) Smoked trout Cold porridge with potato and seaweed (+) State Bird with Provisions  (+) - worth the try, but not exceptional Roti of curry rabbit and hedgehog mushrooms (+) Guinea hen dumpling (+) +++ - Must try regardless! ++ - Really good+ - Meh, could be better Only one word to describe this place..AMAZING! Went for a birthday dinner so it was a predetermined menu... unbelievable. Our server was perfect...not overbearing not negligent. My 2-1/2 year old loved everything as much as I did. Worth the need for reservations in advance and every penny spent. Hands down my #1 on the sf restaurant list. I finally secured a spot for the BF and me at State Bird's... for my Birthday Dinner! =DGranted I had to rush over and get in line around 4:50 because I didn't have a reservation. There were already quite a few people in line by the time I arrived, and I ended up waiting 40 minutes freezing my butt off in order to get in on a Tuesday night. Unfortunately once they opened the doors and I got to the hostess, she informed me that she couldn't seat me without my boyfriend (still on his way over from work). Thankfully she was lenient with me since it was my birthday and let me sit and wait at the bar for him. Thank you!!Once the BF arrived we started ordering:State Bird (Fried Quail): 5/5 - This was my favorite dish of the night. I don't have quail often, and I've NEVER had it fried but this was perfect! The meat was tender, the breading was light and not oily at all and they placed the bird on a bed of deliciously divine onions! They added some parmesan cheese slivers on top as well which were fun to chomp on between bites of meat and onion. MUST ORDER THIS!Hamachi with avocado sauce and radish: 4/5 - A solid dish. Cubes of fresh fish on an edible seaweed/crunchy thing with some avocado sauce. Tasty and light.Pork Belly with tangy addicting sauce: 5/5 - My second favorite, and I'm not even a big fan of pork belly! My boyfriend was in love with this one, and I found it hard to find fault with this dish because it was so delectable! The meat to fat content was perfect, and the outside of the chunks were crispy while the inside remained deliciously soft. The sauce underneath was so tangy and addicting, I was scooping it up and drinking it and dipping everything I could in there because I didn't want to waste a drop!Dumpling in aromatic broth: 4/5 - A very cute single dumpling for each person =) I really enjoyed this one, it was filled with some sort of poultry if I remember correctly but what really impressed me was the broth which was super aromatic and had a subtle lemongrass taste.Salmon tartare with crunchy quinoa furikake and cucumber: 2/5 - My least favorite... The crunchy quinoa put me off, but the salmon tartare part was pretty good. I love cucumbers but it was hard to eat them when they were covered in crunchies..Red Trout with citrus sauce: 4/5 - Now this was some great fish! It almost looks like salmon because the color is such a vivid red. No bones, the meat was very soft and tender, and it was nicely paired with the citrus/brown butter sauce. At the end of our meal we received two peanut muscovado milks for free because it was my bday =) The service was great and everyone was very nice and accommodating which was awesome! The only issue is some of the dishes that are not on the menu (the ""dim sum"" ones) can take awhile to reach you but it makes for a nice, leisurely meal. Thanks for a great birthday meal SBP! Everything. Salmon tar tar is better than ice cream!!  Garlic bread with burrata is heavenly. Terrific food, great service, fun atmosphere. That pretty much sums  it up. Our friends made the reservations 2 months earlier, we just tagged along without the hassle. I loved that the atmosphere was so casual, and we never felt rushed. I won't bias you by telling you what we had - its all good! I can say that we didn't order much off the menu but simply grazed our way through the plates that were brought by.The flavor combinations of everything we had was amazing, and reasonably priced. The 4 of us, sat there for 2+ hours, had 2 bottles of wine and split a $300ish tab ($150 each couple) - not bad for this city. I'll be back for sure but I am not one to get up at 4am just to get a table. They do take walk-ins, both for the bar & a few tables. I have heard there are long lines, but when we arrived on a Friday at 8pm, there was none. And the couple ahead of us who asked, were told there was a 30-45 min wait. Absolutely delicious food, but not worth stressing over a reservation. If possible, go at 5:15pm on a weekday for an early dinner. *just go here* #fancydimsumstyle#flavorexplosionWondering what all the hype was about, me and a friend popped over here to drop in our name. Reservations were long but we got a call back about 2 hrs. later. The lovely hostess let us know this was only for an hour so we agreed. I was not prepared for what went in my mouth (yeah yeah make a joke). I had no idea that they had their set menu, then everything else was pseudo dim sum style. Chef created, unique, original, and ever changing. These dishes were brought out in tapas style portions with some of the most vibrant tastes I've had. Dishes ranged from duck liver mousse, beef tongue, salmon tar tar, pork belly, and who knows what else I missed. Everything was incredible, interesting, and worth savoring. Also a fun point, if you're not buying a bottle of wine this place is incredibly reasonable. Go here for the experience, the taste, and all of the above. It is sooo hard to go to a place with so much hype, especially given how hard it is to get a reservation and waiting the two months for it to arrive!  The food here is good, yes.  There's really interesting combinations of ingredients that provide a really fulfilling eating experience (the key is eat slowly).  I love tapas style places because I like to try so many different things, but it is a little disruptive since people come by all the time with different plates of things, and it's sooo hard to hear every ingredient they list.  All the waiters are super nice though and are willing to repeat what items are, etc.  BUT like I said, everything is small plates, but they're priced like entrees!  So while the food is good, it is pricey and hard to justify the price, especially when some dishes are a little mediocre.What was the STANDOUTS that I would go back for?- Tuna avocado and seaweed cracker: my friend said it tasted like a sushi roll, but it's so much better!  crunchy, little salty, creamy, fishy goodness- Smoked trout with crunchy quinoa tabouleh: soooo good, really great flavors and just a great combination of textures too- Smoked sturgeon cream dip with chips: I'm really not sure exactly what was in this, but it was pretty tasty, and I liked that the chips were a harder textureThings that were SOLID:- Guinea hen dumpling: one dumpling with a lemony broth; good taste and texture; understated, but definitely better than usual dumplings.- Garlic bread with burrata: very light garlic, interesting bread texture (it's almost like a cinnamon bun, but not sweet and harder on the outsides; flakey, so there's gotta be butter!), and the burrata looks so creamy, but is so cheesy!- state bird: it's basically fried chicken, tiny pieces with lots of bone, but the lemony/cheesy onions on the bottom really make the dish complete and special- grapefruit curd poppy seed ice cream sandwich macarone with fennel: very light in texture and flavor; definitely an interesting, understated ice cream sandwich that's a little chewy; you can get a half of this one in case you want to try something else!Things I would definitely SKIP:- Pork belly grape salad: way too salty/vinegary, but the grapes taste really good as a comparison.  They gave us fatty pieces and the pork is just really fried and hard- Rabbit and fontina croquette: rabbit was gamey; I just had a tiny bit of one- Chocolate roll cake, sesame mousse, seville orange-clove caramel: a dark chocolate taste; just very sweet and nothing too remarkable for meOverall, a really good dining experience, but I don't know if it's the best food i've ever had.  I don't think I'd go out of my way to go here again, but I'd go back and try new things if I had the chance.Tip for everybody trying to get reservations online, go online at 4 am!!  That's when cancellations go through. Update - online reservations now start at 4am. Good luck! Today was my second visit to SBP, though the first time was well before reservations were hard to get and the line for walk ins wrapped around the corner by opening time.  The expansion definitely opened up greater capacity, and makes the space a lot more functional.  Arriving a little after 5 p.m. on Super Bowl Sunday, there were about 15 people or so in line in front of us, and we got the last two bar seats before the cutoff.  Actually, sitting at the bar next to the kitchen was pretty cool, since you could see preparation and scope out prospective dishes for sampling.  I did wish they had hooks under the bar to hang my coat, since we were on bar stools.We decided not to really order from the menu and just pick the offerings brought around, which were plenty, as we had ordered off the menu more during our first visit.My Favorites of the Night:--Chocolate roll cake with caramel sauce and candied oranges: Chocolate cake was rich and ganache-like in a smooth caramel sauce.  Delicious.--Pork belly: Crispy, flavorful.--Chawanmushi: Beautifully hot, creamy, spicy.--Farro with wild mushrooms: Earthy mushrooms with creamy farro.  BF didn't care for this one as much, but I really love mushrooms.Second Favorites, Still Delicious:--Pork Riblets: Tender, best slathered in its own juice/sauce.--Chips with Fish roe dip: Tasty warm dip.--Rabbit Croquette: A crunchy meaty bite.--Oyster: Lovely, but the spice probably overpowered the flavor of the oyster.Nice, but Could Do Without:--Salmon Tartare: Didn't seem special, but was nice. Crunchy quinoa was the best part.--Garlic Bread Burata: Apparently popular, but not my favorite.  Bread too heavy/greasy--Hamachi Kama: Beautifully plump and glazed, but somehow felt too saucy/salty/strong without some rice to go with it.--Hamachi on seaweed raft: Nice, but hard to eat.  Had to use teamwork to break it apart without launching fish cubes off the plate.--Duck liver mousse with little biscuits: I usually love duck liver mousse, but the little biscuits are a little too small/heavy/greasy.  I would've traded them for some fresh bread.Service was great, especially right by the kitchen where basically everyone is checking on you and asking if you need anything.  It's definitely a casual, fun environment, where the minute you sit down, people are ready to drop plates on your table for you to start eating. I would definitely love to come again if it ever cools down a bit, as I don't have the patience to try to book a reservation at 4 a.m. and don't want to stand in line for an hour before it opens. This is the sensation of san Francisco dining scene, my friend offered to wait for a table at 4:30pm on a Friday.  I thought he would take a number and wait at the bar, wrong !!!! When.I arrived, we both waited in the cold till 17:30 when door opened ... only people who got in with reservation are friends with chef ....the food is really creative.  It is worthwhile waiting for the dim sum carte:we loved the trout taboulis with crisps, pork belly with vietnamese sauce. Fried brussel sprouts with bonito flake, spare ribs, chocolate cake.  I was not so fond of the pancake with duck.  We had so many dishes .... it is a unique experience! I am not even going to try - just go.  Its really that good. So tasty!!! It was a great meal and I will be glad to return one day... If I could ever get a reservation. I had to really spend some time considering how many stars to give this place but finally settled with a solid three. Now before you start the barrage of diatribes, I'd like to first state my case. I, as well as any person in SF not living under a rock, has heard of State Bird Provisions before really even knowing anything about the place. Bon Appétit Magazine even named SBP its Best New Restaurant for 2012. My preconceived notion was that this place simply specialized in poultry, from fried to roasted to the hundred different variations seen from all types of restaurants across America. After dinner tonight, we realized that it couldn't be far from the truth.Without any prior reservations in hand (not that we hadn't tried, it's just the SBP website NEVER HAD ANY RESERVATIONS AVAILABLE!), we arrived to a line about 25 people, at about 15 min. before opening time of 5:30pm. When we finally got to the maitre d', we were told that our table wasn't going to be ready until 2 hours later and was instructed to leave our cell phone number so as to be contacted when table was ready. Thank God we had free parking after 6pm and had Japantown conveniently located adjacent to the SBP. We killed time by sauntering in and around Japantown shops (Nijiya, a bookstore and stationary store). Showing up again at 7:15pm allowed us to sit at around 7:30pm.Walking in, you get a very eclectic, San Francisco chic vibe (does that make sense?). The walls were adorned with vibrantly-colored construction paper cut to different shapes of cooking utensils. A concrete wall was the backdrop of one side of the space, with neatly-framed pictures rustically hung with metal wire. Meals were brought out by various waiters/waitresses in the same fashion as dim sum carts and trays, accompanied by a thorough explanation of ingredients and method used to cook the dish. Dishes varied from $3 - $10, but the key was to know that the majority of the dishes were small appetizer sizes. After reviewing the menu, turns out their signature dish was, in fact, quail, our great state's official bird. I wasn't up to gnoshing on an animal whose taste I wasn't particularly fond of. Instead I opted for inventive dishes never before imagined: Savory:raw oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesame **shiitake, persimmon & quinoa 'tabouleh' **duck liver mousse with almond biscuit ***garlic bread with bur rata *trout roe chip & dip **hamachi-avocado & seaweed cracker **mendocino sea urchin, ginger-scallion pancake with soy-lime glaze **roasted bone marrow with chanterelles & pink peppercorn **wild king salmon tartare with fermented turnips ***Dessert:chocolate roll cake, sesame mousse, seville orange-clove caramel **'world peace' peanut muscovado milk **   don't bother**  average/good enough*** exceptionalAbove said dishes (including a few drinks that were totaled to less than $20) left us with a bill of about $150. Would I go back to SBP with local friends? Probably not. With out-of-town foodies? Sure. But this place is all about hype. Quality of food will not blow your mind. Maybe my expectations are too high. But for a $150 meal between two people on a Wed night after a two-hour wait, not worth it.Thanks for the experience, SBP. It was fun while it lasted. It is nearly impossible to get a reservation here, unless you book way in advance and plan to invite dining companions later. So when my friend asked if I wanted to join a last minute reso, I jumped and said YES!I've been waiting to try State Bird for months, and it did not disappoint. I love the idea of New American/ fusion style dim sum. It lets you try a variety of small plates. They have a set menu that you can order from, and a few rotating carts that go from table to table with a variety of small plates. For a table of four, they recommended starting with 3 or 4 dishes from the menu and grabbing whatever looks good from the carts.DELICIOUS:* CA State Bird - which is a fried quail, in case you didn't know what the state bird of California was. Very juicy and tender. The cheese and onions on top elevated the dish to another level.* Pork Chawanmushi - must get this! I could eat a couple of these by myself.* Guinea Hen Dumpling - I didn't think I would like this, but the broth was very light and refreshing.* Spicy Dungeness Yuba with Kimchi - I honestly don't like crab that much, but this dish was delicious. Spicy yuba noodles with a nice kimchi kick.* Duck Liver Mousse - I love duck liver and this mousse was amazing. I only wish there were more biscuits to eat it with.* Roasted Bone Marrow - this is a must here. The bone marrow simply melts in your mouth and the chanterelle mushrooms on top were great.JUST OKAY:* Brussel Sprouts - These were good, but nothing out of the ordinary.* Salmon Tartare - Just okay. I didn't really enjoy the texture - tasted too mushy for me.* Sea Urchin Pancake - The uni was fresh, but overall the dish felt too rich and heavy.* Garlic Bread and Burrata - Two of my favorite things, but combined? Not so great.* Warm Apricot & Plum Mochi - Sounds like it would taste delicious, but I wasn't a fan. * Poppy-seed Ice Cream Sandwich - Light, creamy ice cream. The service was excellent and overall I really enjoyed SBP. I can't wait to come back here - I just need to find friends who already have reservations! One of the best meals I have ever had. It is hard to compete with the food greats in San Francisco, but State Bird Provisions raises the bar. We got there around 4:30 and got in the already long line and waiting until they opened. When we got to the hostess desk, she told us to come back at 7PM and they would give us a call if it was going to be sooner or when our table was ready.They called right at 10 minutes to 7 and said that we could start to head back.Perfect timing,On to the food. I love the dim sum style. I don't care  that someone is coming around every two minutes to feed me more food. Everything tasted superb.Some favorites included the state bird, the saurkraut and pecorino pancakes, and the rabbit cheese balls. (I don't remember the fancy term, oops)If you have a night to dedicate to this, there are plenty of places to shop and hang out while you wait in the area.As someone who no longer lives close to San Francisco, I constantly regret that I only ate here once.Great service, as well! One of the top 10 meals I've had in my life. We arrived at 6pm as a walk in and were informed the next available table for us was at 8:45. We were anticipating this so ni biggie. They actually called me at 8 and said our table was ready so we strolled over a bit early and were seated promptly. Overall the experience was just fantastic! We ordered 3 items off the menu and then sampled about 10 other provisions as they were passed around the dinning room and explained upon arrival. I could go on and on about each dish but I'll spare you the details.I will say from some of the reviews people rave about the burrata & the state bird and those dishes were good but literally some of the worst of the evening. Im not saying they were bad at all, they were really good but it goes as a testament as to how good all the other food is. Trualy an amazing and memorable experience. I have no hesitation in recommending this place to every single person I come across. The service was superb, the food was fantastic and even the Yuzu Shisho mocktail my friend ordered was unreal. I cant wait to go back and try some of the other nightly ""provisions"" Rarely does a restaurant live up to your expectations but this place is all that and more.  I went with a group of 4 and we tried about 10 dishes and shared them.  The food is made for sharing and I liked being able to try so many things in one visit.  Standouts were the wild mushroom farro spezzato, pork belly grape salad with a little jalapeño kick, CA state bird with provisions and curry rabbit roti with black trumpets and lentil dahl.  Desserts were also great especially the hachiya persimmon-hojicha granita, ginger tapioca and pears.  Not usually my thing but very refreshing after all the flavors in our earlier courses. The most surprising part was that the meal with tip and a glass of wine was about $60 per person.  If it was easier to get in I think I'd eat here once a week I think this is a 3 and half star experience. But I will go back to see if it can be better.I don't know how to review this place. The food was all great. The service was knowledgeable and friendly.But I was there to catch up with people I had not seen in a few years...and it was impossible. The food is all delivered dim sum style so we were interrupted  every two minutes. The music is so loud we couldn't hear the complex descriptions of the food. We said yes to every dish partially because we could hear nothing.I loved the Quail eggs, Sea Urchin Pancake and something with brussel sprouts. Only the pork bellies were meh to me. The Fable wine was a great match. Outstanding dinner. Outstanding service. Outstanding experience. We were three and had lots of plates they were all excellent. Unbelievable flavors. An experience for our palates. It was beyond our expectations. We got a reservation. Thanks to my husband - we didn't have to wait in the line. Based on all the raves - this is a chefs' restaurant, we were so excited to try them out. The concept is great and really well executed. The food were definitely played a lot with texture and flavor. The beef tone, it is the best that I ever had. I enjoyed the smoke trout and pickle beets. Pork belly was ok. Bone mallows and wild marshroom is a bit too salty. The state bird was a let down, and I like quals. It is interesting to have potato chips with fish eggs. I like the duck mouse, but I liked it better with the potato chips instead of the almond cakes. The oyster was excellent, and the grapefruit granita was really refreshing. The two vegetarian dishes were descents for carnivals. The service was really good if they didn't keep tripping on my chair  I was at the end of the middle row. For the quality of food and how much we paid for it, I would give it five stars, if I don't have to wait so badly and were not bothered by people tripping on my chair. Completely over-hyped. 1) You do not need to wake up at 4am to get a reservation for two months later, as some in this thread stated. I walked in at 9:00pm on a Sunday night and there were five empty tables. They were quickly filled within 15 minutes,but  let's not be overdramatic. 2) They do have a unique style for American food, but it is the same exact thing that Chinese dim-sums carts have been doing for decades. Just servers going around offering various small dishes and one cart. 3) The food was quite good, but Michelin-starred? You can definitely make most of the menu at home except the pancakes, that was really unique. I planned a trip to SF a few months back, and my friends and I were really itching to try State Bird. Luckily for me, I live on the East Coast and therefore only had to wake up at 7am, exactly 2 months to the day, before we wanted to eat here. My friends thanked me immensely for not forcing them awake at 4am. We had an 8:30 reservation, but got there quite early so asked the hostess for recommendations for cocktails nearby. She was extremely helpful and friendly, and pointed us in the right direction. Around 8:15 we come back and end up waiting around 30 minutes for our table because apparently they are just sitting on their check. Not cool. Although as other reviewers mentioned, it may have been because they were rushed through their meal? Moral of the story: come later. Our group of 4 decided to bring 2 bottles of our own wine, since the corkage was a decently reasonable $25 per bottle for the first 2 bottles ($35 each for an additional 2 bottles). Coming with a group was also a good decision because we were able to try a lot of things. I am going to spare you the details of everything we ate, but my favorites were:-guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth (order one per person) -trout roe chip & dip (I loved! Luckily for my, my friends did not) -pork belly grape salad-sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancake Definitely try the state bird (fried quail), and the oysters were also delicious. I am pretty open to trying everything once, so we did try the duck pate. Still not my thing and would probably never order again, but you live and you learn. When we first sat down, they definitely seemed to be bringing us our dishes at a very fast pace. However, as we were trying to have a leisurely dinner and really enjoy our food, we often told them to come back a little later. They had no problem doing so, and it made our dinner a lot more enjoyable. At one point we also asked our server if they needed our table, but she said as long as we were still eating, we were welcome to take our time. Also noteworthy, one of the owners was working, and he was more than happy to answer any questions we had. He even came back later and talked to my friend a little more extensively, which really went above and beyond. Overall, the service and food were both impeccable, and I hope to have another chance to dine here in the future! I just came from my dinner that I had made a reservation for  60 days prior.  The dinner was at 9:30 pm.  There is no sign on the door, nor a number.  I knew this in advance so I was able to find it easily.  My dinner partner did not know this and walked around a bit looking for it.  Finally she called me and I met her outside.  Okay, I know the place is trendy, but a number or a name outside the door would be nice.  So, moving on: service seemed a little tired at least for the main server.  My reservation was at 9:30 pm.  I was seated about 9:15 which was nice.  I had a draft which was good and cold.  As soon as my friend was seated before she could even order a glass of wine we were approached by servers bringing by small plates of yummy foods.  I think we ordered about 10 different items, mostly fish.  They were all good and some were great.  Was it the best dinner of my life? No.  The servers were all perky and I felt they were scripted ""You have to try this."" stuff.  Really?  I found it hard to get a smile out of the guy who seemed to be our main server, but the Jake Gyllenhaal lookalike was very personable and we were actually able to get a laugh from him.  I used to be a server so I know there are bad nights.  Oh do I know.  So I forgive the others especially if they are scripted which I think they are.  No bueno.  I just did not think this place is worth the hype, especially in San Francisco.  It is an interesting restaurant that is good to take out-of-towners.  The acoustics were horrible.  I had to yell across the table to my dining partner.  It was decorated like a diner caught in a time warp between the Madmen 50', the cinderblock 60's and a Denny's.  The bill was around $125.00 without tip for two with 2 drafts and 2 glasses of wine and about 10 small plates including two deserts.  It was not expensive and it was an interesting experience but there was way too much scripting of the servers.  I prefer a more original approach such as ""WTF, our specials are, blah, blah, blah."" It is better than ""Hi.  I am Bob Marley and is this your first time here?"" Yo baby, can't you see I have my ""Like a Virgin"" dress on?""....I would go back, but I am not in a hurry. Ok, State Bird doesn't need another five star review that talks about how innovative the food is, how nice the people, how electric the atmosphere yada yada. So I will focus on my experience as a single diner, not by choice, but with only one possible date and time to eat here during my current trip to SF.I arrived at 430 and was about the 8th person in line. That's actually the perfect position because you are standing outside the kitchen window and can watch your food being prepped. The doors opened at 530 and only 15 or so folks had reservations, so many of us outside were seated right away.I wanted to have a seat at the counter where I could watch the food being cooked, and that's what I got. There is less desirable counter seating right inside the door and beyond the waiter's station, so be sure to make a beeline for that kitchen seating for the best seat in the house. I immediately made the mistake a solo diner must not make if you're going to try lots of things: I ordered two carbohydrate laden dishes, duck pate with little honey muffins (I'd seen it being prepped through the window and couldn't resist) and the ""must try"" garlic monkey bread with burrata. Poof, I was full, fifteen minutes in.Of the other three dishes I ordered, the nori cracker with some kind of mollusk was a must-have as was the state bird (the small is a generous portion for one). And there were easily half a dozen items that sailed by which I desperately wanted to try. So I will be back, hopefully with a dining companion.P.S. I am not shy about sharing food with strangers, but my seatmate was a guy who eats there twice a week and had very specific interests, so didn't work this time. I don't review often - not unless I have something to say. This time, I definitely do - this is an open letter to the restaurant owners and their customers. Dear State Bird Owners. Love the food. But have to confirm some of the reviews that I read - we felt rushed. We were a party of six with a reservation for 6 30, and we were precisely on time if not early. Your delicious tapa-style food came out, was explained, and before we could even try it, another dish showed up. Turned out that you had reserved the table for some of your own friends at 8 30, so when it came time (and yes we were at dessert, but still) we were actually asked to free the table. Is it more important to flip a table or to have your customers enjoy their meal? Three stars - food is great but I am not sure that you put your customers first. I will be back when the buzz is gone and you start appreciating us again. Dedicated foodie-Annie D. Waste of time. Arrived at 6:20 on a Sunday night and was told that there were no tables available until 9:30. There was no one else waiting. They specifically indicate that 1/3 of their tables are reserved for walk-ins. I asked why there would be a 3 hour wait if they left 1/3 for walk-ins. I was told that there was a line when they opened at 5:30. Assuming that's true, there was no line now and it doesn't take 4 hours for those folks to eat dinner. It was just BS. Don't waste your time. Hands down the BEST meal of my LIFE.  I lucked out with a 5:30 reservation on a Wednesday night. Showed up at 5:15 and there was a line of people around the block without reservations.  Out of my way, people, I have a reservation :)  Anyway. Was seated right away.  State Bird does have a menu that you can order off of - but the highlight are the special off-the-menu items that are presented to you.  The staff comes to your table, dim sum style, and explains the dish and the ingredients used, the price of the item, and you have the option of saying yes or no.  One of the MOST amazing thing I consumed was the garlic bread with fresh burrata and oregano.  Another 'must order' (from the menu) is the Uni pancake - seriously, so freaking incredible.  These two items in particular have me still dreaming of the next time I can go back to this restaurant again!  The staff comes around to your table - A LOT.  So it is somewhat disruptive if you are in the middle of the conversation. But by the same token, I did not feel rushed or like they were trying to rush us out of the restaurant to accommodate the line of people outside. They are just trying to be attentive and make sure to present everything being offered that night :)  I didn't mind.   Other highlights in terms of the food were the Guinea hen dumpling, pork ribs, oysters, salmon tartare (omg), smoked trout, duck.  SIDE NOTE -- I gave up my vegan ways to fully indulge and immerse myself in everything this restaurant had to offer -- and I am so glad I did! One does not simply eat at State Bird Provisions. (Boromir voice)  It's front door is unassuming to those that walk by. There is a line of hopeful patrons, waiting for the limited walk-in tables.  The cooks are ever busy. It is a gourmand's adventure, filled with savory dishes, wines, peanut milk and desserts to consume. The very bites you take expand your palate beyond belief.  Not as a lone person should you indulge in this. It is delicious. I am still in awe of my two, yes two visits in one week to State Bird Provisions. The first was like a gift from God. I was just perusing the reservation web page late one night and realized they had tables available within an hour. My husband and I rushed down there and within 40 minutes were seated. I'm sure everyone gets it by now that it is excellent food served dim sum style. But what really left an impression on me was the whole atmosphere of the place. Everyone that works there are really, really excited about their food just as much as I am to eat it. They are friendly, high energy people with such a positive vibe.  My husband and I couldn't help ourselves and ended up eating about 15 different dishes. Yes, 15 dishes and each one of them were excellent. So then my friends wanted to go so we tried the wait in line approach. This worked out well also as we were early enough to be able to get a table right away. The wait until they opened was made easier by the staff bringing shots of drinking chocolate for everyone in line. I thought I would be more selective on dishes this time around, but failed miserably (ok, not so miserably). Between the three of us, we had about 17 dishes. Again, so delicious and creative. I now understand and appreciate the hype. Not only do they make wonderful dishes, they make eating out enjoyable. I highly recommend bringing a few friends, but no more than 4 since you need a special reservation for 6-8. You will have a great time dining here. I sure did! Everything I have ever put in my mouth at state bird provisions is above par - most times it blows my mind. . . food and drink.  The folks that work here are all very lovely. This is a quality business through and through. It is hard to get a table. but worth it. ...cuisine!With over 660 reviews and 4.5 stars - SBP does not need another dish by dish review describing various uncommon ingredients and exotic sounding preparation methods. So instead I'll just write my take on the place as simply as i can.First id like to state that hype is almost justified. To clarify - I'll compare it to another highly hyped venue Mission Chinese. The two are different on most aspects, one similarity is the amount, and type of publicity, and accolades they received. In the case of both the reputation is well earned.  However SBP epitomizes ""cuisine"" where as MC is the prime example of (best) ""food"" (ever).  The awesome thing about SBP is that its relatively cheap considering the awards, the ingredients, the variety, the skill and thought that goes into every tiny dish. But - its not really a place where you can ""Get into a dish"". At SBP you TRY things and move on. Its fun - but if you like quantity as much as quality you may not be as satisfied, unless that is -  you're looking for quantity of CHOICES.Finally i'll say that everything was awesome - delicious and interesting ( i was on a mission to find the worst sounding thing on the menu and to find out just how bad (good) it would be - it turned out to be the duck gizzards wrapped in bacon - it was a bit chewy - but otherwise delicious), most memorable was the deep fried quail - most perfect deep fried item i've EVER had.If you haven't been here yet - you owe it yourself to experience this place at least once.USEFUL NOTES:1. There will be a wait, expect 1-2 hours if you have no reservations, we planned for this and just hung out at japantown having drinks and checking out stores; also kabuki theater is an awesome near by place to kill just the right amount of time.2. If you're anything like me your meal will be 40-60$ without drinks (per person).3. This is a cool place to visit - not so hungry as the dishes are small and well priced!4. Service - personable, energetic and knowledgeable.5. Interior/exterior - well put together space, emphasizes the kitchen - we sat at the bar and felt the heat of the ovens - which i love but its probably not for everyone.6. Parking - this is a busy neighborhood that's heavily metered - meters do take credit cards.7. Try the namesake - quail - its one of those ultimate dishes.Other notes:1. great place if you want to establish your foodie cred.2. great place i want to expand your vocabulary of food related words.3. bad destination for comfort food. We'd been sitting on a gift card for over a year.  We have a hard enough time coordinating a babysitter for our toddler, let alone booking reservations months in advance or waiting hours in line.However, one night in November I just so happened to be awake at 4AM (see above re: toddler) and managed to book a coveted Friday night reservation.  When I checked again at 4:05 AM, everything was already gone.Two months later, we arrived-- 20 minutes late for our hard-won reservation!  As we raced down the street, I steeled myself for the inevitable confrontation with the staff at such a popular place.  I needn't have worried.  The hostess greeted us warmly, apologized for giving our table away, and brought us glasses of complimentary champagne while we waited for another.  Every staff member we encountered throughout the night was similarly warm, enthusiastic, and laid-back.The food was uniformly solid.  All of it was inventive.  And some of it was sublime-- in addition to the quail and garlic bread dishes that are much discussed, we absolutely loved a duck ham pancake that we ordered off the menu.  And the desserts were the highlight, especially the chocolate roll cake with sesame mousse.Was it the best meal we ever ate?  No.  Is it over-hyped?  Probably.  But I can totally understand why it is so popular.  The space, the concept, the approach are all sui generis.  In a town where it's easy to take good restaurants for granted, this is truly a great one-- because there's nothing else like it.And as always seems to happen on our long-awaited date nights, who should get seated next to us but a harried-looking couple toting a toddler who did not seem as enthused to be there as the rest of the crowd.  As they awkwardly wedged their stroller through the crowd waiting for a table I saw more than a few eyes roll.But the hostess?  She welcomed them smiling, helped stash away the stroller, brought out a high chair.  We watched every server come up and interact with the baby.  The chef himself stopped by the table several times, even brought out some special child-friendly treats from the kitchen.And this is why this place gets 5 stars in my book.  Arguably the hippest place in town, certainly the hardest to book.  But none of the attitude that usually accompanies such feats.  Rather than trumpeting their exclusivity, they've created an atmosphere that's warm and welcoming, food that's delicious, and an overall experience that's truly memorable. I thought to myself: this is my last chance for a grown up dinner with my husband before the second kid arrives and we stop eating out for a few years. I cannot take chances. If I were to arrive early to snatch a 5:30 table, I need to be there early.  In fact, so prepared and so early that I found myself standing outside the no-sign restaurant alone for a good half an hour before the next wave of people came.  By then, at 4:30, people started to come in large waves. Not everyone is seated at 5:30, of course, even though the newly renovated space allocated about half of the tables for walk-ins.  Some received later times.  The last ones were turned away. Of course, after 90 minutes of wait, I was beyond excited to eat, or mostly just excited to sit. The place is very cute and energetic.  Everyone working there seems so happy.  There is a menu where you can order some dishes, while the rest are being walked around on trays by waiters ---  truly dim sum style.  It's exciting to eye the food coming your way.  The unpredictability ---  will they run out before they reach your table?, makes you almost giddy.  And the selection is overwhelming.  We had to decide what NOT to get --- that's the hard part, when there are so many choices.  Uni pancake-- definitely. Brussel sprouts -- maybe next time.  Some of the highlights were surprises.  Like the rabbit croquette.  And the quinoa with persimmon and shiitake mushroom.  Really really good. Others didn't match the hype.  Like the state bird was tender and juicy but perhaps a little too greasy for us.  And the way they described the mushroom dumplings made it sound like a little spoon of heaven. But I thought it was a bit bland. Our waitress's eyes sparkled talking about the half dozen quail eggs. And they were indeed quite special.  runny yolks, tart apple, creamy mt.tam.  Strange combo but just worked.  And the burrata and bread dish ran out a few times right before reaching our table. so it was nice to finally get it and try the strange concept of garlic knots with savory cheese.  Really good, but came in at a time where our bellies were beyond full. Just like any dim sum restaurants, at a certain point, you need to know when to quit.  So we stopped and split the chocolate dessert, which came out looking like a piece of meatloaf.  Cute and inventive, but I was hoping for something more traditional. Service is obviously fast since there is virtually no wait time between order and eat.  And price is surprisingly affordable.  How many dishes did we get? Can't remember, but we only spent about $100 for two without drinks.  hardly counts as a fancy, special-occasion dinner, right? But the experience was certainly different and memorable, which makes it a great ""last chance for grown up dinner for two"" for me! The cheapest Michelin experience I've had to date. After 13 ""provisions"" and 1 large order of state bird, our total came to $175 (tax and tip included)! The service here is ok, they are eager to introduce the dishes but a little on the slow side in taking away empty ones. Highlights from the menu include: the state bird :) no surprise here, the pork belly with grapes, and the smoked trout. The state bird has a crispy outer skin with a surprisingly moist interior. My favorite ingredient was the beets in the smoked trout but my favorite complete dish was the pork belly. we made a reservation and when we got there two seats happened to open at the bar and that really made a better experience because you get everything fresh out of the kitchen and the chefs are really friendly. for 2 and we were really full after:rabbit croquettes: 4 / 5raw oyster: 4hen dumpling: 3duck liver mousse: 5bacon gizzard: 5garlic bread with burrata: 4.5honey mussels:4 hamachi avocado: 4king salmon tartare: 4.5 pork belly grape salad: 5ice cream sandwich (must get): 5overall it was just a very very enjoyable experience.i dont say this often but this place really lives up to its hype Interesting dim sum style service. The food is different and delicious. If you get in line an hour or two before they open, you can snag a spot without reservations. My thing for 2014 is low expectations. For example, I thought Anchor Man 2 was gonna blow, but lowkey loved it. For another example, I thought Wolf of Wall Street was going to be nasty and way too long and I loved it too. It's a formula. It's setting expectations. On the floor from whence there's nowhere but up to go. So when my girl called to tell me she had State Bird Provisions reservations for this past monday, I was concerned. You can't un-hype a place that's got everybody and their dad talking about it's greatness. I went in expecting to be let down. Alas, I was not.ALL of the food was delicious. I liked everything, but can't stop thinking about the salmon mousse, the pork belly, and the burrata. The desserts were straight sexual (and I don't even like dessert). Further, I'd gone in expecting to hate the atmosphere. I thought I'd be surrounded by stodgy folks actively involved in taking their food too seriously, but I wasn't. The vibe was nice and I felt comfortable snatching dish after dish off the trays as they passed us by. Is it possible to give this place 10 stars? I really don't want to let the cat out of the bag but it's safe to say it's already been out for awhile now. This is definitely my favorite restaurant in San Francisco.Where do I start? The food is amazing and unique. Every time we go there are always new dishes on the menu so you really won't ever get sick of this place. The food is tapa style which is great for me since I do not eat much but love trying out different dishes. Price is extremely reasonable for such exceptional food. I won't go into details about each dish because there are too many to name but our favorites include: the staple state bird of course (fried quail) , pork belly, lobster risotto, hamachi on fried nori, trout, steak tartare and the to die for ice cream sandwiches. The service is beyond excellent. We all know how popular this place is and how hard it is to reserve a table here. Even with their immense popularity they are not snobby or rude as one might except. They are extremely accommodating and willing to make sure everything will work out if you need to change your reservation. Katherine is exceptionally helpful and accommodating. If it was easier to make reservations I would be eating here at least once a week.  San Francisco is known for superb food and culinary excellence but state bird definitely is well deserving of its new One Michelin star and popularity. Omg new favorite restaurant in SF. Amazing food, great service, good prices. Believe the hype. Lives up to the hype.  Have been 3 times now, has really been amazing each time.  Had some sort of quail egg goodness which was out of this world.  They were great to accommodate a group of 8 during the holidays and we loved the service.  It's really a treat.  Highly recommend checking out Fat Angel around the corner if you can't get in. Not one complaint, although I will say, I love the ""starters"" more than the main courses. Will be back as soon as I can get in again! The first thing about State Bird is the wait.  If you have no reservation and are disinclined to wait a potential 2-3+ hours, then stop reading and go somewhere else.  My party dropped our names on the wait list, went to a 2-hour concert at the Independent, walked to Japantown for some snacks, and walked back to State Bird to a 40-minute wait before we were seated.  Was it worth it?  Mostly.The hamachi avocado seaweed is the best item on the menu by far.  One of these is meant for 3-4, but I ate one and a half by myself.  It is one of the best dishes I've ever tried, and if I had a reservation here, I'd come back just for that.  The quail was decent, though a far second to the seaweed.  Everything else was kind of funky (also tried the uni pancake, bone marrow, allagash black, rabbit croquette, pork belly salad).  Among the dessert, the peanut muscovado milk shots were my favorite, while the ICS and caramel tart were decent. Ringing in the new year right!!1.5 hr wait if you don't have reservationsSuggestion-GO EARLY and stand in line (like me)Reservations are only 60 days in advance within 90 mins booked online.Equals-WORTHY!!State Bird Provisions has an innovated style/swag with fresh inventive styles of what us Americans like to call ""Dim Sum"". NO NO NO they are far from pushing carts but with a friendly warm smile and fast service, you will NOT be disappointed.Each day the menu changes, so even then you see my photos the items may not be present. The staff was amazing, and no they don't hustle you into buying their dishes as they go around each table offering eclectic and creative dishes. I was quite impressed and our taste buds were dancing as my party of 4 kept talking about how good our food was. Would I come back? Defiantly! CHEERS and Happy New Year. My friend calls me up saying he was able to get us a reservation for that night and that I'd HAVE to come out! Glad that I did because the food was delish! A bit pricey for tapas and the style reminded me of a dim sum restaurant where they'd go around in a cart. Atmosphere was great and just overall great experience. I still can't believe we were able to get a reservation for that night. Talk about luck! The food was good to great, but the service was disappointing. The staff was in such a hurry to usher us out, they asked us if we wanted our check twice before they had delivered the desserts we ordered (which was truly a delightful dessert).The food is fun, but the personal touch is greatly missing. There are a great many other places to choose from where you can have it all (great food as well as service.) If it's possible to get a reservation here, take it- no matter what time of night it is. This place is basically an American dim-sum restaurant. The waiters/waitresses encourage you to order the smaller size of what's on the menu so you have more options to try. There were carts rolled around with different kinds of plates throughout the whole night and I wanted to eat everything. Some of my favorites include the Red Trout with Kishus, Hazelnut-Garum Brown Butter, CA State Bird with Provisions, Pork Spare Ribs, Tombo Tuna- Avocado and Seaweed Cracker, and for dessert, the Coffee Toffee 'Ice Cream' Sandwich with dates, ginger fudge. I guess the list is more than a few. Everything was delicious and it was definitely a treat to come here :) For the wait and the elongated reservation, State Bird surely did not disappoint. The bf and I actually attempted coming here a little before 5:30pm on my birthday with the hopes of scoring a table, but failed miserably. By the time we parked, which was roughly around 5:18pm, the line was already ridiculously long. Not knowing the normal protocol, we thought the line was moving rather quickly and that we were going to actually get a spot, but little did we know, by the time we reached the host, we were informed that they were all sold out until 11pm and will take down our name and number if anyone cancels for the night (but of course, the waitlist before us was massive as well). Bummed, we searched for another restaurant and enjoyed my bday meal elsewhere but swore to come back another day to try again. Luckily, we knew someone with a reservation a few days after that they could not make, so we took it!Let me tell you, even with a reservation in hand, we waited a good 30 min for the tables to pay and be entirely cleared. (Note: we actually arrived an hour earlier than our reservation but they would not seat us until our reservation time.) After sitting, we were informed that we were suggested to order a few items from the menu but around 12 items were dim-sum style and will be presented to us on carts all throughout dinner. Being too excited and mostly too hungry, we ordered the CA State Bird w/ Provisions  (half), Cumin Lamb & Baby Octopus, Duck Ham-Pecan Pancake, and the Curry Rabbit Roti. From the carts being pushed around, we tried a fish egg w/potato chips dish, salmon tartare w/ cucumber, one dumpling ( I forgot what was inside), a rabbit croquette ball, and a pork belly & grapes concoction dish. Since the menu changes so often, you probably will not see any of these items again, but honestly, they were all delicious and unique in their own ways. As long as the dish is filled with ingredients you like, dont hesitate to try it and be mind-blown!My favorite from the entire dinner was definitely the salmon tartare and the curry rabit roti. These two plates were at out-of-this-worth level of amazing. We also ended with the Buckwheat Bao for dessert, which was filled with Coconut Cream & Carrot Jam, and honestly, I am so glad that the waitress took a good 5 minutes trying to talk us into getting it. I am a dessert junky, but I was seriously so full that I was about to blow. Best decision EVER.All I say is, State Bird was amazing so get your reservations in early or be prepared to show up at 3pm to avoid the long line and guarantee your spots for that night! Favorite spot in SF, hands down. For my 100th review this year, I'm going to give a rundown of SBP. We decided to celebrate New Year's Eve a day early and go out for a ""fancy"" meal. The place is casual and we layered up with our coats and hats in preparation of a long wait. We found street parking on the other side of the grocery store. At a little before 4 PM, we were the 10th and 11th people in line! There is no sign marking the place, but it's obvious when you see the line. If you get there early, you can watch them prepping the food in the window.Doors open at 5:30 PM and those with reservations go in first. Then, whatever seats are left get handed out. If you don't get a seat, they will put your name on a waiting list with approximate time a seat will be available. We sat at the chef's table, which was a lot of fun. Everyone working here is super friendly.Food is served tapas/dim sum style, in tiny bites. You can also order larger bites. We started with oysters with a bit of chili oil and kohlrabi slaw. I don't like oysters, but I slurped these up. Next were the guinea hen dumplings in preserved lemon broth. A very tasty bite, but the broth made all the difference. You can definitely taste citrus notes. The duck liver mousse with almond cakes was exquisite. Nice blend of sweet and savory. A rabbit confit croquette with melted fontina-style cheese filling came out piping hot. It was only one crunchy bite, but delicious. However, there was a tiny bone in mine that ruined the moment!One of the highlights was the wild mushroom farro with preserved egg yolk and ricotta in broth. So delicious and creamy, yet delicate at the same time. This one wasn't over-the-top savory, just understated earthy flavors. Fried pork belly with grapes and spicy peppers was melt-in-your-mouth tender. Can't have too much of this stuff, since it's so fatty. Grapes were a thoughtful addition to provide contrast.We ordered a ""commandable"" pan fried red trout with kishus and hazelnut garum brown butter. Many of these were available in a half-portion. Fish was perfectly cooked to a silky consistency. The skin was lightly crisped. You could smell the aromatics wafting from the melted butter. Toasted hazelnuts were a nice, unexpected twist. Loved it!When the seafood cart came around, we had a great debate, but ended up getting beets with smoked trout mousse and salmon tartare with cucumber spears topped with quinoa/furikake-like mixture. The beets were superb, quite possibly the most scrumptious thing we've tasted all evening long. They were tender without any dirt-like flavor beets are known for. The mousse was rich and savory, smoky without being overwhelming. Wow. Capers and oil gave it another layer of complexity. Every taste bud was activated with this dish. DH liked how the chefs played with texture as well as flavor. The salmon dish used fresh ingredients, but I would have preferred it without so much crunch.We were already quite full, but DH insisted on ordering the hamachi crudo on a crispy nori chip. Wow, this one was truly special and looked like a work of art. Who would have thought that radishes would play well with hamachi? The sauces were delicious and the nori chip was crunchy and full of savory goodness. The chef sitting in front of us said it was ""one of their top 5"". Be sure to order one!Finally, their desserts are also available in half-portions, except for the buckwheat bao. We got the bergamot granita with yogurt tapioca, and honey-coriander syrup. It had some tangerine slices in it. Experience was reminiscent of Asian ice slush desserts, but this was on an entirely different level. I loved the subtle, woodsy herb scents with the sour notes of the citrus. Excellent.The coffee toffee ice cream sandwich with dates and ginger fudge was also delicious. The crust was slightly chewy, with flavors resembling a snickerdoodle cookie, but much denser. I wished I could eat more than 1 slice. I couldn't identify the other flavors (date or fudge), but I didn't care at that point.Overall, an excellent place for some new American style dining, and quite affordable for the the quality/uniqueness of the food. Total came up to about $50/head after tax and tips, no booze. Wait time was 1.5 hours. Service was friendly and efficient. Only gripe was that we couldn't try everything! Well...maybe next time. After waiting in line at 5 pm on Sunday, we finally made it into the restaurant at 9:30 (we went home and came back...). My highlights were the burrata garlic bread, the state bird, the scallion pancake with uni, and the rabbit. We had a lobster salsa that was disappointing, and a couple of porridge dishes that I probably wouldn't get again. The desserts were fantastic, especially the oolong ice cream sandwich!I thought prices were reasonable and service was solid. It also lived up to its hype, which is often hard to do. However, to answer your question: No, I would not wait that long again. The food was good, but not that good. I would wait one hour max! We decided to brave the line at State Bird and see if we could get a table for four.The doors open at 5:30 so we arrived at 4:30 thinking we would be among the first ones. Not so, there were already 30 people ahead of us.Around 5, they brought hot chocolate to everyone in line. Nice touch.When it was our turn to check in, they said we could get a table around 7:30 and got our phone number in case it was sooner.We headed to a wine bar nearby and had a drink while we waited.They called us at 7:00 and said 10 minutes.. That gave us time to pay and walk back.We got seated right away and started the feast.I am not sure if I'll remember everything but here are the highlights:Beets with smoked trout cream: Some creme fraiche with slightly smoked fish roe served on potato chips. Beef tongueOysters (served by piece)duck liver mousse with mini almond muffinscrab with kimchee yubascallion pancakes with uni.state bird with provisions (fried quail)coffee ice cream sandwiches.Everything was really tasty, my favorite was the beets with trout cream.Service is friendly.Corkage fee is 25.00Prices are really reasonable.I am not a fan of standing in line. I particularly think that no food on earth is delicious enough for a 3 hour wait. That said, if State Bird was near my house and didn't have a line, I would go there every day. I've now been twice, once with hubby and once with my sister, both times surprising and delicious.  I was unable to get any reservation at all online, so hubs and I arrived at 4pm, and were the fifth party in line. In the 15 minutes after we arrived, the line actually had gotten pretty long, so I'm glad we didn't come much later.  We sat at the chef's table (aka, the counter), which is fun for watching the preparations. Most recommended bites: 1) pork belly with jalapeno and chiles. I don't even like pork belly (usually greasy and fatty), but this was amazing. 2) Yuba noodles with kim chee and smoked egg and dungeness crab--I couldn't get enough of this taste, and again, these are not flavors I usually would choose, but they worked together in an unexpected and awesome way. 3) State Bird Provisions--amazing fried quail. Don't miss it. 4) Dumpling in soup--sounds simple, and it is, but also amazing. 5) ice cream sandwich dessert.If you want to go, and don't have a reservation, just bring a book, come at 4, and enjoy! Was able to snag a reservation when they reopened and had all 60 days of service become available at once.The dining style is definitely unique. It allows you to try many dishes, and keeps the excitement going because you don't know what's coming out next. It's been too long that I don't remember all the dishes, but the garlic bread burrata, pork belly , and coconut bao still stick out. With two beers for me and two glasses of wine for my wife (and at least 10 dishes), the total (after tip) was $175. Definitely an expensive night out for us but it was worth the food and experience.The only reason I'm deducting one star is towards the end of the meal I was interested in seeing what else there was to eat. Several repeats had already come by, but around 8:30 (the restaurant closes at 9) the carts seemed to stop coming by, and they were just trying to sell what they already had made. I guess it makes sense, but it was disappointing that the kitchen stopped producing new dishes before closing, while people were still actively eating. I've been trying to eat at State Bird Provisions for months now but haven't been able to get a reservation. On a Friday afternoon, I stood in line starting at 4:40 p.m. and was about 25th in line (the restaurant opens at 5:30 p.m.). When I got to the front, we were lucky to get a spot at the chef's table at 7:30 - the people in front and behind us were only able to get tables at 9:30. I love small plates and sharing - great to have lots of different tastes and flavors. And these plates are small enough so that you can try a bunch of different things. We got the pork belly, head cheese, beets and trout, garlic bread with burrata, dumpling with broth, trout roe with potato chip, state bird (with provisions), rabbit curry roti, dungeness crab with kimchi yuba, pork riblets, coffee ice cream sandwich and the granita. My favorites were the trout roe, garlic bread with burrata, rabbit curry roti and state bird - the rabbit curry roti in particular. So tasty!The plates are pretty reasonably priced so, as my friend said, you can eat your face off!All of the waitstaff were incredibly nice and helpful and provided great recommendations. We couldn't decide on dessert, so we had a half order of each. We didn't know that half orders were available but when we asked the waiter for a recommendation, he let us know that we could get a little of both! And even with the long wait and lots of people, the hostess was so nice and friendly. Reservations are taken 2 months in advance and you kinda have to be awake at 4am  to lock that ish down. Michelin and James Beard and Yelp-approved, there was a LOT of anticipation going into this dinner.We did a double date for maximum dish-tasting capacity. We ordered a few things from the menu and just snagged cart dishes that looked good as they went by. The menu items -- sauerkraut pancake, sea urchin pancake, were super good. They're not really pancakes but I guess how else would you describe them? Savory dough vessels for delicious toppings. The state bird was like an interesting fried chicken. Bone marrow and cumin lamb dishes were super rich and satisfying but not altogether very unique in flavor.I think we also had the cauliflower salad but it was pretty forgettable.. we def had a forgettable cauliflower something, maybe from the cart. The guinea hen dumplings were whatever too, from the cart. Pork riblets were pretty good. The garlic bread with burrata, amazing. Oysters were nice.For dessert we had the coffee toffee ice cream and buckwheat coconut bao.. not a huge fan of either tbh, thought they were just okay. I wouldn't have ordered any of the desserts except we didn't think we'd come back to try it another time.I really wanted to like this place more! Considering the hype.. and the wait.. and the like $300 bill. There are better spots int he city. Had the opportunity to eat here a few weeks ago, post-remodel. Reservations were a little painful to get, but was able to secure a spot for two on Sunday evening.I'm more of a filmore deli + zeitgeist kind of guy, but happened into a sizable gift card after speaking at a conference in town. I'd heard the hype about the place for a while, and expected that the $100 gift card wouldn't go far, but the portions were surprisingly meager for the price. The food was definitely interesting, but left unfilled and more confused than satisfied. In the end I was longing for an egg sandwich of sizable portions.All that said, an interesting experience. Where else can you have a foam made of duck marrow atop a single rib braised with a truffle from the moon? Spot on everytime, loving this place more every time I go, staff is so friendly and food is amazing if you have not tried this new addition t o SF your missing out, the only dish I have tried that  ididnt like was the liver mouse but everything else was amazing. Wow!!!! Totally blown away by this place it's completely all the hype it's built up to be and thensome. After hearing many ppl rave about how amazing this place was I jumped at the chance when my sister had an open reservation. It was a randoms Tuesday night at 8:30pm and of course it was still packed. I overheard that a walk-in had about a 45 min wait and the girl up from was super cute and pleasant. The restaurant was also really cutely decorated and so unassuming from the outside you'd never be able to tell this is THE restaurant in SF.Everything we are was just amazing I think it's hard to even go wrong. The thing I like about the place that I learned there was it was mainly small plates, dim sum style where a cart literally comes around with small plates then on top of that there's a menu with staple items. We were in love with this crunchy quinoa that came out on a cart seriously EPIC. Then we had this hamachi style tostada that I believe is a staple soooo good! The sort of cheese bread with buratta was out of this world! It was so delicious almost unheard of taste! We had a steak tartare equally amazing and some seafood dishes everything tasted extremely fresh and so original. You could easily taste every ingredient! We split a bottle of wine as all between about 5 of us. For dessert, we had this coconut bao our waiter came by and said it was he last one - so nice of him! It was heaven paired with this cream and fruit compote wow!!! We also had the chocolate ganache on the menu and it was equally out of this world!For 5 of us, we ended up spending about $50 per person not bad considering we kept ordering. That's the issue you can just keep going especially being small plates!Overall OMG amazing! Must try in SF! The Big Table.This is seriously the only way to do State Bird.Why? Let me tell you!1: You have to call or email; it doesn't use the online reservation system. This means you're not fighting all the people with bots, and it's actually possible to get one.2: You get to eat pretty much everything!  We had (I think) 4 courses, and each course consisted of between 4-6 different items, each made with enough for all of us. It was fantastic.The best things we had were spectacular; the worst things were still quite good.The wine list is on the somewhat more expensive side, and I'd recommend the whites over the reds generally; most of the reds are too young (and taste it). By and large, the whites will match the food equally as well, if not better, too.Can't wait to go back! We stopped to grab a drink and glad we did. The deviled eggs were ridiculously good, with a little dab of relish on top. Also tried the meat platter. All the meats were great and the stone ground mustard served along side was perfect. The chef was making rounds and meeting everyone, which was a very nice touch. After spending weeks watching for reservations to appear online to no avail, I decided to try my luck as a walk up.  I got in line 90 min before they opened on a Sunday and had only one party in front of me. Being this close to the front of the line meant that I had my pick of being directly seated at 5:30 when they opened, or of choosing a time later in the evening to come back. I asked for two people at 7:15. Word to the wise, come here with 4 people (or more) if possible. You will have a better experience if there are more bellies to share the small plates. For the service: We were at first confused, that it appears you don't have an assigned waiter, but we quickly realized any of the staff coming by with plates was happy to take our orders for drinks or menu items. This struck me as much more efficient. Our orders arrived very quickly and we never felt like we needed to flag anyone down. Since the small plates and cart came around so frequently, we felt showered with attention so I rate service as excellent. For the drinks: they make their own sodas and I thought the rootbeer was very tasty. The wine list is reasonably priced and contained a good variety. They have a good selection of hot tea and they serve blue bottle French press coffee in regular or decaf. For the food: we ordered 3 items from the regular menu and tried 6 of the small plates that came around. My favorite thing was the pork belly/grape salad. The pork belly was cooked perfectly to melt and disappear in your mouth without being chewy, yet it was very juicy and flavorful. The pork belly was juicier than the grapes, and the flavors married well. The ""state bird with provisions"" was good enough that I ordered a second serving to go. For the record it was still amazing when eaten the next day, cold and directly from the box. The veggie and fish dishes all had such unique spice blends and had beautiful presentations. The ONLY dish that was even mildly disappointing was the curry lamb/octopus because the octopus was more chewy than typical, and this one minor disappointment was easy to forget since EVERYTHING else was spot on. For the dessert: we ordered the ice cream sandwich and the grapefruit tapioca plus two shots of peanut milk. Both were wonderful, though, for a dessert the grapefruit tapioca was not very sweet and even slightly bitter. The ginger-fudge sauce on the ice cream sandwich is thick and has a perfect and subtle amount of ginger. The peanut milk shots were fun and unique, but a bit heavy after all that other food.  The duck liver mousse was served with sweet almond mini-muffins and it is a perfect blend of fatty, sweet and savory. Yes the food was good but No totally did not live up to the hype.  I was so excited when a friend had an extra seat at her table given how hard it is to get a reservation at this place.  We had TONS of different plates and, I can honestly say, the only dish that  I did not want to try was my favorite dish of the night: beef tongue.  I had never had it before and definitely enjoyed how tender the meat was.I'll disclose that I cannot stand it when a restaurant places on the menu that they have a surcharge to comply with Healthy SF.  Honestly, I would expect that at a tacqueria but not at a place like state bird provisions.  I find it totally tacky.  I mean what do they think people are going to do, leave because of a $1.50 charge at the end?  They should just factor that into the already overpriced menu and leave it at that.  I thought the staff was generally nice, a bit pretentious but I would expect that from a place like this.  Also, kind of sad that there was absolutely NO diversity but, again, not surprising.In the end, I was stuffed and enjoyed my food.  Probably will only go back unless the partner really really wants to go. I usually don't hit up restaurants this classy but I decided to jump out of my comfort zone a little with this pick. Knowing that I won't be coming back here for a long, long time, I went all out with ordering. And, I gotta say that State Bird truly delivers on both taste and texture in their dishes. Speaking of, this is my breakdown for each dish I tasted:- Smoked trout. Nice creamy puree with bite-size chunks of pickled beets, capers and onions. I liked it but it tasted a bit average for this quality of a restaurant. - State bird w/ provisions. Great buttermilk crust with cheese and onions. Quail was so tender and juicy also, a difficult technical feat, I know. The little bit of citrus gave it a nice kick, too. Not my favorite dish, though. I enjoyed but wasn't blown away by it.- Uni pancake. It really blew away my previous conceptions of uni. To me, it had always been soggy and grainy. This pancake topped with uni was at the same time crispy yet creamy. That uni was fresh, my friends. Sadly, the pancake itself was too small to warrant the 14 dollar price tag, IMO. - Steak tartare. Definitely an above average steak tartare. Bright and light on top of lettuce cups with some nice aioli on the side. The only thing that distracted me from the flavor were the croutons. I felt they were unnecessary and tough. I understand the need for a balance in texture but I felt the lettuce and toppings were more than enough to cover that.- Salmon tartare. Disappointing. My least favorite. This dish tasted like I could have made it. Fresh and tasty but not too inventive.- Guinea Hen Dumpling. A decent dumpling but I can't understand why the guinea hen made any difference in the filling. I thought the skin and the broth made more sense.- Garlic bread with burrata. Oh man, definitely my favorite savory dish here. I literally wanted to get another one just so I could eat it all by myself. The melted cheese on top of great bread, oh good god. It was like eating my dreams.- Pork belly. Awesome belly meat with super delicious broth. The grapes really tied the dish together, though, giving it that extra level of class. My second favorite savory dish.- Ice cream sandwich. We got the coffee toffee. Best decision in my life. This is hands down the best dish of the night and possibly the best ice cream sandwich I will ever eat. The ice cream was light but not watery with just the right amount of creamy. The sandwich was soft yet didn't fall apart. The ginger fudge, the toffee and the dates? Perfect toppings to an already great sandwich. I seriously cannot get enough of it and am so sad that the night is over. Otherwise? I'd probably go broke ordering more of these.Major drawbacks of the night: Waited a long time for my table to be prepared but the service when we sat down was great and we got to try some complimentary wine/rabbit meatball (which incidentally was also amazingly tender and juicy) in the meantime. The small waiting area was a little cramped as well, which is not to say the entire area is cramped. The actual space was quite nice and cozy. Overall, I definitely hope to come back here someday and hope they keep up the good work. Just like any hot restaurant, it's hard to get in. But once you do, you're taken by the little surprises as each tray gets presented to your table. The true challenge is being able to say no to some of those dishes because they ALL look so good. And they are, there may have been a dish or two that fell a bit short but that's part of the experience, you just have to try. I wouldn't miss out on the bone marrow, that sealed the night and left a savory memory to this day, along with other ones. Quick tip: apparently you have to line up before open and they book their seats first come first reserved style but if you come around 10pm (I know, late) then you may get seated as walk in, maybe. Good luck. Ugh....I've really been dreading writing a review of my experience at State Bird Provisions because of how long it will probably be. While I must admit this restaurant offers a fresh taste on Californian cuisine and prepares a lot of dishes well, there are a few things that fall short and don't live up to the legendary elite status this restaurant now owns. I loved how the restaurant comes around in a ""dim sum"" style and offers food at table side. I further appreciate how the price of everything was listed alongside the dishes so I was always aware what my running total was. My partner and I ordered only a couple things off the  paper menu and then sampled everything off the carts. Disappointments: burrata garlic bread; there was not enough garlic and the burrata was cold. Can we also talk about the state bird aka the take out from KFC with a few onions reluctantly tossed on the quails back? The eggnog ice cream sandwich; please discontinue this item as it tasted like freezer burn.Things I loved: shiitake, persimmon & quinoa 'tabouleh' , oysters with spicy kraut, the chips served with the tartare (the tartare itself was average at best) and corn muffins and liver mousse, The wine pours are incredibly prudish but at least the waitstaff are polite and friendly. I'm excited I got to try State Bird and maybe I'll come back at some point but for now I'm all set. This place is as great as the rumors say it is.  My husband and I absolutely LOVED our dinner experience here.  I would recommend getting one or two of the pancakes (the mendocino sea urchin, ginger-scallion pancake with soy-lime glaze was soooo good) and commandables (must try their CA state bird with provisions - the large size was a good amount for the two of us), and saving space in your belly for the provisions (what they pass around on the carts).  A few of our favorites were the raw oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesame, garlic bread with burrata, guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth (my husband's favorite), and the hamachi-avocado & seaweed cracker (this was my favorite).  Also, the 'world peace' peanut muscovado milk was a wonderful way to finish our meal.  In addition, the service was superb.  While they were super busy, we didn't feel rushed at all.  We really got to sit there and enjoy our meal, wine, and the atmosphere without being disturbed or rushed.  Finally, we thought it was a nice touch that the owner and staff took the time to greet the customers on our way in, and thank us and say goodbye on our way out.  Excellent food and wonderful service.  It does not get better than that! To celebrate a semester well done, my teammates and I decided that we were going to splurge and spend an evening at State Bird Provisions. We emailed the restaurant in September asking for a reservation for 5 people in December, so you can see what kind of planning goes into securing a spot for a large-ish group. We arrived for our reservation and were seated immediately. Waiting for us on our table was our fixed menu for the evening. I asked our server if we could order other items off the menu because I really love their peking duck and I saw that it wasn't one of the fixed items. She said it was possible, but cautioned us to wait and see how  much food was coming, which I really appreciated later when we were stuffed to the gills and could barely walk out on our own two feet.We started our celebration off with a delicious bottle of Prosecco. As each item of food was delivered to our table the servers gave a description. We were happy to find that each of the dishes had enough food for each person to have one serving. The restaurant has its portioning down to a science!We brought two bottles of wine with us, but I regret that we didn't really think very closely on the type wine we should have brought. The food at State Bird is very light and delicate. I would recommend bringing a really delicious pinot noir. We brought an oaky cab and zin and neither was a great match for the food.The best part about coming and having a prefixed menu was that we didn't have to make any decisions all night. We spent our time talking and laughing and enjoying the food that we were experiencing together. Our reservation clearly stated that we would only have the table for two hours, but we were having so much fun the time flew by and before we knew it we have been there for 2.5 hours! The staff was super friendly the whole time and never mentioned that we needed to leave or made us feel rushed. Here is our menu with some short notes about each item...FIRST COURSE- raw oyster with spicy kohlrabi krant & sesame (delicious and fresh)- hamachi-avocado & seaweed cracker (super tasty and left us wanting more)- smoked trout 'creamed' beets (so good we were literally licking the serving dish clean)- duck liver mousse with almond biscuit (I don't usually like duck liver mousse, but this was excellent!)- sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancakes (yum! especially with the dipping salt)rabbit & fontina croquettes (very savory and tasty)SECOND COURSE- garlic bread with burrata (delicious and the bread is very fluffy)- shiitake, persimmon & quinoa 'tabouleh' (we loved all the different textures in this one!)- pork belly grape salad (I thought that the sauce was a bit heavy on the fish sauce)- spicy fried cauliflower salad, bayley hazen blue cheese & fermented green tomatoes (super tasty and flavorful!)- 1/2 dozen cast iron quail eggs, apple, sunchokes & mt. tam (I thought that this one was a little bland for me)THIRD COURSE- CA state bird with provisions (perfectly crispy and tasty)- wild mushroom farro spezzato (it was good, but didn't stand out)- red trout, mandarin, hazelnut-garum brown butter (good, but not as good as other dishes)- spicy dungeness crab kimchi yuba with smoked egg (very flavorful and tasty)DESSERT- 'world peace' peanut muscovado milk (tasted like drinking a snickers in a good way)- eggnog icecream sandwich, almond macaroon (so delicious!!)- bittersweet chocolate ganache tart, brown sugar-oat crust, olive oil (great if you love chocolate) I managed to snag rezzies at State Bird Provisions for me and my mommy's milestone birthdays (actual milestones not to be revealed)!  Our server, Jess, and her crew provided impeccable service.  For those in the know, you already know State Bird Provisions' dishes are served in small portions, like dim sum or tapas.  When you have a big group reservation (we had 7 people), they have four ""courses,"" each course consisting of 3-5 dishes.Overall, I would say that State Bird Provisions does a fabulous job of making ""healthy"" foods taste delicious!  For example, I usually hate quinoa and cauliflower, but their quinoa and cauliflower dishes were amongst my favorites!  These were the highlights of our meal:* shiitake, persimmon & quinoa 'tabouleh' (we couldn't figure out what the crunchy element was, maybe toasted quinoa, but whatever it was, it really made the dish!)* spicy fried cauliflower salad, bayley hazen blue cheese & fermented green tomatoes (spicing up the cauliflower makes it delicious)* duck liver mousse with almond biscuit* pork belly grape salad (the pork belly was deep fried and heavenly)* sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta* spicy dungeness crab kimchi yuba with smoked egg (they don't numb the heat, it was actually a tongue stimulating spicy!)* eggnog ice cream sandwich (fluffy, not-too-sweet goodness)I can't wait for the next excuse to dine there again! Can I say, the 2 month wait for it to open and get our reservations in was totally worth the wait!  Had the glorious tasting menu and everything was wonderful. Although I still dream about the hamachi with seaweed cracker. Damn that was soooo gooood!!The service was great. Easy and casual, friendly and fun. We were a very happy party of six especially getting there with a line of almost 80 people waiting to get  a table. Phew!  Thank goodness for reservations!  Love love love this place! I visited SF with my fiancé on a culinary adventure and found this hidden gem that have been on our 'to dine' list. Below are the small plates we ordered. Pure goodness:*Quail w/ stewed lemon onions &      parmigiano-reggiano *Braised pork riblets in pork broth *Mendocino sea urchin, ginger & scallion pancake w/ soy-lime glazed*Duck liver mousse w/ almond biscuits *Guinea hen dumpling w/ aromatic star anise broth*Green garlic toast & burrata cheese *Oysters w/ spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesame *Eggnog ice scream sammie w/ almond macaron & cocoa-sherry coulis paired w/ a shot of 'world peace' peanut moscovado milk Just ok:*Tuna tartare w/ porcini infused cream and chips*Maine oyster w/ glazed onion strings *Roasted beets w/ special creamy sauce Super innovative cuisine. Unique eats that utilizes the dim sum concept. Everything was well balanced, from textures to spices to portions! I enjoyed the very casual/hipster ambiance. This is not a typical fine-dining experience. Photos and reviews cannot do this restaurant justice. This place does lived up to the hype & definitely one of the best in SF! Make reservation if you can. If not, expect to wait at least 1-2 hours to dine. It's worth the wait. Thank you for the scrumptious culinary experience! I highly recommend this establishment to everyone. was finally able to secure a reservation once they reopened after remodeling!the service here was wonderful! everyone was super friendly and you were able to ask anyone for help, instead of trying to wave down your one assigned person. i liked the idea of ""american dimsum"" it's always good to have a visual of what you can order. as far as the food goes, some were pretty good and some, sadly, disappointedoysters - forgot what was on top aside from sesame seed but it was too sourlobster salad - one of my favorites of the night, fresh and deliciousgrilled octopus - really liked the octopus but not a big fan of chickpeasrabbit croquettes - lots of flavor in a small little bite. just wish it was bigger or we got more thatn just one per order to be worth the $$state bird - i love quail so this dish was another one of my favorites! crispy on the outside and juicy inside, but i think $16 for two pieces is too priceyhamachi on nori chip - aside from the chip being too salty, i LOVED the hamachi and avocado moussebone marrow - i was really excited for this dish because im a big fan of bone marrow, but unfortunately the peppercorn ruined it for me and i felt like there was more toppings than the actual bone marrow itself.rabbit stew - did not like this one at all. had a weird taste to itcrispy pork belly - it wasn't really crispy but i liked how it wasn't toooooo fatty and serving it with a side of grapes was interestingly good!guinea hen dumpling - tasted like any other dumpling for me, and $3ish for ONE piece?!garlic bread with burrata - i loved the burrata but i don't think it really works with the bread and the bread itself wasn't very garlickyalmond macaron with egg nog ice cream - the almond flavor was overpowered the ice cream so it just really tasted like vanilla ice cream to me.overall it was a fun dining experience but since i only really liked about half of the things ive tried, foodwise overall was A-OK. im glad i came in with a reservation prior and did not wait hours for it. id recommend it for the novelty of it, but for me, it'll just be one-time visit. Good food, good service, good timesWas lucky enough to score a reservation for State Birds ""fairly"" easily and came with a group of 4. Tip: Ended up checking for reservations a few times a day when walking to meetings and such and was able to score one after the second or third day. Our reservation was for 5:30, right when they open, and the line was more than 25 deep by the time we arrived. We were sat promptly and greeted by the nice server. I love the dim-sum style of dining, lots of fun small plates, and you get to see them before ordering! While our dinner dates were a little less adventurous, we pushed them to try a few different things, we ended up ordering: * State Bird with provisions (menu) - crispy and tasty * Pancakes with sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta (menu) - doughy, yummy, unique * Hamachi avocado and seaweed cracker - one of my favorites of the night, fresh fish, crispy seaweed cracker and flavorful sauces* Charred octopus in tomato-chickpea broth - perfectly cooked octopus * Duck liver mousse with almond biscuits - velvety rich mousse with lightly sweetened biscuits * Dumpling with aromatic broth - dumping shot, nice and light* Garlic bread with burrata - was looking forward to this but the bread was a bit tough* Pork ribs - tender and flavorful, the guys loved these * Pork belly - crispy chunks of pork belly with jalapeños and grapes, yum* Lobster salad - fresh a light* Braised rabbit- another favorite of the night, tender pieces of rabbit cooked to perfection * Dungeness crab and faro spezzato - rich, another favorite for the guys * Tea ice cream sandwiches - unique dessert, not too sweetOur server was great, very informative, without being pretentious, and was always happy to answer our questions. While there were only a few great dishes, they were all good. Would definitely come back once the menu changes up a bit. Very interesting and fun concept of serving and entertaining of patrons.Prices were reasonable for the whole concept.For people who appreciate adventurous and diversity in a fusion of taste. Staffs were All enjoying and having fun.Owner is friendly and genuine, took time to introduce the concept and style of cuisine.The only downside is, we waited for about two hours plus, ( cause we didn't make reservations ...) Best food experience in the city, hands down! Very reasonably priced, especially for a Michelin starred restaurant! Amazingly, this place lived up to the hype. The food was so incredible I literally ate myself sick. But it was worth it. I went here last night with a friend. Starting with the hostess to our waitress, everyone was really friendly and warm. That is exactly as it should be. The decor is a little odd- like your dad's basement workshop on one side, but it was open and clean and I was there for the food and company. Had I been on a date, however, maybe I would have cared more.  Now, let's talk food. It was tasty, but it was not very exciting for me. I'm vegetarian so this reduced what I can eat, but my friend reported a similar ""ah, pretty good"" sentiment and she ate through every meat and seafood item she could. I've had a couple amazing meals recently, so I have been reminded of what truly excellent food and I had high expectations. This fell short. Finally, the dim sum style has pluses and minuses. For my friend and I it was fine, but remember it's disruptive- every few minutes someone stops by to describe dishes. If you're looking for a quiet dinner date or the ability to catch up with your friend uninterrupted, this isn't the place. I consider this to be the best food and overall restaurant in San Francisco right now. I would eat here weekly if getting a reservation wasnt impossible. The newly renovated space feels much more open and the ambiance is always lively regardless of the time or night of the week. Absolutely have to get: Pork Belly, Sturgeon Pancakes, Rabbit Croquettes, Garlic Bread with Burrata and the Spareribs. You also have to get the State Bird because it's their signature dish but I thought it was less memorable than many of the other items. For dessert I would say definitely try the ice cream sandwich and the Bao with coconut cream. Wine list is quite short so I would suggest bringing in your own bottle for a reasonable corkage of $20. Definitely lives up to the hype! Loved loved this place.My friend called in the morning and suggested we go there that night (it was Friday) She said she would get in line at 5pm. I have seen the lines forming earlier than that  - and said I would get in line at 4:30. I arrived at 4:35 and was the 5th party in line. The guy at the very front of the line got there at 4:10 pm. (when His party arrived there were like 8 of them).  At about 5:25 someone comes out and asks if anyone has a reservation they should come to the front of the line and they are seated (there were very few 5:30 reservations). At 5:30 the line was about 25 parties line by my guesstimation.  I believe the way it works is they seat as many of the line that they can, they give the rest of the people in line a TIME to come back and be seated. This is actually fair b/c I have heard that some computer geeks have rigged the reservation system and hog all the reservations (to sell them?)Our party of 3 got right in. We had a great table right by where the food comes out. I'm  the gal at the cocktail party who figures out where the food comes out and stands there for first pick!I took photos of everything we had EXCEPT the sauerkraut pancakes (which I did love)  I did not partake in the seafood options (but my friends did)  If I had to ""Sophie's choice"" it it would be the rabbit with the spetzle.  But the fried quail, and the quail dumpling were also amazing. And sadly we only had room for 1 dessert which we loved. Funny story - there was a kid (about 12 years old) in line in front of us with his Dad (Mom joined the line later). It was his 3rd time there! - they ended up at the table next to us and the kid was recommending what we should order off the regular menu. This Kid was chowing down, he ate the bone marrow, the caviar, fun kid (and I'm generally not a fan of kids AT ALL) - but this kid was so foodie-centric he won my cold bitter heart.We had one bottle of wine to split and one of us had a cocktail - we were stuffed and the bill (with tip) was about $210. Not a bad deal considering,My friend had now hired me as her ""line pimp"" for when her family is in town. I will secure a spot in line for her and they might buy me dinner. Sounds like a plan to me.As an added bonus - here is a adorable video of the owners making their favorite midnight snack at home - sauerkraut and pecorino tacos.   youtube.com/watch?v=ef7U… Delicious food but skip on the desserts. Favorites included the sourdough pancake with ricotta and pecorino and the guinea hen dumpling. The staff kept remarking that we were ordering a lot, which I guess in hindsight, yes we tried 15 dishes amongst three people, but it was our first time there and you know how hard it is to get a table here! For desserts, we had the ice cream sandwich and buckwheat bao, both were underwhelming, considering that everything else was so tasty. Would definitely like to go back to try some of the other big dishes on the menu. It's AMERICAN DIM-SUM! And is definitely a must-try.  I mean, fine-dining but dim sum style.....how intriguing is that?! Very interesting I must say.  You don't hear loud Asians screaming ""HAR GOW!! HAR GOW!!"" while pushing their carts, but rather polite Americans going to each table describing each dish that is too complex for you to even handle.  All dishes were different, delicious, and unique.  We had 10 dishes for 2 people, small plates that average to $8 a dish.  Funny how the most expensive dish ($12 dungeneous crab and farro spezzato) was the least favorite.  It was just too much butter. The best was of course, the ""CA State Bird with Provisions"" on the menu.  Breaded and fried quail, although it tasted like tasty gourmet fried chicken! Juicy, not greasy, tender, and the lemon juice made this dish perfect.My other favorite was the ""Smoked Trout, Egg, and Potato Porridge.""  Omg that blew me away! SO tasty. This is why I love fine dining - one scoop is just bursting with many different flavors that combine to make one amazing experience in your mouth.  Gosh, I want this dish again.  SUMMARY (of my opinions of course):1. CA State Bird with Provisions - 5 (menu)2. Smoked Trout, Egg, and Potato Porridge - 53. Hamachi Avocado and Seaweed Cracker - 54. Steak Tartare with Porcini Ranch - 45. Charred Octopus in tomato-chickpea salsa - 46. Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - 47. Raw Oyster with Spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesame - 4 8. Pork Spare Ribs glazed in their own juices - 3 (menu) 9. Guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth - 2 (i don't like curry :( )10. Dungeness crab and farro spezzato - 1 (too much butter) OVERALL: Other than the 2 dishes I disliked, 8/10 of them were all delicious, some even amazing where you have never had a dish like before (trout egg potato porride). 5 stars for the great service, quality of food, and unique concept of the restaurant that I am proud to say is from my home of San Francisco. Western fancy foodstuff served dim sum style. Yep, you heard me correctly. The concept of dim sum is actually a really strong one -- you are offered small portions of different dishes, freshly made from the kitchen, and if you like more of it you can always get more. It's just usually quite hard to realize for most places -- not to mention the amount of dirty dishes you'd generate ;)SBP does it by offering a couple of staples on a small menu, and have daily specials that get transported out to tables via trays or carts. There are a good number of different dishes -- it's going to be tough for 2 people to try everything in one go. Service was fantastic -- definitely the part most different from a standard dim sum experience. It was rather interesting as the restaurant feels very SF-hipster, but there was no snarky or snobby attitude at all.What we had:Hamachi with avocado puree on crispy seaweed. My absolute favourite dish of the meal.Lobster salad - meh.Oysters. Sauce was nice, but covered up taste of oyster.Roasted rabbit. Quite delicious, but rabbit was a bit tough.Beef tartare. Loved it, it wasn't very saucy or overwhelming, but felt rather light.State bird. This is one of the staples of the restaurant, always on the menu. The quail was very tender and delicious...makes me feel guilty now because I want to gobble up every quail out there.Cauliflower - decent, but could be done better.And we capped it with dessert. The desserts were so delicious they almost overshadowed the main meal. We had the peanut butter milk shots (a must-try!!), ice cream sandwiches, and one more thing that I forgot. I want to say it's an apple thing, but it is in my tummy now!I really want to come back again but reservations are hard to come by (at least they allow reservations...) Walk-ins can be a challenge if your stomach can't stand hunger for too long. I hope that I will have the chance to come here again in the near future. Since reservations are hard to get just stand in line next to the unmarked door about 4:45 and you'll have a good chance to get in. The flavors are exquisite and the variety and creativity is unique. We only had the passed around dishes and wish we had said no to a few because by the end we couldn't eat any more. Every dish was wonderful. Highly recommend. State Bird Provisions is a small Michelin-Star rated restaurant located in the North end of San Francisco. The interior of the restaurant represents a paradoxical approach to ""fine-dining"" by electing to go with plywood tables over those decorated with posh linen. Although the interior may be far from stunning, the food certainly is. Style: State Bird Provisions utilizes the dim-sum concept found in some Chinese restaurants. The menus found at every table consists of their staple items including their namesake ""CA State Bird w/ Provisions"", wines and desserts. Throughout the entirety of your meal servers will come around with different items not found on the menu. They will give you a brief explanation about the dish and then you get to decide whether to take it or not.Food: Every dish I had at State Bird was marvelous. The tastes were complex and the small serving sizes ensured that I got to try a large variety of dishes. My personal recommendation is the ""CA State Bird w/ Provisions"", it was a ""tastier fried chicken"" and everybody acknowledged that it was highly enjoyable. Overall: State Bird Provisions is a restaurant is a phenomenal restaurant with good service and fantastic taste. Although it is not the cheapest dim-sum you can get, I highly recommend this establishment to everyone. We came on a Wed night.  I waited in line starting at 5:15pm (30 minute wait), no problem getting a reservation for 7:15pm.  We were seated around 7:40pm which was no big deal since we were running 10 minutes late anyways.Service 4.5 StarsService was great.  It seems we didn't have a specific waiter for our table.  Different members of staff just came around to check-in with us.  Everyone was really nice, professional, and NO attitude.  Ambiance 4 starsNot too loud or quiet, they did a cool job of the remodeling.Food 3.5 StarsThere is a lot of hype regarding the food.  I thought the food was good, but not outstanding.  Everything was perfectly cooked... nothing too dry, overcooked, undercooked etc.  The memorable dishes of our dinner were the Himachi with avocado on a Sesame cracker, the quail egg with halibut, and the grilled octopus (and I don't really like octopus).  All well cooked, great flavors.  I did think the sesame cracker was a bit too thick and crunchy for a delicate topping as Himachi.  I liked the State Bird Provisions (fried quail) as it was perfectly cooked... crisp breading and moist and juicy on inside.I didn't care for the cauliflower dish that much.  The pork spareribs were also perfectly cooked (tender), not that meaty of a cut though seasoned well.  Would not get this again, simply because there was nothing unique to them and I could cook this at home.For dessert, I had the green tea ice cream sandwiches half size.  The dough was a french style macaroon.  Good.Concept 4 StarsDim Sum style serving (they come around with carts and there is also a menu). Gives you a chance to try lots of different dished without spending $30-35/plate on a dish that you may or may not like.  Great concept.Price 4 StarsI thought prices were reasonable for this type of dining experience.  It would be one of the main reasons I wouldn't mind going again for dinner.  Our bill was $100 for 2 people with 1 glass of wine, probably $120 if my guest was drinking that night.  Not bad.  We left full enough and not overly stuff with about 8-9 dishes. This place is AWESOME! I was lucky enough to score reservations. Right from the start we were greeted by the super friendly team of hosts. Drinks were offered which made up for the small waiting area. As soon as we were sat our server gave us the spiel on how the ordering process goes. Basically, the dim sum style dishes are rotated around you 'till you tap out. Every dish had such great flavor. Dessert was good.  A friend suggested the granita dessert and it was a hit.  Everything was great! Listen to the hype and get here if you can. This place is amazing and one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. The reservations here are ridiculous. SBP closed for a few months and when the reservations reopened I tried for an hour to get one. It was worth it. I will say that I went on a Monday night. At 5pm (they open at 5:30) there was a line of 20 people without reservations. By the time I left all of the people had been seated. I'm sure the wait is ridiculous on the weekend, but during the week, it's not a bad deal.The interior is quirky. The servers are playful. The food is amazing.First, there is a menu that you can order from. They have pancakes and main dishes. You can order these at any time and are meant to share. The real spectacular part is that servers walk around with food dim sum style. Things I've had here:- Salmon Tartare- Duck mousse and almond biscuits- Ravioli soup thing- ""Buffalo"" cauliflower- Quinoa salad- Oysters (best I've ever had, hands down)- Rabbit and spaetzel- Rabbit and fontina croquettes- Steak tartare and homemade potato chips- Garlic Bread with burrataThe only thing that I didn't love was the garlic bread. It was just ok.I am going back in a couple of weeks and I can't wait. It's simple. Come here and form your own happy memories of playful yummy tummy rubbing goodness because I'm hoarding my own drooly memories for myself (luckily State Bird Provisions encourages sharing at the dinner table--my friend and I have known each other since 2nd grade but if fancy food was a prison situation, we probably would have shivved each other w our forks to get some).Note to slackers who don't make reservations: it's worth standing in line for 1.5 hours for first seating. Second note to slackers who don't make reservations: flirting w the prep cooks at the window may not score you first seating but you should do it anyway. Laughing cooks put smiles in food.... Worked for us! AMAZING is all I have to say!  Came here for my mom's birthday and there were 6 of us. Since larger parties are required to dine off a set menu, we let the restaurant put together their favorites. 18 courses to be exact, and each one was out of this world! Normally if you were to come here on a date or with a couple friends, everything is served dim sum style. The carts go around, you peek at things you like and order as you go! The service was great, ambiance is very cool/hip and they play awesome top 40 and rap at a considerable volume, so its a super fun place to go if you like that kind of scene. Highly recommend trying this spot out, if you haven't already! I'm on a roll of reviewing today so was thinking what else I should review, and State Bird popped to my head as the best meal I've had all year (and let me tell you - I've been doing a lot of eating....).  Not only is the food excellent, but the style of service makes it almost more of an event as well.  We eat - and we eat a lot - and we ate almost everything that was offered to us. And it was all good.  This is a place I've already recommended to a number of people, and would happily return to whenever I have the chance.  I've eaten at a number of other of the 'top' restaurants and have had very good meals there, but I still would not look forward to going back to any of them as much as I would State Bird. I first heard about State Bird Provisions more than a year ago from a gay couple at the community table at NOPA. Since then, it had been on my list of places to eat at. Since it has been getting a lot of hype lately, especially with that James Beard award, I finally made an effort to check the place out. Reservations are usually booked 2 months out so if you want to eat here, you're going to have to come before opening (5:30PM) and get in line. This is the idea I had, so I arrived at 5:00PM to get in line hoping to get in the first seating of the first-come-first-served countertop. We were served hot cocoa in line--awesome. We, however, didn't make the first seating. It looks like you have to come at like 4:00PM to be a part of the first seating if you didn't want to be on a wait list. They do the thing where they take down your name, phone number, and give you an approximate time to return so you can go do other things while you wait. I always appreciate that. We were given 7:15PM so we went to a couple bars to kill time.I had no expectations and just wanted a quality meal. It was explained to us that food comes out dim sum style and they mark the paper menu they give you for things you accept (just like at a dim sum restaurant). My first thought was that it was ingenious to apply dim sum style of eating to quality American food. I don't know any other American place that does it.I wish I could remember everything I had (8-9 dishes). Everything was amazingly amazing. After a few dishes in, I decided that it was the best meal I've ever had in my entire life and it reminded me that truly good food can put you into a genuinely happier mood. You must absolutely get the friend quail and the egg nog ice cream sandwich.Should you come here? No doubt--the whole concept and the quality of the food here will blow your mind. I am extremely happy that I was able to experience SBP and they very much deserve that Michelin star. The price point is very fair. My friend and I paid about $60 each for ~12 dishes and a few of drinks. The service is impeccable.This is the place to be for quality food and a novel experience. This the shiniest gem in San Francisco, CA right now. I rarely give 5 stars, but this place commands 5+ stars. Oh my goodness! This place is absolutely amazing! It's entertaining/fun, refined, and  delicious, all at the same time! Everything was perfect with this restaurant. The service, environment, and food was excellent. If you're planning on coming here without a reservation, make sure you arrive at least an hour and a half before dinner service to wait in line. Otherwise, it will be an even longer wait! My boyfriend and I came here without a reservation and got in line around 4pm (they open at 5:30pm) and there were already about 15 people in line. When they opened for dinner service, we were seated immediately. The wait wasn't bad at all especially because the State Bird Provisions people prepared spiced hot cocoa for everyone waiting in line! That was a very sweet gesture! When we were seated the waitress enthusiastically explained the restaurant's way of serving food. Food is served dim-sum style; there's about a dozen different small-portioned dishes (tapas) that are served from a cart that get's pushed around the restaurant. The servers describe the dish and when you see/hear something you like, you notify the server pushing the cart and they serve it to you and mark your bill to keep track of your orders. In addition to dishes that are served in the carts, there is also a menu with more dishes you could order from. I tried:Oyster topped with togarashi and toasted sesame - $3 eachThe raw oyster was clean, fresh, and naturally sweet. It was delicious!Rabbit fontina croquette - $2 eachI never had rabbit before this. It was interesting and pretty good, the meat it a bit tougher than chicken and it tasted a lot like carnitas (pork). Mendocino sea urchin, ginger scallion pancake with soy lime glaze - $14This dish was savory and filling. The savory pancake is sprinkled with baby greens and the soy lime glaze and topped with sweet sea urchin. I really liked this dish because sea urchin is one of my favorite things. This had a very asian fusion feel to it. It's worth getting because it can fill you up. All the dishes are very small, so you have to order quite a lot to get full and this can add up pretty quickly.CA state bird with provisions (half order) - $8This is deep fried quail topped with parmesan on a bed of cooked onions. The breading for the quail was flavorful and the quail itself was moist and very good. This dish was highly recommended by our server.Guinea hen dumpling in aromatic broth - $3 each dumplingThis was probably my favorite! The broth was incredibly flavorful and the dumpling was so so yummy. Must try this!Grilled beef with maitake with bok choy - $18My boyfriend ordered this dish because it was one of the few non-seafood options they had. He loved it. The beef was well-seasoned and tender and the grilled mushrooms were incredible. This dish was a little pricey for the amount of food, but it was worth getting.Hamachi, avocado, on toasted nori - $9There were cubes of raw hamashi and avocado on a piece of toasted nori. The nori was more like a nori chip, it was thick and very crunchy. The sauce, hamachi, avocado, and nori (seaweed) all went well together. This was probably my second favorite dish!Dessert - Spiced pomegranate granita (shaved ice), lemongrass tapioca, and persimmons (half portion) - $ 4You can ask for half portions for desserts! That way you could try different desserts! This dessert was interesting, the granita was very strong with a pomegranate and plum taste. It was like nothing I have ever tasted in a good way. All the flavors from all the ingredients used in the dessert had an interesting taste. If you're feeling adventurous, try this dessert!Dessert - Bittersweet chocolate ganache tart, brown sugar-oat crust, and olive oil (half portion) - $4This was our favorite dessert. The chocolate and tart crust was not at all overpoweringly sweet (which we liked a lot). The chocolate ganache was a little bitter and had the right amount of sweetness. It also came with sunflower whipped cream! That also very delicious. This was a great end to a great meal!! FYI: Most of the options here were seafood options - most of the dishes being served on the dim-sum style carts were seafood. And there were a few non-seafood options they had were on their menu. The restaurant environment was very refined and also very youthful, hip, and trendy.  The food is plated with finesse and everything looked sophisticated and well-thought out. All the servers and chefs were great! They were super friendly and informative, and really wanted to make everyone's experience there amazing. My boyfriend and I loved our experience here! It's one of the best dining experiences I've had.I highly recommend this restaurant! :D Words can not express my after glow two days later after getting to eat here. We (party of 3) had no reservation. Walked in at 630 on a Wednesday, was quoted a time for 915.. We came back at 10 literally as they were closing. We got it!!Absolutely perfection. They even had  Alagash beer on tap! Everything here was/is exquisite.  The service was unsurpassed of exceptional quality.Do not miss this place. Go when ever you have a chance. I lived vicariously through the window. Judging by peoples faces, I'm sure it was amazing I didn't expect to go here this soon - the famous difficulty of getting a table put me off from trying this place. This place is obviously underpriced relative to the demand, and as long as SBP doesn't raise prices this means customers end up paying with their time (lining up at 5pm, staying up until 4am to try to get the reservation) in attempts to capture the excess consumer surplus. This isn't a game I like playing.But as four of us were leaving a concert at the Fillmore around 10:30pm my buddy's girlfriend dropped in to see if they had room for a table of 4. They did and we decided this was a better alternative than late night korean.They were closing soon so we didn't get the full psuedo-dim sum experience (We could order off of the menu but there were less dishes being moved around the restaurant). But the dishes they did come around with were all quite good.  In fact, if you are eating here I highly recommend making a meal of the appetizers. We tried about half of the dishes and none of the appetizers disappointed (except for the person who was here before who said that now the garlic bread and burrata is smaller than it used to be) and most were quite good. The hen dumpling soup was amazing as was the duck liver mousse.The main dishes were slightly less impressive. When we ordered the smoke sturgeon everything pancake we imagined some sort of awesome twist on okonomiyaki. What it was ended up being basically a very thick pancake with some fish and greens on top.  The state bird wasn't bad but it wasn't that amazing either - it was just fried and almost anything fried can taste good. No one really disliked the cast iron quail egg dish, but no one really liked it either.Dessert was a step up from the main courses - the peanut muscovado milk shot was very interesting and the oolong tea sandwich came in 4 pieces which made it really easy to split between four people.The service was great the whole way through even though we were among the last people in the restaurant.  I'll probably be back, but it's not quite worth giving up my mid afternoon/evening to try to show up at the restaurant and get seated when they have room. 4.5 stars. SBP has been on my radar for a long time, but I could never manage to snag a reservation.  Granted I didn't try very hard (not waiting by the computer at 4AM), so it was very fortunate that LR generously donated her reservation to J & me this past weekend (relax people, she changed plans and went out of town).  AMBIANCE: So popular/awesome that there are absolutely NO signs for this restaurant outside!  Too cool for school.  The space is on the small side, covered with pegboard, and is on the casual side-- I definitely felt overdressed in my dress/heels.  Tables are well spaced, and there are a fair number of larger tables for groups.  Lighting is on the dimmer side, but it adds to the laid back, relaxed vibe.SERVICE: Very friendly.  Its all hands on deck, especially with since several servers are circulating the floor carry trays or pushing carts full of goodies dim sum style.  Our main server (Melissa?  Sorry, I didn't quite catch her name) was awesome.  Just the right amount of camaraderie with diners while still maintaining professionalism.* side note: despite having a reservation, we ended up having to wait around 10-15min for our table... which was slightly annoying.FOOD: Don't feel obligated to read all my descriptions below.  The cliff notes version: everything was delicious.  Flavors ranged from delicate and subtle to bold and in your face.  My #1 advice to first time diners?  SLOW PLAY IT.  J and I went all savage and ordered everything in sight within 5min of sitting down haha (we finished our meal in a little over an hr).  Next time I will go slow and savor everything. - Dungeness crab with quinoa (?) porridge: so light, delicate and delicious!  A close second fave dish of the night.- Smoked salmon/trout: Possibly my favorite of the night.  The smokiness from the fish was the dominant flavor of the dish, but the potatoes (? something slightly mushy/creamy in texture) and other components of the dish were the perfect supporting players.  Despite the bold savory flavors, this dish still came off as light and delicate.- Garlic bread with burrata: fluffy, decadent burrata floated like clouds above a rich garlic bread twist.  Best eaten/devoured immediately upon ordering-- this dish only gets heavier as it cools down.- Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit: probably my least favorite dish of the night, not b/c of the flavor profile, but because of the combination of textures.  I was expecting a crunchy almond biscuit, so the small ""almond"" cakes (couldn't detect any almond flavor) just didn't do it for me. - State bird w/ provisions (whole $16): J loved this dish.  Perfectly fried (not at all greasy), fabulously tender and juicy... MMM.  The lemon onions were a perfect pairing for the quail. - Cauliflower ($14): such an interesting dish.  Our server described it as ""cauliflower buffalo wing style"" and that's exactly what it was.  I wish this dish came in half portion because the full serving was a bit much for two people.  - Trout (half $11): so tender and light.  I really liked the combination of flavors and textures-- the toasted hazelnuts provided a welcome contrasting crunch to the perfectly cooked fish.- Charred baby octopus: I really liked this dish, but it was one of the worst for J because it was too salty (the tentacles; the body had more meat and was perfectly seasoned).  The octopus was quite tender, and had just the right amount of chew for me. - Yuba noodles with kimchi: this was another letdown for me, though I can't decide if its because I was pretty full by the time we ordered this, or because I was expecting a cold dish.  We ended up taking the leftovers home, and I was right, it does taste better cold.- Peanut milk ($2/shot): smooth peanutty goodness.  I wouldn't go out of my way to order this, though I'm glad we tried it. - Oolong ice cream sandwich ($8): MMM such delicious, delicate flavors.  The pepitas macarons used in the sandwich were a touch too chewy/stick, but I loved the flavor combination.  The smear of apricot jam was such a bright, bold punchy addition that J loved, but I found to be overpowering when eaten with the other components of the dessert (it was really good on its own though).  OVERALL: Definitely lived up to the hype.  This was probably one of the best dining experiences J & I have had in SF in a loooong time.  Portions are perfect for 4-- enough to give everyone a satisfying taste of the dish while allowing for the group to order many dishes to try everything.  J & I also thought that pricing was super reasonable, especially given the portion size (we expected bite sized bits that would be difficult to share).  Total damage for everything listed above plus a glass of viognier was around $150 (including tax+tip).  We would've been satisfied (and full) with half of what we ordered, and $40/person for top notch quality dinner in SF seems like a steal to me.  Totally staying/waking up early to make reservations for my next visit. 1st attempt, came in with my friend at 6pm on a weekday after work and was told we can get seated 3 hours later. But we were hungry and tired so passed. 2nd attempt, no dice of getting seats. 3rd attempt, we wanted to eat here no matter what. So came here on the busiest night Saturday. Walked in around opening time and they got us squeezed us at the end of the night. Decided to go hang and eat some snacks until then.After all that effort and wait, we told ourselves that this better be worth it and had high expectations.The first thing that came to us was the Corn & Quinoa (tabouleh). And after that first bite, MINDS WERE BLOWN. The Corn & Quinoa was just fresh and delightful. All the flavors/ ingredients just mixed well, and it was something I could eat all day.Then we decided to try almost every dim sum style provision that was carted to us.What's worth getting:- Tabouleh!!!!- Any of the pancakes especially the smoked sturgeon.- spicy kimchi yuba- smoked trout- BURRATA!!!- BBQ RABBIT- state bird- pork spare ribs- grilled beef- the ice cream sandwichOther things were good, but not memorable. I would skip the dumpling and anything raw fish. Those dishes were okay, but not worth picking up. Due to a birthday blip mix-up, my bff gave up her reservation rights to State Bird to me.  Her attempt at getting these reservations was no easy task either, she said it was like going to the race tracks and making bets on who the lucky horse will be.  Her wild ride gave her reservations at the earliest timeframe of 9pm on a Saturday evening.  This is considered lucky, as I read other Yelpers ride into eating here was absolutely ridiculous!My first attempt of dining here was a weee bit over 150 days ago.  We tried to do a walk-in but just couldn't wait until 10:30pm to eat dinner.  And throughout those 150 days,  I checked their online reservation page but it was always booked.  Booked booked booked!!  So finally, my long awaited wish came true via my BFF ( thanks girlfriend!)... I was finally dining at State Bird... the #1 most popular restaurant in the nation.  And also...my first Michelin Star dining experience to boot.What a great dining experience it was!  EXPERIENCE is the key word.  Everything I tasted was brand new New NEW!!!I'VE NEVER HAD and ORDERED:! State Bird Buttermilk quail - signature dish and MUST TRY DISH!!!!!!!  MUST MUST TRY IT!!! 5 stars! Grilled beef shank with mushrooms, bok choy, and mixed greens. 4 starsDISHES THAT CAME OUT OF THE KITCHEN (dim sum style):! Deep fried seaweed with raw cubed hamachi and tuna with Hershey kissed shaped avocados and fresh slice radishes. 5 stars! Raw oysters with sausakraut and sarachi sauce. 5 stars! Rabbit with cheese fried dough balls 4.5 stars! Lobster with salad - there was an herb flavor that didn't suit my buds. 3 Stars! Beef tartare with nacho cheese and potatoe chips - who could resist potatoe chips, right?!  Loved the chips and beef tartare... However, the nacho cheese cheapened the taste for me, it was too much like those big ol' cans of cheese from the ballpark. 3 StarsThe decor was peg board chic with an open kitchen concept.  It is casual dining with a very expensive price tag.  We ended up spending $100 for 2 persons and this didn't include any alcoholic beverages.  My date actually ate noodles before coming out to eat here, it's a good thing he did, otherwise, we could had easily hit $200 bucks here.  Yowza!!The service was friendly and impeccable.  Our waitress came by after our meal was over and asked how we liked it.  It was fun dining here and trying flavors that were new to us.  We told her we'd like to come back but reservations are so hard to get.  She told us that their online reservations opens at 4am and to check at that time.  I was like, really?!  And she even let us know that the owner caught others trying to SELL their reservations on Craigslist... That is bananas!!  High demands can lead to these types of scandalous ideas.  So funny too!Anyway, this is off my bucket list now.  I hope I get to come back again someday... My hubs and I are in love with this place. He says it's the best meal he has ever had. We couldn't get a reservation so we walked in at 6pm. The extremely sweet and patient hostess told us we would have a table about 9:30pm. We expected this so no hard feelings and we took a walk around town and visited a piano bar nearby. We returned at 9:30pm and had to wait an hour longer for a table. The hostess was extremely apologetic and we were offered duck liver mousse with almond biscuit and sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancake. Both were delicious and we were very pleasantly shocked to enjoy duck liver! Once we were seated service was efficient. We ordered the garlic bread with burrata (absolutely delicious and addictive soft pastry garlic bread and both dense and light as air cheese) BBQ rabbit & spaetzle (deliciously bbq'd great balance of flavor), CA state bird with provisions (perfectly lightly breaded/fried tender quail) roasted bone marrow with chanterelles & pink peppercorn (melts in your mouth). For dessert caramel nut tart, poppy seed crust, pears, whipped ricotta (rich, sweet, but not overly so) and the delicious and oddly refreshing world peace' peanut muscovado milk. The prices are surprisingly moderate for such imaginative and high quality ingredients. If we lived in San Fran we would Definitely be back many many times!!! State BIrd is just plain awesome.  From the vibe, ambiance, style and quality of the food, everything was great.  I'm not sure if this is the type of place where you're suppose to leave super full but I sure did.  Unable to resist and deny any plates that came around, I'm pretty sure I tasted everything that was available that night. I highly recommend everyone to try this place out. ""Some people deserve to have their faith rewarded.""I was a bit nervous going into State Bird Provisions for a friend's birthday. I knew it would be a long wait, if we got in at all. The recent Michelin star gave this place a certain amount of cache with the foodie crowd in town, and they had come out in droves. I showed up at 6:15pm on Tuesday to put my name in, and we were told they had an opening at 8:30pm. Given the fact that their reservation list was packed for over a month when I inquired, that was better news than I expected. We grabbed wine at Dosa before eventually getting in. SBP is split into two zones, tables for the larger groups, and counter seating for the pairs. We had the counter, right at the entrance to the kitchen. From the counter, you can drool all over everything being made, but we had one distinct advantage. Every dish that was brought out was presented to us first. Yes, this made our bill skyrocket, but it was all so amazingly good. We had the state bird (quail), pork belly, the ahi/wasabi, oysters, and a whole a lot more. Between that and their excellent wine selections, we rolled ourselves out stuffed after a great evenings.Two shout-outs to the team. 1) Katherine from their reservations desk was incredibly responsive, even though I'm sure she's being deluged with last-minute requests from jerks like me to get a table. I'm sure her job involves having to say 'no' a lot, but she was great about encouraging me to come down on a weeknight and try my luck. 2) Melody was hosting that evening, which meant running defense from the 'Do you know who I am?' crowd that kept trying to muscle their way in, and she handled herself with far more grace than I would have. No matter how frantic the greeting area was, she was a constant ball of sunshine.We had an excellent evening at State Bird Provisions, and I hope you do too! I was able to snag an online reservation on the day that the system re-opened. It was no easy feat but I booked a dinner reservation for 3 weeks later. I sure counted the days until the reservation. Since it was for a very late dinner on a weekday, we easily found parking in the area. We got to the restaurant several minutes before our reservation time and miraculously got seated right away.The food is fun, fresh and flavorful, and it's really the experience I think that makes State Bird Provisions so special. The kitchen is open and centralized at the front, and the ambiance is very relaxed but the excitement stems from what dishes will come around on the cart or on the various trays. Order a couple of ""commandables"" = items from the set menu, but as one of the wait staff put it, ""just see what happens"" = play it by ear and order from the cart or trays. During our visit, the cart rolled around with primarily seafood dishes. Also, we found that although there were particular items that we wanted to try that we didn't see on the set menu, it was no prob to order them from any of the wait staff.  We tried a number dishes but the flavors and textures of the following 3 were the best for me: ***hamachi-avocado & seaweed cracker ***CA state bird with provisions***chocolate mint 'ice cream' sandwich, plum jam, walnutsDon't forget to save room for dessert! I had to order a shot of the 'world peace' peanut muscovado milk which was very delicious and to my surprise, tasted like Choc Nut (a filipino chocolate).On top of the amazing food, service was exceptional. This was a once in a lifetime experience. The stress of getting the reservation was well worth it. What innovative foods and fabulous flavors. The service was outstanding. Best ice cream sandwhich I have ever had The first day the opened the reservation like after being closed for a while was crazy.  I had two phone and two computer screens and after about an hour of constantly refreshing and dialing again, I got through and made a reservation for whatever they had.  Which happened to be Halloween.  I'll take it!I loved the whole concept, casual atmosphere and dim sum like carts rolling around with tasty treats, in addition to the larger items on the menu.  I really like being able to share and brought 3 girlfriends with me.  This is the kind of place where you benefit from coming with more people.  The more people you have at your table, the more items you can order and try.  Although since the portions are small, you sometimes have to order two of something, in our case that was the PORK BELLY.  It was so delicious I almost ordered it a third time as dessert, but I thought my friends would kill me.Some items that stood out in addition to the yummy yet not so meaty state bird (quail), were the dumplings in brother, the aforementioned pork belly, the beef tartare, the hamachi avocado seaweed cracker, the oysters, the egg on top of the trout and that chocolate crisp dessert, did I mention THE PORK BELLY?It is such a production to get in, and yes, the service is friendly and upbeat, and the food does not disappoint but it certainly doesn't make you want to necessarily make you want to run back.I am just happy I was able to experience it once.  When the coast clears up a little, I'll try coming in again. This was my first visit back since the renovations and revamping.  It's actually not that obviously different from before, but they did expand it a bit.  It still has a nice intimate feel but seems a bit less crowded, and they can accommodate some bigger parties now (but 5 is kind of the max at a regular table, and that's squeezing it in on the bench).They're still wine/beer only, no liquor.  Servers are very friendly and enthusiastic about the food.  We got 2 bottles of whites, both in the $45-65 range. Onto food.  It's the same as before where you can order pancakes and some more substantial dishes off the menu, and there are around 10-12 dishes brought around dim sum style (prices listed), which you can add on.  We did pretty well for 5 girls!- Smoke sturgeon pancake: a thicker pancake, lots of sturgeon (definitely smoky), like the beet accompaniment which added sweetness and a beautiful color- Uni pancake: a more traditional flat pancake topped with a generous amount of uni- Quail eggs: served sunny side up with cheese, topped with sun choke chips.  I'm a huge fan of runny yolks, which are hard to do when the eggs are so small, but they did a reasonable job- Salmon tartare: I liked the cucumber underneath, but it was a bit fishy for me- Lobster ""salsa"" salad: lots of chunks of fresh lobster!  But I could have done without the mayo.  Lobster was fresh, though- Crispy pork belly with grapes: one of the favorites of the night. It's exactly as it sounds - crisped pork belly, and the grapes soak up all the pork fat goodness and balance the heaviness- Hamachi on a nori cracker: fun to break up the large crisped nori, hamachi was fresh- Fried green tomatoes: I liked the shisitos and other peppers, slightly tart- Oysters: with a house togarashi on top, which I liked - Charred baby octopus: good charred flavor, plump octopus, with a good bean and tomato base- Chanterelle, persimmon, quinoa tabouleh: The quinoa was crisp and added texture, but I would have preferred more chantarelles.  The pumpkin goat cheese was a nice touch.- State bird: fried quail, good flavor, slightly acidic sauce- Bone marrow: the mushrooms got pretty heavy thanks to the marrow, and it's on the larger side as far as bone marrow portions go... bread helps- Dumplings with maitake mushrooms and broth: the broth had a light lemongrass scent and was very fragrant, and the dumpling was pretty meaty considering it was just mushroomDesserts: - Apple granita with fennel and persimmon: parts of it were light, but it was a bit heavy on the fennel, and I'm not sure the persimmon matched it- Ice cream sandwich: good for sharing, just the right proportions of ice cream and cookieOverall, it was a fun meal, and it's always great to be able to see/smell/hear about the dishes (and know the prices) as they come by before choosing them.  They have a wide variety to fit each person's preferences, so I definitely had my favorites (burrata, dumplings, sturgeon pancake, state bird).  I'm glad they're finally back open and that I was able to snatch a reservation on the first day they opened the site back up (despite urban spoon crashing for over 45 minutes..). State Bird is definitely the new it spot for SF foodies given how difficult it is to make a reservation or get in.  My friends and I planned to have a grandma dinner by going at 5 PM to be there right when they open, but lo and behold there was a long line that started at 4.  We ended up getting seated at 10:15 PM (they'll take 1-2 phone numbers & call you back), so make sure you're prepared to roam around the city, eat some crepes, or watch a movie (or 2) during the long wait to work up your appetite.  My favorites were the garlic bread burrata and the seawood cracker w/ sashimi.  I really liked the idea of American style ""dim sum"" and being able to see the dishes before I order, but trying 12-15 dishes and only being fascinated by 2 was not an impressive record.  I think it's a fun place to go & ideal for a group of 4 so you get to try the maximum number of dishes.  I would give it another chance since the menu items change and its very affordable for a michelin star restaurant Best meal I've ever had. From the amazingly friendly and efficient staff (including chefs, cooks, wait staff, and managers all of whom stopped to chat) to the unbelievable food. We had some of almost every dim sum-style dish, each one meticulously crafted. Will go back as soon as I can get in again. We had been here before and since there was so much hype we expected a lot and were a bit disappointed. Today, after months we came back. I have to say this was by far the best meal I've had, in every aspect.The chefs make very complex foods taste very simple, and make heavy flavors balance into several layers of palate sensations. Mr Brioza and his whole team are extremely talented and have made the most balanced and complete place i have ever set foot on. The pork belly was the best flavor my mouth has had. The texture, the sensation as I was chewing, the aroma of the vietnamese sauce, the perfectly measured spice of the jalapenos, the freshness of the mint. This is absolutely INCREDIBLE. I have no words to describe how pleased I was to come back and find such a delightful experience. THANK YOU STATE BIRD. KUDOS. I went to State Bird yesterday fully expecting to be underwhelmed. I had, after all, done my research, and everyone said the place was overhyped.I thoroughly disagree. I had a fantastic time, and I highly recommend this spot to serious diners in SF.To get the awkward part out of the way: yes, there is a wait, and yes, it's absurd. There is, however, a way to beat it. Come in early (~5.30pm) on a Mon-Wed, get your name down, and spend time at Dosa's bar or the Wine Jug with some cocktails. We waited about an hour. Next, the service. I was expecting the staff's pretentiousness to match the restaurant's hype. This was absolutely not the case. Everyone was super friendly and accommodating, including the head chef, who was so wonderful (I'd come back just to say hi to him!)Finally, the food. As you've probably gleaned from your Yelp research thus far, it is all dim sum style, but they do have a menu too. We mostly stuck with dim sum because we were too full to order off the menu after a few small plates. My reccos:Hamachi-avocado & seaweed cracker - SOOOO GOOD! Don't do yourself an injustice....eat the cracker WITH the hamachi, it's amazing!Buratta garlic bread - UNBELIEVABLE. It was more pastry and less bread. Forget your guilt. It's worth orderingOctopus - one of the best octopus dishes I've had. It was a charred octopus with some sort of chikpea salsa and simply phenomenalEgg white kimchi - what a novel dish! it's veggie-friendly and had a wonderful texture while still maintaining the authentic kimchi tasteOysters with spicy kohlrabi kraut - YUM.Quinoa - I LOVE quinoa so I liked this dish, but it wasn't anything crazy. Good texture - soft and crispy, but again, nothing wow-worthyRibs - the only thing we ordered off the menu, and though I don't eat ribs, these were apparently good, but nothing great. Yes, it's embarrassing that we didn't order the state bird. Apparently, it's epic. Order that.Finally: THE DESSERT. We had a lovely chocolate macaron ice cream sandwich with a pecan streusel. The chef was nice enough to give us peanut muscovado milk on the house with this....and the combination of the two was sinful, amazing, and heavenly. MUST ORDER. Textural synergy.Dish after delicious dish, I couldn't help but notice a mastery of this concept and really...it wasn't until near the end of me and my brother's epic meal that the term dawned on me.Having just finished renovations to expand the main dining area, I immediately fell head over heels for the eclectic layout of a space that vaguely resembles a child's wood shop...in the best way possible.  Tables and booths were both surprisingly spacious and there was nary a sense of confinement even with the servers constantly roaming the walkways.  Speaking of which, these staff members provided some of the most jovial and enthusiastic service I've ever experienced.  These folks presented their dishes with such passion that one would almost think they cooked it themselves.While I quickly realized that it was folly to make note of the ingredients in the fourteen ""provisions"" we ordered, every single one had a tasty combination of flavors and textures to offer.  But who says I can't try?  Roasted nori with hamachi, salmon tartare, steak tartare with potato chips, oysters and chilled crab all contributed to a crunchy and refreshing start to the meal.  Moving towards fried fare, duck and cheese croquettes exploded with savory, fatty goodness.  Likewise, lightly crisped pork belly killed it with its lipid-laden glory and...wait for it...grapes, basil leaves and red chili peppers.  In fact, I'd even recommend eating just those latter ingredients for a clean, slightly herbacious and sweet bite with a hit of capsaicin on the finish!Those pancakes.  Holy hell.  Leave it to Chefs Brioza and Krasinski to serve Mendocino sea urchin atop a wonderfully pillowy ginger-scallion pancake.  Then came the smoked sturgeon atop what appeared to be a rice pancake adorned with every ancient grain imaginable.  Crazy delicious especially when eaten with the accompanying jam and cheese spread.From the ""commandables"", everything will be hella (yup) delicious if the cast iron quail eggs and roasted bone marrow were even remotely accurate representations of the quality and ingenuity.  Each bite of the eggs was as if I was munching on delicately soft white and yolk...laid in a garden...with an apple that dropped from a tree.  Never would have thought that each of ingredients would contrast yet simultaneously harmonize so well together.  As for the fatty globs of undifferentiated cells, they erupted with an other worldly richness of umami and earth that was simply astounding.  Combine this with the superlative bread that achieved toasty yet spongy equilibrium and you have the best marrow ever.And finally, the sweets.  ""You're crazy if you don't try the birdseed,"" said one of the servers.  No joke, son!  My brother ordered seconds of this on his previous visit and for good reason: the caramel cloud (of the heavens) cream provided a nearly unparalleled softness that held in the chocolate crunch's full caramel, hazelnut and pecan flavors so that they could all blanket the palate at once towards each spoonful's finish.  The apple & vanilla granita, coconut-carrot cake and hefty chocolate macaron 'ice cream' sandwiches all offered uniquely tasty forms of sweetness as well.  I especially enjoyed the granita's exceptionally cool and refreshing flavors while the sandwiches' accompanying yogurt spread contrasted perfectly with the chocolate's richness.By the end, this effectively 22-course behemoth of a meal left me with the undoubted conclusion that State Bird has taken over as my #1 restaurant to date.  It was an absolute joy to experience such creative and exceptionally well-executed cuisine that incorporated both traditional structuring and influences from Chinese dim sum in a playful, inviting atmosphere full of great minds and personalities. Yes there is a 2.5 hour wait, yes the food is really that yummy. I thought I would never get into this place after hearing about it for so long. Yesterday was the night I decided to try to get into the place and succeeded! I went at 6pm put my name down then went home and hung out until 8:30 when my table was ready, uh yeah crazy...But it was an amazing, fun experience cuss we got the best seats in the house! Right next to the chef all night and right in front of all the food being made and first to see what was leaving the kitchen. They serve their food dim sum style which was fun. You need to go in knowing you will be spending a crap load of money and just enjoy it. It's so hard to say no when it looks so good my eyes won over my full stomach. Ok best dishes for me, beef tar tar, the state bird of course, garlic bread with barata, we had two!, and the crunchy bird seeds chocolate cloud dessert, my friend's eyes closed while eating it. Everything was good but if I were to pass on something next time, the lobster is just ok, the fried green tomatoes itself was good but I just am not a fan of the peppers around it...Service was beyond what you will expect. I think I had five people attending to us, that included the chef, manager, and a cook, where would you get service like that?..I hope I will be lucky enough to sit at the kitchen counter next to Chef again, it was fun. Went there recently and loved that 40 percent of their restaurant is avail for walk ins NOW!  I was really turned off by their reservation system last year but the walk in system is pretty easy now.  I think everything was good but not something I had to have again.  All in all it was a good experience.  Would I come again? Yes.  Would I wait in line for 2 hours no! State Bird ProvisionsDon't even bother.POSCan't believe they got one star.Crappy wannabe food with no substance, loud loud interior, we were sitting next to PEGBOARD. Yes, the entire interior decor is PEGBOARD.Wow, we'll spend $50 on the walls but charge you $300 for the food, WTF?They serve things in a tapas meets american meets dim sum way, with carts being pushed around with the prices of the American dim sum displayed prominently, but they PUSH them on you to jack up your bill like no place I've ever been to.The waiter was obsequious, and obviously just trying to get money. There were many people waiting for a table, every host(ess) was polite, but fakely.I wouldn't go back there even if somebody else were paying.It was beyond bad. We had almost everything they made, and there was not even ONE DISH that spoke to us, and there were four of us, it's not just me.The ""ribs"" were Asian Fusion, no smoke, just an Asian style sauce, the meat was tender but no flavor. What's the point? I'd rather have gone to Gorilla.The lobster salad was OK, but no flavor, the tuna tartar the same, the quinoa so bland I couldn't eat it, the smoked duck had never seen a pack of cigarettes in its life, one of the desserts was completely inedible, we had them take it off the bill, it was texturally disgusting and bland. Imagine completely flavorless sorbet with jicama shavings. Bland bland bland, flavorless.Did I mention the word bland before?I have no clue why anyone would want to eat there, and I don't say that about many high-end restaurants. Gary Danko or Quince is 1000x better.Summation: They're experimenting with ""daring"" food presented in a ""daring"" way and you're the test subject.No thanks, I literally would rather have eaten at Burger King.PS: And did I mention the new location is in the SF black ghetto? Lovely. Paying mucho money to have to walk past the projects and worry about getting jacked.I have no idea what the owners were thinking about the food or the location. The hottest restaurant in the city????? Not so hot...........All that hype..... Hard to get in and make reservations....... Need 60 days in advance to get one..... Ehhhhhh...... Really????? Why?????  (After eating here)Everything we ordered was good but not exceptionally good that would make me come back for more.  We ordered about 15 dishes and still it was just good.nothing really stood out.Best ones were the hamachi sashimi, salmon tartare, octopus and of course the pork belly.I was disappointed with their specialty- THE QUAIL.. Being it the ""STATE BIRD"" I was expecting a unique preparation and presentation. However it was a shock to see that it was just plainly BREADED!!!! I was expecting roasted with some kind of specialty sauce but it was just fried and breaded. Truly disappointed...They only serve BEER and WINE which  was again disappointing because we were expecting specialty cocktails... How about for people that drink neither????I was really expecting to be blown away by this place but unfortunately no. Being the best two chefs of the year , you would expect an extra ordinary experience ..... But no.... Nothing was memorable .... Even the food.I was going to give only 2 stars BUT their service was excellent so I gave this place 3 stars.Worth the visit here?????.. Sorry to say BUT no. 1. Getting in can be an tough task. 2. Going on any day but Thu, Fri, Sat, and Sun might bring more fruitful results.3. Have a backup plan when they tell you the next reservation is the standing room only seat at 9 PM.4. Enjoy the wait and then enjoy the food because it is fantastic.5. Service is awesome for a place that is this packed. Truly some of the best service I've had. NOTE: For all the whiners about the reservation system; yes, it is a pain to get a table. #firstworldproblems just like another poster said. Guess what, they have no problems filling their tables. Why? The food is amazing. As long as they keep up the great food I don't think their reservation will be their downfall. This restaurant is quite unique, given the dim-sum style of serving customers, mixed with nouveau dishes that reflects the fusion food that SF is so good at.Came here on opening night after the renovations, so I didn't have to go through the entire 2-month reservations waitlist. Due to being some of the people in the front of the line, my friend and I was seated promptly upon opening. During our wait, we were served some hot cider from the kitchen inside. They must have seen us freezing to death waiting outside for their food.Given the price tag, I was actually quite disappointed in the food. My friend and I sampled something like 10 dishes, and I felt only satisfied with half of the meal. There were only 3 hit dishes for me - the state bird with provisions, the nori cracker with hamachi, and the dumpling with broth (in which case, it was mostly the broth that blew me away). Everything else was either blah or good (uni pancake, sauerkraut pancake, quinoa bowl with goat cheese, octopus and chickpeas in tomato sauce, furikake soft boiled egg atop potatoes, corn biscuit with duck liver, peanut milk shot, chocolate crunch with caramel cream).Definitely felt that it would have been better bringing another friend or two to split the bill, since it was more fun sampling all the dishes than feeling really full. Definitely my treat for the month here! the fried pork belly. Let's get the bad out first. On line reservation system is terrible. Went on line to get reservation after State Bird Provisions closed for remodel. Was able to get time and date after a few tries. Hit enter and server crapped out. Was never able to get in. Turns out , I was not the only one. Not many people get lucky on on line or by phone for reservations. Ended up going to Soft Opening on Oct. 19th. Was actually first in line. Got there at about 3 o'clock for 5:30 PM opening. The /12 hour wait to get in was worth it. Went in with a budget, but ended up blowing it up. Everything was delicious. Couldn't stop trying all the items being carted around. If it wasn't for myself and my wife getting full, we would of been there longer. Simply Stated. Amazing. We are going back. Probably standing in line again. The people we met in line prior all had the same feelings. we are all Fans. As of October 23, 2013, State Bird Provisions has received a Michelin Star, in addition to The James Beard Award for Best new Restaurant 2013. This is a late post from earlier in the year. Food is a little pricey but is worth it for the experience. Portion size like all tapas are small, but the food will get your taste pallet dancing. This was like a dim sum experience minus the actual dim sum. You have your dedicated sever.  The staff all knew the menu. They not only knew what they were serving, but also how the food was prepared. I hate this place, not because of the bad food or the bad service, it's because every time the servers come by our table with new dishes i just have to order it! I had an awesome experience dining here, service was friendly and attentive. This restaurant serve's its food dimsum style. Each of the dishes were amazing such as the oysters, soup dumplings, octopus, oh don't let me forget to mention the quail, omg the quail is a must! I highly suggest reservations otherwise you'll be standing outside looking through their kitchen window dying just to get in. The idiot who wrote a bad review for the reservation system craping out is a moron. I hate yelpers like that, it's not helpful at all. Get a life. I ate there a couple months ago. It's the best new restaurant in America, for a reason, so of course it's a mad rush to get in. #firstworldproblems #amirightoramiright The food and experience are amazing, the service is nothing short of fantastic and I look forward to going again when things die down a bit. What's it all about? It's dim sum style new American food. Which means people come around with prepared dishes on a cart, you take it if you want it or they move on. There's a menu with prepared to order dishes as well. Menu changes regularly. If you're traveling from out of town and making plans for must dine places, this should def make your list. Can't get a reservation? It can't hurt to try to walk in with a smile on your face, a patient attitude and flexibility of sitting anywhere whenever they can get you in. Don't worry, be happy and eat well! How can a place of this caliber have a totally inept online reservation system? Get your shit together, SBP. I'll keep this short.Quite simply the best dining experience I have ever had in my life. Wow!  Never seen such badly managed reservation system.  Tried all different ways for over an hr - between crashing website at different stages and no phone service , it's unclear why no tables are suddenly available.  Even left a voicemail but no response!  Oh well, it would have been nice if the system was somehow managed better. Total disaster trying to sign up for reservations after the close.  Pages timed out and 40 minutes wasted trying to score a reservation.  Will not be trying again anytime soon. I've eaten here twice, and the food is good.  yes.  the ambiance is nice and the concept is fun and engaging... When my boyfriend tasked me with getting a table for four for us and his parents during their upcoming visit, I thought, no problem.  I'm all over it.You'd think that a restaurant with lines out the door every single day would prepare accordingly for the onslaught of internet traffic once their reservation page opened up again for the restaurant reopening.  But I have been struggling with 505 service errors, gateway timeouts, bad gateways and the like for over 40 minutes now to no avail.  I have been able to reach each stage of the reservation process through my NUMEROUS attempts, but the state bird website and the reservation website have crapped out on me every. single. time.  I have been tasked with scoring tickets to a number of lucrative events: Prince at DNA Lounge, Phish lotteries, Dave Chapelle flash sale at the Indy... and none have been as frustrating as this.State Bird: host your reservation site with a service company that can handle your level of web traffic.  This is amateur hour. Between reservation bots, an inoperative website and all around madness to get into this place, I'm over it.  Sorry State Bird, you won't be seeing me again. I had the pleasure to eat here a couple of months ago (pre-remodel),  I arrived at 4 to get a table and waited 2 hours.  This is not like me at all to wait.  I was lucky enough that they had a ""stand up"" table available (not like me at all to stand up for dinner) and the fun began.  The food is amazing, watching the staff's passion for food is amazing and nothing absolutely nothing disappointed me.  This place is a gem. I'm not a fan.  But maybe I went on an off night looking at all of these reviews.  The food was decent, best dish was an oyster dish.  Everything else was ok, the flavors didn't blend well together and certain dishes just left me wondering why?  Service was good and our waitress attempted to explain all of the dishes to us.  My friend and I left this place underwhelmed.  I'll come back again to see if I can update this review. why so fabulous huh????i will start with the negative. when i make a reservation that took me weeks, i don't want to wait at all when i get there....i should be seated asap. just being honest so get on point. SBP! if i don't have to wait at french laundry or le bernardin, my ass should not have to wait an additional 25 minutes for state bird....get your shit organized and if i come on time, you be on time too.on to the good stuff.staff is super nice. short stack amazing and to die for. everything we got was amazing minus the small bird or squab they had on their menu we got....i wasn't dying for it....but everything straight up was FANTASTIC.dessert was killer and i was floored. thanks for the fine fine food.

Delightful food and a wonderful dining experience. We were just about the last table sat during the last seating on Saturday, and the food and staff couldn't have been more wonderful. I also fully expected the check to be a bit more when all was said and done, so maybe they're not charging enough :) This place will always hold a special place in my heart- my fiance proposed to me here!Prior, my friends and I had been trying to get reservations for months. I was ""surprised"" when the boyfriend landed a last-minute reservation for two on a Saturday night ;)The setting is intimate, I always love open kitchens (though fiance tried hard to convince me to sit facing the other direction), the wall decor is fun, and the lone bathroom is super clean and posh. The staff is really friendly and proactive, and explained how to order (unlike some restaurants with unique concepts who assume you can figure it out on your own). They have a combination of made-to-order items that include the famous State Bird with Provisions, and other items come out of the open kitchen on trays and sometimes carts. They usually only put out 4 plates of each dish out at a time, but since every table is at a different point in their meal, you don't feel anxious to grab dishes as they came, as you would at a traditional dim sum restaurant. The pace is steady, we had about 2-3 dishes on our table most of the night, and we pretty much tried all but a few dishes. My favorite was definitely the heirloom cherry tomatoes on a zesty blended eggplant bed that reminded me of babaghanouj. We were recommended some great wines, and the dessert was so delicoius, combining some of my favorite ingredients in a minty pistachio ice cream chocolate sandwich with a raspberry sauce.They said they're closing down temporarily to remodel-- the waitress said they're opening up the space to allow more room for carts. Can't wait for them to re-open, we'll be back again! :D We had a great time here. Clearly other reviews have covered most important points, but my main observations were that we much preferred the meat dishes to the vegetable ones, and that the pancakes were completely delightful. We managed to come not hungry, which was a good strategy as we refrained from ordering every dish that came by. The bread + burrata was, in my opinion, not better than something you could put together at home with high-quality ingredients. I'm really looking forward to going back. They were at SFSFF 2013 and had $8 garlic bread. I didn't like it. I thought it was overpriced for the portion and it didn't taste garlicy at all. We did not have reservations so we stood in line for an hour to get a reservation.  Then we had to wait another hour and 45mins for our reservation.  They were nice enough to serve hot chocolate to everyone in line.  It was a nice teaser because the hot chocolate had a nice citrus hint so I really got excited.They serve most of their dimsum style wherein they will approach your table with small plates of food and you can choose to accept or say no to the food.  So it will be good to go as group so you can taste more dishes.  But not too big a group because the place is really small -- 4 pax will be ideal.My friend and I were so hungry by the time we sat because of all the waiting so we did taste several dishes -- 16 in total.  I will say that most were average -- good but nothing great.  Only two dishes really stood out which was the crudo sashimi with wasabi mayo on top of crispy nori and the braised rabbit.For dessert, we had the chocolate crunch and it was NOT the punctuation mark that I was waiting for at the end of a meal.I say go and try the place since the food is good but make reservations.  Its not one that I will line up for hours. The best food in recent memory, top 2 or 3 of all time.  Casual restaurant experience definitely worth the hour and a half wait if you don't have a reservation.  Service was excellent.- Go as a party of four so that you can try everything on the menu (best advice)!- Eat first from the trays that are brought to your table, order from the menu last- Try the house made sodas, all of them- Sit at the chefs counter, it's like sitting courtside or behind home plate- Go hungry and take your time working through all the dishesEnjoy! There are many beautiful restaurants offering friendly, attentive service and serving creative, delicious food in San Francisco. State Bird Provisions is one such restaurant, but it offers one additional thing that sets it apart from its peers and places it in a unique, far more elite class of dining establishments: It is a restaurant that captures the true heart and soul of its city. To step into State Bird Provisions is to enter a microcosm of the spiritual fabric of San Francisco. Allow me to explain:1) The Californian-Asian cuisineIt is no secret that San Francisco has a rich and lively Asian community that spans multiple countries, nationalities and ethnicities. It is also no secret that the city has access to fresh produce year-round. State Bird Provisions reflects both of these aspects in its cuisine. Whether it is a ""stew"" of purple radish leaves mixed with poached egg and fish, or a salmon tartare combined with pumpkin seeds and quinoa, or stir-fried vegetables with almonds, crunchy rice, cheese and romesco sauce, the menu each day is a harmonious marriage of Asian-Western ingredients, culinary techniques and cooking styles, combined with the delicious, endlessly fresh bounty of the earth that characterizes the Golden State.2) The dim sum-style serviceIt should come as no surprise, following #1, that State Bird Provisions also offers a uniquely Asian style of serving food. Most dishes are tapas-sized, good for 2-4 people and presented by carts and trays by various serving staff. Simply choose which dish(es) you want and your order(s) is marked on a checklist--just like at dim sum restaurants.3) The bustling, open kitchenI'm probably biased because this is where my friend and I were, but I would argue that the best place to be in the restaurant is at the standing ""chef's table"" at the front of the restaurant. Place your things on the hooks provided and stand back (literally) to enjoy the sight of State Bird Provisions' many line cooks carefully and meticulously preparing their dishes. San Franciscans love good food, but San Franciscans also embrace an open, casual, laid back attitude. This is reflected in the kitchen, where the cooks are a friendly, easy-going bunch dressed in whatever clothes are most comfortable for them (no matching suits and ties here) and chatting easily with diners while they slice, toss, sauté, roast and plate. When I left State Bird Provisions, I felt as if I had just spent the last 2 hours consuming the very essence of what makes San Francisco great. For that reason alone, a visit to this restaurant should be on everyone's to-do list. Why, oh why, did I consume a $3 slice of pizza before coming here?  I wish I had come on an empty stomach, but the drunk me after several Friday night drinksies forced me to buy a slice before I passed out on the street somewhere. My reservation was a late one, 10:30pm, and I had friends in town from Australia and it was her birthday, so it was perfect (especially before closing down for rennovations!) We were immediately awed and overwhelmed by the process of ordering here. Besides the menu of pancakes, commandables, and desserts, the staff come around with carts and trays of their prepared foods ala dimsum style.My co-worker told me to get the state bird off the menu, but we were quickly lured to sourdough/sauerkraut/pecorino/ricotta pancakes and the pork spare ribs. I thought the pork spare ribs were more delicious than the state bird (quail). Deliciously tender and the meat fell off the bones. The state bird came with some cheese and tasted like fried chicken. I only had a small piece because I was full. The pancakes could be used to dip in extra sauce, like what my friend's bf did with the leftover avocado dip.If my appetite would have allowed for more food, I would have definitely tried more plates. Lots more. I mean there was seafood, veggies, and so many other varietals I can't remember.  Some of the smaller plates ordered:--This slow cooked egg with trout (flavors were delicate yet decadent)--This avocado thing with spicy flavors that came with chips (YUM)--A dumpling in yummy broth. (should have ordered more than one!)Next time, I will do it properly by 1) coming earlier 2) coming on an empty stomach.Can't wait to come back! You can just tell the quality of the food is amazing, the staff really care about their food they prepare for you (cooked with love), and a great atmosphere for hanging out.P.S. They don't do anything special for birthdays here. We mentioned it once or twice but nothing happened. Sad, we didn't even get to order dessert! The food here was absolutely amazing. We had been waiting a few months to get in and finally made it off the wait list one night. Started getting food very quickly and couldn't stop trying new dishes. Everything had a distinct feel and flavor and there some pretty wild dishes. The quail was OK. The beef salad was memorable. The other stuff seemed awkward, and tasted kinda bland. The wine was good, though. Overpriced food that I forgot about by the next day. Ok so I walked in expecting hipster food. You know artisanal water and organic air infused broccoli which will cost you $45 dollars a pop. I was totally wrong and I am soo sorry for thinking this.Ok so I had no clue but everything is sort of served dim-sum style. Someone comes by and asks if you want a plate from their tray, and they mark off the amount on the card. Simple.  It ranges too. We had a vegetarian in the group and 3 other non vegs.Favorite little dish was the nori with albacore on it. Totally awesome. Came with a bit of avocado and a garlic mayo combo (hip kids call it aioli I guess).Honorable mention was definitely the pork belly plate but I mean it's pork belly, how do you mess that up.There was a quinoa and corn starch that was great too.People were talking about something like a garlic bread burata?, it was eh compared to other things on the menu. It was just garlic bread.The duck liver confie was awesome too. I kept just dipping other dishes in it or spreading it along other items.You can order from the menu as well, but among the 4 of us, we were all full off of taking 1 of each plate they had passed out throughout the night. A special callout has to be made to the staff here. They are awesome. Super friendly, totally engaging and very attentive. They had no attitude about anything and they just provided an overall nice atmosphere and were actually excited.When it came time for dessert we were stuck. We were at the standing counter all night which is right behind the place where they make the desserts. So we saw everything. But we thought we should ask. Everyone seemed to be ordering the ice cream sandwich dish, but no we were told by the server, we want the crunchy chocolate dessert. It sounded weird but it was delish. Just a bit nuty crunchy, chocolate not too sweet and man I was pleased. They even threw in a shot of the panicotta stuff after because they liked how we were up for anything.Then the bill came and ... it was actually pretty reasonable. Every dish they had, split 4 ways, cost about 50 bucks WITH tip. Come on that is crazy awesome considering everything.Pro tip, just suck it up and go for the standing table. (6month wait for regular table). It has the best view, so what if you have to stand, and you can get a seat day of. Go to fat angel and grab some wine and beers while you wait. Had dinner here during a stop in San Francisco on our honeymoon.  Best dinner we've ever had.  Everything we tasted was amazing.  Sat at the bar and tried everything that came by on the cart.  Service was great and everyone was friendly...we even got to meet the chef/owner.  When we got back to Atlanta, we saw that we had visited one of the best restaurants in the states in Bon Apetit. Dim sum nouveau.  More than anything else, I love this concept.If I were a culinary artist, this would be the format I would choose by which to express my artistry.  I would be moved to capture fleeting thoughts inspired upon seeing a beautiful bouquet of fresh vegetables, colorful shades of edible flowers, or fish that literally jumped out of the sea into my lap.  Life is to celebrate these things.Anyhoo, I don't know if these are the things that inspire chef State Bird, but I sure am glad he shares his love for life and his culinary inspiration with the rest of us, in little portions.  You know he has vivid imagination, as he can throw together unlikely and complex pairings of ingredients, or present simple ingredients, as they are (nasturtium and balsamic ricotta?).  As with all artistic creations, not everything works perfectly, but I am just as glad to be on the ride to experience someone else's inspired moments.  It feels honest and genuine.As everyone says, the wait was very long (got in line at 5:30 to get a standing spot at 8:45, but the time estimate given to us by the hostess was quite accurate).  Nonetheless, I was amazed at how calm the chefs in the kitchen were.  In contrast to the perceived craziness (maybe it was more excited anticipation) of hungry-people-waiting-in-line-in-tiny-dining-room, the chefs in the kitchen were so not Hells-Kitchen, they were zen, calm and collected, and warm and friendly.  In the middle of making yummy corn pancakes, the lady chef who happened to see me watching flashed a warm smile.  And everyone else patiently answered my million and one questions, and one chef even put together a dish we requested even though it was not in his rotation.  They say they will be closed after August 11, 2013 for remodeling.  I hope it's for expansion, although hopefully its charm won't be lost in the process. Yeah, I definitely think SBP lives up to the hype and is one of the more delicious and interesting places to check out in SF right now. We got in line at 4:40pm on a Tuesday and made it in the first seating. The line was loooong behind us. I love the dim sum style eating--it was executed very well --and the service was great. Everything was easy. We had plenty to eat and I thought the end price tag was not too bad considering the quality of food. There were two items that we didn't think were amazing but everything else blew our minds. Loved, loved, loved it. AMAZING!!! I had heard great reviews from friends about this place and was nervous to be disappointed - my expectations were pretty high after all the rave reviews. The food was AMAZING. The service and attention to detail by the staff was AMAZING. The chefs and wait staff all work extremely hard and are a clearly passionate bunch. They work very hard to get food out quickly and let as many people enjoy their art. This place is a foodies dream. Everything we tasted we truly loved. I recommend asking the wait staff for their recommendations and being adventurous. You won't regret it!P.S. probably not the best place to take picky eaters. The food all tasted great amazing, but you have to be willing to try things out of your comfort zone. This is no ordinary experience. Let me start by saying I will probably never go back here without a reservation, or unless I can convince someone to get there at 4:00 and stand in line like others have told me to do. Instead, I showed up at 5:30, got my name in by 6:00 (yes, we waited in line for a half hour just to get our names down), and then told we could be seated at 9:45, maybe 9:15 if people didn't show up for reservations. We decided to kill time and catch a movie at Kabuki, grabbed a few drinks at a nearby wine bar, and 4 hours later we were finally seated at 10pm. The food itself was great, albeit very rich. Lots of creamy, cheesy, meat heavy plates. There were a few let downs (steak tartare, oysters with kimchi, and duck liver mousse), but some highlights (pork belly salad, corn pancakes, salmon tartare, pork ribs). I'm most amazed by the staff, incredibly friendly, impeccable service. Even with a full house, they were attentive and made our dining experience really pleasant. After about an hour, we were finished with dinner, stuffed silly, in pain from overeating. As we left, I think 5 or 6 people thanked us for dining with them. Wonderful staff, really. I just can't forgive the insane wait time, I do hope their expansion will help avoid this. State Bird Provisions has a special place in my heart, and I was so lucky to score seats to such a highly rated restaurant! Reservations are done months in advance, and make the whole seating process a lot quicker. A section of their seating is reserved for walk-ins, and as long as you line up at least an hour before they open (yes, there is already a small line outside by 4:30pm... and they open at 5:30pm), you can get seats. Also, this isn't the place for large groups. I would say parties of 4 at max, maybe even 3 max. I don't think they can merge tables, not with the amount of people inside. Probably would end in a fire hazard or something...Other than that, the place is pretty spacious, despite a packed house, with servers running around with trays of small dishes, or with the one dim sum cart packed with goodies! The servers come around fairly quickly, and explain everything in the dish, giving you a few moments to decide before moving on.The quality of the food was phenomenal, and everything was really delicious. Pricing was fairly cheap, considering what you got. Also, State Bird isn't one of those restaurant where you pay exorbitant prices for food the size of your palm on a plate the size of your head. Think dim sum... pretty much the same prices. And for those small plates that cost around $9-10, same price as a dim sum entree you order off the menu.Where to begin with the food? It's tough, as everything was good!Provisions-- Raw oysters with spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesame - Delicious! Fresh! The kraut give a small kick to the ocean flavors of the oysters.-- Guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth - Solid! The dumplings were well made, filling, and definitely a good addition to our meal.-- Corn & quinoa 'tabouleh' - Hands down, the highlight of our dinner (agreed by our entire group)! A really fresh dish, not weighed down by meat, but not underwhelmingly light or lacking. It blew some of our dishes out of the water, in terms of flavor and satisfaction!-- Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - Amazing! One of the few times I've had duck liver mousse, and it was a real treat. One of our first dishes, we were left wanting more after finishing every last bit!-- Steak tartar with jimmy nardello ranch - Really delicious, although a bit lacking. The entire dish was well put together, but it felt more like filler than flavor.-- Salmon tartar with pickled turnips - A better choice for tartar over the steak version. Felt lighter, and a solid salmon flavor.-- Pork belly plum salad - Yummy! The pork belly was cut into cubes before cooking, and they were still really fatty! The pork was really tasty, and the fat intensified the flavors and the savoriness of the dish. It was also great to see plum in a savory dish, rather than toppled on a salad. The plum added an extra layer of flavor and complexity to the dish!-- Salmon collar - Really tasty! A bit difficult to extract the meat, only because of the odd cut of the salmon. Quality fish, and a good try!Pancakes-- Sweet corn & mt. tam 'shortstack' - Really delicious! Very dense, and packed with flavor. Served with a corn powder that amplified the flavors. Glad each individual piece was small, so you don't have to force your way through a giant, thick pancake! Little packets of mouth-watering goodness.Commandable-- Pork spare ribs glased in their own juices - Amazing! For the price, you get quite a bit of pork. The pork isn't too dry or under-seasoned. For three people, it satisfied all of us.Dessert-- Birdseed bittersweet chocolate crunch, caramel cloud cream, blueberries - Delightful! A great end to an excellent meal! The chocolate crunch was really light, but definitely in good portions. The cloud cream was to die for! We had to call dibs on the last bits, seeing how good the dessert was!Drinks (SBP Sodas)-- Muddled Herb - Think of a mint mojito, but without the alcohol. Pretty much sums of the flavor of this drink.-- Strawberry Plum Vinegar - Three ingredients that melded well with each other. I went through this drink so quickly, and really wanted another! Such a good combination, and a wonderful drink to enjoy while eating delicious food.For the amount of food we ordered, we could have easily paid a lot more than what was on our bill. The food was really enjoyable and quite memorable. Dining at State Bird Provisions is an experience, and it definitely lives up to all the high reviews and the love of all its customers!I will definitely try to come back the next time I'm in the area! No lengthy in depth review here.  Everyone knows it's hard to get in (lots of acclaim + very few tables) but it's absolutely worth the wait.  I'm still shocked it didn't get into the Michelin guide because IMHO it blows many of those other restaurants away.  Pretty much everything that we ordered was amazing and it's very reasonably priced.  The chef is very approachable and even remembered us from the first time we ate there almost two years ago!  The staff is very friendly too.  Can't wait to go back. It's good, but not that good.  This place is way over-hyped; why is everybody so smitten with the dim sum style service?  What's the big deal with food coming around on push carts?  Chinese restaurants have been doing this for centuries and nobody gets all googley eyed over steamed buns rolling by your table.  That being said, the simpler dishes can be quite tasty, but several more complex dishes were just too disjointed in flavor profiles.  For example, clams and scallops cooked with kimchee and bacon and a mess of greens - not sure what was the star of the dish, but between the sour kimchee and salty powerful bacon, I couldn't taste much else.  Lots of asian flavor profiles here, but I'm not a fan of fusion asian food.  You will spend at least 50-60 bucks per person and probably leave feeling hungry (I was more satisfied with the Kokomen ramen I had right after going home from this place).  The servers were nice but kind of uninterested over all.  It's a bit of a hectic eating experience, and not the best place to enjoy a relaxing meal. The service was not good. However, the bartender was so nice!! He was friendly and helpful. I liked the salmon collar very much. Fatty and delicious. The buratta on Garlic bread was kinda boring. I was most excited about this, but it's a skip. The anchovy pancake was tasty, but the portion was minuscule! The corn and mt. tam pancakes were great. The best was a white tuna tartare on a nori cracker with black garlic aioli and avocado cream. Fabulous. The octopus with chickpeas was only ok. The line is cray though. I don't know whether State Bird Provisions (SBP) is the best new restaurant in America, as the James Beard award declares, but SBP is definitely the most exciting restaurant I've been to in the past year. Much has been written about the core concept being inspired from Dim Sum, but frankly, it is the execution, energy, and personality that set the restaurant apart from any reference point. The servers, and one of the owners (Stuart) who I didn't recognize then, are passionate about what they do, and you can see that in the glint in their eyes - as they also size you up on what would appeal to you!The modular, changing menu is divided into four distinct sections: Pancakes, Commandables, Desserts, and Provisions. You could order plates from the first three sections, and/or you could wait for the staff to bring in front of you a tray featuring a ""Provision"", and select it if you like what you see. The best strategy would be to pick a popular dish or two between the Commandables & Pancakes, and choose well amongst the Provisions brought forth at regular intervals. You could select 3 to 4 Provisions (small-ish), while leaving room for dessert... I totally got carried away and didn't pace myself well. Despite reading prior yelp reviews carefully I immediately pointed towards the almond biscuit and duck liver mousse, and the steak tartare with chips and jimmy nardello ranch. I didn't think much of the former (either the biscuit or the duck liver mousse), or the latter, other than being amused by the construction. These two misses were followed by the guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth. Though, the dumpling was little more than a bite, I liked the dish. Next, I nodded at the charred octopus with chickpeas and tomato salsa. Charred octopus is currently featuring prominently across cuisines and cities in America as a popular appetizer, and though I didn't think much of the octopus' texture (compared to superior versions in Greek restaurants of NYC), the tomato salsa played off really well with the chickpeas. Mindful of limited stomach capacity I skipped the garlic bread with burrata, and instead chose the smoked trout with potato porridge, poached egg, and Nori. This was the first of my five star experiences in the restaurant with the senses being given a thorough workout by the smokiness, textures, and flavors.  Trying to balance my indiscipline with some greens, I next ordered the SBP Thali salad from the Commandables. This dish features greens the restaurant grows such as shishito peppers, in addition to yogurt, curried cauliflower and pappadum. Typical of the fusion across cuisines successfully pulled off by SBP, I marveled at how well executed the pappadum was and how refreshing the dish was (5 stars). By this time, I had no discernible appetite remaining, and so I can't commend the next provision enough: albacore tuna, avocado on a plate of sea weed cracker - again a mélange of colors, textures and flavors, and not to be missed out is the perfection of the crunchy, seaweed cracker (5 stars!). Going with my fervent belief that desserts are processed by another stomach with separate capacity, I went with the mint ice cream sandwich accompanied by chocolate plum coulis, and pistachio. Personally, I thought the macaron sandwich did nothing to enhance the experience (other than being friendly to those who like gluten free), but the rest of the ingredients paired off well together (another 5 stars).With a glass of Rose (2012 Abbaye Saint Hilaire Coteaux Varois en Provence), and including taxes and tip my bill turned out to be $ 90 - which was much higher than expected for I clearly ate 2-3 dishes more than I should have. But then: what's a vacation if you're not splurging on yourself?Standing in line outside the restaurant (I was 35th despite getting in at 4:45 pm, well before the restaurant opens at 5:30 pm), in my 8th year I realized just how useful yelp is. I had checked in to the hotel at 4:15 pm, taken a bus straight to the restaurant, and was able to dine at one of America's premier restaurants, while a multitude of bemused locals and tourists passing by had no clue as to why the restaurant was so popular. Now, not only did I know where and why - but I also knew when to get in line, what to order and how much should I expect to pay. That's truly priceless!SBP is one of those rare cases where the whole is truly greater than the sum of its parts. So, yes, do get in that line before they take a summer break... Love this place!  Such a fun idea, serving CA cuisine dim-sum style!  Must haves: burrata w/garlic brioche, fried quail, and corn pancake w/Mt. Tam cheese.  To die for!  Reservations are hard to come by, but if you plan ahead it's worth the wait! We were lucky enough to be the other couple invited to State Bird on a double date- my friend somehow finagled a reservation, to which we owe her majorly.I have never had such an eclectic array of food before. It would be impossible to categorize it under anything as it was a mix of the heavy french, Mediterranean/seafood all with a dim sum experience. That's truly what this was- and experience. Sadly, seeing it's closing in August for expansion they are no longer taking reservations. So, a once in a lifetime experience it may be for me :(Here's what we had:Octopus salad w/garbanzo beans- very goodDuck and mushroom stew - very goodDuck liver mousse - very good, but VERY richFried green tomatoes - very goodSalmon/cucumber salad - Excellent, and a refreshing lightweight mix into the mealAhi Tuna and avocado puree on a crunchy seaweed cracker- EXCELLENTRibs - I DIED AND WENT TO HEAVENCorn quinoa - BOMB and lightBurrata in a croissant - SERIOUSLY? DIED AGAINGuinea hen dumpling - very good, rich as hell but goodMint ice cream sandwiches!!! WOWLoved it all, I really hope I can make it back in there again! Service was patient with all our questions and interactive throughout the entire night. I love how everyone ""worked together""- you'll see what I mean. ;)*Nice idea to grab a cask beer or glass of wine at Fat Angel next door beforehand! Feel like a debbie downer for slamming another place with such glowing reviews but I just can't perpetuate the hype, especially when some of the dishes were so sloppy. Let me start with the memorable dishes: the fried quail was perfectly cooked (and surprisingly) one of the more restrained dishes there. The onions, parmesan, and lemon all complemented each other with the right amount of acidity and salt. The clams and scallops with kimchee, on the other, hand was a hot mess. Between the kimchee and pickled green beans you were left with an overwhelming amount of sourness that nothing else came through. Seemed like every dish had three too many ingredients that never came together harmoniously. To top it off? We were seated for at least an hour and half and still never saw several of the dishes that were being passed around. You have to give the place credit for it's creativity. That said, I feel like people give creative concepts too much of a pass. If you're going to have an incredibly hard time to get a reservation and win numerous accolades, you should deliver delicious, memorable food. Nothing there struck me in a way that would make me ever crave it again (like Delfina's simple, yet stunning, spaghetti, or Ichi Sushi's unique nigiri combinations). That's why I don't think I'll ever be back again. Much better experience with my girl and her family. I'd really like to get a space at the bar and just pig out on everything. I must return soon. It was impossible to get a reservation at this place.  They book out 60 days in advance and there were never any available, so my wife and I decided to try the walk in route.  I got there on a Wednesday at 4:40 (they open at 530) and there were 10-15 people in front of us.  The line eventually quadrupled in size by the time 530 rolls around, and we were very fortunate to get the last two seats available (the couple behind us were told to come back in 2 hours).I loved how they take the concept of dim sum and turn it into the ultimate food experience.  You never know what dish will catch your eye.  Some of our favorites include:the state birdthe pork bellythe salmon cheekahi tuna (my favorite)the chocolate crunch dessertThey will be closing on Aug 11th and expanding so hopefully that will make reservations easier to come by. Whatever. I went and never need to return. Nice presentation and ambiance. Also servers are very nice.They use very fresh ingredients. However, the food lacks real flavor and umami. The owner should pay more attention to whathe or she prepares and presents to the customers. Do you LOVE amazingly eclectic food and superb service? SBP is worth the hype and the 60 day wait. Plus, you need to book a reservation online circa 5am in the morning when the reservations go live. Everything was divine. I would go back for the: soft egg/dashi potato/trout dish, pork belly, scallop/clam dish, fried quail, and the burrata with fried garlic bread.  YUM. in an unexpected location near japantown, across the street from woori market. down the block from western union. it only has the word ""PROVISIONS"" painted on the front; no sign and no ""state bird"" anywhere.i feel like we tried about 3/4 of what was available. overall everything was good; a few things were AWESOME; nothing was BAD but there were a couple of misses. see cheatsheet below.overall, a unique dining experience at a really reasonable price for the quality of food (we just kept ordering and ordering and it came out to a very reasonable $50-$60pp). not sure it's really the ""best new restaurant"" in america per the 2013 james beard awards, but i'll gladly come back if i can get a seat without too much effort.---cheatsheet5* so good i wanted to order seconds right then and there:- albacore tuna-avocado & seaweed cracker $9- heirloom tomatoes with eggplant & greek basil $6 (so simple but so delicious)- blackberry & plum jam-black pepper cake, summer morettini pears, hazelnuts $8 (reminded me of pound cake w/ strawberry jam - no 'pepper' flavor at all)4* would definitely get again:- salmon tartare with pickled turnips $10- mussels with diced potato- glazed salmon collar $63.5* good:- seared scallops & clams with spicy bacon-kimchi yuba $16 (i learned that 'yuba' is 'tofu skin'! never had this outside of chinese food before - a fun dish with good flavors)- CA state bird with provisions $16 (we got a ""large"" - shared between 4 people it was about a chicken nugget size each - nice and moist, like a very good chicken parmesan)2.5* not bad but not great:- roasted vegetable 'romesco' $5 (i love vegetables but this didn't do anything for me)- guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth $3 (looked really good but was not memorable at all)- fried pork belly vietnamese style with fish sauce and basil (interesting but not a home run... flavors were similar to getting fried fish cakes at a pho place)- steak tartare with jimmy nardello ranch $8 (nothing special)- garlic bread with burrata $8 (the ""bread"" was reminiscent of the 'chinese doughnuts' eaten with porridge and soy bean milk)- SBP 'thali' salad $10 (shishito peppers, yogurt something, and curried cauliflower - interesting but nothing really jumped out at me)- mint 'ice cream' sandwich, chocolate-fig coulis, pistachios $8- 'world peace' peanut muscovado milk $2 (the peanut version of almond milk - very straightforward flavor, lacking complexity)2* fatally flawed:- duck liver mousse with almond biscuit $6 (the almond 'biscuits' were really enticing and were good - but the duck liver mousse reminded me of paint thinner - someone else here said it was the alcohol, that's exactly it - extremely overpowering)- birdseed bittersweet chocolate crunch, caramel cloud cream, blueberries $8 (nestle crunch-like chunks - yum - in a bed of whipped caramel - way too sweet) Well, it was certainly an experience.A tip for the spontaneous: don't underestimate the line.  We ambled over at 4:40pm on Saturday and ended up 24th or something with a 9:45pm seating time.  Ultimately, we got bumped up earlier, but just be prepared and/or flexible.  And, if you can help it, be a small party.The attention to service felt almost curated...from the chocolate milk shots in line to the detailed intros of each laden tray to the whip-smart efficiency of the maitre d'.  And of course, it's a culinary paradigm shift: dim sum style transformed into a completely reinvented dining artifact: a modular, ever-changing menu, various seating arrangements, and an overall DIY-eclectic feel to the space all contributing to this culinary concept of self-made fun.However, I'm afraid that in execution, the concept slips a bit.  - All of the seafood dishes were hits: lobster salad, scallops and avocado quinoa, oysters, nori cracker with tombe tuna.  (I swear, that seafood cart is rolling straight to the foodie hall of fame.)- A couple more hits: state bird and peanut muscovado milk (I could pound shots of this all night long).- But several others were misses: guinea hen dumplings, spicy yuba noodles, ricotta dumpling, sweet corn and mt tam shortstack. (sounded good, but all the ingredients/flavors were muddled and dull.)- And a few others suffered from mis-pacing (inevitable in the dim sum format but regrettable all the same): garlic bread burrata, steak tartare with house made chips, and some crudo (and perhaps others?) that never made it by our tableSo, 3 stars on the food (with drinks, it came out to $120 before tip), but the passionate service and flat-out fun experience tip it over to 4 stars.  I think even execution and distribution remain significant challenges (or lures for additional visits?) but how can you not fall for a place that believes so much in itself that they'll see your full tummy and raise you a half serving of the chocolate ice cream sandwich?  Self-made menu, thank you very much. Bon Appetit said this was the Best Restaurant in the US.  So, natch, it is busy and buzzy.  The food is spectacularly creative; it's not a place to take that person who thinks a ""nice"" meal is a steak.  Everyone dining here knows they are going to eat food that, not only have they never tasted before, but never even imagined before.  SBP is farm to table dim sum, you order some off the menu and some off the madly tempting carts rolling by.  I usually don't care for oysters, but the fresh oyster with sauerkraut and? was like a dreamy mouthful of ocean.  Sweet corn and Mt. Tam goat cheese short stack of pancakes?  Heaven.  Red trout, mandarin and hazelnut-garum brown butter?  More, please.  And the desserts!  Often granitas taste like a mouthful of melted ice from your fridge.  The greengage plum granita with tapioca and berries?  My, MY. While the food is transporting, the best thing about the restaurant is how nice everyone is.  The host, the servers, the chefs--Stuart and Nicole--everyone is so jazzed to be there, and so happy you are there, and so delighted to eat the food that a meal at SBP becomes the special-est of special occasions. bestporkbellyEVERA wonderful time with friends, Emily and Derek...also loved the second plate of pork belly we had.  So full I did not have room for dessert, which I regret.  (Did I mention the pork belly?) My friend and I dined here on a Saturday evening in June.   We didn't have a reservation so was told by the hostess on the phone that we could wait in line for bar seating and dining room seating that are set aside for walkins.  She indicated that some people start lining up 45-1 hr beforehand.  We got there about 20 minutes before it opened.  There were already around 25+ people in line already.  We were told there was bar seating or standing room at the counter by the door at around 8pm.  We walked around Japantown and had a light snack across the street.  Luckily we received a text around 7:15pm letting us know our seats were available.  We ordered a total of 14 dishes (most were from the dim sum style trays that were passed around).  Some of dishes were ordered included:PROVISIONSCucumber with avocado and fried quinoa- I like the fried quinoaTwo raw oysters with spicy kohlrabi kraut and sesame- tastyGuinea hen dumpling with broth- I thought it was averagePork belly plum salad- I like pork belly so it was my second favorite dish.  Very flavorfulDuck liver mousse with almond biscuit- it was average White tuna & avocado on a crisp seaweed cracker-my favorite; very deliciousDevil egg with salmon tartar- this was good as wellPANCAKESUni pancake- I'm not a fan of Uni so didn't enjoy the dishCOMMANDABLESHalf order of the CA State bird  with provisions- it was crispy but slightly under seasoned.DESSERTWorld peace peanut milk- amuse bouche; quite tasty and not too sweetHalf order of two desserts, one of which was ice cream sandwich - it was goodIt was a very casual restaurant with friendly and attentive wait staff.  It was fun watching them prepare the food.  It wasn't difficult standing while eating but it was definitely our first time doing so.  We were told by our waiter that we ate more than two big men:-) If you don't have a reservation, like me =( , show up at 4:15 to be the first one in line, like me! =)I'm not going to give you a whole spiel about why this place is awesome.  I will say that this place serves tapa style dishes so it's best to go with at least 4 people- more people=more food to try!rabbit- tastes like chicken teriyakiduck liver mousse with almond biscuit- slather on a lot of the moussegarlic bread with burrata- yuMmmm!!!

Believe the hype. I had high hopes for this place given all the buzz and it absolutely exceeded my expectations. The food is incredible, inventive and on point. We had about 8-10 plates. It's damn near impossible to say no when the servers keep bringing around plate after plate of delicious steaming food fresh from the kitchen. The pork belly was stupid delicious. The barrata garlic bread was heavy, but soulful and bursting with flavor. The salmon belly, words can't describe. And don't forget to order a few tried and true dishes off the menu - the fried quail on top of the onions grilled in lemon are so good I might trade my first born for another plate. It's important to mention how cool the staff is as well. While the food rivals any fine dining in the city, the staff don't allow themselves to get caught in the pretentiousness that often accompanies high end dining. Each server was friendly and playful. The restaurant has a great sort of laid back atmosphere. The head chef and owner was there greeting people and helping with the service. Extremely humble and friendly, he embodies everything a head chef should be.Don't miss State Bird Provisions. It's worth the wait. 5 Stars for the food3 star for the Flow and Service. (please note this is not the servers themselves, who are wonderful, but the overall service experience)I am not an avid reviewer, but I have been here twice, each time with a similar experience so I thought it should be noted. First and foremost the food is simply fabulous, and you MUST save room for dessert! Faves...they do the most amazing things with quinoa  (who knew?!), the State Bird, tuna crudo, nd the Chocolate Birdseed dessert. The food is innovative, simple yet unique flavor profiles, not stuffy, and there is a wide variety of dishes to fit any palate. Now for the concept and service. Once you get seated, you will be greeted by a wonderfully friendly server, who will explain how things work. Then they leave and you can just start picking up plates as they are passed around. Issue...After that initial interaction it is really hard to get their attention. No one comes back to take your drink order! You literally have to flag someone down (after 10 minutes) to order a glass of wine. Meanwhile you see two servers setting a 4-top, while you are still parched and wanting that lovely glass of wine. Next...the passed plates. I wish there was a list (either verbal or written) of the evenings ""tapas"". The flow of the passed dishes is not always consistent, and unfortunately if you are seated not at the front tables, the trays are empty before they get to you. There were several dishes that we missed due to this. We also missed out on the duck liver mousse, bec we didnt see that until we were half way through dessert. We finally asked a server what else they were passing around so we'd have an idea. If we knew what was coming, we could have paced our meal better. You kind of get a feeling of being left to fend for yourself, and it's up to you to ask what is coming next or flag someone down if you want something. State Bird...I love ya, but the service flow issues need to be worked out. Maybe with the new reno??? I also hear the counter is THE place to be. Wish we could have sat there with our reservation. First time we had reservations, second time we got there a half-hour before they opened, and waited in line. You get a seating time, so we went to The Social Study nearby and killed some. The wait is worth it. Our favorite/stand-out item was hands down the SBP 'thali' salad. Of course everything else was excellent too.The girl with the messy blonde hair who handled the reservations/seating times is one of the best service industry associates I've seen; especially having to deal with the SF crowd. We are needy! This is one of those San Francisco dining experiences that you must try. Dim Sum style dining with cuisine from all different cultures? Who would have thought? We came into the meal with sky high expectations thanks to all of the attention State Bird is getting, and we were not disappointed. The food was all amazing!! The restaurant is tiny so now I understand why it is impossible to get a reservation. The vibe is a bit hipster but not over the top.One negative, we had a late reservation, maybe 930 or so. We showed up a bit early and were told it would be a little while until our reservation. Ok no problem. We told the hostess we are going right next door to the Social Study and we'll be back for our reservation time. We showed up 5 minutes after 930 and we were told that our table was given away because we weren't there on time..............Pretty poor. So we had another drink and were seated a little after 10. The menu changes often so I won't give the complete rundown but 95% of the things we tasted were amazing. The flavors and concepts are so different that this is truly a one-of-a-kind experience. Try not to overdo it at the beginning of the meal because you will be fighting back the urge to grab 3 of everything that comes by. It actually ends up being a good thing because you don't really have to decide too much, just get everything. It's great to come with a group of people so you can try lots of different things. Dinner wasn't cheap, about 240$ for 3 people and we didn't drink too much. If we can ever score another reservation we'll surely be back. An awesome restaurant. It is difficult not being glib, and joining the chorus, when I say this is Bay Area fresh/local angled diverse dim sum. AKA small plates of delightful and interesting ingredients rushed past you at a fever pitch. I might even toss in the concept ""gastropub"", because the lack of pretension, as well as paired down but frenetic service, certainly simplifies expectation - just grab what excites you, and pass on anything, without guilt.  The nature of dim sum means this can get spendy in a short period of time, but it's important to romp through the typical menu, and try one or two things off the specials menu.  The quail, the beef, the lamb, oh my....  I am fairly certain it's a worthwhile meal, and a proper way to spend hard earned money.  The only thing is that it may be addictive - you might want to save 2x as much, because you will want to go back.  For such a hip and in demand restaurant, it is nice they allow access by refraining from booking all their tables... It used to be 5p, but show up by 4.30p (or earlier) to hopefully guarantee a first seating when they open at 5.30p.  If you can get there earlier, or have one hold the spot for more, it's a wise idea.  It's truly worth the wait - just don't expect Michelin level china or tablecloths.  This is a room full of people truly excited to be there, proud of what they are producing, and just as excited as the people coming to wait in line. Liked most of the 16 dishes we tried!  Love that the plates are small so we can try a variety of stuff.  Group favorites include grilled octopus, anchovies sesame pancake, ice cream sandwich, fried green tomato, and balsamic roasted figs. Their brilliant concept of a dim sum restaurant serving dishes of infused cuisines from all over the world =  get here early or make a reservation.You will not be disappointed. Read a review of a local Atlanta joint that mentions this place so on a trip to San Francisco we decided to check it out. Went to the web site and had trouble making reservations so we took a chance and showed up at opening to a line out the door.It turns out they hold a third of the seating for walk ups but you need to put in your name ahead of time. We were able to get one of the last time slots of the day (10:45) which was late but we really wanted to try it.Before I get to the food the real stars of this place is the staff. A place of this kid of demand could have a stuffy staff but no. The host was as kind and accommodating as could be. I'm sure she gets a lot of people upset with not getting in or seating so late but you would not know it she is like a ball of sunshine.The wait staff including our waitress was also friendly and really explained the food and showed a great deal of pride in the work of the restaurant. I wish this group could train other staffs.The food was wonderful and familiar while still being creative. We went a little overboard sampling every dish that came by and ordering off the menu but it was worth it. The rabbit and potato salad really was the highlight for me. This place can be as expensive or reasonable as you want it to be if you have the will power to do so.Worth the wait. I rarely give FIVE stars to a place but WOW was this amazing.  We got in line about an hour before they opened to try and get the scarce bar seating but alas, we were not early enough!  However, we were game to try the ""Chef's Table"" right by the window where you stand for the meal and it was awesome.  Seriously.  I kind of loved getting to stand and see the action right there - not to mention talk to the totally subdued and very genial chef / owner.  Next time, I do think I want to try to get a reservation and sit to see what the difference was.  First of all, the way the waitstaff / cooks work is a thing of genius -- they are all able to help you / take your order at any time.  It's kind of like dim sum in that they will bring around the specials of the week -- I think they change the menu every week or so.  Highlights include: pork belly with peaches and fennel, smoked fish with corn and dill, the pancakes (both sardine and sauerkraut), sushi cracker with tombo.  All of it exquisit.  GO.  It's worth the wait.  This is a unique and wonderful dining experience and we are lucky to have it here in SF. Wow....don't be picky. Say yes to everything and you'll be pleasantly surprised. Favorite dish: almond biscuits with goose liver mousse...yeah, super good.  I will say though, as is the problem with many restaurants in SF...you're not just paying for the good food, you're also paying for the privelige to sit in the seat...and something about that just rubs me the wrong way, hence the four stars instead of 5...but seriously, it was a great dining experience. I love this restaurant. My fiancee and I have been lucky enough to go twice in the past 6 months.The experience here is one you will not find anywhere else. The eclectic mix of the delicious gourmet dishes is quite amazing.Last time we went we were extremely lucky and got to sit at the 'chefs table' which is basically the bar right in front of the open kitchen. It was such an amazing experience. To watch them create the dishes right in front of you, and also get the chance to choose what you want first! The chefs are amazing and very friendly, we talked with them almost the entire time. I admit, you need to be a little adventurous to come here, I am a very adventurous eater, but my fiancée  is not as much, but she still loved it. (though she did not try any duck liver mousse or the sweetbread meatballs).I really have to go back to what an amazing overall experience it is to eat here, all of the dishes are amazing, delicious combinations of ingredients you would sometimes never expect to be together. It is fun to try all the different dishes, allowing you to eat a vast array of things, much much more than you would at any normal restaurant. The best part is that you really don't have to do much deciding. You just have to say YES when that cart or that tray comes around. One of my favorites was the pork belly and citrus salad. The flavor of the pork and the fat mixed with that citrus (i believe orange and grapefruit) was a delicious explosion in your mouth, the way the citrus cut through the fat was amazing.Every dish is an experience like that, each bite exploding with flavor.I really could not recommend this place any higher. The only bad thing is trying to find parking and actually getting reservations! Haha...Oh, and you have to try the 'world peace' Peanut  milk with muscovado at the end of your meal. its sooo delicious, its something everyone should experience. What a great, GREAT restaurant!I was in line outside the restaurant as it was about to open, thinking I had little chance to get in that night. Once I got to the dining room manager, I was told the next table was about 4 hours from now. I was about to turn around when she went to talk to the chefs and suggested to make room at the end of the counter for ""table 100"", literally in the chefs' kitchen. Eating and chatting with the chefs made this experience even more memorable. They were really fun and made it a really fun dinner experience.The food you'll ask? Fantastic. I couldn't help myself and got almost all the plates that were offered to me. Favourites: shitake mushroom ravioli in broth, garlic bread with burrata cheese on top, the rabbit and fontina croquettes (OMG!), and the ricotta dumplings!I know it is booked weeks in advance, but do take the chance, it is worth the wait in every way! Holy schnikes.  If this place doesn't collect a few Michelin stars in the future, then perhaps I ought to stop eating out at awesome dining establishments.Let's hope they get those stars.The fiance and I decided to throw caution to the wind and our food destiny to the food deities above and went early to get on the wait list for the legendary State Bird Provisions.  Two hours later, we were rewarded.To save everyone the tiresome, long winded review... the highlights were:- Anchovy sesame pancake.  Get it.  Get two.  Just get it.- State bird with provisions.  It's the namesake, so you have to.  It's like an unspoken rule and you will be judged if you do not follow.- Salmon belly. OMG.  Fatty, tender, juicy, NOM.- Everything in general.  If you can eye a few things first and make sure to save plenty of room to try all of the ""dim sum"" items.Oh, and ask your server for help.  Daniel, who was our food ally of the night, came by and asked if we had already tried some small dishes and made sure we didn't miss any stellar hits.  Huuuuge thanks to him!Recommended tips:- If reservations are out of the question, go extra early for the wait list.  For us, going forty minutes before opening meant eating at 8pm.  If you're able to swing it, definitely try to get there as early as possible if you are swinging by town.  Head over to Japantown (or further north on Fillmore) if you need to burn some time.  It also gives you a great chance to talk more with your dining partners.  Oh, and if it's just the pair of you, ask for the counter!- Pick a few from the menu...definitely wait on the ""dim sum"" items that are unlisted.  Even though the menu was tempting, the ""off menu"" items were definitely worth it.  If it's your first time, you must try the State Bird with provisions (that goes without saying) and, again, the anchovy pancake.- Dessert isn't mandatory.  If you have to plot out your stomach space, as rare as it is for me to say, dessert isn't something you would feel too sad about missing out on. Even though the 'ice cream' sandwiches were tasty...it was okay.  The savory items outshone the sweets on this food trip. Amazing.  Fresh, seasonal.  And the staff was equally amazing.  Yeah, lining up hours ahead of time is quirky at best, but it was still worth it in the end.  We ended up going across the street for drinks and to hang for a bit i was so looking to state bird provision.  it took at least 5 attempts and planning many months in advance to finally secure a reservation at a reasonable dinner time. I thought going on 7/3 would be a great way to start the long weekend, little did i know I would walk out of there disappointed.  maybe i set my expectation way too high due to the james beard award.  I am so sad :( The dishes were interesting.  dim sum style american food with an asian twist.  I tried 1)  Guinea Hen Dumpling (gyoza in a sour broth) 1 piece $32)  Rabbit & Fontina Croquettes (2 meatball size $5)3)  Tombo Tuna-avocado & Seaweed Cracker ($9)4)  Charred Octopus In Tomato-chickpea Salsa ($8)5)  corn pancake (a small stack $10)6)  Grilled Beef ($16)!!!!  this was actually a salad dish with cooked asian vegetables, bok choy, scallion , and shitake mushroom in vinaigrette sauce7)   trout with claims ($9??)8)  lobster/scallop ($12)extremely small portion/bite size (i mean literally bite sized) for the price.  almost everything came room temp or cold except for the croquette and the pancake which were warm.  the octopus was fresh, reminded me of fresh calamari in Italy.  The steak was good although I seriously thought i was getting a hot steak dish but a salad came instead.  the warm bok choy and scallion mixed with cold salad complementing the meat was odd.  I have tried a lot of fusion, and is a huge fan, but state bird's asian twist just wasn't for me.  some asian dishes should remain its original goodness (i.e.:  the gyoza).  the food were on the oily side.  tho i must give the waiter/waitress credits.  the service was great, everyone was knowledgeable, helpful, and efficient.we spent $90 for dinner without drinks or dessert. seriously, for this price, I could be dinning at so many other amazing restaurants in the city. Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here. Loved the concept, loved the rolling dim sum carts, and the service was so friendly. We snagged reservations 60 days in advance, and I am glad we did because I saw the walk-in line.... looked brutal.Favorites:1. duck liver mousse with almond biscuit2. sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancake (the sauerkraut salt was incredible! I wish I could buy some to put on everything...)3. CA state bird with provisions4. ricotta dumplings with spring onion & sunflower seedsOther notables:1. chocolate 'ice cream' sandwich with cherries2. guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth3. raw oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesame4. lobster with corn & green corianderProbably wouldn't recommend:1. balsamic roasted figs with fondue2. garlic bread with burrataThat was all the food we ordered for 2 people. Plenty... With a blackberry limeade, the total was $80 before tip. Not bad at all! Will definitely be back. Variety of food and flavors.Huge Tip:  Try to keep track of what items just came out and what items have been making the rounds.  It is a huge difference; just imagine food fresh out of the oven, versus room temp food...Some things tasted pretty good, but I don't feel they have a dish that people would rave about; it's the variety that people seem to love. Some friends wanted to go to State Bird, so the foodie that I am, I was willing to give it another try.  I am so happy we went!  Service was great, and we ordered to our hearts' content -- the food was yummy and I would come back again for sure! go wait in line. Currently subdued in a lobster-and-fried-tomato-induced comatose bliss, I do believe that State Bird lives up to the hype. The service was impeccable from threshold to farewell, the charming chef and his crew crafted a seamlessly delicious dim-sum style culinary experience. The genuine warmth and friendly expertise of the staff was impressive and heartfelt--for this alone I would return. The menu is constantly shifting, but the staples we indulged in (The State Bird Provision--aka the crispy quail, the trout, the fried green tomatos, and the sweet corn pancakes) were flawless. For dessert, we had the most incredible caramelized coconut cake with a dark chocolate drizzle as well as a berry-infused peach rice pudding--both were some of the most wonderful sweets I've ever had the luxury to taste. This outing is well worth the several month reservation wait. State Bird doesn't miss a beat, and the unique opportunity to try so many exquisite plates in one sitting is a rare, exciting treat. Book it--giggling in elation with my friends over how many different amazing bites we tasted is a memory I won't soon forget. This place is Amaze-balls!  Came by for the second time in two weeks and it was actually more amazing than the last.  New love....ricotta dumplings!  This time only waited 30 min, and was able to kill time with a beer around the corner. Wow. This place blew my mind! So many delicious options, great service, and just an overall delightful experience. We didn't have a reservation but got in line around 5:20pm and got seated immediately! Definitely get the sauerkraut pancakes off the menu. They are insanely delicious!! Have you ever been to a restaurant that has so many interesting dishes on the menu that you want to try everything?? And what if almost every single thing actually WAS good? Well, that's State Bird. My mouth still waters thinking about it.They have an interesting serving style, where most of the dishes are NOT on the menu. Instead, they bring out small plates around, dim-sum style, and you can decide if you want to eat it or not.  This allows you to try out a variety of different dishes, as opposed to the 1-2 appetizers and an entree that you would normally get at regular restaurants.It looks like the menu changes all the time, but some of the highlights from when I went were the grilled baby octopus, ricotta dumplings with shimeji mushrooms, duck liver mousse with honey cornbread, and some clam dish which had a very Japanese-style flavoring to it. We had about 11-12 dishes total, and all but one were excellent!I definitely want to go back, but I hope I can get a reservation... This place is amazing!  It's like getting an amazing tasting menu where you get to pick your options.  I must have tried like 10 different dishes among my friends and I liked them all.  Ended up spending about $62/person with tax and tip.  They are going to be closing for renovations (making the place bigger) in August so they aren't taking any more reservations (they are booked!).  If you want to eat there you have to get there about 45 minutes early and wait in line! State Bird Provisions is one of those places you just have to try at least once.It's american food, it's tapas style, it's served in carts rolled by the different waiters and waitresses that try to sell you the item.Each item has a price, and you get a card with different prices on it, and each time you pick something from the cart, they put a tally next to the price.There are a couple of mains and dessert that are made to order, I guess because this would probably not taste that good if it was carted around and cold or melted.I took pictures of the whole thing, I'll have to post some photos soon.  I really enjoyed it and I highly recommend that you try it once.This is the problem with not writing a review immediately after eating.  It's so hard to remember what you ate.  But the important part is that if the restaurant was so good that it #1 compels you to write something #2 you just have an overall great feeling of when you were there.So go if you can get a reservation. If you can't, my suggestion is go early, like around 4 or 5, usually the first 10 people can snag a seat.  ( provided that you're not an asshole that brings 10 friends with you to a small, cozy, chill restaurant like this) This was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had! We loved all of the food and the staff was very informative and made us feel right at home! I love how they come around with carts, you never know what's coming next! If you can get a reservation, 5:30 is probably the best time so you're seated right when they open! After several late night/early morning reservation booking attempts and having to give away my reservation a month and a half ago at the last minute, I FINALLY went to State Bird Provisions last night!i would not advise going without a reservation. I've heard stories of 4 hour wait times and I saw firsthand some walk-ins eating their meals standing. BUT they are closing for a few weeks starting August 10th to expand the place so hopefully that'll help with the wait/reservation situation.Regardless, this place is worth any reservation/wait-time hoops you have to jump. Very rarely do I find that places meet the hype and almost never do they exceed it! State Bird Provisions is amazing on all fronts.There are around 20 menu items that you can order plus another 12 dim-sum style items that come around on carts and trays (all explained to you by really knowledgeable and patient waiters and all labeled with the price so you don't feel at all hoodwinked).Everything we had was delicious, here's what I can remember though not all will be available when you go...From the menu:- the state bird: nor particularly meaty but the fried skin was insane. Oh, and the onions and cheese! All worked perfectly together.- anchovy pancake: I don't like anchovies but this was incredible. Makes me want to start putting anchovies on everything but I have a feeling it won't be as delicious as they make it here- sourdough sauerkraut and ricotta pancake: another winner, served with dehydrated sauerkraut in a sort of salt form. Just beyond anything I could ever fathom.- the beef: served with broccoli, bok choy and cooked a perfect medium rare- the duck with cloud ears: this was probably the closest to traditional versions; still delicious- quail eggs: I am not big on egg dishes but this was so tasty- chocolate pistachio torte: good but not as good as....- chocolate ice cream sandwich: the ""bread"" of this sandwich is a delectable white brownie; mind-blowing.From the carts/trays:- scallops with avocado: I wish someone would try to drown me in it so I would be challenged to eat my way out- the clams: another seafood hit- liver mousse with almond biscuits: the mousse was light as air and the bread balls (sweet like cornbread!) were perfection- ahi tuna with avocado on a seaweed crisp: I'm probably not describing this accurately at all but it was divine and a favorite of our table (but really, everything was)What I wish we had gotten:- the fried oysters looked terrific- the lobster salad (genuinely regretting this)- cherry granita dessert- kim chi- everything elseWhile it was hard to notice anything else but the amazing and inspired food, the service was beyond reproach. The staff was so nice and patient (we were a bit overwhelmed but needing to make snap decisions with the dim sum options, especially in the beginning and they were happy to re-explain the system or give us our time). The waiters and even the chef himself (genius!) come around very frequently to check on us, refill water, replace our plates every few dishes, provide recommendations. All around stellar service.You honestly can't go wrong in this place. I earnestly believe every dish is a winner. Coming back here in a few weeks! We waited in a queue for an hour to get a reservation or that night at 9pm which we didn't mind and is to be expected in san francisco where for some strange reason people queue up for almost all restaurants! When we arrived at 9 it was another 45 minute wait standing awkwardly in their narrow corridor waiting for a table to open up. Their system is really terrible, they have your cell phone number, I'm not sure why they can't just send you away to have drinks elsewhere and give you a call when your tables ready?! Instead, the (very polite) host kept telling us tables were about to open up in the next few minutes and that we were the next table to be seated and then proceeded to seat other parties before us. It's really not fun to be lied to... The food cart is way too slow, and we waited far too long for the cart to show up at out table by which time it was empty and we had to choose from the scraps other tables didn't want... By this time we were starving and I had to ask our waitress to bring us something, ANYTHING for us to try. The wait staff are really lovely and friendly.The food was good, really loved their duck mousse, the rabbit we were told was served with romesco but it was quite obviously not romesco sauce but some sort of cold green guacamole beany thing, found the rabbit to be a bit on the dry side and overly salty, the garlic bread with burrata was divine, the deep fried quail dish was perfectly balanced with its accompaniments and peanut milk was deliciously simple. We had their cocoa ice cream sandwich which I found to be far too sweet and not enjoyable. I would recommend the place to others but this restaurant really needs to work on their seating system if they want happy diners! The food was good but I'm not sure if it was worth that sort of wait... This was flat-out one of my best dining experiences!!I knew going in that getting a seating would be a challenge. I decided with a friend to go in on a Monday as close to opening time as possible. They open at 5:30 pm and I heard that people sometimes line up at 4:30 pm. Well, we both had work on Monday, so we got there at 5:55pm (I remember because we had to put in 5 minutes worth of coins at the meter). There was a line to put your name on the list. When we got to the front about 10 minutes later, the dude was super nice and let us know that unfortunately all the seats were taken for the night. Wow!! But, they had standing room available at 8:45pm. Cancellations could potentially change things, but otherwise the only option was to have us stand at the counter right by the door. It didn't seem ideal, but we agreed. They took our # and would call us when ready. The whole experience would normally have been frustrating anywhere else, but here the dude was so polite and nice, that we were impressed. We ended up going to Fat Angel for a drink and then Pride of the Mediterranean for Hookah and had an awesome evening waiting for our table.  Okay...so now to the actual dining experience. We were hoping to get bar seating, but ended up at the standing are as originally planned. Turns out that this is the best ""seat"" in the house. Yes, we were right by the door, but we were facing the kitchen and right by the action. Every chef came over and talked to us while doing their thing throughout the night. Everyone was so friendly. They were absolutely slammed with a packed house, but they always took time to talk with us. No one was rushing around, the service never felt hurried, people joked with us when bringing around the food...it was great. The best part was that everyone in the kitchen was having fun! The standing area almost made you feel like you were part of that fun...and that makes the overall experience so ridiculously awesome. Now, the food...Have you ever read one of those ""Choose your own adventure"" books? You flip to a certain page if you want the character to do this or that. Keep that in mind. Now think about a fancy sit down tasting menu with carefully composed dishes at a place like Coi, Ame, Michael Minna, etc.  Now...combine the two, and you have SBP. Yes...that's right...AMAZING. Seriously...each dish could hold it's own against individual tasting menu dishes at a fancy Michelin rated restaurant. But the advantage to SBP is that you can choose your own dining adventure. You can pick whatever suits your mood. From Artichoke Bread Salad to Curried Scallops to Pork Belly to Garlic Bread & Burratta, each dish is unique and composed with various tastes to culinary perfection. It's a completely out of this world experience in the perfect dining environment. Desserts are just as phenomenal. I'm not going to describe each dish...you should just go there and try them out. They have something like 16 dishes that get passed around, plus over 10 more that are listed on the menu that you can order. There are several vegetarian dishes...in fact more than half our dishes were veggie, and they were delicious!I know there are some low Yelp Ratings in other reviews...that's fine. But trust me...make the effort to get a seat...or better yet...STAND. Try it yourself, and make your own decision. Good thing is that you don't have much to lose. If you don't like the food, you can leave after the first dish. But I'm pretty sure you're going to keep ordering more and have a ridiculously amazing dining experience similar to ours. SBP - you guys rock. From the very first taste of the first dish, through the 13 other dishes, all the way down to the last drop of the peanut butter milk shot, we absolutely loved every bit of it. Adding to that was the amazing fun attitude of every person in the kitchen, the wait staff...everyone. Make the entire experience over the top. Thanks, and we'll be back very very soon! You want it.All of it.You just don't know it yet.Until they show you.Presenting their provision wares, all fancy like.You'll be reduced to a fat kid in a candy store. Plenty of ooh's & aah's will be said.Your eyes will be making dirty love to each platter.Stupid pervert eyes with expensive taste.Temptation at every corner. You're in big trouble, mister.Temptation doesn't come cheap, but they deliver on the promise to make it worth it.What can I say, this is possibly the most engaging, interesting, diversely tasty and most FUN dinner I've had all year.Elevated dim-sum in a non-pretentious atmosphere with a personable staff getting down with some creatively delicious provisions that you can't get enough of. I stay in the know in LA, but I can thank my chef lover for knowing about this new gem in SF that I had no clue about. We came to the walk-in line that was probably a good 20 deep by the time we got there. Our estimated wait time was about 3 hours from when they opened, so we meandered around town until then. We were seated at the bars that surround the open kitchen and it made for interesting banter and fun sights.Some of my favorite + most memorable provisions:Tombo tuna-avocado & seaweed cracker: YUM! And so pretty too. For the love of KING TRITON, people, if this dish is till on the menu when you go, please note that the seaweed cracker ""plate"" is not a plate. It's part of the dish that is meant to be eaten. You are MISSING OUT if you don't eat this as intended. We saw people around us picking the tuna and leaving the seaweed..which was lightly fried and crispy..one of the most delicious elements.Curried scallop & avocado with crunchy quinoa: A delightfully fresh, textural treat.Guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth: I love how they pour the broth when you nod ""yes"" furiously upon seeing the tray holding these. This was delicious & so flavorful and just right.Balsamic roasted figs with fonduePork belly peach salad: I love how the peaches cut through the heaviness of the pork belly, making this dish feel surprisingly light.Ricotta dumplings with spring onion & sunflower seeds: I think this was the dish I was thinking of...the little yellow guys on a plate. Loved it.I found the pancakes on the regular menu to be overly loaded with butter for my taste, especially at their petite proportions. But, you might like it. Overall, I recommend coming here when you find yourself in SF. for a true San Francisco treat. This is a hipster joint. the food is good, but the food is disjointed and shares a similar fate IMHO to plum in oakland. everything has a vinegar or pickle component that just makes everything one note.I think the dim sum style eating choices is a bad idea. we tried about 15 dishes in total and there was no flow to the meal.we had the following items in this order1.garlic cheese bread - we got this because the lady said its the last one and we should get it cause its good, well its not good. it was stale and had a clump of soft cheese on top with pepper. what really ticked me off was that 10 min later they made a fresh batch of it. im sure if i had known it would be passed around again i would have waited2. rabbit meatballs - these were filled with cheese and had a creamy tomato sauce. just meh, it was over cooked and usually with rabbit you want to add some sort of fat cause its so lean, nope not here. the meatball reminded me of a cheese stuffed meatball i got at applebees.3. oyster - the oyster was good, it was fresh and expertly shucked. the only issue with the oyster was the sauce it came with. pickled salad of radish. its hard to beat an oyster with lemon and tabasco. this one did not4.sashimi - this was by far the best dish. it was sashimi of white fish with wasabi and various other ingredients served on a blue nori plate. this is where i have an issue with flow. this dish was balanced and delicate and should have been served first. unfortunately it was served in the middle of fatty overpowering vinegar/pickled dishes that muted the subtle flavor combination. if this dish was served to me first i probally would have given this place another start based on this alone.** at this point (15m into our meal) we decided to place an order from the menu we ordered the grilled beef and corn pancakes5. ricotta dumpling - this was horrid. so bland could have used some salt and the mushrooms tasted like canned. i almost spit the mushrooms out but decided to swallow as i was sitting directly in front of the chef who made them and she was watching for my approval.6. cured lemon dumpling - just ok but for 6 bucks for one dumpling i wanted better7. pork belly - this would have been the state birds saving grace. It was crispy pork belly with Asian cilantro jalapeño salad with peaches the flavor combination is great and it has the wow factor that foodies love when trying a new dish in fact I would go back just for this. My issue is with the dim sum format you see I was watching them make it and was salivating for my opportunity to get the first ""dibs"" on it, but they  skipped right passed me and I got the last dish on its way back when it was no longer crispy and the salad wilted. Such a shame cause this dish could have been the difference between the 2 stars im giving it and 4 stars it could have earned** another update, at this point im watching them make the beef and pancakes and i see that this might be more of the same potentially amazing food that i got a glimpse of with the pork belly. the chef finishes and plates my dishes and tells the server where its destiny lies, the the server mistakenly brings it to the couple sitting next to me. arggggh8. kim chi salad - this was good. very asian flavors as expected, had smoked egg on it and i liked it9. duck liver mousse - this was the weakest dish by far it was almond cake like cookies with a alcohol tasting mousse. the cakes taste like desert and the mouse which had a great texture was overpowered by the port that it was infused with10. squid salad - great taste but sadly over cooked, was like seafood chewing gum**10 at this point i see that my beef and pancakes have been made and served to other people that ordered after me. and im not happy about it, but im starting to think it was a happy accident cause im pretty full. we grab a waitress and inform her to cancel the two orders but instead she insists that the items being made currently are earmarked for us and its too late.11. grilled beef - this was a major disappointment, the beef was expertly cooked to a medium   doneness but again covered in vinegar. i just dont get it, if i want vinegar flavor ill order a salad, if i order beef i want beef flavor12. corn pancakes - just plain corn pancakes. not great, just standarddished 13, 14, and 15 were dishes that they pretty much guilted me into getting. sometimes the chef said that he made it for us cause he thought we would like it, sometimes they said the dish is the best and will not be made again tonight. whatever the reason every time we got guilted into taking one we were disappointed.my final recommendation would be to by all means check this place out, but its not anywhere near the level of food that people are reviewing as such.save your money and you can get many of the same flavors at your local highly rated cheap Chinese/vietnamese/asian restaurant"|5|100|0|Routine|This inspection has no violations.|GOOD: no inspection needed
State Bird Provisions 2|4.5|Tapas/Small Plates in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|1051|2|4.2543554006968645|" Excellent Service! Excellent Food! Excellent Décor!It is difficult to get a reservation here at State Bird Provisions. HINT: trick is to get here early before they open at 5:30PM and get on their walk-in list. I've seen folk line up as early as 4:30PM! My recommendation would be getting here around 5PM. If you're lucky, you can get a table when they open. If not, most likely you would get a table for 2 at 7PM or later at 9PM. This restaurant is not meant for large party; best to have a party of four max.Emily, our hostess, was a warm and welcoming face for Provision and 'seated' us by 7pm by the standing table (door area), Even though I was at the standing table , I thought it was one of the best 'seats' in the house. We got to interact with various sous chefs and was usually offered first in everything that was coming out of the kitchen. At Provision, they bring out a platter of the same dish (similar to the idea of dim sum) for you to take or not to take. If you do decide to take a dish, they will mark your menu and keep track of your orders. There are also dishes you can order off the menu, but the best ones are the fresh ones coming out of the kitchen for you to nab. I've literally almost tried everything that was coming out of the kitchen. What stood out for me even after a month were  the Hamachi Nori Cracker and the Macaroon Ice Cream Sandwich. Everyone should have their own Cracker and Ice Cream for sure! It's so good that you won't want to share!Tip: - free dessert shot if 'seated' by the standing table' (by front door)-kill some time with Happy Hour close by on weekdays-wear comfortable shoes Overall, Provision was so good that I wanted to grab another meal before I left the Bay area. Unfortunately, they are closed on Mondays. Provision would you please send me some yummy Macaroon Ice Cream Sandwiches? A girl can dream, right? Keep up the good work;  your dishes are tasty and creative, till my next visit! It was the most over-hyped restaurant of all time. I walked in at 845pm on a wed night and was immediately seated  with no reservation. Shortly after, a massive line formed so I guess I was really lucky.We ordered the sour dough pancakes and state bird off of the menu and got the rest of the dishes from the carts.The first thing we ate was the dumplings which were not much better than a pot sticker. Not impressed.Our statebird came and was a great dish. Probably the best quail I have and will ever eat but it begged the question why you would even want to eat quail in the first place. It was rough on the outside but juicy on the inside. Pretty good but felt like i was eating a fancy chicken wing.Next, the seafood cart came and I ordered three items, a lobster and honeydew dish, a scallop dish and some stopped oysters. The oysters were actually really great. I cannot remember what the topping was but it was a nice addition to a strait oyster on the half shell. The scallop and lobster dishes were good and creative but just did not blow me away with taste.lastly, the pancakes came and were pretty tasty and interesting. Sort of a new take on a latke. Again, a creative and tasty dish but nothing that I would crave.And that was it. I walked out of there wondering what all the fuss was about. With not hype this place would have probably gotten a 4/5 from me. The food is well prepared and there are some creative dishes for sure. However, due to the hype I am going to give it a 3/5 as it set my expectations too high. I also really liked the dim sum theme. However, at the end of the day, the taste of the food is the most important part of the meal and I have tasted better food elsewhere. This was one of my favorite meals, ever. I love small plates. Each dish we tried was surprising and exciting. The atmosphere was fun and relaxed.  My only complaint: hearing the thumping of club music while eating is annoying. The first time this place caught my eye was when I read about it in Bon Appetit in the top 10 Best New Restaurants in America article. One of my girlfriends managed to get us a reservation for 4 (over a month in advance) and I heard so much hype and positive reviews on this place that I flew up to San Francisco to try it for myself.End result: worth every penny.It's really a great place -- the whole ""dim sum"" spin on things is truly brilliant. While the food was delicious, the whole dining experience is really what made everything memorable. It's just a great little space to go to with a bunch of friends and just hang out and eat (and eat, and eat). I can honestly say that we didn't pass up any dish that came by the table. Everything looked so beautiful and tasted as good as it looked. Needless to say we quickly ran up our tab, but like any dim sum place, it's better to go with a large group so you have the opportunity to try more items.Like most people say on here -- order the CA State Bird when you go. It's a must and it's damn good. Fun and novel concept, great variety of unique and tasty dishes. Spendy but not super spendy. Hipster atmosphere.There are 2 kinds of really great restaurants. The ones that are constantly striving to be unique and different, changing their menu constantly. And the kind that really only do a small handful of dishes, but have perfected them over many years. This is the first kind.Long waits. Reservations were booked weeks ahead. We went on a Saturday, lined up for opening, then got quoted a 9pm seating.The food: the best thing is really the variety. Overall, I felt no dish was really done to perfection, even though everything was enjoyable. Which is what happens when dishes rotate so often, everything is pretty good but nothing you fall in love with.We had most of what was going around that night, like the garlic bread with burrata, guinea hen dumpling with broth, ricotta dumplings, oysters, duck liver mouse, grilled octopus, scallops, quail eggs, a tofu skin dish, as well as ordering the trout and quail off the menu. Most of it was very good, but no dish was OMG OUTSTANDING. I particularly liked the guinea hen dumpling, mostly because of the broth. The octopus was also nice, but we've had a better version at Son of a Gun in LA. The scallops were a bit strange, I enjoyed it but my wife did not. Fried pork belly - this is the heart attack plate. I like pork belly that's been braised then finished in the oven. But fried is okay too.Ice cream sandwich was tasty, but the ""macaron"" was a bit hard to eat because it did not pierce easily with the fork.Their food tended to be on the vinegar-y side, with the use of pickled or preserved items to bring in acid to the dish. Which is fine, but just so you know in case you hate pickles for whatever reason.Sat at the bar and chatted with the chefs while they were cooking, which was fun. The atmosphere is very personal. Almost too personal. If you didn't accept a dish a waiter was bringing around, it felt like you were hurting their feelings a little bit.Mostly the appeal of this place is the ability to eat 10 different dishes by looking at them instead of reading a description on a menu. Would go back if wait times were more reasonable and we lived closer. place opens up at 5.30pm, you should get there at 5pm and stand in line! There is a reason why you stand in line...cuz it's good! Some items are GREAT some NOT. Prices on dishes adds up FAST...Very tasty This reso was booked 2 months out, but the wait and anticipation was so worth it! This experience was out of this world and up there with Lazy Bear Underground Restaurant. The dim sum format was awesome as it allowed us to try nearly 20 menu times between 4 people.Here were the standouts (all BOMB.COM): CA state bird with provision, sweet corn pancake, pork belly plum salad (OMG this is was BOMB), curried scallop, smoked wild king salmon, tombo tuna avocado & seaweed cracker, and lemon curd ice cream sandwich (this is super interesting).Also, REALLY good were: eggplant frites, garlic bread with burrata, charred octopus, anchovy pancake, and quail eggThe items that were just OK in comparison to the rest were: spare ribs (too salty), duck (too plain; i prefer regular peking duck from chinese restaurants), and the chocolate pistachio torte (too dark/rich for my taste).The fact that I had 7 separate ""OH MY GOD THIS IS THE BOMB"" moments for under 80 bucks might make this my new favorite restaurant in SF Meh!Honestly a 2.5 is the best I would give this place. I am tired of over hyped, rude, hipster driven places in san francisco where people don't have a clue about good customer service and good food. They are so caught up in their fancy, unpronounceable ingredients which they are so utterly clueless about and have forgotten the basics.In any case, it's worth a visit if you have a reservation and want to see a new, gimmicky place but please be prepared for rude, customer service. Our waiter just appeared to be grumpy from the moment we sat down and we honestly felt talked down to. He didn't have any time for us or maybe he was just overworked. Plus we waited and waited for the magical 15 dishes that were not on the menu to appear dimsum style. Only half of them did in the 2 hrs we were there and we were made to feel like it was our mistake to arrive when we did (i. e. our reservation time) because apparently we had missed a lot of the dishes from the previous batch. They kept asking us repeatedly if we wanted to order from the menu or if we were waiting for more savory dishes. Seriously annoying.After a good 30-40 minute gap with no new dimsum dishes we asked for the check and our waiter turned completely cold. We couldn't believe it. Clearly we didn't eat enough food or spend enough money for him and his attitude was shocking. It just left us with a bad taste in our mouth walking out of the restaurant.Now the food. Nothing was mind blowing.Only memorable dishes were the smoked trout and everything bagel pancake, the ricotta dumpling with pumpkin sauce, the fried quail eggs and so some extent the name sake dish though it was a bit greasy and not as crispy.Nothing besides the ricotta dumpling above from the dimsum cart was worth it. We ordered 6 different things out of desperation waiting for food.My husband and his dad weren't impressed with the steak tartare salad and his dad lives in France. The quinoa and the vegetable dish was completely forgettable, in fact I wish I could forget them. 4.5 starsI ate here last night with a hungry group of 4 excited diners.  We ordered almost every item delivered by their mobile expediters carrying trays.  We also didn't shy away from the amazing seafood cart and items off the fixed menu.  Favorites from the fixed menu were the roast Duck/pancake, Fried Quail, Quail eggs, sweet corn/cheese pancakes, and 3 different desserts.  In all I would say our meal was executed commensurate with the reputation/hype.  My only recommendation is to make sure you go with a group so that you can try more of the dishes they offer.  Without a lot of time to spare there really is no way to line up reservations for this place with regularity.  So small groups will be stuck ordering only a handful of the many amazing choices.  Also make sure that the group you eat here with have flexible palates as the protein choices have a delicious range.  I cannot wait to go back here as my first meal left me in complete bliss. For any of you Foodies you probably have already heard of State Bird (what I've heard it commonly referred to as) the James Beard Best New Restaurant WINNER for 2012. It's a very small intimate restaurant (plan to call 60 days ahead to get a resi then when you're there make your next resi) and that's part of the charm. For a non adventurous eater be bold and try whatever is available. Save room for the cart vs. ordering too much off the menu prior to seeing the amazing cart options. I usually say save room for dessert however here I think the starters and entree's are so fabulous you may prefer to try everything vs. saving room for dessert. My second visit was my birthday dinner and we didn't hold back, trying everything on the menu and a few things more than once! My favorite's include: State Bird (it's a must try), Curried Scallops, Tuna Tartar (I normally don't like this dish but loved it here), Guinea Hen Dumplings, Spare Ribs, & Steak & Tartar.  Coming from New York where hot new restaurant's come with attitude the team at SB couldn't be nicer. Forrest is the host who's beyond adorable, patient and helpful and the chefs (was able to meet and chat with Glen the Sous-Chef during our wait) were also super friendly and approachable.  State Bird is not only AMAZINGLY delicious, unique , fab food but also amazing people. What a fabulous spot, totally worth the 2 month wait!Read more details:jsfashionista.com/san-fr… Remember to make reservation or try to, otherwise, prepare to go even before they are open and wait. This place is filled with so many unique tapas! There are so much on the menu as well as those that were being carted around and not on the menu. I love the dim-sum concept for this tapa restaurant. I swear every time someone take something out, I want try it! All the food look so fresh and vivid. Some of the ones that I recommended would be duck mousse with almond biscuit, CA Bird of Provision, the lobster, the peking duck and the hamachi on fried seaweed. Everything is small, but so, so flavorful!The waiters were super nice and helpful. I think next time I'll try to sit at the ""bar"" so I can see the chefs in action! Super tough to get a reservation at this place. Had to log-on to the website at like 6am to get a reservation 60 days in advance... and still could only get an 8:30 seating.  That being said, totally worth it. A very cool, dim sum-like concept, where the waiter/waitress brings around platters full of small plates. Each has a price, and you say either yes or no.  You can also order directly off a menu, and we ordered their signature dish, which is crispy fried quail.  Highly recommend this place for someone looking for a fun dinner experience Its still just as good as when they opened, but I feel like its slightly more accessible. I had to wait 5 minutes for a table at 9 pm. Not bad at all.  I have attempted to go more, but the wait is always too long. I just keep thinking I will get lucky like I did on this occasion. Even at 9 pm I would not be amazed if they told me I would have to wait for a long time. I have been a couple times, I was less impressed overall this visit simply because I know what to expect.I know there are going to be amazing selections and combinations of flavors that are unexpected. I know I am going to learn something new. I know I am going to leave happy and having eaten just the right amount. I know that I am going to spend a lot of money. The staff is cool, its a fast paced environment and its got to be hard work. But the stay cool. The signature dish is stupendous. The things they do with seafood, great pairings and tons of creativity. Fresh ingredients. If you have not been yet, but your thinking about it you should just go. Gotta give these guys 5 stars. The basics:  Service is great - ask questions, joke around, learn something. They even gave us the Duck Liver Mousse/Almond Biscuit while we were waiting for our table. Everyone that works there is knowledgeable, interactive and really look like they enjoy what they're doing.  Prices aren't bad (especially what you get, and especially for the City). Atmosphere great - not stuck-up, not divey, but Fun, somewhat loud and exciting.I'm not a food pro, but I do eat a lot - I have to say everything we had was amazing.   The kind of amazing where you don't want to use your napkin because there are still good flavors left to be had after you put that delicious quail leg down.(Get the State Bird w Provisions, 1/2 order for 2 people, Full for 4).   The kind of delicious where when you get the garlic bread and burrata and the burrata ends up all over your face and you still can't use that napkin. A few other favorites in no particular order:-Guinea Hen Dumpling with Broth.  Get one for each person. Drink the broth when your dumpling is done.-Clam & sungold tomato salad. Wish there was a little more sauce, but clams were perfection.-Duck Liver Mousse/Almond Biscuit - Fo' Free. Delicous small bites.-charred octopus in tomato-chickpea salsa - great texture, 'salsa' is great - salty and spicy. Crunchy octopus parts are the best!-tombo tuna-avocado & seaweed cracker  - this could have been my favorite, though it is nearly impossible to choose. Get this.-smoked wild king salmon with pea hummus & meyer lemon - very good, especially if you liked smoked fish of any kind. -sourdough, sauerkraut pancakes. Comes with this saurkraut salt. I was eating just the leftover salt with my fingers when the cakes were gone... -lemon curd 'ice cream' sandwich, poppy seed macaron, blueberries, fennel. Wow. So an ice cream sandwich - but instead of the normally delicious fake chocolate 'bun', they make it out of a flippin' delicious poppy macaron. Couldn't get enough of this.In short, go here. Enjoy, Have Fun and eat til you can't. Our spirits were in high flutter as we stood in line.  I've eaten here several times before so I was certain it was worth the wait.  Inside, this place is quite small.  We were lucky to get one of the last standing spots near the door.  This location is a bit on the colder side (obviously) but it is choice if this is the only option.   We began by inquiring about their gluten free options.  This was not a problem although the pancakes are out of the question.  The food here has remarkable presentation.  We were delighted by the taste of just about everything.  Visually, the food is put together with such thought and precision.  The servers come along in their dim style manner, waving their trays about.  I fancy saying yes to all options, as they continue to be favorable, yes, all of them!   It's all incredible!  I love this dining style, it feels so interactive and exciting, the dinner just continues to happen and evolve.  We left properly overjoyed! It was a crazy process getting a reservation, so if you want to go any time soon make a reservation ASAP! The tapas were all so amazing. The peking duck was spectacular (from the main menu). If you're there are going to splurge you have to get the dessert. The menu always changes and it's always great. I lucked out that one of my bosses had an extra reservation here that he wasn't going to use.  Score!  I've since learned how difficult it is to get a reservation here.We came in early on a Monday night and were seated over the kitchen bar.  It was a lot of fun interacting with the kitchen and everyone was super nice and you could tell they really enjoyed what they were doing.Loved their burratta, fried state bird and beet salad served with nasturtium leaves.  Very cool, normally I only see the flowers.  We enjoyed it so much we purchased a gift certificate for our friends to try.  I hope they were able to make a reservation. For the first of many upcoming birthday dinners, I chose the recent winner of the James Beard award for ""Best New Restaurant"". As it was a last minute decision, getting reservations was out of the question. After reading some Yelp suggestions, we showed up  at 4:25 p.m. and were the first in line for the walk-in lines. Half an hour later, there was a crowd of 25 behind us. It was a sunny but breezy cold afternoon in the city, and both of us commented how we had never done this before (wait in line for over an hour to eat in a restaurant). We were, however, able to watch some food preparation going on through the front window, and it looked like it would be worth the wait. Doors opened promptly at 5:30 p.m., and people with reservations were taken first to their tables. Walk-ins get sat at the chef bar or small drink bar, there is even a place for four if they are willing to stand while they eat their meal; we opted for the drink bar. What followed in the next hour and a half was a dizzying whirlwind of small plates of delectable food brought by on a cart (dim-sum style) or offered to us by servers walking by. We had pork belly, oysters, mussels, curried scallops, octopus, rabbit croquettes, duck liver mousse, guinea hen dumplings, smoked salmon, and sashimi on a seaweed bruschetta. The only items we had off the menu were the state bird (quail), sea urchin pancakes, and dessert (chocolate torte). The speed at which we were offered food was a bit overwhelming. After around 45 minutes, I started to feel the start of a early food coma. It wasn't the wine that brought it on, but just the large amount of rich food I consumed in a very short time.  I slowed down a bit and luckily felt better after a short time. Unfortunately, we didn't leave room in our stomachs for the Peking Duck, Garlic Bread with Homemade Burrata, Red Trout, Glazed Pork Ribs, or Lemon Curd Ice Cream Sandwiches. Regrettable, but I will definitely be back. And soon.My advice to Yelpers: Pace yourself. JUST SAY NO (but rarely) or better yet  ""I'LL TRY THAT LATER"". The servers probably moonlight as car salespeople because they do a good version of the relentless (but very polite) hard sell. If they see you wavering, they might opt to make up your mind for you... ""OK, I'm just going to make this decision for you, you know you want it!"" All of the servers were GREAT, by the way, and obviously love this restaurant. It probably is so much fun to work in a place where people are enjoying themselves so much. Will make a small mention of the bathroom (for you folks interested in this restaurant feature): There is only one unisex bathroom. However, it is nicely appointed with a fun painting of the USA with all the state birds listed on their corresponding states. The decor of the whole restaurant was interesting too, as some other reviewers have noted. But I was much too focused on the sensations my taste buds were having to really take much notice.Our bill, after stuffing ourselves with a plethora of food and two glasses of wine each, was $175 (not including tip). Really a deal considering how much wonderful food we consumed and what a fabulous time we had. Well worth the wait!!!! Just do it. You won't regret it one bit. Look I don't even remember all the things we stuffed our faces with, but I DO remember that it was all delicious. And the servers were fun. They didn't take themselves too seriously. Which is doubly impressive in SF.We made a rule: If it doesn't have meat or fish in it, we're not ordering it. It turned out to be a great rule, because when one of our party broke it, and he was disappointed. That's not to say the vegetarian items aren't good. We're just a carnivorous bunch.Some highlights:- Duck liver mousse ... yeah, it's fantastic- Fried pork belly. Why? Because. It's Fried. Pork. Belly.- Dumplings. Actually a light and fun bite, was a nice ender.- Seaweed bruschetta type thing...it was flipping amazing!!- State bird. Very very yummmyThe only thing we didn't LOVE was the blood sausage. It was a much milder flavor compared to all the other in your face items.If you can get a reso, EAT HERE. Apart from the ridiculous reservation operations and wait time for non-reservationists, this place churns out good food with an interesting twist in service.  I didn't have reservations so I arrived at the restaurant 10 minutes before it opened, only to find that there were at least 30 people already in line ahead of me. By the time I spoke to the hostess a few minutes after 5:30, I was told the wait would be 2 hours for a standing spot at the counter in the front area of the restaurant and to return around that time unless I receive a text with an earlier spot.  So my friend and I bided our time over drinks and a couple of snacks at a wine bar around the corner.  I received a text at 7:10 that our table was ready.  After closing out our tab and heading over to SBP, we were seated at a counter in the middle of the restaurant, WITH STOOLS!  So that was a pleasant surprise and a good start to my dining experience there despite the long wait time.  We had a very pleasant staff person/waiter standing in front of us, who would handle our menu orders and drinks.  We ordered the garlic bread with burrata, CA state bird with provisions and the Mendocito sea urchin pancakes off the menu.  There were other staff walking around with either carts or trays of food to offer to diners, akin to dim sum style.  We decided on the roasted vegetables romesco, raw oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesame, dashi pickled greens and smoked wild king salmon with pea hummus & meyer lemon.  The garlic bread with burrata was pretty good but the bread became a bit too overwhelming and dense the more I ate it.  The CA state bird and Mendocito sea urchin pancakes were amazing.  The roasted vegetables romesco was good but the almonds were not blended in the sauce and were left whole, so the dish tasted better when you took a bit of everything including the almonds.  I didn't really care for the dashi picked greens but the smoked wild king salmon was amazing.  My friend was avoiding dairy so she didn't want dessert but the pleasant waiter in front of us told me that they could make a half portion of the lemon curd ice cream sandwich, which he recommended as his favorite dessert.  The dessert was pretty good but what was astonishing to me was how well it paired with the fennel.  The good will of the restaurant to be willing to half portion my dessert was a good end to my pleasant dining experience here.  In general, the staff here is very nice and pleasant despite how busy the place was.  I would love to come back and try more of the dishes but am a bit wary of the wait time. I'm glad that I have finally gotten a chance to try the food at State Bird Provisions. I live right across the street and alway see a long line even before they open. It has been on my list of places to try and last week I finally got the opportunity.Reservations a hard to come by. However if you line up before they open you can snag a table. The reserve the counter area for walk ins. It's actually quite nice to sit in this area. It's not as private as an actual table, but I actually enjoyed it because you get to watch the chefs as they prepare each dish.The food is delicious. It's kinda of like dim sum style. The chefs prepare various dishes and take them by each table on trays. You just grab what you want and the mark it down on your sheet. Everything we tried was delicious! However my favorites were there Hamachi Nori Cracker (AMAZING!) and the Poppyseed Macaron Ice Cream Sandwich. Both are must haves!Definitely worth it the wait. If you can score reservations that's better, but if not try to line up before they open. I think they open at 6PM, so I'd try to be there by 5:30 to get your name on the list. We ended up with seats by 7:30, but it's worth it. Just put your name down and grab drinks at Fat Angel around the corner! Whether or not you like State Bird Provisions comes down to one thing, and one thing only.  Do you like (or are you a), hipster?The food is excellent.  It's a strange concept to only have half the menu on the printed menu, the rest is brought round on trolleys and you either have it if you like the look of it, of you don't if you don't (or if you're already full).  It's an interesting concept, that really doesn't work all that well, since you can't plan your dining experience.  We found ourselves not taking something we liked the look of out of concern that we might be too full for something that may come later.  Not knowing what might come later really impacts what you might eat.  While it's an interesting idea, and helps the restaurant stand out from the crowd, it really doesn't work.What lets the place down is the decor and the servers.  Everything is all oh so cool, in the sense that the art on the walls is hung by copper wire instead of picture string, so as to make it look as if it has been hung using whatever they had lying around, because they are too cool to worry about going and getting the right stuff to hang pictures.  The problem is with trying so hard to look cool is it is so obvious you've done it.  I'm an electrical engineer and I don't have copper wire just lying around - clearly they went to buy it just to make themselves seem more spontaneous.  It's pathetic, and it pervades the place.  Another reviewer referred to it as feeling like you're eating in a schoolroom - my wife and I had exactly the same discussion while we were there.Similarly, the waiters we all oh so cool.  The blood sausage they brought round hadn't been bought from a supplier, it was made by, ""one of their friends"".  The desperate efforts to seem like they are incredibly individual, when really they are just conforming to the culture they have decided to conform to really began to grate with me.When all is said and done, the quality of the food papers over many of the cracks of the place, and that's good.  When you go for a meal, the food should be the primary concern, and they got that very right.  The deserts especially were fantastic (I'd put the rice pudding I had in the top 5 deserts I've ever eaten).  It's a little expensive ($140 for two people, and we had very little alcohol - 2 beers between us), but fair play to them, the line of people waiting to eat is testament to the fact the prices are OK.The overriding question for me with most restaurants is, would I go back, and this place gets a resounding no.  If you're into doing everything you can to make it look like you're an individual, you'll probably love it.  If you don't, you'll enjoy the food, but find the place itself irritating. 3.5 starsA caveat: Bon Appetit named State Bird Provisions best new restaurant of 2012 and the restaurant has received all sorts of awards and accolades since. I think I was probably there on an off day. I'm therefore clicking on four stars instead of three for my 3.5 star rating because, to be honest, I would probably trust Bon Appetit over my single visit. State Bird Provisions' is built on a great concept. It's like non-exclusively Chinese dim sum. Dim Sum is amazing and taking the experience outside of the morning and opening it up to other culinary viewpoints (does that phrase sound like something from Top Chef, or what?) is brilliant. I will not call the dishes tapas, however, because I have found tapas restaurants to be way overpriced and State Bird Provisions is pretty reasonable. So here's how it works: 1) You try to get a reservation and discover that the restaurant is totally booked for the next 60 days. 2) Wait in a long line. In our case, we arrived at 5pm on a Tuesday (the restaurant opens at 5:30) and were given an approximate time of 7:30 for a seating.3) Have a drink and olives at Fat Angel nearby.4) You'll get a menu from which you can order small plates. You can order from this menu if you want, but wait first to see what will come out of the open kitchen. A cart will be wheeled around with different small dishes for you to choose from. If you sit at the bar, as we did, the chefs and servers will offer you dishes the moment they are ready. The experience is interesting and fun and, no doubt, the food is sophisticated and creative. This is probably the hardest gig for servers in town because they have to be salesmen as well as servers. I think it must take a really outgoing personality and I really give the servers there credit. My criticism, however, is that it just wasn't really seasoned the day we were there. I actually do not have much of a taste for salt at all. So if I felt that it needed a little, this lack was very noticeable. We almost ordered the cheesecake, which looked good when I saw other people order it, but the server convinced us to try this mochi thing which, to be honest, was not good. Afterwards, my friend and I realized nothing was really memorable. My friend said that the olives at Fat Angel were actually the best food we ate that night. Overall, I think one of the cooks had an off day or an overly light hand with the salt the night we were there. I'd try it again--but only when the lines go down! I can attest to the 4 hour wait! We got here at 6pm on a Saturday to put our name down and they told us we would probably be seated at 10pm (which was pretty accurate). If you know you're coming to wait, go to Social Study and get a drink or go watch a movie while you booze at Sundance. Or even go get a massage a Kabuki Springs. It'll help pass the time. They told us people started lining up at 4:15 for seats if you didn't have reservations. They reserve the bar area for walk ins which I actually really enjoyed. You get to watch the chefs prepare the food and you get first dibs on the plates that come out. They have a regular menu to order from and they also come around with various trays and carts of dishes that you can decide if you want to order or not. They all seemed to range from $5-$10 each depending on what they were. We were lucky to have been able to make a future reservation while we were there. Worth the daunting 4 hour wait and we didn't feel rushed at all even at 10pm! Excellent service from the staff as well. The best dining experiences I've ever had in San Francisco. My fiance and I decided we wanted to go to state bird provisions early enough that we didn't need a reservation. We got there on a Saturday night about 20 minutes before opening and there was already a 20 person line waiting ahead of us. 15 minutes later we felt pretty good about ourselves because there were another 20 people behind us in line. 5 minutes later a chef from the restaurant came out and asked if anyone had reservations. He asked that anyone with reservations please line up in another line. Of course, the 20 people behind us all had the forethought to make a reservation and immediately moved to another line.Eventually, the doors of the restaurant opened and we were in the last group of people who didn't get seated. The restaurant isn't tiny but the 30 people with reservations filled up a large portion of the restaurant. When we finally got to the front of the line we were told our table would be ready in 3 hours (8:30pm). We decided to just hang out in the area and grab a cocktail before our table was ready. Around 7:30pm they called us and we immediately ran down the street to the restaurant. I expected we'd end up sitting in the dining area but it was basically full and we had to sit at the bar instead. I assumed sitting at the bar would be a kind of crappy experience but I couldn't be more wrong. You only get the PRIVILEGE to sit at the bar if you DON'T have a reservation. The huge advantage of sitting at the bar is you're 5 feet away from the chefs having a great time making amazing food.Unlike your typical kitchen, these chefs are basically working autonomously. They're prepping a handful of dishes on their own and they're not waiting for anyone else on the line to hand them the next thing they need. You'd think this would be inefficient but it just works. They're making small dim sum plates for a small restaurant. The best part of this is they have time to stop, hangout, talk to everyone sitting at the bar and the rest of the staff because no one is waiting on them to finish prepping a some part of a dish. We ended up meeting everyone who was working there. It was an extremely relaxing and delicious experience. We'd randomly see a chef cooking something and we'd say ""Hey! watcha making?"", ""Oh this? this is a something something something something, want me to make you one too?"", ""hell yeah!"". This pattern of randomly asking about/receiving food continued for about an hour and we were absolutely stuffed. In addition to asking about what they were making, we also asked about how they had prepped things. My fiance and I are huge foodies and love to know how the sturgeon fish was brined/smoked and what the chefs love to cook when they're not working. We got all sorts of advice on topics ranging from cooking technique to favorite dives in the city (the chefs literally found a piece of paper and wrote everything down).Amazing food, amazing atmosphere, amazing staff, what more could I asked for? Well, the bill was a hell of a lot less than I thought. I'm used to paying too much for great food. I'm happy to pay for good food cause I love it that much. My bill at State Bird Provisions, $90 for two people including drinks. I thought something must be wrong, they must have missed the beer or something. Nope, fancy fusion dim sum is just a little more expensive than regular dim sum and just as filling.Totally worth the 2 hour wait, 5 stars without a doubt. Probably one of the best meals you're going to get in the city because of great staff and amazing, inovative food! Love the dim sum style that allows you to try just about everything! Anyone who questions the quality has rocks in their head! We somehow scored a reservation to this place without actually making one! I have no idea how that happened but i am glad it did. The food was amazing, the service was okay, we had to wait about 30 minutes past our reservation time but it was worth it. The food was inventive, fun, and priced within reason. It was worth the visit. There are a fantastic number of restaurants in San Francisco.  It really is a foodie town and eating has become one of the things I love most about it.  But not only is the food what I live for, but also the experience of the meal.  Coming together with friends and being brought into an installation of decor, atmosphere, and cuisine.  It makes it for me.  I've sat in an array of restaurants, from hole in the walls to Michelin star rated, and I always come with the same openness to the experience.  Some places have the worst service imaginable BUT the best food so there is a willing sacrifice.  And some places have food that's good, by no means amazing, but service that's incredible so it shines.  Not only can the food make a difference in the experience, but the service can as well.It is a treasure to come to a place that has it all right; fantastic food and extraordinary service.  When there's so much hype about a restaurant it's very difficult to not come in without an expectation.  I had heard nothing but positive things about the food State Bird Provisions so I was prepared to let that part of the experience happen on its own.  It truly is an amazing accomplishment by the chefs.  The food was killer, the flavors were excellent, and the meal was a highlight of my eating life in San Francisco.Along with the incredible food, the front of house staff was beyond.  From the moment we arrived there was a feeling of being welcomed from everyone.  The service is based off a dim sum service, so throughout the night you meet a lot of different staff members as they bring you food and everyone who came to our table made a great impression.  At the same time, our actual server Janice (NOT Jan!) was close by, attentive, and charming.Food highlights:QUAIL EGGS.  I could have eaten 5 of those.duck liver mousse with almond biscuitricotta dumplings with spring onion & sunflower seedspork belly'peking duck'lemon curd 'ice cream' sandwich  !!The difficulty of getting a reservation should not deter you from trying.  It is worth the wait and a necessary experience to all foodies in San Francisco.  And when you do get in, order everything (because it might be a while before you get back in) How to Have a Great Meal at State Bird Provisions:1)  DO make a reservation before they win any James Beard Awards.***whilstinsf.tumblr.com/po…2)  DO eat snacks in the afternoon since the only reservation you could get was for 9pm on a Tuesday.3)  DON'T show up early as there isn't really a waiting area and you may be waiting a bit past your reservation time.4)  DO take in the eye candy of plates coming out of the open kitchen and the cool kinda-of-reminds-me-of-a-tool-or-rock-climbing-­wall decor.5)  DON'T let anyone take a sip of your refreshing, unique, and very pink Rhubarb Soda ($3).  (Otherwise you will find yourself with a half empty glass.)6)  DO start off with the dish that you've been eyeing, the fried Garlic Bread with Homemade Burrata ($8).  DON'T grab another one (although you really, REALLY want to.)7)  DON'T order more than a few small items off the menu so you can try as many dishes as possible.We loved the the crispy skinned CA STATE BIRD with Provisions ($8) and the perfectly brown butter cooked Red Trout sprinkled with mandarins and hazelnuts ($11/$22).  We also tried the Glazed Pork Ribs but due to the mushy texture and abundance of salt we preferred the swiss chard that came with it ($10).8)  DO try a bunch of items off the trays.  Our favorites were the Guinea Hen Dumpling in a flavorful and citrusy broth ($3) and the spicy, balanced Yubu Noodles with house made Kimchi and Smoked Egg 'Bottarga' ($7).We also tried the more basic Golden Beet 'Caesar' (solid) ($4) and the Octopus in Tomato Salsa (rather chewy) ($7).  9)  DO check out the seafood cart.  I tried the Raw Oyster with Kimchi-like Kohlrabi and Sesame on top but the oyster was overpowered by the kimchi ($3).10)  DON'T forget to save room for dessert!I could eat the elegant Lemon Curd Ice Cream sandwiched between chewy poppy seed macarons all day long ($8).  The Black Sesame-Walnut Chocoyaki with roasted strawberries and whipped ricotta was warm and oozy with chocolate inside but next time I'm getting more ice cream sandwiches instead ($8).  11)  DO be surprised you managed to rack up a $100 tab for 2 people (+tax and tip).12)  DON'T regret it.***Too late!insidescoopsf.sfgate.com… Wow that would accurately sum up my experience at State Bird Provisions.  This restaurant has received many accolades.  2013 James Beard Award for Best New Restaurant in the country and 2012 Bon Appetit Best New Restaurant.  Reservations are booked 3 months in advance.  Aileen and I decided to tempt fate and got there an hour early before they opened to wait outside the restaurant in hopes of being that little child looking through the glass starving and watching all the elegant patrons eating their small plates.  When we arrived we weren't alone there were already 12 people lined up.  One star for the restaurant bringing out little samples of some wonderfully citrus spiced hot chocolate to thaw out our fingers during our wait.  The concept of the restaurant is genius.  Provisions has a small menu of staple items that they will make to order for you but the magic of the place are the creations, the plethora of small plates that are the brain child of Stuart Brioza the owner and his talented culinary artisans.  In the dim sum tradition tray after try is brought around and you have the choice to say yea or nay.  Small plate items are reasonably priced between $3-$10.  The doors opened and we scored a seat at the counter.  We were blessed because we had a state birds eye view at all the chefs creating culinary masterpieces.  Stuart was chatting with us like we were old friends and just took any air of pretension right out of room and I felt like I was at a friends house for dinner.  He told us to pace ourselves because they have 18 different small plates to offer tonight.  I threw his advice right out the window I couldn't say no.  Every plate that was presented to us we accepted.  Unfortunately I can't remember everything that we devoured.  Some of my favorites were the smoked salmon and the butteriest tuna if ever had.  We also had rabbit croquet's, octopus and spare ribs to name a few.  Each dish pushed the limits of imagination and was artistically beautiful to look at. My mouth danced as I experienced new combinations of ingredients that I had never imagined let alone tasted. Save some room for dessert the perfect way to end the night.  Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to try the State Bird but want to return soon with close friends and relive that wonderful experience with others. It's been a year since I've been here, and this was just as fantastic if not better!We tried a million things and got a bottle of wine - split 4 ways, total was $67 a person including tax/tip.~~MUST-HAVES~~Dim sum: Rabbit loin, Pork Belly, Beef tartare, Asparagus w/ black trumpet mushroom puree, burrata bread, Sumatsa fruit/avocado puree/scallopFrom the menu: 1/2 dozen quail eggs, SBP saladDesserts: chicory 'ice cream' sandwich~~DIM SUM~~* kimchi veggie - 3.5 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…Not the biggest fan of kimchi, but they made this work pretty well.* asparagus w/ black trumpet mushroom puree - 4.5 stars for the puree!pic: yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…Yup.. that puree.. amazing!* rabbit loin w/ avocado - 4.5 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…Absolutely fantastic tender/moist rabbit meat.

Favorite menu item I tried= hamachi-avocado seaweed crostiniLeast favorite= state bird with provisionsI'd certainly return to SBP, especially since I found it to be a great value for the money. Yes.  that is all I have to say.I love everything about state bird provisions.  though the concept may be new to those who don't frequent dim sum establishments, it's a nice experience with excellent food.  Everything we had was tasty, the right temperature, and a good size to share.What did we eat?  What didn't we eat is the question you should be asking.  We had octopus, rabbit, state bird with provisions, smoked sturgeon with an everything pancake, scallops, pork belly, dumplings, asparagus, and a nori cracker with tuna.  For dessert, we had a light and airy cheesecake and some kind of chocolate dessert (whose texture I actually didn't particularly care for).  Favorites for me were the pork belly which was cooked perfectly and seasoned well and the state bird.  who doesn't love deep fried quail?service was friendly and attentive.  I'm not surprised everyone loves this place. We got here 30 minutes before they opened on a Tuesday night and there were already about 10 people in line so plan on getting here early if you want a table.The duck liver mousse with almond biscuit was amazing, garlic bread with burrata was too chewy, the namesake state bird was cooked to perfection, and the red trout with hazelnut brown butter was delicious. I'd pass on the scallops with avocado mousse-it was pretty bland.Funky vibe, friendly staff, interesting concept, definitely worth checking out. 7x7 100 Best Things To Eat In SF Before You Die 2013#99 State Bird with Provisions2013 James Beard Award for Best New Restaurant, 2012 Bon Appetit Best New Restaurant Think of any culinary accolades or cliché praises one could give a restaurant and that pretty much sums up how I felt about my experience at State Bird. Food was fresh, vibrant, innovative and delicious. Atmosphere was lively and energetic. Chefs and staff were hospitable and accommodating. Special thank you to Forrest for going above and beyond. Recommend make a reservation or get there at 5:30, right when they open and get your name down on the wait list. Keep in mind the wait can be lengthy, we waited for 2 hours but man was it well worth the wait. In the mean time, go for a walk to the near by park or head over to Japan town and explore. I would suggest checking in every half hour and see if you can get in sooner than estimated, we were told 9:00 and were able to be seated at 8:00. Next, try to get a table at the chef's counter, in the middle if possible so you can have the best seat in the house to see all the action in the kitchen. Another perk of the chef's counter is you get first dibs on whatever the kitchen is making. My favorite dishes were the ones served hot more so than the cold dishes served from the dim sum cart. I would gladly go back for the Quail, Hamachi over a bed of homemade noir cracker, Rabbit, Pork Belly and for dessert the Cocoa Nib and Mint Granita. I will definitely be back in the fall to see how they interpret the new seasonal products. Overall ThoughtsThe best restaurant I have been to since I moved to SF! The best restaurant experience of 2013 so far, and the truly extraordinary experience was had standing up! I dropped by State Bird after several recommendations to try it, but I only had a couple of hours before I had to return to the airport. I showed up at the opening time -- this is key since they don't take many prior reservations -- and the host graciously offered to reserve a standing room spot for me. I can't remember his name, but he was one cool, interesting and engaging guy. I chatted with other guests in line, with the host, with servers, and the kitchen staff while waiting. It was just that kind of warm, friendly and low key place -- quite amazing considering the quality of the food coming out of the kitchen and the Bon Appetit ranking as the Best New Restaurant in America in 2012. Better yet, each item costs less than $10, and one can have a filling experience for $50 without wine with no problem, and even less for just a couple of tapas.The servings are served dim sum style, and my samplings involved dishes that ranged from the more gamey balls of rabbit meat and cheese, to the Asian fusion flavors in the Thai Pork Belly Salad, and to southern comfort style fried quail (the state bird of California). Though I certainly love fried chicken, I think I would probably skip the quail next time in favor of other options. The Thai salad was my favorite. I violated my no sugar rule and made an exception for the ice cream sandwich with chicory ice cream and coconut caramel. Amazing, and enough for 2-3 diners.The food was excellent, but I will have to admit that it was the atmosphere and vibe created by the engagement of the staff that made State Bird Provisions a memorable experience. It's worth the hype and then some.Fantastic food and unique experience aside, what really did it for me was the service.  Every single flannel-clad member of the waitstaff was genuinely kind, helpful, and excited FOR me to be gettin' my State Bird on.  Like, almost as excited as I was.  They nailed it. Very fun.  We did not have reservations and were in line at 445pm.  The restaurant doesnt even open till 530pm.  We were lucky to get the last 2 seats that were at the counter overlooking the kitchen.  It was great to see how everything was prepared and cooked.  It was like a show and dinner.  We were also able to ask questions while the staff prepared the food.  One of the ladies let me hold a quail egg which was awesome and so small.The food was an experience and delicious.  Different from average everyday food which made dining here special. It is pricey if you come hungry and wanted to get a bottle of wine.  The cheapest bottles of wine are around $50 and dishes range from $5-$9.  Seems reasonable but the portions are small, the food is delicious, so you end up spending over $150 before you notice it between 2 people.  Definitely worth it though. State Bird Provisions takes an unconventional, eat-by-the-seat-of-your pants approach to serving its Asian-inspired small plates, a sort of Western take on Chinese dim sum service. You get thrown out of your comfort zone of knowing what to expect from your meal, as there is no set menu to refer to. Instead, dinner becomes a game of chance, and a server comes around pushing the plates on a cart, asking you point blank whether you'd like to accept or reject the options. It's like a culinary version of Shark Tank. I would say overall the food here is solid, and nothing ever tasted bad. My only complaint was that something wasn't mind blowingly good, and that's only because I had huge expectations for a restaurant voted ""best new restaurant"" by the James Beard Foundation. Amazingly good: hamachi-avocado seaweed crostini. They should call this seaweed crack. We ordered two plates of these, and we were so full.Very good: charred Spanish octopus in tomato salsa, garlic bread burrata. The octopus was pan fried to perfection, with a nice char along the edges. The sauce was slightly sweet and spicy, similar to Korean gochujang sauce. The garlic bread burrata was deep-fried to a perfect golden form, resembling a soft, fresh and pliable cruller doughnut. The salty garlic seasoning was a perfect complement to the crispy, golden crust, and the burrata's creamy flavors and texture balanced everything out. I only wished that the bread were served a tad warmer.Solid: smoked sturgeon pancake, tuna crudo & confit with chickpeas and cumin. The smoked sturgeon tasted like a really good smoked fish and latke, nothing more and nothing less.  Same goes for the tuna crudo & confit. Potato chips and chunky, creamy dips is a proven flavor pairing. The restaurant executed everything well, but not in a way that significantly elevated the dish above existing forms.Ok: state bird with provisions, kimchi yuba noodles. I personally thought the buttermilk batter that was used to coat the quail meat was too thick and didn't allow for the delicate, gamey flavors to come through.The yuba noodles taste exactly like they sound--bland tofu skin noodles imparted with flavor from the intense pickled kimchi, but that was it. You were literally eating noodles and kimchi, and integrating the two didn't result in some powerful flavor combination.I certainly enjoyed my dinner at State Bird Provisions. I wasn't the biggest fan of the Russian Roulette type ordering experience, but I can appreciate how this type of dinner service is more adventurous and unique than you would get a a traditional sit-down place. And the joy of stumbling upon the amazing seaweed crostini  was one of the most memorable dining experiences I've had to date. I would gladly stand in line again for dinner if the opportunity ever presented itself. I'm not sure if this is THE best new restaurant in America, but it certainly is one of the best. absolutely positively worth however many hours in line / months to wait for reservations. just hunker down and do it. the food is other-worldy, you guys. it's the best i've ever had. ever.the service is stellar: super-friendly, casual, and incredibly knowledgeable waitstaff. the atmosphere is comfortable and a visual treat. you can deck yourself out, or cruise over in more casual get-ups. you'll be comfy either way.oh & come hungry! it's an amazing experience. i love that this is in my city!!! i want to curl up under a table and live at state bird provisions! love you guys. and congrats on the radness that is james beard BEST restaurant in the country! Really best new restaraunt? Bc I ate there and it is lame, the decor is horrendous unless you like pay $100 a person to sit on 1950's grade school chairs surounded by string art, the food is dull, servings are tiny, and the same sad eight items being pushed around on carts like white people dim sum is not I repeat not dim sum and not an original idea. Basically the menu has eight items and instead of making them to order they pre make the food and push it around on carts. The best thing we ate was guacamole with shrimp. I am sorry but guacamole with shrimp is hardly James Beard worthy or maybe James Beard awards don't mean what they used to. Do not order dessert as we did and the ""ice cream sandwich"" was more like two hockey pucks stuck together with vanilla ice cream. One plus was the wine list was reasonable. If you want to try a new place in SF that's delicious and has original flavors try Plaj or Boxing Room. State Bird Provisions meh I've had better just about everywhere. Yes, a happening and food.....perfect! State Bird Provisions.....I get it....quail but still love the name! Got here early, waited in line with all the other hopefuls and just our luck, we got in. OK, we had to eat while standing (at the little bar area by the front door), but that was fine as we were going to an event afterwards where we'd be sitting all night! Plus, you get to watch the food being prepared and you get first dibs at the food coming out! We had so many wonderful dishes that I don't know where to begin but some favorites were the toasted seaweed with various fish/avocado/radish, the oysters, croquettes, potsticker, and while I'm not doing them justice with such short names......they were all incredible! Cute place with a real unique flair. I'd go back but be ready to stand in line longer now that it just earned the James Beard Best Restaurant award! State Bird Provisions just won the coveted 2013 James  Beard award for Best New Restaurant.   Good luck getting in. Janice and Emily are my jam! They are awesome and will serve you so well. I've been here twice, and they were both equally memorable. The staff is fun, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable.The food is so good. The word on the street is true, and you need to either book far in advance, or come early to stand in line. Dinner: So the dinner is like dim sum, but not asian food. The servers come around with a tray of small portions of simply delicious bowls of goodness.  The food that I've had here is awesome. Here's a quick list of the items I loved: Garlic Bread with burrataraw oysters with spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesameGuinea Hen Dumpling with aromatic brothCrunchy Quinoa-Hass Avocado with lime pickle yogurtTuna Crudo & Confit with chickpeas & cuminRicotta Dumplings with spring onion & sunflower seeds\CA state bird with provisionsEach dish ranges from about $5-$8 so it's really reasonable to try so many incredible dishes for such a great price. If I were to break it down:Service: 5 starsAmbiance: 4.5 stars (casual, but cute and quirky)Food: 5+ starsOverall: 5 stars - Can't wait to come back again! After each of my three visits, I've left with a stomachache. Not an ""I ate so much food and feel so full"" kind of stomachache, but like a ""whoa that fried quail/dessert did not sit well"" stomachache. So, as much as I've enjoyed (some of) the food, it's hard to deliver a solid verdict when it's made me feel like crap afterwards.I think this place is more about the experience than the food. It's a fun environment and the dim sum thing is unusual and interesting. I've had a few dishes that I thought were really remarkable (beef salad, vegetables with romesco, a dungeness crab dish back in January), and a bunch I thought were not very special (any/all of the pancakes, the burrata garlic knot). I also think some of the crudo dishes sit too long on trays waiting for a taker. We had some sliced grilled rabbit on pea puree that seemed unintentionally cold (one of the passed dishes). It still tasted great, but I wondered if it was at the right temperature. The desserts have really not agreed with me, especially the ice cream sandwiches. I would definitely avoid those.For a place with this much hype, the prices are pretty reasonable. It's easy to get plenty of food, a few drinks, and dessert for $50-$60 per person after tip. Most beers are like $5, which is really fair of them. Service is also great. The people are good at what they do - they're all over the place covering for each other. So, I guess I'd recommend trying it out, but after three visits I've definitely had my fill. I say less so ""tapas"" as Yelp lists it and more like Hipster Dim Sum as Phil H. describes it. Despite my hipster bias the food was awesome. I am predisposed to not like trendy places with small quantities of food but State Bird Provisions lived up to all the hype I had heard. My favorite dish was the garlic bread and burratta. Yum. I also enjoyed the state bird (quail).It's tough to pace yourself as so many good things are coming at you that you want to eat everything. Even dishes that sounded odd to me were tasty so I enjoyed stepping outside my comfort zone. I would go back. The staff are SUPER enthusiastic. Very friendly, helpful and you can tell they are passionate about their food. I can't say I have ever seen such passionate staff and I've been to a ton of restaurants. Good job, state bird. Awesome experience.  small interior with simple and cool decorations.  make a reservation or else be prepared to wait.  Walked in for a table for 2 around 7:30 pm and the next available table will be at 9:30pm! they have the ""sweet tables"" which requires standing throughout your meal in front of the kitchen.  We waited for that instead, since it was promising to be free in less than an hour.  It was a neat experience.  We stood, watched food prepare and come out from the kitchen, were the first people to order, and was able to catch up casually.  They have a set menu where you can order from the kitchen staff and also a ""dim sum"" style ordering where they bring food items to your table and try to sell them to you.We tried scallop in curry jelly and avocado whip, rabbit meat,  seaweed tostada with hamachi and avocado (DELISH!), chips with fava beans, garbanzo beans, and tuna dip, asparagus with truffle yogurt, fried garlic bread with burrata cheese, grilled octopus, smoked sturgeon and pancake (ehhh), and finished off with smoked chicory ice cream sandwich with coconut walnut caramel (chewy and yummy!!) and a shot of peanut milk.Fun and interactive dinner.  definitely a cool place to have in the fillmore! An amazing experience.  Rarely have I walked into the ""it"" place to be and been treated so well.  My first interaction was with chef and my second with Emily, the hostess.  We were walk In's and put our name in, completely expecting to never receive a call as it was busy beyond belief.  20 minutes later I received the call that we had 2 seats at the bar.  Not only did we get to watch the amazing chefs in action but we were the first to see and choose the fresh food that was being prepared.  To say it was an experience is an understatement.  The food is to die for and the staff is as great as they come, we will come back again and again. I'm obsessed.This is one of my happy places :)Exception food (fresh, fun, creative, tasty), really great service and people. Top off your experience with a seat at the chef's counter (foodie friends only) and chit chat with the chefs and get food right off the burner. LOVE IT.In the 3 times I've gone, these are the items we ate each time:- State Bird - quail is delightful, if only the portion were bigger- Pork Belly with citrus salad- Crispy nori cracker with hamachi and avocadoOther highlights: ice cream sandwiches to die for, buttery lobster, duck plate, uni pancake, guinea hen dumplings in aromatic broth. mmm ... ah the list goes on. Try it if you can but remember to pace yourself because there is always something else new coming out of that little kitchen. I came here in Fall 2012 when the reviews on this place were flamin' HOT. The whole staff was hyped and you could feel the enjoyment they get from their work.  Memorable menu items: The dessert shot was easily the most memorable; I highly recommend it as a topper to your already amazing meal. The burrata was also delish but I don't think I've ever had *bad* burrata. Note: It's easy to drop a bill here (including wine) and then go home an hour later and make yourself a sandwich. Just a heads up from one fat kid to (probably) another ;) I don't even know where to start... the wait for a reservation is ridiculous, but the food is on point.  Decor is modern and rustic at the same time; you can order things off the menu but the fun is in the dim-sum style carts that come around with tasty little surprises.  A server accidentally spilled a beer on my dress, but it was in the middle of a heated argument and actually broke the ice... so thank you for that one! They even offered to pick up the dry cleaning, but I told them not to worry about it since the dress was machine washable (and the beer came out completely). :)Overall, I would 100% come back again as soon as I can get a reservation! Truly a new and dynamic food spot in San Fran.  Californian style Dim Sum so you can order off the menu and be surprised by the delicatbles that are floating around the place. The staff is super helpful and chill including the chef. Sarah is especially helpful behind the bar with food and drink decisions. This is a destination stop and one of the top new places in San Francisco if not the country. This was a fun and pretty tasty experience. I thought that it was very reasonable with regards to price and portions. Most of the food was good. I didn't love the quail (was kind of greasy and heavy) but most everything else was excellent. I went with my wife and another couple and the total was $200 plus tip but none of us had alcohol but we were all stuffed in a good way. We tried a ton of different things and even my rhubarb soda was really good. This is well worth trying once. I'm not in a huge rush to go back (not because it wasn't really good) but glad I tried it. I took off a star b/c we had a 9:00 pm reservation and waited 30 minutes for a table and they didn't offer us anything aside from a glass of water while we waited. Still, the service was excellent once we were seated. Friendly servers and good food. Imaginative tapas style dishes served in a dim sum cart way!  However, not like in the Chinese dim sum restaurants...they don't give you ""whatever"" looks if you don't want an item !! All the dishes were fantastic.... some of my favorites were the pork belly, the ricotta cheese, the red trout and clams, and a crab dish. Anyway the menu constantly changes (which I love) , but your favorite item may not be there anymore. I am always a proponent to trying new things, so this just helps me from being a creature of habit! The chefs and crew are all young. Chalk up another winner from the new generation of chefs!! The open kitchen provides you a look at all the dishes being made with what seems like a "" college fraternity of cooks"" The vibe is busy busy busy which adds to the excitement and hunger. They even have a ""standing area"" to eat for walk ins... cant say I recommend this area unless you really want to try it. Looks like an area that they were using for ""to go"" orders.  Anyway just goes to show you that people are willing to literally stand just to try the food.... this place rocks!! Love this place! The whole experience was so great that waiting two hours seemed worth it!! The food was great but honestly what puts it over the top is the wonderful hospitality...For me, their ricotta dumplings and the pork belly was the start of the evening! If you're new in town, head over to this little gem and give it a shot! Cheers! Everything about this place deserves 5 stars (except being located in the part of the city that is like 10 degrees colder half the time and I froze my ass off getting there b/c I'm cheap and didn't want to take a cab..oh well), 5 stars!! The servers and staff are so enthusiastic about the food and seem to genuinely love what they are doing.  Our waitress immediately asked if anyone had food allergies/aversions and was so helpful with ordering and making sure that we got enough food (even offered for some of the dishes to be made specially for me).  We started with a bottle of tempranillo that was very reasonably priced and amazingly peppery and then went on to order half of the menu: --raw oyster with kohlrabi kraut and sesame--beet caesar salad--rabbit and fontina croquettes--tuna crudo & confit with chickpeas & cumin--garlic bread with burrata--hamachi-avocado seaweed crostini--dumpling with broth (not sure what kind) --kimchi and pork belly pancake --CA state bird with provisions--glazed pork ribs with swiss chard, togarashi --cheesecake japonaise, rhubarb syrup, boozy cream, pistachiosEverything was really good but i LOVE LOVE LOVEDDD the seaweed crostini and the glazed pork ribs.  I saw so many other things going around after we had finished, but was completely full (that order was for 3 girls mind you).  I will be coming back 100% and can't wait for the new restaurant to open. BRAVO! This is hands down my favorite new restaurant. Such a fun concept and executed so perfectly! It is very hard to get a reservation these days- and the line is so long if you don't have one- but it's worth it. The state bird (their namesake dish) is not to be missed! So deliciously fried. Also, the sturgeon pancakes were to die for. Also, if they have a dish with some sort of smoked potato component- get it! Their menu changes all the time, but I had two different dishes (on different occasions) that had a smokey potato element- and they were both so unusual and amazing. I'm a big fan of the garlic bread with burrata- though some of the people I dined with weren't as into it. It reminds me of a grown up, gourmet version of round table's bread sticks. Personnally, I would skip dessert and use that tummy real estate for more savory dishes! SBP's been on my list for quite some time now, long before they were named Best Restaurant in America by Bon Appetit. Of course, with my mile-long list of bookmarks, I never made it out here until reservations became notoriously difficult to book (pro-tip: check every morning, as they're on a rolling 60 day schedule - and once you're booked, don't cancel!)For those unfamiliar with the theme at SBP, their modus operandi is, ""eat with your eyes."" Think of it as New American food, served dim sum style. The waitstaff wander about the restaurant with little trays of freshly made dishes, each carrying a little price tag on them: simply ask for whatever catches your eye. That said, there are a handful of entrees that are actually only available as orders off the menu, so make sure you don't miss out on those. Our group of three ended up ordering their [ instagram.com/p/ReuH-SQf… ]:== Tasty! ==* Shrimp, Avocado, Nori* Steak Tartare with Poblano & Sunchoke== Good ==* CA State Bird with Provisions* Kimchi-Pork Belly with Tofu* Fried Green Tomato, Eggplant, Spanish Remoulade== Okay ==* Guinea Hen Dumplings* Duck Liver Mousse with Almond Biscuit* Sweet Corn & Garlic Chive ShortstackSo, overall, while nothing was terrible, nothing was mind-blowingly delicious either. Still, the experience is unique enough, and some of the dishes are tasty enough, that it's worth trying at least once. Not to mention that the service is great, and the owners are awesome folks :)***Accessibility Info***Venue - Fairly spacious, but more length-wise than evenly, with table arrangements that are a little bit tight, but still maneuverable. Be sure to let them know your situation beforehand though, and they should accommodate you at some of the slightly more accessible tables.Bathroom - It's been a while, but if I remember correctly, their bathrooms were absolutely accessible. I've now been here five times and I love it more and more each time. The service continues to be incredibly attentive and caring. The vibe is warm and intense and casual at the same time. They take everything seriously here. What I love most is the surprises. You never know what you're going to get. The combinations and inventions are absolutely brilliant. But, here's the thing - most restaurants that try to be inventive end up producing a bunch of crap. Anyone can mix a bunch of stuff that's never been combined before then throw it on a plate. To come up with a new idea that is surprising and that works, that makes sense, that is delicious - that is brilliance. To do this plate after plate, and repeat it day after day, season after season: That is sheer genius. I can never get reservations here. I typically wait 1-1.5 hours just to get in. And, guess what, it's worth it. Best meal I've had in SF.  Fantastic food.  Great service.  A slew of interesting things all cooked perfectly.  Good price.  Seamlessly wonderful experience.  There's really nothing I could complain about.  FYI:  You need a reservation.  I'd skip the pancakes (still good) to save room for everything else.  It's trendy, not fancy. I came to State Bird a few months ago, and was very impressed but forgot to write a review. I sat at the bar and it really was the best seat in the house, as we got first pick of everything coming out of the kitchen. Tonight was my second time and I came with a few friends (all first timers) and we left extremely satisfied. The food was AMAZING but the real star of the show was the service! Emily the hostess welcomed us and was able to get us seated very quickly although we were walk-ins, Sarah, our server, was great at helping us pick from the pre-set menu and described everything so well, we wanted to order it all (...and we did.). My friends thought EVERYTHING was outstanding (literally everything, even something as simple as quinoa-crusted avocado). Standouts were the garlic burrata bread, the pancakes, and the state bird of course. I can't remember the name of our dessert, but it had roasted strawberries and oozing chocolate. SO GOOD. Thank you State Bird Staff for making my friend's birthday memorable in every way! Very creative concept and fun place to eat, especially at the ""Chef's Table"" to watch all the prep and get the description right from them.  Everything was great and the variety made it interesting.  I felt some items were a bit too salty and the effects lasted into the next day so I didn't feel great, but the solution might just be to eat less next time, which is hard when your constantly being offered plates of great-looking things.  Staff nicely handled the crowd and wait. I visited State Bird Provisions a few months ago, in which I was lucky to score a reservation. Overall, the food is very diverse and also very creative. The State Bird Provisions was excellent and easily stood out. From my understanding the food changes quite often, but I do remember the garlic bread was pretty good, but unfortunately because I ate there so long ago, I don't quite remember everything (not to say the food was bad). I recommend going with a larger group (4 if possible) so you can try more things. It's a fun and unique restaurant with an interesting concept. I highly recommend, although, be aware that getting reservations at this place is VERY tough and decor is very hipster-like. Ok, I'll admit this review takes in the hype factor - its just not worth the hype!  We waited a few months for a reservation, so expectations were high.   While we liked our food, there was only one 'oh my god' dish (the Trout), and everything else was just ok.  Meh for the price. Oh yeah, the decor? It feel on the cheap side of quirky.  Peg-board and ugly crap hanging off of it.   Its just not a top restaurant. I would give 6 stars if I could. San Francisco delivered. Mostly we stuck to the carts, other than the sturgeon pancake and the burrata garlic bread knot. We were at the chefs counter and we had first pick from the carts, truly it got to the point where we were just getting one of each dish from every new wave of food. Nothing disappointed. The chef working the station in front of us was great. He humored us and answered all of our stupid questions. The other nearby chefs were just as friendly and funny. For the quality and flavors the prices are reasonable. great place! Fast turnaround so we didn't have to wait in line. The garlic bread, rabbit, and sweetbread meatball were delicious... as was everything else. The waiters are amazingly helpful (and patient). We were abit disappointed by the cheesecake soufflé. Also, they don't waste time once you sit down. Maybe not the most relaxing/romantic atmosphere as you are constantly being interrupted to choose items off the cart (but hey! that's the point of the tapas/dim sum style restaurant). All in all, one of the better dining experiences I have had in a while! Love the concept! My bf and I chose almost everything that came by but didn't feel full at the end of the meal. A great place to go with a bunch if friends willing to try/share everything. Be sure to make a reservation 2 months ahead!! Wow, it is astounding that so many ""seasoned palettes"" have given this restaurant a good review. I've tried to understand, yet can't seem to make sense of it. The only thing I can think of is that everyone is jumping on the hype bandwagon. I don't care if I have to wait in line for over an hour. I don't care if I have to dine standing up (a first for me,) but at least give me good food!! How disappointed my friend and I were to find such small quantities of high-priced, mediocre food. The flavors were just not there. I only enjoyed one of the many dishes I tried and actually felt nauseous after eating the garlic bread with burrata. Advice:make reservations well in advance or get there at 5pm for open seatingorder only 1 of anything (even if you have a group of 4)go with a larger group to try more thingspace yourself...there is a lot of food and you don't think you will fill upRecs:guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth spicy kimchi yuba with smoked egg 'bottarga'tuna crudo & confit with chickpeas & cumin garlic bread with burrata hamachi-avocado seaweed crostini dungeness crab & mandarin gelatina with avocado mendocino sea urchin, ginger/scallion pancake, soy-lime glaze artichoke bread salad with last summer's tomato grilled beef 'salad' with maitake, brussels sprouts & umeboshi vinaigrette 'world peace' peanut muscovado milk shot So if you think the massive Hype is worth waiting for, you are WRONG!!!! This Resturant is NOISY, NOISY, NOISY. I think everyone there feels the need to yell while dining. Yes, there were a few nice dishes that were good, The Hamachi on nori was by far for me the best dish. I enjoyed the chips and dip also.The desserts were under rated!! For the most part, its just OK. I'm getting really tired of writting about   BULL S--T FOOD!!!!! Most of the wait staff were great.... Of all the new restaurants in SF, this is my favorite.  I was lucky enough to get a call from a friend who wrangled a last minute 7 pm reservation. We were seated at the bar, right by the kitchen, so we were able to watch the chefs prep and also get first dibs on anything coming out of the kitchen.  That said, the food was amazing--creative, tasty, and inspiring.  Definitely try the quail, and anything with tuna or yellowtail.  We also loved the fried garlic bread with burrata--decadent but oh-so-delicious. The waitstaff was friendly, very helpful, and not at all overwhelming. I liked the dim sum style--portions were small enough that you could try multiple plates, and we were out of there for about $100.  I was disappointed in the desserts--we ordered two, and I thought they just didn't stand up to the quality of the savory dishes we'd tried. Heard a lot of good/great things about this restaurant so I am glad that i finally got to try it out.  Let me say that I like a restaurant with rules.  Take that for what its worth.Food: Crispy pork belly...awesome-town.   Sturgon Pancake...delicious  Those were the stand outs.  Everything else was good, just not super memorable.Service:  friendly, casual, knowledgeable.  No complaints.I enjoy the concept of the ""Dim sum"" style service but I think i enjoyed the core menu items better.  It was fun though.  Warning...the bill can add up quickly.Yes...you will probably have to wait in line. Yes its not in the best neighborhood to have to wait in line.  Yes you will still wait in line.  Crazy people are less agressive if you smile. You'll find a line of people waiting for the doors to open far before they're scheduled to. Once they do, they'll instruct groups with reservations to make a line on one side, and any walk-in's on the other. They've got this part down efficiently and waste no time seating tables.It's a dim sum style service serving american food. It feels like you're back in workshop class with perforated beige walls and woodshop art projects on display. It feels new and fresh despite spending many weekends dining at a traditional dim sum restaurant in San Francisco. My table had a lot of fun choosing dish after dish from each passing cart (while trying to ignore the equally noticeable price tags). We supported the small plates with two dishes off their printed menu to round it off and ordered a bottle of wine. It was the perfect amount and we felt well taken care of by the staff.The stand outs from the night and current menu:Garlic Bread with Burrata (FAVORITE! Get it. Doesn't disappoint.)Dungeness Crab and Mandarin Gelatina w/AvocadoHamachi Avocado Seaweed CrostiniPork Ribs with Swiss Chard (A heartier dish)Chicory Ice Cream Sandwich with Coconut CaramelAnd finally, the State Bird with Provisions. Our friend deemed the breading the ultimate Shake N Bake and assured us he would buy it in bulk if it existed. I've had quail at many Chinese restaurants and enjoyed eating it cooked a different way at State Bird. The onions are tangy and delicious. I guess all the hype messed my taste buds up?! I really wanted to love it but half the tapas were meh and the other half amazing. How is that even possible you ask? Well, the fresh oyster with kohlrabi kraut and sesame just seemed to mask the oysters flavor and the burrata (while delicious on its own) was served with what seemed to be a microwaved garlic bread. It was as if it had been over cooked and was super chewy and bordering on the tough side. :( Sadly dessert was also a disappointment. We were standing in the kitchen area and noticed a lot people ordered the earl grey ice cream sandwich with figs so we figured it must be good.  The texture was really nice but it was extremely sweet for my taste. With that being said, I will say that the fish collar, pork belly with winter citrus, hamachi-avocado seaweed crostini and the sourdough, sauerkraut pecorino & ricotta pancake were amazing!In continuing with the good...the atmosphere was really hip and had a comfortable vibe in the air. I liked the dim sum style of serving and loved being in the kitchen while I ate where I could interact with the chef and servers. I think this place is worth a try as their menu is constantly changing! I love the concept of an American / Fusion dim sum restaurant. If you haven't been, here is how it works...HOW IT WORKS:There is one seafood cart that goes around with a static 4-5 dishes to choose from. There are about 8 other dim-sum style items that rotate, it took about 40 minutes for us to see the full rotation. They have a small menu with apps / entrees / desserts / drinks.THE FOOD:All of it was delicious, and the tab definitely adds up quick! They are famous for their pancakes (loved the pecorino), and the fried quail (good but didn't blow my mind). My absolute favorite dish of the night was the nori chip with kampachi on top, followed by a seasonal crab stew. Freakin amazing. I thought the fried garlic bread with burrata was a bit overrated, and the mushroom dumpling in dashi sauce was OK, but the best way to experience State Bird is to just try it all because everything is unique and very fresh. Go with 2-3 people and get the full experience.THE DRINKS:The wine and beer list is decent, and given the food prices, I was pleasantly surprised by the delicious Malbec and Saisons I had (only $9 and $6 respectively).I would definitely recommend State Bird, and encourage you to make a reservation - there are last minute options available on OpenTable. The line on a weekday at opening was ridiculous, I would never wait. For someone with a big appetite like me, it can be expensive but it doesn't have to be. Come in and order a bunch of dishes to try, and you will not be disappointed. Enjoy! 4.5 starsThis was one of the restaurants I really wanted to try while I was in San Francisco (probably #1 on my list). Not surprisingly, reservations are still very difficult to come by, probably one of the most difficult in the city. I checked their website multiple times per day for a couple of weeks, and the best I could do was a party of 2 at 5:30 (looking for any availability over a week span). The day before, some cancellations yielded a 10:30 table for 4; very late, but it allowed our whole family to dine together.duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - The rich mousse was pretty tasty on its own, but the warm biscuits (scented with almond) were a great pairing.porcini dip with rosemary buttermilk cracker - Another spreadable dish, it showcased clean porcini-cheesy flavor with crispy rosemary crackers. This was pretty nice too.garlic bread with burrata - If I saw this on the menu, I probably wouldn't have ordered it (it sounded kind of plain). But seeing this come out of the kitchen, it was clear that my assumption was wrong. The hot, fried bread was light and airy and just oozing burrata and olive oil. The garlic flavor was fairly subtle but present.fuyu persimmon with caraway cream - This was one of the lesser memorable dishes of the evening, showing off predictable sweet and tart flavors.seafood 'salsa' - Scallops, mussels and clams were bathed in a jalapeno salsa; a little heat complemented the seafood but this one wasn't particularly noteworthy either.shrimp, avocado, nori - A strong seaweed flavor and texture came from the fried nori, complementing the tender avocado chunks and grilled shrimp. Black garlic provided a mellow garlicky flavor throughout.guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth - A nicely-chewy ravioli was stuffed with rich and flavorful guinea hen, sitting in a comforting, savory chicken broth. Quite tasty.CA state bird with provisions - The restaurant's namesake dish did not disappoint. Fried quail (the state bird of California) was both juicy and crispy, while sweet onions and pecorino provided additional depth of flavor. I just wanted more of this addicting bird.vinegar glazed smoked potato with tonnato - The potatoes exuded a strong smokiness that paired pretty well with the albacore tonnado. Crunchy onion rings added the crunch in each bite.steak tartare salad with anchovy & castelfranco - We didn't care for this one. Too much salad, not enough steak.glazed pork ribs with swiss chard, togarashi - Luscious, tender ribs were delicious, especially with a slight heat from the togarashi spice. Swiss chard helped to balance everything out with its earthiness.hamachi spring roll with fuyu persimmon - Cool hamachi and sweet persimmon were a good duo, but the spicy dip overpowered the subtle flavors a bit.buttery lobster with farro ""spezzato"" - The lobster was cooked well, leaving it spongy and succulent. A very buttery-rich farro base added a creamy starch presence.sweetbread meatball with quince & pickled veg - There was something kind of chewy inside the meatball, but I liked the flavor. Pickled quince added a sweet acidity to balance the richness of the meat.red trout, mandarin, hazelnut-garum brown butter - The trout was well-seasoned and cooked to a nice crispy skin and moist flesh. Hazelnuts and citrus provided some nice complementary flavors to go along with the fish.'world peace' peanut muscovado milk - moving on to the sweet part of the menu, we began with 'shots' of this milk that really resembled Reese's peanut butter cups.cocoa pudding, huckleberries, white chocolate buddah's hand crunch - Next we had a rich chocolatey pudding with a lot of fresh huckleberry flavor. The white chocolate brittle added crunch to each bite.eggnog 'ice cream' sandwich, sherry chocolate coulis - This was my favorite of the desserts, which I thought was executed very well. Eggnog ice cream was delicious, particularly with the soft cookie, chocolate and almonds. A touch of salt was a difference-maker.This was my favorite meal during my holiday stay in San Francisco. I felt like we tried a ton of flavors throughout this meal and most everything seemed thoughtful in concept and execution was pretty strong. Sure, there were some plates that I found more successful than others, but that happens over 18 different dishes. The spreads/dips, guinea hen dumpling, fried quail, pork ribs, trout and ice cream sandwich were excellent. State Bird truly lived up to its high expectations. These three are very VERY good: duck liver mousse, fried bird, pork belly. And I'm partial to eggs so I would always say yes to the quail eggs! Steak tartare salad is good too but I wish there was more tartare. Great concept, great execution, nice people, yay!I'm sure that passed small plates, dim sum-style, is really good for the bottom line too - it definitely pushes you to eat more than you would normally order when something delicious is right in front of you, and each person at the table can say yes :) But on the flip side it's fun, and we ended up with a reasonable bill and really full bellies.The only things I didn't love were the artichoke bread salad (we got it late in the meal, and I think it was just too rich at that point, so maybe a timing issue), the asparagus with truffle something, which was okay, but didn't really come together as a dish, and the oyaki dessert which was fairly bland and boring next to the sabayon ice cream sandwiches. After months of checking their web site for availability and almost giving up hope, I was thrilled to see a Tuesday 5:30 reservation randomly pop up.  It was a long and excruciating 2 month wait before our res, and during that time, they received their James Beard nomination, further fueling my impatience. Finally, the big day came. Upon arrival at 5:30, there was already a loooong line going down the block, but they called all parties with reservations to the front. So this is my new. favorite. restaurant.  We were a group of 4 and ordered 5 hot items off the menu, which was the quantity recommended by our server. We then ordered about 8-9 amazing ""dim sum"" items that were circulating the room. I love this decadent style of dining! Everything was delicious - not a single disappointment - but there were a few standout items: cast iron quail eggs, sea urchin pancakes, smoked trout porridge, duck liver mousse with biscuits, pork belly (dear god!), hen dumpling in broth, and a heavenly cracker spread with sturgeon roe, lemon, and egg (I think?)...and the earl grey ice cream sandwich is a MUST.   Atmosphere is totally casual, with pretty much every customer in jeans and servers in plaid shirts. Service is mercifully hipster-free....they were friendly and down-to-earth, no airs or pretentiousness.  The space itself is simple but stunning -- bricky lofty with very high ceilings and an open kitchen right where you walk in. The counter (for walk-ins) is set right up against the kitchen...I would imagine that sitting there and watching the artists in action is a special experience.Now back to obsessively stalking their web site for another reservation. Ridiculous! So tasty, one of my favorite SF spots. The reservation situation is out of control, but if you get a table, you won't be disappointed. I am a vegetarian but also a lifelong food lover, and everything I have here is incredible. Finally something different and unique from the loads of California cuisine restaurants that are all kind of the same. Each plate is well thought out and curated. Not to mention the staff is wonderful and interesting, and make you feel like you are eating in their home. If I had a meal here, had sex, and then died....I could say I would have no regrets! I came here on Saturday night with my husband and another couple. We didn't have reservations since it was a last minute decision to eat here. Thanks to all of the yelp reviews, our friends arrived at 4:20pm and was the third group in line! The first group arrived at 3:30pm! The line grew to 30+ people by 5pm! We were immediately seated at 5:30 (it looked like 10-15 people were able to sit at 5:30). They also served hot chocolate while we waited in line, that was nice.They have food on a menu that is made to order like pancakes and the quail. They also have food that are on trays and carts for you to see...this one entices your palate with your eyes. It's sort of funny to see the look of rejection that some of the staff have when you don't want a certain dish (in dim sum the ladies don't care, haha). My favorite made to order dish was the ribs and the quail. The ribs are not baby back but very tender. I was indifferent about the sourkraut pancakes. Of the tray/cart dishes, I liked the salad that had slices of rare beef and mushrooms in it (sorry don't remember what they called it). My favorite dessert was the earl gray ice cream sandwich with the dried fruit soaked in riesling. While the dessert sounded fancy, it was yummy and didn't taste complicated. The cheesecake was ok, it was very fluffy and not cheesy enough, if you're ok with that. Overall it was a good experience. If you walk in and are a group of 4, make sure you come EARLY. Otherwise a group of 2 has better luck of scoring a table, bar seating or even standing at the bar. If you don't want to deal with waiting, then I highly suggest just making a reservation far in advance. I got a reservation back in January, and waited two months to finally go to State Bird!  Our reservations were at 10:30PM, so we stopped by a bar earlier and got ready for our NY style dining (late night dining).One thing that completely stood out was the fact that this is probably one of the hardest restaurants to get a reservation at right now, but the staff had no airs.  They took a while to seat us, and they gave us wine on the house while we waited.It is a really fun dining experience, I'm not really fond of traditional dim sum since I don't eat a lot of meat.  But I'm all for American style dim sum.  I wouldn't suggest coming here on a date, since the servers do interrupt a lot with the new items and explaining each item.  My favorites - Sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancakes (mini ones), green garlic bread with burrata and Earl grey, almond & cocoa nib 'ice cream' sandwich! Freakin expensive but worth every bite.JONASAPPROVED! A great dinning experience to say the least!  I rarely go to the same restaurant twice but with State Bird Provisions I will make an exception! My 2nd dining adventure at State Bird was even better than my first; experience helps. - State Bird: We didn't even mess with it this time; the moment we sat down, we ordered a full serving of the fried quail so we didn't have to wait for the 2nd serving after we realized the 1st serving was awesome .Yeah. We got smart. - We ordered less from the menu this time; we skipped the pancakes entirely- they were too soggy and unimpressive. -Ricotta Dumplings: light, fluffy, and pillowy. Highly recommend- The ribs were still smokey and yummy. - Quail Eggs: i love quail eggs but these were not what i was envisioning. I'd skip this- Guinea hen dumpling in aromatic broth: honestly, just as delicious as the state bird. They walked around with these in a tray and they are $1.50 per bowl. I could easily have gobbled 10 of these. Dangerous- I've grown to like the Peking Duck. It's very respectable as long as you don't think you're eating Peking Duck. Think....duck confit. Yum- Ahi Poke: I like but i'm a poke snob. It ain't Hawaii. But it was pretty good- Duck liver mousse with Financiers: silky and light. Good for a starter- The ice cream sandwiches this time were earl grey;  i wasn't a huge fan. If they have chocolate ice cream sandwiches, i'd highly recommend them. Even if you have a reservation, be sure to get there a few mins early. If you're the first seating, don't freak out by the sight of the loooong line. Most of these ppl are in line for walk-ins. Someone from the restaurant will make a short announcement about forming a line for reservation holders and you'll be seated the moment the door opens. LIsten up for that. Walk-ins who don't make the first seating (at the bar) will probably have to wait 45-60 mins for the next seating. For the top new restaurant in the country, the service here is friendly and efficient; no pretentiousness or snootiness. Love I've been here twice so far. Luckily the last time I made a last minute reservation for 9:30 and was able to walk in and be seated right away with my super cute date.The food here is dim sum style. To sum it up, the dishes are all very creative. Some tasted great, some were good, some were ok. I don't remember eating anything bad. I found the servers to be informative and accommodating. They might have a stuck up hipster vibe about them, but once I got over it, I really did enjoy the service.You MUSt try the peanut milk shot. It is AMAZING! Heaps of praise have been poured on State Bird Provisions over the past year. It has already won Bon Apetit's 2012 Restaurant of the Year award and is now a contending finalist for a James Beard Award in the Best New Restaurant category. It is nearly impossible to walk in and expect someone to give up their reservation. In fact, due to the recent critical acclaim, it took me nearly a year to finally snag a coveted reservation, which only opens a month in advance (and fills up quickly). Expectations were definitely high.What makes State Bird unique is their menu. In addition to a frequently changing menu, you order from a number of small plates to tide you over until the dim sum-style service carts come rolling by. This was where it got dangerous because everything looked better plated than described on a menu. Order everything? We pretty much did. Here's a breakdown of the menu plates we tried:Sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancake - I couldn't get much of the sauerkraut, but the pecorino and ricotta were distinct. These were addicting and I could see why people order more after the first plate.CA state bird with provisions - Fried chicken, but with a quail. It was good, but not amazing. Glazed pork ribs with swiss chard, togarashi - The meat was very tender, but it was too salty to enjoy.Buttery dungeness crab with farro 'spezzato' - This was by far, the best savory dish of the night. The crab was so buttery and delicious. It was like a really magnificent rendition of a crab porridge. Please sir, can I have some more?Earl grey, almond & cocoa nib 'ice cream' sandwich, riesling-poached winter fruits - This dessert was outstanding. It wasn't too sweet for a dessert and the presentation was beautiful. And the plates from the cart:Crispy pork belly with mint, jalapenos, and winter citrus - This was a great appetizer to start off dinner. I've had a lot of pork belly, but never with a combination of refreshing mint and citrus. Great contrast in texture with a splash of acidity.Potato chips with beans, salsa, and avocado - It looked cool when the salsa was in the mason jar. It turned out to be really expensive chips and dip.Raw oysters kohlrabi kraut - The worst plate of the night. The kraut completely overpowered the oysters, but the waiter gave us a free oyster for our party of 3.Lobster croutons topped with lobster salsa - The croutons were genius. They had a satisfying crunch while drenched in lobster goodness. Garlic bread with buratta - The bread had the texture of a churro. The buratta was good.Rabbit with cannellini beans - Actually, this is tied for the worst plate of the night. The rabbit tasted exactly like cold grilled chicken. Really expensive chicken with hummus.We washed it all down with the St. Stefanus, Belgian Blonde, which was an excellent beer to pair with our dinner. The service was great and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. Most of the dishes were really hit or miss. There were a couple of really great dishes and a couple of awful ones. Overall, I wasn't wowed by the food. The concept is interesting, but if I have to wait this long to get a table, I better be impressed by most, if not, all the dishes. All in all, very pleased.  This place lived up to the hype.  Everything we had was good to excellent.  The concept of this restaurant is neat.  I like the idea of gourmet dishes coming out on carts for you salivate over.  When they bring them by, it is really hard to say no.  We were starving when we arrived, and within three minutes, before we knew it, we had six dishes on our table and were overwhelmed in foodiness.  This place serves about 2/3 of its menu via dim sum carts (think of these as your appetizers) and the rest is made to order (mains and desserts).  The best strategy is to bring a group of people and just try a bunch of stuff.  Slow it down after the first few, and then order some larger stuff.  Save room for dessert.We ate the following:- Saurekraut pancakes - i had never heard of such a thing and they were great.  Little silver dollar pancakes with tangy, crunchy sauerkraut in the middle.  delightful.- scallion ginger pancakes with uni and soy lime glaze - amazing.  The uni was really fresh and added that nice briny creaminess that really worked with the flavors of the glaze and mixed nicely with the texture of the pancake- green garlic burrata toast - what more can you say.....puffy green garlic toast with burrata smeared all over it.  delish.- guinea hen dumpling - loved it.  the broth was incredible.- state bird with provisions - breading on the quail is awesome and the bird is perfectly cooked.  the onions and parmesan are an unusual but delicious combo.- peking duck - duck leg confit, with scallion crepes, some pickled type of mushroom and plum sauce - really, really tasty.  I loved this.- steak tartar caesar salad - very good, but all you could really taste was the dressing.  That said, the dressing was really good.- tuna crudo with chickpeas, capers - delicious.  had a nice cuminy flavor.  served with potato chips.- quail eggs with sunchokes and ravigote - amazing.  tasted like breakfast in the most wonderful way.  the sunchoke chips were a nice crunchy texture.- crab with mandarin gelee with avocado - this dish was good as long as you had every component of the dish in one bite.  if not, it tasted kind of bland and mushy.- sweetbread, veal and pork meatball with fig - very good, but it did not blow my hair back.- cheesecake souffle - excellent.  was light, tangy and creamy all at the same time.- earl grey ice cream sandwiches - delicious.  the earl grey ice cream was amazing.  the only downside was that the service was sometimes a little lacking.  by and large, servers were attentive, but there was a little lag in getting drinks sometimes.  The fast pace of the dim sum style was a little intense at times too.  You are bombarded with food as soon as you sit down.  Service is very quick and it is NOT meant for a romantic, quiet night out.  Its not bad, it is just different.Great spot.  Nothing else like it.  WIll go back as soon as the buzz dies down a bit. I brag to everyone I know that my boyfriend and I went here the week it opened (pre-hype) and ordered so much food (and finished it all) that the chef, the sous chef and the hostess all came to say hi to us. I have been back another ten times since then and the hype keeps getting crazier and the wait keeps getting longer....but the food is still as good. The food is delightful and inventive, just don't go with sky-high expectations, because seriously no place lives up to those. The staff is really nice and the atmosphere casual and unpretentious. The place is expensive but not for the quality of food (and the cool experience). Make sure you don't miss- the burrata on garlic bread- the state bird of course- the almond biscuits with duck liver mousseMost of the menu keeps changing, but the pork belly and the grilled lamb are really good too (but not always offered) I am not the biggest fan of the pancakes or the quail eggs and to be honest, haven't given any of the veggies much of a chance.Definitely a must-try place, just be prepared to wait, but hey, you can watch a movie at Kabuki right around the corner. Loved it. We did the ""wait before it opens, get a reservation for that evening and come back"" thing. But that's miles better than the ""wait an undetermined amount of time in line for a table"" thing. So, props for the system.The food was relentlessly inventive and exciting; everything was delicious. The system may be dim sum style, but the cuisine borrows a bit from here and there. (Note: not a negative thing). The concept is actually quite brilliant, you're eating as soon as you sit down. And they've created a restaurant where they're free to continually reinvent their food.Stuart walked around greeting people with a huge smile, clearly (rightfully) delighted that his creation (obviously the product of a lot of shared hard work) was being received so well.It's memorable and genuinely worth it. We got out, with tip, ~14 dishes, 2 desserts and 3 glasses of wine for under $140.Not loud at all for us, seated at the counter.They're doing it right. They did not create the hype, which some people are now reacting against. The public choose to buy into it. The restaurant just puts out an excellent product and hopes people respond. Personally, I hope they're around for years to come. Like Clint Eastwood once said in a sappy movie ""This kind of certainty comes but once in a lifetime.""  I love you, State Bird Provision. Scored a res on the online roulette system prior to it winning all the accolades.  Lined up with everyone else in the rain prior to it opening and waited anxiously, wondering if any restaurant could possibly live up to all the hype.  Love the casual, non pretentious atmosphere.  Since the offerings are constantly changing, I won't delve into what we ate, but into the experience itself.  My husband, dining companions, and myself thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  Rather than paying upwards of $100 for a fixed menu, we were able to pick and choose what we wanted.  Reminiscent of times when you are dining and you see someone else's meal go by and think, ""I want that!""...State Bird allows you to see, smell, and hear the description of each dish before you decide if you want it.  My husband thought it was a great dining ""deal"".  We got seconds of some dishes and passed on others that just didn't appeal to our senses.  I can certainly see why State Bird has been racking up the awards! Nicely executed dishes served dim sum style.  SF is blooming with creative chefs and concepts.  This place is always packed and best to come early or be patient while they put you on a wait list.  The food is approachable using the best in local ingredients and delivers on flavor. The restaurant just wasn't up to the hype. One of the biggest weaknesses of the place is that some of the off-the-menu items were not all offered to the table when you are there. But one could request it from the kitchen if you know what you want. So one always feels like you are missing out somehow. For instance, the burrata on garlic bread looked great that another table ordered, but we never got to try it since we saw it at the end of the meal. The restaurant was incredibly loud, reminding me of one of those trendy restaurants in NYC, where one can't hear the waitress who is trying to communicating the special of the day (in this case, what's in the cart), except that everyone is a lot more casually dressed and the wall hangings are a bit too apocalyptic for my taste.some of the best dishes:lobster crouton with lobster salsa on top. Fresh, perfectly cooked lobster steeped in a lovely sauce, which is a lot less sour than the usual ceviche sauce.dungeness crab with farro: farro produced a texture that almost reminded me an in-between of risotto and steel-cut oats, not too creamy, with fabulous aroma, and topped with big chunks of crab.CA state bird -- fried quail, the signature dish. Very good, light crusted with tender moist quail. Half portion is enough for two for a taste.The other ones:Smoked Sturgeon -- this was a winner at my table, especially for the people who like smoke salmon lox bagel. I think of it as a riff on that dish, a much more refined version of it, with sturgeon whose texture is cooked to perfection. Boudin noir / blood sausage -- average, especially for a person who was never that into boudin noir in France.Kimchi on top of tofu skin -- not sure what the big deal is, if you have tasted a shanghai dish with pickeled mustard green with tofu skin and soybean, you would not be impressed.Sea urchin pancake -- I like the sea urchin, but the amount of sea urchin to pancake was too small to satisfy the sea urchin lover's palate.Pork Belly dish // Short rib dish -- same genre, average. My favorite pork belly is still momofuku noodle bar's pork belly bun. this one is just not as tender. Earl grey, cocoa nib, almond ice cream sandwich -- the best dessert, not too sweetoyaki (japanese bean cake) with some sauce -- interesting combination. averagechocolate souffle cheesecake -- unusual texture. I liked the chunks of chocolate that sometimes one happens to catch in a spoonful of the dessert. It's having a bit of an identity crisis though, not as rich as a chocolate souffle, and not as creamy as a cheesecake.Gosh, we did eat a lot for the four of us, had a bottle of wine and 2 pots of coffee. $60-70/person which is quite reasonable.I highly commend the chefs on being experimental and constantly combining various elements of multiple cuisines every day/week/month. But part of the downside is that the quality may be inconsistent across dishes. As long as one doesn't care and want to experiment with the chef, one should try this place out (when the hype dies down a bit and when it's a bit easier to get a reservation). Delicious!!  My bf and I waited two hours to eat at this place.  It's always best to make a reservation but good luck getting one!  The staff say on the weekends you have to go at least 1.5 hours before opening and on the weekdays maybe 30 minutes to an hour.  This place is definitely worth the wait.  Because we waited so long, out in the cold, the staff gave us some free hot chocolate and if you're waiting that long you can always go to Q-cup across the street and get some milk tea while you wait.I recommend trying everything, but be sure to get the CA state bird with provisions dish which is on their menu daily.  Also, try out the dishes that are not on the menu.  I really liked the hamachi-avocado seaweed crostini dish.  Everything tasted delicious and I would love to come back again. Unique set up - you can order small dishes off their menu, and other items you order as the waitresses/waiters bring it around to you, as in dim sum.  Fair warning though, it is kinda hard to pass up the dishes when they offer it to you in your face - I think that was their plan.  Some of our favorites included the quail, duck pate... It's pricey though.  $$$$$$$ Be prepared. Tried just about everything, and loved it all. Crazy busy, and loud, but it's a small charming place, with a friendly attentive staff. Food was delicious.  I can't remember 1 dish I didn't completely enjoy.  I can see why it is so difficult to get into this place!  One suggestion for all future diners is to take it easy and go slow.  Since this place serves their food ""dim sum"" style it is easy to get excited and order every delicious looking dish that passes by.  But the problem is that you eat everything as fast as you order it (just like good old regular dim sum) and you get full crazy fast.  You can't help yourself as things are just so yummy...or maybe that was just a problem my group had?!?  Minus 1 star because service was meh...our waiter was a little too cool for school.  Usually poor service would affect my experience more.  I think the dim sum format and that fact we ordered a bottle of wine made it easy for us to ""take care"" of ourselves and still have a fabulous night despite the meh service. Wow, what a lucky person I am to have ended up at this restaurant by accident.  How perfect to have incredible food in a completely relaxed atmosphere.  I love the fact that you can try so many things, rather than an appetizer and entree in other great restaurants.  The trout was delicate and perfectly prepared.  The crab and farro, was what a day at the beach would taste like.  The pancakes are amazing.  I have reservations to go back and can't wait!  But, it was worth the wait in line and hour and a half to get a seat.  There is a cute wine bar around the corner to wait at. I loved Silver Linings Playbook. Wait, that's the movie (I did love it though). State Farm Prudential? Nope, insurance companies. State Bird Provisions...that's the name of the restaurant!When I first heard about it, I kept forgetting the name, so up until our visit my girlfriend and I kept amusing ourselves with various versions we thought the restaurant name sounded like. I could go on, but I won't. And rest assured, the food was no joke.Although there is a standard food menu, what makes this place truly unique is the pay-as-you-go dim sum style small plates that the servers carry/roll around. Whereas in dim sum it's fairly easy (for me at least) to pace myself and not over-order, it's nearly impossible here. BECAUSE EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD. How much do I order from the menu? Do I get one or two orders from this cart when I know more is still to come? Do I have room for dessert? WHERE ARE YOU STAN?? I'M IN A GLASS CASE OF GLUTTONY!!!Whoa. Lost my composure there. Apologies.Now on to the food. I'm not going to go over everything we ate, because as evidenced by our bill, we practically ordered everything. I will say, the highlights were the peking duck, the pork, the hamachi nori, and the ribs. And I'm not even a big fan of ribs, but they were fall of the bone tender. So glorious.One issue I had is with our service. Our waiter wasn't rude, he was just...weird. Everything he did was at inopportune times and he was clearly not amused by anything we were saying. I know this place serves food dim sum style, but I wasn't expecting the service to be similar to those restaurants as well. Whatever, it wasn't enough to dampen the overall experience, as all the other servers who brought around the provisions were nice and welcoming, and the food was delicious, of course.I can't wait to return to this place. But it will have to be in two months (at the earliest) because this place is already booked through then. The place is small, so unless you want to wait for hours, reservations are the way to go. One final shout out to the earl grey ice cream sandwich. A delicious end to a great meal. There is a lot of great food in SF, so it is a real treat to go to someplace for the first time an come away anxious to go back.  We had a four-top on Friday evening.  We ate robustly, ordering one of just about everything that came around, plus a few things off the fixed menu.  The flavors were universally bold and interesting.  The one non-meat eater among us had plenty to eat, despite the carnivores among us.  The five star rating is for the food and for the staff who were awesome.  The wine list has enough choices to have something nice to pair with the food, but you are not coming here for the wine.  Also, the place was packed and very loud. It is a tough reservation to get, but one that I will make and clear my calendar for. I just couldn't get into this place.  And I didn't even have to wait, even though we were walk-ins and the place was packed.  Admittedly though, the servers were really nice, and pointed me in the direction of a great wine that I've never tried before (cannonau).  With respect to the food, there were a couple of hits - and a lot more misses.  Maybe I was expecting too much of the quail and the short ribs, which were dull.  Burrata cheese garlic bread was nothing special, especially once the cheese cools down and hardens.  The guinea hen dumplings seemed gimicky.  I probably won't go back. I am giving it a 4-star, because the quality is not as good as when they first opened. Don't get me wrong, their duck moss and the sea urchin pancake are still to die for. However, they took away a couple of my fav dishes (salmon roe with chips and the salmon pancake) and for some reason the fried quail isn't as delicious anymore;( We rolled in past 10 pm last night, and we were seated within 10-15 minutes. It was our first time; we were curious about all the press surrounding the restaurant. The entire staff was friendly and down to earth, and everyone was enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the food. The inside of the restaurant was cheery and a bit kitschy, reminding us of an old school diner. It was fun having the option to order from the ""dim sum"" trays and/or from the menu. So many choices, and everything was made fresh from the open kitchen!We tasted the following provisions:- kimchee yuba- glazed pork ribs- sweetbread meatball- red trout- cast iron quail eggs- ricotta dumplings- smoked sturgeon pancake- Seville orange granita, lime curds, and Asian pearAll the flavors popped for us. In fact, some dishes were too salty. To us, the stars of the night were the red trout (perfectly cooked) and ricotta dumplings (reminded us of burrata.) Both dishes included hazelnuts - the crunch contrasted nicely with the soft texture of the fish and dumplings. We appreciated the addition of fresh herbs to many of the dishes and the piping hot temperature of our main proteins.We are glad State Bird Provisions takes reservations, but we wish they were on Open Table... We'll be back! Been hearing a ton of hype about this place as ""one of the best new restaurants in America"" and whatnot. And while I do agree the food was really good, I wasn't completely blown away. A big part of it for me was the fact that they come up to you every 5 minutes asking to try something off the tray. This would be fine -- IF you had the option to opt out. I've eaten at similar restaurants (Dim-Sum and Brazilian churrascaria steakhouses) where you can put up a small flag or other such indicator on they table if you would not like to be approached by the food trays. It became hard to have a conversation with my date when we were being interrupted every few minutes and I found myself starting to resent the servers for doing so, even though the staff was actually really nice.My only other critique would be lighting. The decor is neat but it was too bright in there, which hurt the ambiance. Felt like a cafeteria. I would recommend it for sure, and all this to say the food *was* really good -- especially interesting and tasty was the fish egg/egg salad and the ribs. And of course the state bird...with provisions. :) I really wanted to like this place, as I've heard so many good things, but after paying way too much for leaving still hungry, I was very disappointed.The wait for this place is out of control. I got there right when it opened and was told there was a 2.5 hour wait. I understand that it is a tiny restaurant, but then why have a reservation system at all? It would work better to have a walk-in-only establishment.I was seated around 8pm and ordered quickly, since I was starving. While I waited for my food, various servers came up to me and thrust dishes in my face. They described them and would insist that I eat them, looking disappointed if I didn't oblige. I could barely have a conversation with my friend because I kept being interrupted by them and it got annoying quickly. Many of the dishes did look good, but they were so tiny that they didn't seem worth the $8-$10 price tag, so I only ordered one small plate that was indeed, so small that I could barely enjoy it.The crab farro was not worth its $20 price tag - it was small and lacked seasoning. I had to ask for salt and pepper and got a dirty look when I did. The sturgeon pancake, however, was delicious, and I only wish I had ordered 2 or 3 of those and called it a night. Everything was expensive, so I left without trying dessert and ate another dinner at home since I was still hungry.State Bird has a lot of potential, and I can see it being a really great place. But if it wants to have a successful dim sum concept, it needs to be a bigger restaurant and it needs to appreciate that its diners are waiting 2-3 hours to eat there. Not once did anyone ever acknowledge me for waiting so long or offer me anything complimentary or otherwise, which was a total letdown. It didn't feel very hospitable to me, and I was very disappointed. I'm a bit torn about this place.  Went in, knowing about all the hype and having read the articles about it being the best new restaurant in 2012, etc, etc.. so it was pretty hyped up.  Went in.. the space was nice... kitchen WIDE open and in the front.  A counter at the front for 3 people to stand and eat, then about 9 more bar spots to sit and eat and watch them cook.  Everyone waits along the wall by the kitchen... and the seating area is in the back.. looks like no tables more than 4 people.  It's an interesting and cool concept.  You order off a limited menu and then they also come by with trays and carts (kinda dim-sum style) with special dishes of the day.  There is a price clearly showing how much each is, which I think is nice.  Everything is meant to be shared.  It's an interesting way to eat... there is food, you just eat and share... no order to anything... no courses... kind of like a tasting or a cocktail hour with horderves.  Some notes:1. The service was great.  We were greeted warmly.  Our server asked us if we'd been there before and explained everything well.  The people who came by w/ the trays/cart described their dishes well.  Our plates got switched out when we wanted, etc etc.2. It's not pretentious at all.  It has more of a neighborhood, casual feel.... kinda hipsterish.3. The price wasn't bad.  We got a LOT of dishes, including 4 big $16-20 ones off the main menu.  The smaller plates they come by with are small and cheap.. they range from $6-10.  Include a bottle a wine and it was $65 a person w/ generous tip.4.  The smaller dishes, you wonder how are four people going to share this (one meatball?).  but it's actually no problem.5.  They bring out the trays and carts at random, so they brought out stuff at the end I wanted to try but we were already full and done eating...The food itself?  It was interesting and unique.  It was good but not awesome.  Nothing wowed, nothing popped, the flavors were kind of muted if anything.  The state bird (fried quail), the duck, the beef salad were all pretty good; the ribs were weird.. not really glazed or sauced like you would think.. tender, but not super tender; the pancake with smoked sturgeon was awesome; the garlic bread with burrata was good texture, but no flavor; the sweetbread meatball was ok; the spicy kimchi yuba with smoked egg 'bottarga' was interesting in a good way... a bit oily but it did have a good kimchi flavor; the vegetable romesco was so-so... the swordfish and artichoke was so-so... I didn't like the ice cream sandwich...  we got a few more dishes I think, but I can't remember... overall, it was just muted flavors.Given the opportunity I'd go back.  try some other stuff. My friend took me here for my birthday!  Fried quail: must have.  the half order ($8) was just enough to taste Several cold seafood dishes (salsa/avocado thing, raw seafood salad) were flavorful and refreshing.Steak salad: very very rich, with delicious lemony oyster mushrooms.The garlic bread is deep fried and topped with a mound of burrata.  My friend needed another order, but I found it to be too rich.Other things were unmemorable: a single dumpling in a lemony broth, sweetbread meatball.  Mini sauerkraut pancakes: delicious Expect a slow meal (carts came by once every 10 min).  We had a 30 min wait even with reservations.  Easy street parking + structure nearby. Meh. Food is good, but service needs a lot of help. Don't ask me to pay $200 for dinner for 2 and then act like you're doing me a favor.Got a walk-in table, which they told us would be late. They ended up getting our number wrong, so we called in at 9:45 and they gave us a table. Our waiter was very cool when he was at the table, but I've never been so rushed in a meal in my life. It was just uncomfortable. Staff literally was mopping around the table at 10:45. And there was an audible cheer as we walked out the door.Net net: if you're going to play in the big leagues, act like it. If you didn't want to stay late, don't seat a customer late. That's all there is. But when you do seat a customer, you should at least pretend like you're excited to make more money. Because you're charging an arm and a leg for what's basically fried chicken and a few novel sides.I'd be shocked if they got a Michelin star. That requires service and class. This is more like a hipster flash-in-the-pan type place. Excellent service, but the food was fine.  Not bad, not great, just fine. Details: guinea hen dumpling (basically, a won ton in chicken broth with cumin)garlic bread burrata (bread was tough but burrata is always yummy)quinoa and mushrooms (very bland and mushy)pork belly with orange and mint (dry/overcooked but good flavor combination)ribs (dry/meh)beef (the best dish)the seafood selections (lobster lentil dish was good, but the others were just ok) the ice cream sandwiches (ok)After all the hype, I was a bit disappointed. One of the few restaurants that actually live up to the hype. Living walking distance we  figured we blew our chance to try SBP once every magazine started pimping it, locally and nationally. It was to out pleasant surprise that we walked in ans scored a cancellation and was seated at the counter within 5 mins. I'm feeling you now, State Bird!No need to go on about the food. Enough has been said and 9 out of 10 our dishes were awesome. So you're good there. Where my expectations were essentially neutral was in the staff. Genuinely happy to be working there and it showed. We got treated to the milk shots for dessert too so got to feel a little special though guessing this happens often but whatever-nice touch SB! And it was my official first goodbye hug by a staff member I just met. AwwwPersonal tips:-Don't take every dim sum dish that first comes out. The options were plentiful and you'll get stuffed so bide your time and check out all the options first-Go counter. You get to chit chat with the cooks about anything and everything Thank you Stuart!  You and your staff are all super cool.  Not much else to say other than it was a truly great experience dining here. I enjoyed every dish I tried.  The state bird (Fried quail), the uni scallion pancake, the lobster jar, the guinea hen with fragrant broth and the sweatbread meatball.  All were delicious and should be on everyone's must try list.  I left the hollow leg at home otherwise I would have gone for the hamachi crudo on the nori and the burrata and garlic bread.  Good luck getting reservations or try coming in super early at 5 to get a walk-in spot.  It's totally worth it. One of the best dinning experiences I've ever had hands down! All the servers are extremely friendly and informative. But the food is what takes the cake here! I loved the small tapas style dishes. And just so creative with all the different combinations. I would recommend anyone to go here! You will not be disappointed!  Definitely go with  a group of 2-4 people and share your dishes. It's extremely fun!Definitely rated best new restaurant in the country last year for good reason :) this restaurant was amazing and def worth the two month wait for the reservation!  Just walking into the restaurant and watching the food that was coming around in the carts we were ready to make our next reservation.My favorite dish by far was the pork belly.  The sauce that it came with was to die for!  Another must for me was the sourdough pancakes.  They came out at the perfect temperature and the ricotta inside made for a great texture.The only dish that I could have gone without was the steak tartar.  The anchovy was a little too overpowering for me but it was still nice to have a few bites of salad with the meal.I would definitely recommen only ordering a few dishes off the actual menu and waiting for the carts to come around.  The element of surprise about what we could possibly have next was really fun.  For dessert the candied almond and chocolate ice cream sandwich was my favorite.  The meringue almost made it taste like a sophisticated s'more.  And yes on our way out we did make our reservation for our next dinner there. 13.02.19    1st TimeFood                      4 1/2Price                      $45-$65Atmosphere         3 1/2Words cannot do this place justice.I will try.Everything other than waiting in line was fun experience.I will bring out the bad news first.NEGATIVE:   YES, the line IS infamous as other blogs say.          - Showing up 40 min earlier still garner  2hr 06min wait.              We were text-ed earlier than estimated time.             I love restaurants that gives worst case scenario time.            At least we could do other things other than ...                     hearing table will ready in 10 min ... for 5 times!

I was full          and yet the temptation kept coming ... next time          you little devils...--------------------------------------------------­-------------------------------------------POSITIVE:  (Counter seating ... dubbed Chef's Table or Counter)   One hell of customer service!   Not a single snubbed or bad service.   Everyone was introduced ... including all 5 line cooks!!!   Each order was vividly and fully described !!!   Each offerings had price listed.

(Not to sound like a food snob                       I don't usually sounds like this ... check my past blogs ...                       some of the dishes was breathless.rough draft ... will update For how busy they are, their customer service rocks.Food Quality - Excellent.Food Taste - Good.Food Originality - Excellent.Price - Good.Customer Service - Excellent. The lady who manages the place has so much positive energy even tat 10:45PM. If everyone enjoyed their work like she does the world would be a better place :)Ambiance - Good. My #1 bestie and her boyfriend went to statebird while I third wheeled, but we're all family so it's whatever. We stood at that standing bar and ordered a ton. They say its fun to stand there but don't believe them!!Food:The duck liver mousse with almond biscuit was creamy, flavorful, and really cute. Yes, order this.garlic bread with burrata- good but not garlicky enoughSeafood salsa wasn't great. Kind of bland and boring. I felt schemed. Meh, I'd pass.CA state bird with provisions. This is their fried quail. The lemony onions were great but the bird was bland. I'm obsessed with fried food but even I was kinda just like wtf. HUGE disappointment. Super PASS.Half dozen quail eggs on iron pan. nothing special, an expensive nothing special too..Strawberry ice cream sandwich- yum yum yum, yes please!The peanut muscovado milk was given to us complimentary for being in the standing spot. The girl was super sweet but I just don't like peanuts vey much..UNI PANCAKE. THIS. THIS. THIS. FIVE PLEASE. SERIOUSLY. MAKE THAT SEVEN. WHY ARE YOU SO DELICIOUS. this was the absolute BEST thing I had here. So obsessed. Arguably the best uni I've had in my entire life. Order this please. One for yourself and one for me. Think of me while you eat it and graciously thank me by dropping one off to me after. You're already welcome.I'm gunna try the sturgeon pancake next time. But forreal, uni = bomb. I enjoyed this place. Went on a random Tuesday night without reservations at 5:10 and just missed the first 5:30pm seating. Why is this place so jam packed? Mardi Gras that night in the Fillmore? Maybe, but I would like to say it is because of the well warranted buzz surrounding their delicious food and novel concept. Burrata fried bread and nori fish thing were great. Dinner at the bar overlooking the kitchen enhanced the experience. We got superb service from Glenn and had fun watching him and others assemble each wave of dishes. Drink and wine menu were fine. Atmosphere was hipstery and alright. Key thing, everyone felt welcome there and I saw so many happy dinners. I was one of them.Try to get a reservation or get off work as early as you can to get a walk in spot. Worth experiencing at least once. Best dining experience I've had in awhile! The service was amazing and the food was fun, inventive and delicious! Each dish is explained properly and there's no pressure to grab everything that passes by, although you'll want to since everything looks great. Just pace yourself and enjoy the experience!Note: Definitely get reservations. Chances are slim that you'll get seated if you wait in the LONG line out front unless you're willing to wait a few hours. We made another reservation with the hostess as we were leaving - heck yeah! This is actually the real deal.  The food was super fresh, creative, interesting.  A unique dining experience even for a jaded crowd that has seen it all.Good atmosphere with clearly lots of adoring and doting fans. For the big #600, it seemed fitting to review ""one of 2012's best new restaurants in America"".  Fortunately for me though, I actually knew nothing about that before my friend and I stopped in for dinner (does that mean I'm not a true foodie?).  However, despite not having those huge expectations, I was still hopeful after hearing so many good things about them, and State Bird did not disappoint!Although it's not a concept unique to them, it's pretty cool how State Bird runs its meal service like a dim sum restaurant.  In addition to their staples you order off the menu, the workers will also bring around the day's ""provisions"" - about 5-10 dishes that rotate and change on a day-to-day basis.  Of the ones we tried, the first two below and the dessert are signature dishes, while the rest were part of their daily ""provisions"".- Green Garlic Toast and Burrata Cheese(yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…)One of the two dishes my friend said we had to get (the State Bird was the other), but I would have got this whether she wanted it or not.  Lightly fried garlic toast topped with creamy burrata cheese, olive oil and ground black pepper...what's not to like?  It was so good, I wish she ""made"" me get my own order!- CA State Bird with Provisions - Breaded and Fried Quail with Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese and Stewed Lemon Onions(yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…)We split a half order so that we could try several other things, but it just wasn't enough.  Unlike some Yelpers, I didn't think the breading was all that thick, but I agree the quail was missing that mild gaminess to it.  However, I actually didn't mind since it didn't get in the way of the tasty stewed lemon onion sauce and the MMMMMM...CHEESE!  Just make sure you get enough to go around. - Togarashi Oysters  - Saint Simon Oysters topped with Pickled Corabi, Sesame, and Chili Pepper(yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…)Really fresh, but it was our least favorite of the night.  For me, the pickled corabi and chili pepper came off a little strong for the more delicate oysters.  Still, not a bad dish at all; just that I might look to try something new before getting it again.- Duck Liver Mousse with Almond Biscuits(yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…)It's no foie gras, but I'll gladly take this as a substitute while I hope/wait for the real stuff to return.  The liver is rich, but it doesn't leave you with that gross feeling inside.  The almond biscuits though, were amazing - just the right amount of sweet, almond flavor.  If it's offered, it's a must get if you like duck liver.- Eggnog Ice Cream Sandwich with Sherry Chocolate Coulis(yelp.com/biz_photos/stat…)Neither of us really had dessert in mind, but my friend really wanted to try this one after she saw another table get it.  Good call!  The egg nog flavor was rather mild, and the chocolate was delicious.  The almonds were great as well, and added some nice texture/crunch.With such awesome food (and amazing service...the workers were so genuinely nice!), it's no wonder getting a table at State Bird can be tough.  Reservations are ideal, but they're usually booked up a month or two out.  Otherwise, they do set aside some tables for walk-ins.  Just arrive early or late (it's not that big of a place).  We did the latter and were lucky enough to get a table immediately...at 9:15pm on a random weeknight.  However you get in though, I'm sure you'll leave pretty happy! My wife was out celebrating a friends birthday so I decided to give SBP a try as a single walk-in on a Tuesday night around 7:30.  Was seated at the bar in about 5 min.  Everyone was extremely friendly and seemed to really enjoy working there which made for great conversation throughout the evening.  Forrest, my commrade behind the bar was gracious enough to let me talk his ear off and was extremely helpful with the menu items (what his favorites are at the moment, all-time, wine pairing, etc.).My top 5 favorites of the evening:- mushroom & quinoa with toasted 'gomasio'- duck liver mousse with almond biscuit- hamachi-avocado seaweed crostini- raw oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesame- garlic bread with burrataThe mushroom & quinoa and hamachi crostini dishes tied for my overall favorites. I, of course, overindulged and had a few other small plates and was pleasantly stuffed to the gills.  The ambiance was a bit loud, but I thoroughly enjoyed the lively atmosphere.  Upon leaving, the majority of the staff behind and in front of the counter made it a point to smile and thank me for coming in.  Definitely going back soon! 1 month of waiting for a reservation.2 months of waiting after the reservation was made.2 meals skipped prior to dinner.4 famished/excited people.2 hours of stuffing and gluttony.after 3 months of waiting to try State Bird Provisions, my game plan was to wreck thru the place like a tasmanian devil...mission accomplished.as soon as we sat down, it was like we've all been there before...i mean, we've all had dim sum before, and State Bird is practically the same...err, just better...concept wise, pre-made ""share"" dishes, carted around for people to eye f*ck while you still have other dishes on your table...this place will definitely bring out the fat kid in you...if you were to ask me what i had for dinner there, i honestly wouldnt be able to tell you, ONLY because there was so much intermingling of all the dishes that i couldnt keep track...all i remember was sweating and stuffing my face full of all the different flavors that kept popping up in the middle of our table...appealing to both the eye and the palate, State Bird Pro. definitely lives up to the hype and accolades that its received in the past year.after revisiting the menu online, these are the dishes (and prices) that we had...-raw oyster with spicy kohlrabi kraut & sesame 3-guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth 3-duck liver mousse with almond biscuit 6-sweetbread meatball with quince & pickled veg 6-lobster, lentil & asian pear salad 8-steak tartare salad with anchovy & castelfranco 8-seafood 'salsa' 10-pork belly with winter citrus 10-mendocino sea urchin, ginger/scallion pancake, soy-lime glaze 14-glazed pork ribs with swiss chard, togarashi 10/20-1/2 dozen cast iron quail eggs, sunchoke & ravigote 12-'peking duck'....spiced confit leg, crepes, cloud ears & persimmon 20-buttery dungeness crab with farro 'spezzato' 20-candied almond & chocolate 'ice cream' sandwich, apricot meringue 8i dont want to bother you with describing every single dish (although i easily could) BUT i will tell you what i think are the MUST TRY DISHES...MUST TRY-----SEAFOOD SALSAMUST TRY-----PORK BELLY W/ WINTER CITRUSMUST TRY-----SEA URCHIN W/ PANCAKEMUST TRY-----1/2 DOZEN QUAIL EGGSMUST TRY-----PEKING DUCKMUST TRY-----DUNGENESS CRAB W/ FARRO SPEZZATOthe above dishes were amazing, and when i go back on April 4th (yes, we made reservations again immediately after dinner) i hope to have at least 3 of these MUST TRY items again...the only thing i was not impressed with was the steak tartare salad...was more of a caesar salad with a sprinkling of steak tartare...tasted good, but not up to par with some of the other dishes...cant wait to see what new items will be available for us in April...love this place! Love this restaurant!  I think, so far, my favorite in SF.It's a long wait if you're a walk-in, but it's worth it to sit on the counter near the chefs.  My opinion...best seat in the house.  (Suggestion: sign up on the waiting list then go grab drinks around the corner.  They'll call you when your table is ready.)Everyone is super nice and informative and the food is AMAZING! Disclaimer:  We haven't eaten here yet, we tried, oh yes we did.  Went down early, like 6 on a Monday and was told we could be seated at 8.  That's fine except I don't think they should have ""Walk-In's Welcome"" on the website.  It's kind of a farce, if I understand it correctly (please correct me if I am wrong) they use the counter space for reservations, not for the walk ins like most restaurants my husband and I go to.  It just turned me off... 3.5i've been wanting to try this place for months and would check the site periodically to make reservations.. i've never seen the reservation tool whenever i went on so i was convinced there was something wrong on the site.. on a random early sat afternoon, i saw the calendar for 60 days out but it landed on a tues so i made a mental note to check on wed.. i almost forgot about it but a friend just posted a pic from sbp tues night to remind me. i stayed up til almost 1am wed but no luck.. luckily my bladder woke me up in the middle of the night and saw that was about 430.. i immediately checked the site on my phone and lo and behold the calendar was up! scored a prime time sat 730 seating 60 days out. (had to cancel last min and made reservations for a diff day). it took a while but i finally made it...they have a menu where you order the bigger dishes and the smaller ones come out on a cart, dim sum style..now on to the food:-mendocino sea urchin on ginger/scallion pancake: the creaminess of the uni went well w the soft pancake-hamachi collar(special that night and only had 2 made): this was good and the soy glaze made the dish-seafood salsa w tortilla: salsa on top of whipped avocado.. i liked this but wasn't amazing-ricotta dumpling w chanterelle dino-kale ragout: ok, i wouldn't order this again-duck liver mousse w almond biscuit: loved it w the biscuit-chips and ahi tuna salad ""dip"": ok, the home made chips were a nice touch but too oily-ca state bird w provisions: so good we ordered another at the very end but the wait took so long that we didn't even want our second order and weren't in the mood to grab dessert herethere were def hits and misses.. would i come back? yes, but not in a while and only to try dishes i didn't get a chance to eatside note:bonappetit.com/restauran…bonappetit.com/blogsandf…bonappetit.com/restauran…nytimes.com/2013/03/10/m…;immaculateinfatuation.co… I stalked their homepage for months before I finally was able to snag a 9 pm reservation on a weekday. It felt like winning a golden ticket. Reservations are hard to come by, but it's definitely worth trying. I thought this was over-hyped, but it deserves all the accolades. It's one of my new favorite places to eat in SF. I think the ideal party size is 4, that way you can try a variety of dishes.Loved the dim-sum style of serving the small plates, we ordered almost everything that came around to our table.  Things that were noteworthy for me were:Here were my favorites:- Trout - This had mandarin oranges and the fish was tender and melted in your mouth.- Sea Urchin Pancake -  I don't normally like sea urchin too much, but this was delicious. A savory pancake, well seasoned, and the uni on top was the perfect touch.- CA State Bird - Deep fried anything is good. Slightly small portion, but delicious breading on the quail and fried to perfection.- Pork Rib - Tasted great, good seasoning, not too salty and the meat fell off the bones it was so tender.- Beef salad - So good, I don't normally like red meat, but this was delicious. Was seared just right, super tender, and good flavor. Roasted vegetables were paired perfectly. Okay:- Lobster, lentil and pear salad - It was good, but it was $8 for a baby-food sized jar of this salad.- Mushroom & quinoa - Tasted good, but wouldn't get it again. Could probably make it at home.- Oysters - The vinaigrette was a little overpowering on the oysterWe had other dishes but they must have been not-as-memorable. I didn't have anything that I didn't like, though.The highlight of the night was the dessert. The ice cream sandwich was the clear winner - thin brownie on the outside, vanilla ice cream with candied peanuts, apricot puree and a toasted marshmallow cream. We enjoyed it so much that we ordered a second of these. Definitely a must-have if you come.The total bill (before tip) for 4 people was $200. Not too bad since we got to try a wide variety of dishes, the quality was excellent and all the food was delicious. I'll definitely be back. What a fun and delicious place. Am stalking their site to make my next reservation 60 days from now...Definitely get a reservation for four people (can only do 2 or 4) -- like with dim sum, more dinner friends means more dishes. I think we ordered all but two of the dim sum dishes. We ordered without abandon, had 1-2 beers each, and ended up with a $50 bill + tip (so about $60). Favorites- Lobster salad with lentils- Garlic break with burratta- Ricotta dumplings- State Bird w Provision - crispy deliciousness- Ice cream sandwichWe also had the oysters (yum), uni flatbread (i've had better ways to have uni but interesting), ribs (fatty and delicious), bacon wrapped fish belly (fatty and delicious), and the white chocolate mochi rice pudding (yumm).Highly recommend getting two orders of the ice cream sandwich. They cut them up to four pieces, but it is SO worth getting two pieces each with the delicious citrus dollop and the marshmellow with the roasted crust (guessing torched). Gingery cookie. So good. Came here a few months ago right when it was featured in Food & Wine, just before reservations became so hard to get.  It was really good, but we resigned ourselves to not going back for awhile.  Then we got not one but TWO gift certificates here for a recent birthday!Tuesday was our second trip there, and that sealed it: it was terrific!  The service -- great; the wine -- delicious; the food -- wow!  Some of the tastiest, most creative preparations I've ever tasted: oysters with kohlrabi, uni on a seaweed 'cracker', sweetbread meatballs -- come on!  And the concept is still awesome: I haven't heard of dim sum trays and carts being used anywhere else but in a traditional dim sum restaurant, so kudos for the folks who thought this up!Interesting note about the crowd: it attracts all kinds, which is cool.  That night, we saw hipster buddies, PacHeights socialites, bridge-and-tunnel couples, and (annoyingly) some combo of 20-something guys and their 60-something bosses who must've been here for an IT convention and didn't know how to modulate their volume (no, bro/dude, you don't have to laugh at EVERY bad joke your boss tells).  It's a small space so expect to hear everything and have your chair bumped by the person behind you, but it's all part of the experience -- and worth it. OMG the hype on this place is well deserved. Love their dim sum concept. We really do eat with our eyes and seeing the dishes presented to you is much harder to say no to. I went with my husband, foodie friend, and my 5 year old son. He came away full and happy. He knows good food.My favorite was the duck liver pate w/ almond cakes. First off, the cakes were more like little bites of honey cornbread. The pate I literally, scooped onto my spoon and licked it off. No need to put the pate on the almond cakes at all. We had 3 orders. My son kept stealing the almond cakes off our plates.The hamachi on nori was beautifully presented. The nori was thicker than normal sushi nori but it was crispy and full of umami. The hamachi was tender and fatty and the light drizzle of sauce on top was perfect. There's nothing wrong at all with this dish. We had 3 orders of this.The ribs on the menu was surprisingly delicious and out-of-the-box. I thought they would likely be BBQ but I was wrong. They came on top of some greens that were drenched in oil. Too much oil on those greens. The ribs looked bland w/o the usually BBQ sauce drizzle and char. However, they were delicious. Not BBQ but braised likely. It was tender w/ the meat falling off the bones easily. I would have gotten another order had the greens not been so oily.The oysters were fresh but I did not like the overpowering mignotte on it.The lobster lentil salad was ok, not spectacular.The cerviche with potato chips was good. The fresh potato chips stood out more than the ceviche.The chocolate soda sounds really weird but I got it just to try. It is actually pretty good. It is good in a weird way.I don't remember what else we had. I was in a food coma and was blissfully happy. I didn't think it was that expensive. I think it is very reasonably priced for the quality of food. If the wait wasn't 2 months for a reservation, I would definitely go back more often. The service was wonderful and knowledgeable about what they were serving. It's important to know that they do not take reservation over the phone, you'll have to do it in person. All the staff are very nice and helpful. They serve the food in a ""dim sum style"" as they will walk around with a cart or plate of tapas and you can choose which one you would like to take. But, I found it easier to order from the menu as I was ordering from the walking plates at the same time. It was hard to tell when the next cart/plate will come around. My favorite dishes are the avocado and shirp with nori chip and buttery dungeness crab with farro 'spezzato'. A waiter told me that the Garlic Bread with Buratta is their most popular dish but it was a little too ""cheesy"" and too heavy for me. Also, I wasn't too fond of the dumplings, they were bland and stiff.Another tip for ordering food: do not order anything with the host. We could not locate our waitress for a while so we asked the hostess if she could find our waitress for us. The host took our order and ended up chatting with the gentlemen sat behind us for half an hour and our waitress never received our order.Overall, I love their decor and atmosphere. Service was great, and I enjoyed most of the dishes we got! This was singularly the best dining experience I've had in years!  I was completely blown away!I had heard this was the toughest place to get into with a 2 month wait and was fortunate enough to get a table.  I assumed it was an ultra trendy, upscale place and was surprised that it was so much more casual.  So casual and NOT trendy that I thought I was in the wrong place.  And it was all up hill after that. The concept is brilliant.  Signature menu-ed dishes while the staff wheels carts of small plates like they do in a dim sum restaurant.  The dishes are extremely inventive with a lot going on in texture and flavors yet all working magically together.  And the staff was the most pleasant, happy, helpful people you'll ever meet.  So much so that they helped make for an amazing experience!We had about 10 dishes and one was good, two were very good, and the remaining were sublime!  In the ""sublime"" bucket is: hamachi & avocado seaweed crostini; red trout; tuna crudo; ricotta dumplings; sourdough sauerkraut ricotta pancakes; and peking duck among others.While eating, I met the owner and instinctively stood up to speak with him out of deference because it was so amazing and couldn't have been nicer or more humble.  Brilliant!!!! It took about 2 months for a reservation.I wanted to loooooove SBP but I just couldn't.  The concept is amazing and it was well executed.  But I did leave hungry with a hole burned into my wallet.WHAT I ATE:fried herring: it was ok moist and crispstate bird: love the crisp on itquail egg: so delishtuna: passfried pig ear: LOVEEDDDD IT ordered it 2xhamachi on fried seaweed: SO GOODburratta garlic bread: so greasy gooddessert:  I can't remember what I ate so it wasn't that great. The concept is unique. The food is average, maybe a bit overrated. The staff is very friendly. Would I go so far to call it the best restaurant in America? Probably not. This was my third time at this restaurant. Keeps getting better. Service - on pointDecor - inventive? The map of the US with each of the state birds is pretty classic.Food - off the charts1) Uni Pancake - never seen anything like it. Tangy pancake, sweet salty uni2) Chips with Tuna Tartar - best salsa I've ever had 3) Ricotta pasta with roasted squash sauce - killer4) Crab with farro - toned down farro with some awesomely buttery crab5) Housemade bread with Buratta - I would take this as my last mealRelatively inexpensive and well selected draft beer. Good, but not zany wine list. HOLY COW. State Bird Provisions is hands down one of the best experiences I've had here in San Francisco.  The wait, the food, the ambiance, the restaurant - ALL WORTHHH ITT.Let's start with getting a table.  We all know it's next to impossible to get a reservation at SBP.  So, for the desperate triers like myself and Greg, we decided to game it and crash the party by showing up at 7pm and putting our name down on the waiting list.  Of course, we were met with ""it's going to be awhile"" and of course our response was ""yeah no problem, when is the next available seating?"".  The last thing we were expecting was, ""9:30pm or 10"".  Um what?  We put our name down, and then set off to go watch Lincoln at the Kabuki Theater around the corner.  As it turns out, this was one of the smartest things we did.  2.5 hours later, we saw the movie, and headed back to SBP.  When we got back, we had to wait another 20 minutes for our spots at the chefs bar to clear out, and finally, 3 hours later, WE WERE SEATED.  It should be noted that each time we walked in, we were greeted with one of the people at the restaurants.  This person made sure we were able to get on the waiting list, made sure we had the drink menu in case we wanted something to drink, and as it turns out, it was Stuart Brioza himself!  How awesome is that?!Ok, so, onto the food!  So right when we sat down, we could see the chefs preparing all of the tiny dishes that were going to go out to the tables.  One of the BEST things about sitting at the chefs bar is that you get first dibs on what's coming out of the kitchen.  That means, while the chef is garnishing that savory meatball, you get the first crack at it.  Not only that, but you get the 411 on what's in a dish, and can request something you like, or reorder your favorite item.  Here's what we had that night in our order of favorites:1. California State Bird with Provisions: YES YES YES.  This is as amazing as its advertised.  The perfect crust on the bird, an easy dish to share, and topped with some parm and onion jam.  The only small thing about this was that you have to kind of work for your food, the bird is a little small for a knife and fork, but it's totally worth it.1a. DESSERT: Candied almond & chocolate 'ice cream' sandwich, apricot meringue.  This was most definitely a piece of art and not dessert.  This was absolutely incredible.  It was as beautiful as it was delicious. A must try item (even if its just for the pics!)2. Greg's favorite of the night: the veal and sweetbread meatball.  The meatball itself was HUGE. Greg didn't feel like sharing, but in the small few bites I managed to get in before it was gone, this was delicious!3. Pan fried guinea hen dumpling with mushroom in a wonderful aromatic broth: This wasn't an item on the menu, so I don't know the specifics of what was in it.  BUT. long story short, Greg and I loved this so much, we got it again later on in the meal4. Pork belly with winter citrus:  This was one of my favorites!  I LOVE pork belly, and this was crispy and totally savory and when paired with the citrus, made for an absolutely wonderful experience!  I would have totally gotten this again :)5.  Homemade potato chips with avocado, tuna and bell peppers:  Greg loves potato chips, and with the avocado it was like guacamole meets poke meets picnic.6. Hamachi avocado seaweed crostini:  I really enjoyed this, but you have to really like seaweed to enjoy this.  I really loved the avocado and fish to go with the big nori chip.7. Olive oil bread with burratta: This was a really whimsical dish, I'm not sure if I loved it, but it was certainly a great idea!  Definitely worth trying since it was a popover with cheese on it.8. Sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancakes: I'm not saying these aren't good, but relative to everything else, these were just OK.  They were dollar sized so they were perfect to share.  I love these, but I'd try another version of these next time.So, the long story of this, I totally would wait 3 hours again for State Bird.  And I would want to go with a bigger group so that I could try more things!  I love here, and I can't stop raving about this to all of my Yelp and non-Yelp friends :)  Do yourself a favor and head over to SBP! It took us 2 months to get reservations for SBP....5:30pm on a Saturday.  Traffic was bad getting into the city and I knew they would cancel our reservation if we were more than 15 minutes late.  We called 3 different times to let them know our status and arrived at 5:46pm (5:45pm to the restaurant, but took us a minute to get to the front of the line).  We had to beg to be seated, and told we would be seated, but that we had to leave by 7pm.  I didn't think much of it, but she actually came up to us at 6:55pm to remind us that we had to leave by 7pm.  This was with one more dish coming out from the kitchen and no dessert ordered yet.  We paid $340 + tip....I would expect to NOT get rushed through my meal.  Our waiter was extremely bored, but he got us stuff when we needed it.  The people ""selling"" the food didn't make much of an effort besides tell us the ingredients. They didn't tell us how it was prepared or anything.   The chef came out though and he was a really nice, happy guy.  Total burst of sunshine and energy compared to the rest of the drab snooty staff.  Everything we ate was unique and well made, but nothing was insanely addicting that would make me want to come back.  $340 + tip for 4 people.....stress on the drive up....stress checking in....stress in having to eat at warp speed...stress at getting reminded that we had to leave at 7pm .....really not worth it.  There are so many other places to eat in the city.  This fad will quickly die out. Great restaurant, innovative, friendly, down to earth, not pretentious, exceptional food. Hard to get reservation so plan ahead. Love it! Update 4/24: I returned to Statebird when Emily was working. Shout out to Emily - hostess, scheduler and customer service representative extraordinaire. All staff were super friendly and helpful. Def returning for my next set of friends visiting or new to the neighborhood. Love the food at State Bird. The chef's table is always a great time.Living so close to the restaurant is awesome. The State Bird experience is a must do. For veggies, the Buratta with bread has the flakiest tastiest bread - nice and not too creamy.One note: I've always love the way they've treated myself and my guests with our day of reservations. January 14th however, I was slightly disappointed. Our reservation was for 7:30 PM. I was taking my visiting from out of state friends and they were all excited. We arrived on time. Once arrived, they told us we did not have a real reservation and that we would have to wait until someone left. I've never had anyone ever tell me this, and had I known we would be treated this way, I might have chosen another option. I don't know if it was a chaotic night or miscommunication but after nearly an hour of waiting we were seated with no apologies or remorse.Again, I love this place, but please note what day you are going and how your day of reservation might be treated. This place is a must eat! Wonderful American food in dim sum style. The only have about 10 items on the menu and then everything else is brought to you on trays or a cart. I can't wait to go back...probably in at least 60 days since they are always booked!If you want to eat here and can't get a resi, stand in line at 5pm and hope to get a table when they open at 5:30pm as they save a few tables for walk-ins. You just have to be okay with eating that early if you go that route. I forgot to write my birthday review back in April...2012 so not sure this counts. Food was great (yes, the quail was good. Small portions really add up $wise. Let me just say I am surprised about all the hoopla with waiting 2 months to get a table lately. I think there are better places in SF to wait for....Let me just share my b-day disappointment. The bf asked the waitress to put a candle in our dessert. She apparently said they don't do that here. So I see this dessert come out with a candle....right past me and served to another table :( My sad dessert came with no candle. WTH? I hope that waitress is no longer there. We got a Saturday night reservation, an amazing feat!  This is a fun place to eat.  The small restaurant is filled immediately on opening.  And soon after being seated, lots of food comes rushing out by cart and on trays.  You get to see the small plates before being served them which I enjoyed.  On their looks and verbal descriptions, you pick what you want from the servers.  My husband called it white man's dim sum.The food is interesting, tasty and fun.   There might be 15 small plates offered by servers on a walk around and then there is a ""Commandable"" menu of 9 larger plates, 3 pancake dishes, and desserts each made just for you in the kitchen upon ordering.  We enjoyed 9 small plates and 3 ""Commandable"" plates, 1 pancake dish and 1 dessert.We of course got practically all that walked by though one gal never stopped or even looked at our table as she went by offering them to our neighbors so we missed out on her dishes.  It did seem like most things made one trip out and about and then probably not offered again.  So do not hesitate to pick the dishes you want when you are first offered them. The food was good, not great but definitely not boring.  I found the small lobster and lentil cup lacked much lobster and the ahi tuna salad served with potato chips lacked much ahi tuna.   But the Dungeness crab and farro dish on the ""Commandable"" menu had great lumps of crab.  The Mendocino uni pancake too had a good amount of uni and we loved it.   There was also a hamachi small plate served on a fried nori that was really good!  There was a big hot bread served with a huge spoonful of  Buratta that should have been good but the fat was pooling on the plate.  I think the fat was not even from the cheese but from way too much butter on the bread.  The bread got tough and old immediately on cooling. We only each had a bite, for it definitely looked better than it tasted.  A large dumpling was served and enjoyed as well as some sort of meatball which my husband especially loved.  A refreshing small salad with grapefruit was especially interesting with many flavors. Oh, we had oysters too which were good but not great.  No oyster liquor left to give that so loved briny sea flavor.  I felt they may have been opened earlier so not just fresh for us.   None of the dishes cost so much that if they were misses, you did not feel abused and misused.  We also had the duck confit leg, their rendition of ""Peking duck"" from the ""Commandable' menu which was good too.  Served with thin pancakes which you filled with the duck and cloud ears.  The State Bird was some kind of tiny fried bird that which was as thrilling as its size.Our server was a delight.  We so enjoyed the ice cream sandwich offered on the dessert menu.  It killed me to leave some, it was that good. We found we ate for the first hour fast and furiously then spent the second hour relaxing as we picked at our ""Commandable"" menu choices while bemoaning our too full stomachs.Bill for 2 piggy eaters was about $240 including a bottle of wine plus 2 glasses.  We may come back!Update:  Just got home from Rich Table (the chef's menu with pairing)  and had to downgrade State Bird by 1 star.  Rich table was so much better.  Lots of WOWS  Our bill was comparable at about  $280.  Lots, lots of food and great pours. A gem in the Fillmore/Western Addition corridor. Reservations are basically impossible to get a this point, so my lady and I put our name in around 6:30pm on a Friday night and were told we'd be looking at a 10pm seating. That was fine with us, and we headed out into the night to enjoy some wine and cards over at Social Study. We got our seating call earlier than expected, and were seated with menues around 9:45pm--a late dinner to be sure, but worth the wait!As vegetarians, we were a little nervous but shouldn't have been: we ate the eff out of that restaurant:- Garlic bread with baked in burrata- Hummus and pita- Quail egg hashI also broke the vegetarianism and ate two oysters with pickled jalepeño. We enjoyed pistachio/strawberry ice cream sandwiches for dessert. But by far the best part of the evening was the waitress delivering our rosé champagne with squeeling, ""pink bubbly!"" with obvious delight. Service was excellent, as expected. The unexpected part for me was the price: entirely reasonable for a splurge! If you eat a lot of the small dishes, they do add up, but if you keep yourself in check, you can get out for about $40/person, including alcohol and tax/tip.Take aways:- Resign yourself to eating late and just put your name in at the beginning of the night- Come hungry State Bird with provisional 60 day wait to get a reserved table! Yay, still a fan but minus one star for that 60 day wait.The day and time came alas for our reservation which took 60 days to arrive. Cut short that last 30 minutes that Tarantino flick, Django Unchained, just to make our 10:30 Saturday night reservation. That was brutal so I was hoping State Bird Provisions would make our first visit worth the visit and make us forget what had ever happened to Django.The +'s:+Saturday night parking was not a wretch. We landed a place three blocks north of the destination but this area can get sketch. Luckily a policeman caught a brawl on the street and we safely passed.+Staff are very friendly and nice. Such a nice reception!+Quail eggs. Half a dozen arrived sunny side up. They were delish. Just perfect golden jewels!+Sea urchin pancake at $14. Get it before it runs out. It was just that good!+Glazed pork ribs on Swiss chard. The meat slid right off that rib. Half order is enough I think for 2 girls. Consider the Full order (4 ribs) if you have a bigger appetite.+Chocolate mochi dessert was plenty for two. That date with marscapone on the side definitely was a winning combination.+ Plenty of tapas kept running by our table on a timely basis. I love the idea of tapas rolling by dim sum style. There was plenty of variations to keep us hungry for more inventive creations but sated after each taste.The -'s- BIG minus is this 60 day wait for a reservation. Mentioning it a third time because it's a real sore point but hey this place is still hype. At least you can show up and hope you get seated before the places closes.- Not all the tapa dishes are a hit and at $8-11 per tapa, the bill tab adds up way faster than a dim sum restaurant.- It's kinda noisy. Voices echoed off our silverware, table, glasses and walls. It was kinda hard to hear my companion speculate on what had happened to Django in the end.- Mushroom dumpling. Meh. I thought it was salty and not much but my companion disagrees completely and said it was a highlight of the meal.- There was a poke like mix of tuna and chick peas that top off a potato chip. Not my fave either. claustrophobic creativity. When someone mentions this is the hottest new restaurant in the world/US/SF, the expectations are going to be high.  At 530 pm there was a line of about 20 people standing by outside, and it seems like maybe the first 12 sat down when the restaurant opened.For the price, I thought it was quite good.  And if it was easier to get in, I'd definitely go back.  The prices are reasonable, but yes, they are tapa sized items.  If we hadn't ordered wine, it would have only been $40-50 per person.  For that level of food, that is about what I'd expect for a good value.  I WAS expecting more ""wow factor"" given the press and rep--only 1-2 dishes really did that for me--but the service was excellent/friendly and approachable.  The citrus, avocado chili lime tapa was excellent.  Refreshing, but not so beguiling that I couldn't duplicate it at home (or so I think!).  I much appreciated the supremed citrus though.  The state bird was also pretty good (fried quail--just like you expect it to taste).Ribs were solid but not anything exceptional--dark green accompanying the ribs were also not so remarkable to us.  I personally thought the uni pancake was nicer (a bit more fluffy, and many flavors/textures) than the the saurkraut pancakes with salt.  But my other dinner guests would say the opposite  We also had two seafood tapas which were unremarkable and two desserts which were ok.  Despite the fact that we all thought the desserts were just ok, it was all gone somehow before we left.We were lucky to get a reservation for the same day we called (due to a cancellation).  If it were easier to get in (not such a labor) I would definitely come back because I thought the price for the level of what you get and what they're trying is great.  I don't think (personally) it's a michelin star level (does not delight and beguile).  But it's very smartly run, the kitchen has great intent, servers go out of their way for you, dim sum concept is fresh, and I hope they continue to be a great success.  When we go again, one thing we'll do differently is skip the $80 bottle of oregon pinot noir.   The wine was nice on its own, but once the food came... Let's just say that a lot of their dishes have enough fatty mouthfeel that any half decent glass of wine would go great.  Next time we'll just order a few individual glasses to have more fun sampling different wines.  That's probably a better philosophy given the variety of dishes State Bird offers. I was very excited to come here of course because of all the surrounding hype.  We were able to get a same day reservation, so if you really want to come here, just CALL and see if there have been any cancellations so you don't have to book 2 months out. The staff was all amazingly friendly and thank god for our reservation because there were about 20 people waiting to sit at the counter. We sort of went all out for this meal and just ordered whatever we wanted in order to have the full experience. We tried all the standards: sauerkraut pancakes, uni pancakes, State Bird w/ Provisions. Then some other plates: Lentil w/ Lobster & Fuyu, some dish with avocado and citrus, the ribs, the Peking duck, a mushroom wonton, the potato chips with creme fraiche, garlic bread w/ burrata, and others I can't remember. We also had two desserts: ice cream sandwiches and the mochi rice pudding.  I wish the Peking duck's skin was more crisp, the burrata more chewy, and the ribs were just really standard, nothing too exciting. The mochi rice pudding was yummy and not too sweet, but I won't think about it again like I do with some desserts.All of the food was interesting, but I have to say that the only things I really loved were the sauerkraut pancakes and the avocado with citrus thing. I could make the citrus/avocado thing at home and the sauerkraut pancakes were good because they were crunchy and balanced flavor-wise. All the other food was pretty good, but not mind-boggling. It was exciting to dine here, but I don't need to come here again.  The price of everything was very reasonable for the quality. 4.5!!Atmosphere and owner attentiveness make it worth it! Will write more soon. Such a fun evening! FYI: arrived at 5:00, a few parties ahead of us and we were the last walk-in to be seated (standing table for two hours!, great calf workout). Sixty days is a long time to wait for a restaurant reservation but in this case it was well worth it.  State Bird Provisions' ""dim sum"" concept is genius.  I wish more restaurants would adopt this approach as it allows you to sample more of their cuisine rather than being saddled with one or two principal dishes.I consumed far too much food to remember each and every item that I ate.  Resounding successes include the vinegar glazed smoked potato, garlic bread with burrata, seafood ""salsa,"" and the glazed pork ribs with swiss chard.  Service was excellent . . . the ambiance was so-so given that the place was packed and it was hard to have a real conversation but, whatever, that's the price you pay for dining at the new ""it"" spot in the city. We ate like royalty.Everything is well made and the atmosphere is casual. Go early REALLY early if you don't have a reservation. Tried to make a rez but nothing until Feb and it was a week night at 8;45 so on a Friday nite, we decided to take a chance as an early walk-in. BINGO.... got to the fillmore at 5:10pm, parked right in front, a line forming already and we are about 10th in line. Within 10 minutes, there is a line 1/2 a block long... Was it worth the HYPE? YES, YES, YES.... love sitting at the bar watching the action and being the first to check out the food as it comes out. We basically ordered all the food that came out on the cart. Didn't care what it was, we wanted to try everything. I can't even remember the name of any of the dishes we tried but they were all good... will post pictures in a bit... perhaps that would help... let's just say, there was not a thing we did not like...you must be an adventurous person to appreciate State bird. If your idea of dinner is a burger or pizza, skip this place and leave it to the adventurous souls. I would say you can easily spend $100 for 2 people without drinks but hey, it's worth it. Plates on the average is about $8.00 and they are tapa size. okay...this place was amazing.  we ate at 10pm because reservations are hard to come by, but it wasn't a big deal still had a great experience.  they serve american food dim sum style... the food was amazing.  i love that you get to try a bunch of different items.  they walk by and ""sell them"" to you without being pushy or salesy.  my favorite was the hamachi on the seaweed.  amazing!  the menu changes, but would definitely recommend it if you see it on there. It was a memorable dinner at State Bird Provisions.  I went here with my girlfriend and she emphasized it was the last Thursday meal of the year.  So for a Thursday dinner, it was quite fab.  We spontaneously decided to go to State Bird Provisions since it's one of her favorite restaurants and I had heard a lot of great buzz about this place.State Bird Provisions is in the Fillmore area inside a space that is quite cozy and small with an open kitchen in the front.  The food is brought out to you in ""Dim Sum"" style carts.We ordered the following:Ray OystersHamachi-Avocado Seaweed CostiniPig Ear ShoestringsCA State Bird with ProvisionsGrilled Beef SaladLobster, Lentil & Fuyu SaladI thought most of the dishes were excellent.  The Pig Ears were tasty and crispy.  I really enjoyed the Grilled Beef Salad since the beef was a perfect medium, rare with a nice flavor to it and buttery.  The Lobster was another highlight.  I can never get enough Lobster.To top it off, we ended the night with a full stomach and fully satisfied as well as we closed the night out with a shot each of the ""World Peace"" Peanut Muscovado Milk! I feel privileged to be able to write this review as my dining experience at State Bird was one of the most ethereal and euphoric I have yet to experience.  As close to perfection as it gets. Delighted to have shared this meal with two wonderful people that savored every morsel as much as I did.  Dinner here was an amazing way to end 2012. State Bird Provisions reservation is one of the toughest in the City. I booked New Years Eve on the first available day. Try going to their reservation page, and chances are that they're booked for the next 60 days. When you do get a reservation, just go all out when their dim sum like carts starting rolling towards your table. We basically tried everything off the carts because they all looked good. From the menu, the fried state bird and red trout is a must. From the cart, duck liver mousse, pork rillette, garlic bread with burrata, raw oysters, seafood salsa, potatoes with tonnato, variety of raw tuna with chick peas and chips, veal sweet bread meat ball,  and rice pudding. I could go on about SBP, but I won't. You really need to try it for yourself because it's a very different experience. Took my girlfriend here for her birthday on NYE. Definitely make reservations as the wait is easily 1-2 hours, even on a non-holiday night. The staff was very friendly and the food was excellent. We sampled several different items that the staff brought around and everything we tried was great. I wish I had written down what we wrote (which would probably make this review more helpful), but honestly, we didn't try anything we didn't like. I loved the experience I had! I cannot say enough about the staff, they are very accommodating and friendly. The Chef himself is personable and will answer any culinary question you have.  It is a unique atmosphere, the kitchen is in the front of the house.  We sat at the ""Chef's Table"" and watched as our food was prepared.  Everything from the Duck Neck Dumplings, to the Beef Cheek Salad with Bone Marrow was spectacular.  I highly recommend! I was really excited to take my sister to State Bird while she was visiting from New York. We had read all the hype and were intrigued by the dim sum style serving. However, we were completely disappointed. The pancake dishes are excellent. Unfortunately, the night we went they didn't have good pancake options (at least compared to others I talked to who recommended certain ones to us but they were no longer on the menu.) The other dishes are mediocre especially many of the asian inspired dishes. The combination of flavors don't go well together. It's almost as if they are trying too hard to come up with interesting combinations.If you want to eat right when you sit down, you won't have a problem. The food comes out immediately. The drawback of the dim sum style serving is the servers push food on you and almost make you feel guilty if you don't want it. They do a good job trying to sell you on each dish. If you want to have a quiet and relaxing dinner this is not the place to go. You will likely be in and out fairly quickly and it's difficult to have any conversations at the table without being constantly interrupted by the serving carts. The worst part about our experience was our waiter. He was very friendly when we first sat down and throughout our meal but when we asked for the check much earlier than he expected he turned completely cold. We couldn't believe it. Clearly we didn't eat enough food or spend enough money for him and his attitude was shocking. It just left us with a bad taste in our mouth walking out of the restaurant. This restaurant could be a lot better if they had more pancake options. Usually there are three on the menu, and they could easily double it. They are unique and very tasty. A friend had made reservations two months prior. We ordered the quail, seafood with raw veggies, hamaki with avocado, beef tartar. Everything was delicious, but we didn't like the duck liver pate with almond biscuits. The first biscuit was fine, but they became too sweet didn't complement any of the other dishes we had. Had been looking forward to trying this place since devouring their garlic bread knots with burrata at the mission street food fest in August. My expectations were met and then some! We didn't have reservations and got to the line at 5:00, about 12 people deep by then. We missed the first wave of walk ins, but enjoyed cocktails at Yoshi's-who mentioned how they've had more bar customers since SBP opened. :) We were seated at the chef's counter by 7:15 and enjoyed every minute of sitting up close to the action. Everyone, from the owner to the chefs to our waitress and the hostess, was extremely helpful throughout the whole meal. We tried 10 different things before we filled our bellies to the brim, enjoying each one. We especially loved the quail, kimchi pancake, sweetbread meatball and burrata (of course :)). Interesting, but we could have passed on the pork ear strings. In the end, it came to $70 each (went with my bf) including the $20 corkage, 10 items and tip. The bf was just as excited to try each dish as I was and we both can't wait to go back! A really different approach to American cuisine. They have a dim sum style which is really cool if you're the type that wants to taste a little of everything! The food was delicious but I gave them 4 stars because they didn't have much of a variety. I went back and ate at the counter.  Excellent.  Once you do not have the interruption of the cart you can just sit and point to the food coming hot off the stove and there it is right in front of you.Though some dont like sitting at counters, I love it as one gets to see the action up close and this team is fun to watch.The food was as good as it was on the first visit and I must reiterate, there are a lot of hip restos in this city that are hard to get into but in truth, the food is really quite mediocre where as here at SBP, the food is very very good.I will be going back very soon. Over-hyped, but entertaining with regard to the dim sum style service. Be prepared to spend some money if you want to leave with a full stomach. The best tiny dish, hands-down, were the dumplings in broth. One tiny dumpling for $3, but the broth is great. The signature state bird was not very good, in my opinion. Too much breading, the sauce/broth in the bottom of the dish was way too acidic.  I agree with other comments that the staff members are very friendly and efficient.  We spent $100 for two of us, including one glass of wine. I'm glad I went but probably wouldn't bother to go again. I'm not totally sure about what I ate but damn was it tasty. I remember a perfectly fried quail and a tuna and quinoa dish topped with crunchy toasted quinoa, both wowed me.My sis and I settled for the standing dining area as we didn't have reservations. It was actually really cool sitting so close to the action. The lady making the desserts was super fun to talk to and she had us sample the persimmon, kiwi granita, and yogurt dessert for free.This restaurant really pays attention to detail and the service is phenomenal. Attentive and friendly. Having random servers come up to offer different dishes was fun for me. I'm sad I passed up on the sweetbread meatball. I should make a reservation next time and save up because I'm willing to drop many pretty pennies here. It's rare to find a restaurant firing on the cylinders of Food & Service, but St. Bird does it.  I've never encountered a staff so sincerely invested in making the dining experience as satisfying as possible.  We entered sans reservations and were provided with a 'standing table' at the end of the bar that afforded a great view into the machinations of the kitchen.  The staff could not have been more attentive and engaging.  The food was worth every piece of praise its received.  Sweetbread meatballs were amazing, the signature dish was very succulent (fried quail), great pork ribs, and the mushroom dumplings were uniquely flavorful. If you want amazing food and a truly unique experience, friendly service and a chill atmosphere, go here.  It's worth the wait to get a reservation.  Loved it! Food is 4 stars, concept is 5 stars.  The dishes available on my visit were excellent.  The quail was divine.  Love the idea of offering dishes dim sum style, especially when eclectic- viewing helps w/ the selection.  Cool location. i went here with some friends several months ago. we ordered over half the menu and everything was awesome. would definitely go back (if i could ever get in!!! =) ) One of my favorite things about eating out is the variety you can get.  That's why dim sum and tapas are some of my favorite things on the planet.  Walk in, and go to the far end of the bar. This is where you check in. We were seated very promptly.  We started with several items of the passed trays:Matsutake mashed potatoes with goat cheeseChantrelles with butternut squash and farroGuinea hen dumpling with aromatic brothDuck liver mousse with almond biscuitsVinegar glazed smoked potato with tonnatoShrimp, avocado, noriGarlic bread with burattaWe also ordered a couple of items off of the menu.  Smoked sturgeon, horseradish schmear with an everything pancakeState bird with provisionskiwi-moscato granita with persimmons, pomegranate and tapiocapeanut milkNothing was a total miss, which is impressive.  The matsutake mashed potatoes were wonderful, and the guinea hen dumpling was really stellar.  The fried garlic bread with buratta is one of my favorite dishes. So straight forward, and amazing.  I can't currently eat the duck liver mousse, but my husband was sent to some kind of happy place as he ate it.  The shrimp with avocado and fried nori was excellent as well with a great balance of textures and flavors.  The smoked sturgeon was lightly smoked, and the pickled onions on the dish made it really pop.  Of course the signature dish was excellent.  If every fried fowl had this kind of crispness, I would be the fattest person on the planet.  Each dish hit a high point on some element.  The food was tasty, playful, and satisfying without being so filling that you couldn't continue trying other tastes and textures.The biggest pain about the place is getting a reservation.  Check midday to see what has opened up, an note, a late reservation doesn't necessarily mean you'll be there until midnight. We got a 9:30 reservation, and without feeling rushed, I think we were done by 11. This place currently has a HUGE buzz. That's what you get for getting write ups in both Bon Appetit and Food and Wine.  I'll be back, but maybe after the buzz has settled down a touch. What? You have not been and you are just sitting around reading the reviews to make up your mind. Best thing to have happened to  San Francisco in 2012. Followed by those Giants winning...again. The most creative, yummy dinner that you will want for all of your friends to experience! Seems like second time is the charm. I came to SBP a few weeks ago for dinner, without a reservation, but willing to wait. A lot. No luck, all the tables were booked for the rest of the night! Boo hoo.Second and Third times were a lot easier...we waited outside in line for about 30 minutes before they opened their doors, and voila, we got the best seats in the house!SBP offers a completely new style of eating, where all the dishes are presented to you, dim sum style, but with much better explanations. Each person coming around has a sense of pride for the dish they are showing. Dishes range from $2 - $16, and trust me it will add up! I've eaten here twice, and both times have spent more than I'd like, but not regretting anything.Must-haves:Garlic bread with burrata and oregano - a flaky bun of garlic bread with a huge serving of burrata melting on top from the heat of the bread. It's topped with oregano and pepper. It's like crack.Mashed potatoes - a small iron casserole dish containing creamy mashed potatoes topped with matsutake mushrooms and shredded nori. An original combination of flavors that work so well together.CA State Birth with Provisions - buttermilk battered quail, in a sauteed onion sauce. 1/2 order for 2 people (which is what's recommended) will not be enough.Pancakes - their options change regularly so they may not have the same combination of flavors. My favorite was the uni pancake with ginger and a soy lime dressing, topped with micro greens.The kitchen is definitely fast-paced, and you may feel rushed. It's ok to turn down dishes if you're the slow-eater type. They're not rushing you on purpose, I think they lose sight of the fact that we're there to enjoy a meal and not always on the go. My friend and I got into line about 4:30pm but it was worth the wait.  I loved all of the individual dishes and the abundant choices.  The flavors were delicious. My biggest complaint was that they really seemed to push you taking the new dishes as they arrived and I felt like there wasn't any time to talk or relax.  It was a bit like a real ""night market"" in that regard.  So food gets 4 stars but wait and frantic atmosphere lower it to a 3 star restaurant (for now) Hipster dim sum. And hipster (aka pretentious, bitchy, rude) service. Fun concept and some really good dishes. It's great to be able to sit down and almost immediately get food options. But the waitstaff here overall (with the exception of a couple cheery faces) is not pleasant....as if you're doing something wrong for expecting service. Anyway, the ahi tuna tartar with quinoa was good, the CA state bird (quail) was decent, and the fried garlic bread with burrata was amazing. The seafood salsa was okay but not amazing, and the spicy tofu skins were not spicy and kind of a weird texture (totally an opinion thing). We dined over those things plus a couple more for about an hour, and for some reason the servers STILL hadn't come and offered us the remaining 3-4 dishes, so even though we weren't totally full and would have been curious to see what other options there were, we didn't want to wait forever for them to notice and serve us.This place is a cute idea. It has potential to be great. The main missing element is experienced, sophisticated service. Really good food and different experience....long wait Hipster dim sum! One of the funnest and most enjoyable meals I've had in a long time. You get to order some food from an established menu in which they recommend only 2-3 dishes. We thought they were kidding because everything on the menu looked amazing. Thankfully we listened to them. After ordering we were bombarded with tons of amazing looking dishes on carts with price tags ranging from 5-9 dollars. The portions were more than enough for a party of 4 to share per plate and the price was unbelievable cheap (around 50 per person and we had around 15 dishes). The food was delicious. The cornbread with duck liver mousse maybe a loop hole around foie gras but it was GOOD. Try the pig ears! Fat is good!Since it is a dim sum experience, I would recommend going with a party of 4 (max allowed) so you get to try more dishes. I do think the portions are large for a party of 2 which would limit the variety you get. Just went last night after hearing a lot about it. I wouldn't say its the best meal I have had. Unfortunately it didn't look like a crazy night, bad I had to send a dish back and that was the state birds with provisions. Completely rare and under cooked and they had to serve up another one. Sad.Most of the foods were heavy definitely need to drink lots of wine. Dim sum style foods I would have expected to have a little more balance between light foods and heavy foods. Basically tried a couple of salads, like the quinoa salmon (interesting texture), but taste was just ok. This was same with the oyster with some spicey sauce. The fried bread with burrata was good, but the portion was definitely more fit for 4.Steak Tartar was interesting in terms of taste ass it had some papaya in it (?) Definitely had better....Something else was the tofu skin with some tomato based sauce and that was ok. Had the original pancake type thing with some special salt, but it just tasted like fried batter and cheese.For desert had the walnut tart with fresh asian tart... Thought it would be a little lighter in taste but also very heavy. The asian part was a complement to the tart rather than a balance. Overall I think it should be a try, but get 4 people to go. I went with my wife and I think the portions along with the heaviness of the of the food definitely could be just bite sized for 4. For 2 people, it would be a struggle to finish a dish. One of the best total meals I've had in awhile - from the food, the flavors, the format to the service, setting and just overall impact...wow. They definitely deserve the line of people fighting to get in. I had so much fun!They have a small menu of set items that you can order from that aren't passed around the room - a pancake section, some 'mains' including their state bird dish, and a dessert section. The rest of the menu is carried around the room on trays or wheeled through on carts for you to order just like at a Chinese dim sum restaurant. It's so much fun to watch what is coming up next - the element of surprise keeps you intrigued throughout the entire meal. There were so many diff items presented, and I love that they have stands showing the price for each dish too ranging from $2 to $9/dish.  I somehow managed to say no to 4 or 5 dishes even though I wanted to try it all. The pricing is totally reasonable as well! I expected the bill to be so much higher.  Tried a lot for under $60/person all-inclusive incl wine.I won't go into too much detail since there are too many to describe, but from their set menu:Everything pancake with smoked sturgeon and horseradish - the sturgeon was so fresh and delicious. The pancake was a bit big, so we couldn't finish it. Good fresh dish though. I saw the other 2 pancake dishes circulate the room. The first one that is vegetarian is composed of maybe 5 or 6 mini pancakes. The bacon pancake dish had 3 medium-sized pancakes (my neighbor said they were great). Then the sturgeon one had one large pancake. For dessert, the plum jam ice cream sandwich was so good. Bright tart jam, macaron-like sandwich portion, and an 'ice cream' filling with nuts and chocolate drizzled on top. 4 pieces to an order. So good.'dim sum' dishes:Best ones were the guinea hen dumpling (broth tasted like pho), shrimp/nori/avocado, fry bread with burrata, boudin noirThe kimchi pork belly, oyster, & steak tartare were just ok, so fell into the shadow of the other dishes. Didn't get a chance to try the mashers, tuna w/quinoa.Get there by 5:15p if possible and join the line if you don't have a reservation. They will separate out the reservations and seat them and then file everyone else in right away. The place fits about 60 diners, and I think at least 20 of us walk-ins were seated right away. Make sure your entire party is there. The poor girl waiting before us had to leave the line because her dining partner hadn't shown up yet. They couldn't reserve seats for them either. As an SBP regular and patron from the earliest days, I'm gonna throw in my pennies.  I'm not sure what some of these negative yelpers are seeking, but it is obviously not innovation, lack of pretention, eye and tastebud opening flavor combos, general good times and the warmest crew I've encountered in SF.  This place is an explosion of happiness & creativity and provides one of the most enjoyable eating experiences around.  Believe.    I've eaten here going on twenty times and each and every time we're introduced to new and groundbreaking dishes.  Thankfully most of our favorites have also managed to stick around... balancing this kind of innovation with consistency is no small feat.  And did I mention the staff?  For a restaurant in such high demand, they could not collectively be any kinder.  These are good peeps doing what they love, and the result is almost magical.  Every time I leave The Bird I am fat and happy and grateful SBP exists.  For those battling the reservation gods, I'm here to tell you it IS worth it.  Once you arrive, be patient, open your mind and enjoy the exploration! My boyfriend and I had a great dining experience at State Bird Provisions! It took us forever to be able to get a reservation but it was so worth it. Really delicious Californian cuisine - so flavorful and fun. Order a few things off the regular menu and then go for the carts.It wasn't expensive at all - was expecting much worse from the price rating on Yelp.Be sure to try to snag a table near the front - all the best dishes might get grabbed before they reach the back. Really well-done concept with good service and decent food.The space is small and loud, but comfortable.  Three beers on tap span a variety from light to dark to a very nice IPA.  Wine available by the bottle and glass.We were seated remarkably on-time for our reservations.  Street parking was easy to find close by on Webster street.  Walk-ins had a 1.5hr wait at 7pm on a Monday night.Unlike most dimsum places, they have a menu of items you can order from the kitchen that doesn't overlap with the passed items.There's a cart of seafood dishes, but otherwise the servers walk around with trays.Hilights:  Duck liver mouse - almost perfect.  Steak Tartare - very good, though a small portion.  Seafood ""salsa"".  Sea urchin pancake was amazing.  My companion loved the sweetbread meatball.  Beef cheek curry was good.Lolights: Mt. Tam pancake was perhaps a little over-bacony and oily for our taste.  Shrimp avocado nori was not particularly interesting in flavor.  Cumin lamb was an oily stir fry without strong cumin or lamb flavors.  Honey nut tart was a bit heavy on the nut component.Also - you are almost required to get the ""state bird"" - a fried quail.  It's good, but so rich that a half order was enough for the two of us.The place is not cheap - the little dishes add up.  Say $100/person is not unreasonable.Overall - liked the concept, some good food, some duds.  Would go back. Cumin lamb= phenomenal, possibly the best lamb I've had in life. The sourdough sauerkraut pecorino and ricotta pancakes are always delicious. Also the desserts are amazing- especially the plum jam ice cream sandwich and buttermilk maple granita/ tapioca! Sit at the chefs counter- pick and choose as you like! It took about a month to get a reservation, which was a bit annoying. I hadn't heard about the Bon Apetit article yet, so I was baffled. While my meal was tasty, I do think that most of the charm was found in the method of delivery and innovative pairings, but in many ways I can't help but feel like there was something left to be desired in the preparation and seasoning. We got around 10-12 dishes and a couple of glasses of wine each, which I felt was more than a fair sampling of dishes for 2 people. The vegetable preparations were generally a blur, which unfortunately tells me that they weren't quite the standouts that I had hoped for. The corn pancakes with Mt. Tam were delicious, but one must pose the question: can you really lose with Mt. Tam? Nope, never. The ribs with swiss chard alone however, might have been worth the month long wait. Smoky, sweet, delicious they were so beautifully meaty. Also noteworthy was the shrimp and avocado served with nori chips. Sadly, dessert was largely a disappointment. The cheesecake was oddly savory (and not in a good way) and the toasted tapioca was nothing out of the ordinary. The small dishes added up, but when the bill came, I was actually surprised by how reasonable it was, especially since you expect to pay a ton to dine at a place considered to be the ""best in the US""...you know, whatever that means these days. I'm not entirely sure I'd jump through hoops to come back here, but hey, I'm glad that I was able to come here at least once and see what all the hoopla was about and form my own opinion outside of it. Lady and I agreed that this is certainly one of the best eating experiences you can have in the bay area.  Yes, it's a pain to get into.  But sit at the counter, where the action is, and don't come with too many people.  Try to go early, if possible.  Then let the food come to you.  It works kinda like dim sum--there's a menu, but also a whole host of other dishes (about twenty different ones per evening), that come around with the servers on carts and trays.  These are definitely the highlights, and between the two of us, we must've had all twenty, PLUS a couple menu items.  The food itself is clearly Asian-inspired, but mainly just goddamned delicious.  Beer and wine selection is really intriguing, and service is not at all what you'd expect in an uber-hyped San Francisco restaurant.  People are attentive, well-trained, and there's this pervasive atmosphere of cooperation and helpfulness among all the staff that's just a blast to watch.  Very few lowlights among a roster of fantastic, delicious bites that very in size from one forkful to ""really quite a bit.""  The only ones I will certainly avoid next time are the uni pancake (not that it wasn't good, it just wasn't particularly special) and ribs (not particularly good or special).  Both are on the menu, further bolstering the notion that what you REALLY wanna get are the ""cart"" dishes and use the menu solely to supplement.  I'll be back soon, and you should make your reservation (for 3 months ahead, no doubt) ASAP. We ate there the other night for the first time and were looking forward to it after all the great press.   The staff were great - friendly, upbeat and attentive.   The food was good with some wild combinations that actually work for the most part.  However, this is a place to sample lots of different foods,  but not a place to sit and and leisurely enjoy the food and people you are with.   Once everyone is seated,  the progression of food carts start.   At first it's a couple of carts, but then the area gets chaotic with someone asking you every 3-5 minutes if you want to try another small plate (and yes, there are very small - usually a bite or two for two people).  The idea of pushing around carts with different foods is a cute idea, but we've been there and done that - now I want to try a place with great food, where we can actually savor and remember what we ate before our next course comes, and maybe even enjoy our friends without constant interruption. It's definitely worth trying once, and a good place to take someone from out of town for a different experience - especially one with ADHD! Awesome place to dine.  The dishes are fun, rich, and innovative.  I ordered a couple of dishes off the al la carte menu and about 5 dishes off the ""dim sum"" trays. Off the hook dish: uni pancakes!RSVP is difficult to get.  The wait for me was 2 and a half hours.  It was well worth it, though.  I just went up the street to Yoshi's and had a couple of drinks and listened to some jazz.  The restaurant texted me when the table was ready.  Service is impeccable, food is out of this world good,  and overall experience was memorable.  A repeat is in the works to try all the dishes I didn't get to. I would probably give this a 3.5 if I could.  The food was good, but I think my expectations were just way too high.  Bon Appetit named it the best restaurant in America, so I thought I was in for something really extraordinary.  The food was good overall, but definitely not the best I've ever had or even in San Francisco.  People seem to go nuts because it is served dim sum style on carts; come on, Chinese people have been doing this forever.Reservations were booked up for two months, but we showed up at 5pm and were second in line.  We were seated immediately when they opened at 5:30.  Service was fine and the ambiance was casual.  I think I would have given it a higher rating if I didn't buy into all the hype. State Bird Provisions has been named Bon Appetite's 2012 best new restaurant in America, consequently making it the most hyped restaurant in the bay I have seen in long time. You can imagine my excitement when I was finally able to secure a reservation (two months in advance).First and foremost, what a fantastic, well-executed concept. American tapas served dim-sum style off carts and trays. A handful of items can be ordered off the menu, but the rest are only available as they come around and change daily. Reservations are required for a table, and they are hard to get. (available 60 days in advance.) There is counter seating available for walk-ins but expect to wait 2-3 hours for a seat. Food dishes were hit or miss, most ranged from good to great for me with a few misses.Excellent:- Duck liver mousse and almond biscuits- Garlic bread with burrata- Albacore crudo with quinoa- Shrimp, avocado, noriGood:- CA state bird with provisions- Guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth- Glazed pork ribs- Sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino, ricotta pancakePass:- Veal meatballs- Plum jam ice cream sandwich yum yum yum! came here for my birthday dinner and it was darn tasty. i would say we liked the majority of our food. there were a few let downs tho. i like the concept and the waitstaff was incredibly nice. the space is tight and wait is long if you don't have a reservation. we walked in around 7 and were able to get a table around 9:45. guinea hen dumpling with aromatic broth- mm.. savory little bite (wish i had gotten 2)duck liver mousse with almond biscuit- biscuit and mousse went together so well, a little salty and a little sweet great texture (we had extra mousse left after we ate all the biscuits and they so kindly brought us more)garlic bread with burrata -- HORRIBLY disappointed in this one. it was too salty to eat. tasted like it was covered in salt crystalssweet corn & garlic chive 'shortstack' with mt. tam- absolutely divine, one of my favorite dishesCA state bird with provisions- solidly tasty, loved that it was mostly deboned buttery dungeness crab with farro ""spezzato""- the other bleh thing we had so fishy tasting. needless to say we didn't finish it at the restaurant ( I later made crab benedict with it and the burrata)chocolate-gingersnap pudding, coconut pecan crunch- super gingery not a big fan of this dish either. it was ok Wish it was easier to get a reservation here :) Just had desserts and I cannot wait till I get to try the real deal. even the desserts were spectacular! Great small plates. Good concept. Good food. Bingo! Holy moley. EVERYTHING was sooo good! Low key, casual service and the food- OMG. The garlic bread thingy with burrata, the fried quail, tuna w/ quinoa- uuuummmm. Dying over how good this place is- book it 60 days from now if at all possible- I think it's nice to have something to look forward to. I fought long and hard with the rest of the Bay Area's diners to secure a reservation at State Bird, a task that became immeasurably more difficult after Bon Appetit and countless other magazines, blogs, and newspapers dubbed it the hottest thing in SF aside from the ban on public nudity. Finally, though, I got a reservation, albeit at a super early (5:30) time.No other restaurant has been this hyped in the Bay since maybe Mission Chinese, but I can say that it mostly met my expectations. The food, concept, service, and decor all range from good to excellent, but there were still a few moments that just barely kept this from being a 5 star restaurant for me.Here's the rundown:- Sweet corn pancakes with garlic chives and Mt. Tam triple cream cheese: this was the first thing we tasted, and it was one of the most spectacular dishes of the night. It was so good, in fact, it set an impossible standard for the rest of the dishes that followed. But the sweetness of that corn, the light touch of the cheese...oh my.- Quail: I had to try the namesake dish of the restaurant. I think this was battered with panko, and there was a nice citrus sauce that went with it (yuzu, I'm pretty sure) - cooked really well. I love quail (it's one of my favorite things to eat when done correctly) and this was spot-on.- Cauliflower viennoise, beets, horseradish-ale cream: Easily the single best dish of the night, aside from the corn pancakes. My wife is the pickiest eater on the planet and she loved this dish. The complexity of flavors on display here was impressive, with the earthy cauliflower, sweet beets, acidic and creamy horseradish, bitter arugula. Well done.- Farro with pickled vegetables, topped with a mixture of seeds and nuts and a yogurt sauce: also really good, and a very complex flavor profile. I love pickled anything (comes from the Korean and Polish heritage), so this dish was a winner for me. - Pork belly, kimchi, tofu: Because State Bird's dim-sum style approach to smaller plates, it's hard to get everything you want - this dish kept running out before it got to us, so we had to ask our server for one. It didn't disappoint, though the belly was a bit too dry on some pieces and the dish could've used more kimchi liquid. I'm sure this was inspired by the buta kimuchee dishes you find at izakayas and was a good representation of that dish.- Oyster with kohlrabi and chili: Not as great as I wanted it to be, though the contrast in texture between the kohlrabi and the oyster flesh was fun.- Huckleberry beets with yogurt: A great dish - almost could've been a dessert.- Pork pate with rosemary chips: The pate was really, really good and flavorful, though the chips were too flaky to support the thick pate.- Burrata on garlic fry bread: one of those dishes that's awesome for the first few bites and gets less appealing as it sits. The fry bread got too hard after a few minutes, but the burrata was sublime.- Guinea hen dumpling: I loves me some guinea hen, but the flavor of it was a bit lost due to the intensity of the mushroom and yuzu broth. Skin was a bit too thick for my tastes, too.- Tuna crudo with quinoa: A fun dish - like the oyster dish, there was a texture balance here that was really fun, and the sauce was great, too.The biggest letdown for us was the dessert, which was the cheesecake japonaise with huckleberries. I must confess my palate was letting me down in this case. My wife is Japanese and we normally love Japanese style cheesecakes, but there was something off about this one - I tasted curry powder, though I'm sure that wasn't in there. The texture also just didn't agree with us - it was too dense compared to how fluffy and light Japanese style cheesecake usually tastes. The other dessert choices looked really good, and we regret not choosing something else. aaaahhh State Bird Provisions. in every sense of the word, it's awesome! from the concept and the ambiance to the food itself, it's a fantastic experience. this restaurant is quintessentially ""Californian"" in that the dishes are conceptualized based on seasonal ingredients, fusion cuisine, and interesting combinations of flavors, tastes and textures that aren't always standard. i mean, Bon Apetit named it the #1 new restaurant in America so they've got to be doing something right.over a year ago, during one of my frequent walks through the Western Addition in SF i noticed that a restaurant was taking shape on Fillmore St. i had no idea what it was but became quickly intrigued when i saw that they were a ""cart and tray service restaurant."" what does this mean? it means small plates served in a manner like dim sum is traditionally served. people walk around with carts or trays carrying the various dishes for the night and you decide on the spot whether  you want it or not. often times you read a description of a dish on a menu and it doesn't sound appealing. but when the dishes are presented to you in this manner, you immediately ignite the visual sensory as well as the smell sensory. then they describe the dish and you can't help but want every dish that passes by, though ordering every dish is pretty impossible because nobody could ingest twenty or so dishes in one sitting. fortunately i have an incredibly large appetite and was able to sample a lot. of what i had the garlic bread with burrata, the almond biscuits with duck liver mousse (helloooo foie!) and the sweet corn pancakes with Mt. Tam cheese were the absolute winners, though everything we had was very good. i LOVE state bird. someone take me again! Generally speaking, I'm a fan, and I like the concept, hence a generous 4*, but the dishes were uneven. A few of them are really good, like the state bird provision itself. Others not so much, though overall, pretty good.  Really liked 3 of the 9 we had, and the 10th, dessert was very good too. I would certainly recommend going with 4 people to be able to eat more of the dishes. Got too full too fast with only 2. It's easy to end up with the ""eyes bigger than the stomach"" syndrome as the dishes are brought by. Space can get pretty loud; service is friendly. I admit that my expectations may have been too high. I REALLY wanted to like this spot. I had heard really great things about this spot from an acquaintance who worked at Saison and F+W plus a few people had mentioned the great reviews. I really tried to get there at 5:30 but ended up in traffic for an hour and half due to some stupid protest in Union Square and a couple accidents on the bridge. I was pretty famished by the time I got there. I really liked the concept and thought the service was perfect but the atmosphere and the food.... frankly, the both left much to be desired. There is a little bar space where two people can stand up eating right by the front door. I was immediately super irritated by the idea but I was so hungry that I agreed to eat standing up by the door which of course opened a million times leaving me freezing. There is a section of the menu served dim sum style on carts and a section that is by order. I like this idea a lot. At least for me, the service was absolutely perfect. Everyone was super friendly, quick and on top of things without being stuffy or overbearing in the slightest which is a big plus for me. The only shitty thing was I didn't end up being offered all the dim sum options and since there wasn't a list that I could see, I wasn't able to ask after the ones I wanted to try (like the oysters or the duck liver mousse or spicy tofu skin).The food was such a bummer. Maybe I just went here on an off night?Here is what I had:+huckleberry beets with goat yogurt. One of the better dishes and also something I have had a million times often much better at many different spots.-sweet corn, garlic chive and mt tam pancakes... I don't know what happened... how could I not like something where all the ingredients are things I hold so dear? I just wasn't into this... a little too soggy and had a weird bitter taste+sea urchin pancake with ginger scallion and lime-soy. This was great. It was the only thing I genuinely enjoyed. I will probably go back just to eat this.-steak tartare with grilled broccoli and shishito. I love steak tartare usually...  I only ate one bite of this-guinea hen dumpling... super boring. -shrimp, avocado and nori... again, all things I love... it was just bland and not very inspired.-marinated yuba 'noodles'- this was probably my least favorite. -quail with lemon onion provisions... I am so sad to say this was disappointing. I was most looking forward to this dish as I love quail. I felt that it was too heavily breaded and somehow in the cooking it really lost that sweet gaminess that I love about quail until it just tasted like badly friend chicken. greasy and oily not in a good way. The lemon preserves were decent but made the bottom of the quail soggy.I wish I had tried the pork belly or the garlic bread with burrata. They looked good but I was stuffed.I had the Japonais cheesecake for dessert (again 1 bite and I didn't want anymore....) then the strawberry granita with honey and tapioca.... I thought I would LOVE this and it was ok... it was my second favorite of the night. I didn't like the decor and it was a bout a million decibels in there but I don't think the atmosphere matters that much, it should be about the service and the food. As I said, the service was great and it makes me feel all the more worse that I was so disappointed by the food. Maybe I will try this place again, but I it will be with a hesitant tongue. A few other people told me they had a similar experience. I hope it was just an off night and not that they really are super missing on the flavor profiles. there was just something off and weird or bland about everything for me. :( I didn't even like the iced tea or almond horchata that much. With tip my bill was $125. I have no problem dropping a bill or three on a good meal but for such a disappointment I felt really ripped off. Super excited to super bummed. Boo. Buratta on Fried Bread? Mollusk Ceviche? Sesame pancakes with anchovies? Halibut Crudo? Korean pork belly and tofu? Yes please. The dim sum was eclectic and perfect in my opinion. I enjoyed the several different wines we had and was glad to get the tip that if you have an early reservation (which is nearly the only one you can get these days) be prepared to wait in a line outside since there's no where to stand inside. After their Gourmet magazine write up I understand all the fuss over the food but where they are lacking was on the aesthetics. The cute DIY vibe inside would bode better in a boutique rather than a highly revered restaurant in my opinion. Regardless, I will certainly come back. Was very much looking forward to trying this place out.  They received a lot of good press in the past year and if you combine that with their unique 'dim-sum' type of dining I was very intrigued.The place has the atmosphere of a shoebox combined with a kindergarten classroom.  Cheap pressed boards with holes (like in a garage for hanging tools) cover the walls and ceilings, and the one wall that IS exposed is concrete.  I think this has something to do with trying to tamp down the acoustics that make this place almost unbearably loud.  I like loud.  I enjoy the energy and hum of a place that is packed on a Saturday night.  But keep my loud at something less than a lawnmower decibel level.  The lighting is without note.  I think it's flourescent covered by a bland fixture.  Not great lighting here.  The art here is almost non-existent.  Visually the place is very UN-stimulating.The service was good, but not great.  Pet peeve....if you are going to address a table take the time to stop and do it properly; don't do it in a huff as you walk by without stopping or making eye contact.  It's an extra 2 seconds and makes a big difference.  Outside of the small things that make big differences we found the staff to be knowledgable, friendly and accomodating.  But not up to the standards of a restaurant getting national press.  Sorry, but you have to be ON YOUR GAME from a to z.  The food was quite good.  But all small.  I think the small plate offerings hit a point of diminishing returns when you get too small.  And I think State Bird has gotten them too small.  Each plate is like a tea cup saucer.  Which really only allows one bite each for two.  This is just too little to be satisfying.  And their namesake 'State Bird' is a quail that is so thickly breaded you can barely tell that there is supposed to be a slightly gamey wild bird underneath.  Tasted like chicken.  The saving grace is the onion/lemon/rosemary sauce underneath which could quite possibly be the best condiment I've ever had.All else is good.  Some awkward combinations afoot:  Steak Tartare with hot peppers?  Not a good idea.  Pork Belly with Tofu?  C'mon.  I'm now craving a decent serving of a simple meal. We made the reservation WAY in advance so we had a 6 o'clock reservation on a Saturday. Friends couldn't make it so it ended up being just me and Jovanie. They sat us promptly and the restaurant was already packed. Theres a little counter to your right as you walk in which people can stand and eat.Seriously. And they do. We tried ordering a bunch of things but our waitress cautioned us saying that we were ordering a lot of food and there were going to be trays coming around with food not on the menu(She was right). So we ended up with all three of their savory pancakes (uni, sweet corn, and sourdough sauerkraut). The sweet corn had melted brie on the top and it made my toes curl.OHHHHHHHHH it was so good. Jovanie loved his uni pancakes as well. We tried some faro which was good. The state bird,which is fried quail, was very moist , and tasted good but I'm not a fan of fried things so it wasn't my favorite thing.However,if you like fried foods, then you will LOVE it. They don't have hard alcohol so we stuck with a drakes beer ,which is always good and then some kind of ale from a outfit called Pretty Things.It was good, but i'd stick with drakes if i had a chance to order a third round. We also got to try the garlic bread with burrata which everyone raves about but though it looks like heaven, i wasn't a big fan.I think mostly, because i was so looking forward to it.It was alright but as other Yelpers have pointed out,it is greazzzzzzy. The waitstaff has got to be one of the hardest working staffs i have ever seen in my life. They are not only waiting on their tables, but they are also wandering the room with trays of other food not on the menu and they describe to each and EVERY table. Now thats commitment. For dessert , we had the pudding and the plum ice cream sandwich. The pudding is not sweet. WARNING. You will expect sweetness when you see it on the menu.You will expect sweetness when you see it placed in front of you. You will expect sweetness when you put it in your mouth. NO SWEETNESS. The off menu items were heavy on the seafood side. This place is not for the faint of heart. They really elevate all the ingredients and challenge the diners with the combinations. Even though I'm not that adventurous when it comes to dining,I really enjoyed the experience and will go back. Thank you, SBP!PS When we left there were people lined up all along the wall like a gulag of human bodies waiting for a table to open up.Be prepared. We had so much fun that it didn't matter that our reservations were at 10:30. We bought a bottle of wine, stayed til midnight and ate everything that came along. I was so so so full when I left but was happy to have tried so many amazing little plates of things I already like to eat served in styles that were new and fun!We had oysters that were well shucked, ceviche that hit all the right notes, beef curry that made me want to sing, pork belly (really - that too was friggin amazing), some trout in brown butter NOM, and the state bird provs which was oh so delicious, There was a pretzel thing with burrata that we could have gone without but that was the only regret... We were handed a shot of the peanut milk for dessert. A perfect end to such a tour de force!! I attended a conference in SF, and one of my friends mentioned State Bird Provisions.  So clever-dim sum type carts as well as a standard menu.  I was going in Oct, called for reservations with first available in Nov, so I decided to take a chance and see if I could walk in and get a seat at the counter.I ended up walking from Bloomindales on Market to the restaurant, as I was rusty on my cab catching skills.  As I walked into the restaurant, my heart sank as it was packed, and there were even two patrons eating dinner standing at a small counter near the entrance.Fortunately, the kind waitress took pity on me and let me know there was a table available.  The space is cozy, filled with energy and anticipation.  The couple next to me was out to dinner for the first time since having a baby and they were thrilled to be here.I started with the oyster.  This was my 27th oyster of this trip, so I probably have not met an oyster I did not like.  The deviled egg was elevated by the addition of the cured salmon.  The seafood pork belly pancake with the soy lime glaze was a bit dry.  I would probably order the corn pancake next time.  Red trout with mandarin and hazelnut-garum butter was perfection.  Seared skin, tender meat with the citrus adding a bright note to a comforting dish.  My introduction to yuba was a revelation.  Yuba tagliatelle with matsutake and nori was light and refreshing.I only wish I hadn't been so full to order more of the tempting dishes as they circled the dining room.  Definitely worth the walk. State Bird Provision pretty much had me at the name of the restaurant, I'm a sucker for interesting monickers. They totally had me at the concept. Moderately strange American tapas dishes served off dim sum carts. Why had no one ever thought of this before? It's almost genius. Being named Bon Appetit magazine's Best New Restaurant of the year made me determined to try it. One problem, they're booked solid for months these days.We walked in on our first night in town blissfully unaware of this, four adults and one gregarious three year old. The hostess was exceptionally sweet and understanding that we'd made a long trip and though they couldn't accommodate us on that particular evening, she kindly booked one of the walk-in tables for us a week later. By the time we returned, we had eaten in some of the Bay areas finest restaurants and I wondered how this trendy newcomer would compare. Not to worry: the food is fun, inventive, tasty and eclectic. It's also reasonably priced, so it's possible to try many dishes. We nibbled (ok, we don't ever nibble) our way through a large part of the menu, not sure there will be room to discuss them all and the offerings change quite often so it would be useless, but I'll hit the high points.Most of the smaller plates come out on trays or carts, and you can choose which ones you'd like to sample. While the plating isn't always the most artful, it doesn't diminish from the illustrious flavors at all. If the kitchen doesn't have quite the craft of the Michelin star restaurants, it makes up for a lot with ingenuity. There wasn't a bummer in the bunch, except for two too bland desserts at the tail end. Not to worry, the two good desserts were so good I still can't stop thinking about them Especially the ridiculously addictive ice cream sandwiches. The wonderful:Oysters on the Half shellHaas avocado with Seafood salsaAlbacore crudo and quinoaHuckleberry marinated beets with goat yogurtSweet corn pancakeDouble chocolate pudding and spiced pearPlum jam ice cream sandwich The very good:Steak tartare with shishitosKing salmon deviled egg saladFried green tomatoes with tartar sauceCA state bird with provisionsRed trout in brown butterThe disappointing:Cheesecake japonaiseStrawberry granita and tapioca The restaurant is alive and full of happy, joyful people. That's always a good sign. Even on a rain drenched night like ours, it felt like a warm inviting house party. Service was sweet and attentive, top to bottom.I wish I lived near State Bird, it would be a regular stop. It feels as though there will always be new and interesting tastes to explore here. It's also easy to tell the kitchen loves what they're doing, that they're having fun twisting expectations. Anytime you bend convention, you'll have some missteps along the way. It comes with the adventure, and while there weren't any on our visit I'm sure they do arise on occasion. As with all forward thinking experiences, it won't satisfy everyone but then what does?I'm really enamored of State Bird, it was everything I hoped for and quite a bit more. A superb way to end a marvelously delectable vacation.Best Plates: Oysters, Seafood Salsa, Albacore Crudo, Huckleberry Beets, Sweet Corn Pancakes, Steak Tartare, Salmon Deviled Egg Salad, CA State Bird, Red Trout, Double Chocolate Pudding, Plum Jam Ice Cream Sandwich Palate: eclecticFood - AAmbience - AService - AValue - A I love the concept. It's not dim sum but its served like dim sum. Gourmet carts going around. If you can't say no, this is a horrible place to be. My hubby had to reel me in [cuz I can't say no]. Space: horrible if you don't have reservations, which I didn't. The bar area, where the walk-ins have to sit is tight. I worried about how the cart will squeeze in. It did manage to get through though. :) I got a good spot where all the food came out. You are the first to be asked, would you like to try this. Pretty soon, my hubby decided it was a bad spot. Onto food. State bird was excellent! Love the tart onions with the crispy quail. Garlic bread with burrata - They fry the garlic bread then add the burrata. Heavenly!ribs - bland bland bland! Let me get to the point. The asian inspired dishes were almost all a complete miss. If I went back, I would skip all the Asian dishes and stick to the ""American"" dishes. So don't get the kimchi dish, or the ribs with togarashi, or the Asian-like pancake. Everything else is excellent. :) Overall, love the concept, about half the food and wished the space was bigger. If you're afraid of food do not eat here.  I understand people have food allergies, don't eat certain things for different reasons, or are just absent minded when it relates to food as entertainment and pleasure and see it just as an energy source.   That said, the meal I had last night was perfect.  I didn't take any pictures, I'm not diving into the details of the food I ate.  If you like small plates, enjoy sharing, expect reliable and attentive service while dining, and are not afraid of food, this is the place to go.I've heard  about the wait, that it is hard to get a reservation and some have even said it was over hyped.  People...  This is what food is about.  Young people sourcing good product and using their knowledge and skills to serve said product efficiently and tastefully.It's worth the hype, it's worth the wait, it's worth the cost. ah state bird provisions.  first off id like to say that when a restaurant gets this much hype (best new restaurant in america, 2 month ahead reservations) the expectations skyrocket.  with great reputation comes great responsibilityof course we made the reservations online about two months in advance.  our slot was at 7:30.  previously i had actually gotten some reservations but they were at 10:30.  who the heck eats at 10:30? they were super accommodating when we called ahead to arrange a table that could take a baby carrier as well.  their largest tables are 4. we sit down at a table in the far back and our table is freezing!  so cold i had to put on my jacket at the end.  not sure if it was cuz the vents were right above us?  the decor was cute.  i loved it.  just mismatched things here in there. string and pegboard walls.  colorful abstract veggie cutouts.  exposed beams, concrete walls.when we walked in the kitchen is right there and everyone greets you.  kind of nice and welcoming.  service is ok.  i think most of the people who are bringing the food around are in a rush or something.  sometimes when they brought stuff around. i felt really rushed to make a decision.i have to agree that the concept is novel for american food and that is the main draw here.  there are drawbacks to carting around the food.  there is a reason why most dim sum restaurants in hong kong dont offer the carts anymore:  space.  there isnt enought space.  and such is the case here.  when we walked in we waited by the door for a while because there was a cart being wheeled in the narrow entrance corridor/bar.  another thing is that when dim sum is getting wheeled around, those carts have steamers/heaters in them. not here.  so most of the food that we got off the cart was not hot.  on cold days, i want hot food.ok onto the food.  in general i thought dishes were inventive but the taste was not stellar.  from the menu we ordered (of course) the state bird/fried quail, uni pancake, and also the trout. i have to admit ive never been a fan of quail but this was decent.  it was piping hot, brined?, breaded, and deep fried.  the meat was tasty and moist.  crunchy and soft textures.to save space here ill just list out what we got off the carts/trays and comment: duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - liver was mild, biscuit was sweetsherry glazed smoked potato with tonnato - good! smoked fish spreadshrimp, avocado, nori - nori was deep fried until crispy.  all else was kind of ... blahgarlic bread with burrata - deep fried bread.  love burratasteak tartare with grilled broccoli & shishito  - flavors of veggies were better than the tartarekimchi-pork belly with tofu - sour?  not a fancheesecake japonaise, huckleberries, candy cap - def japanese influences.  deliciousplum jam 'ice cream' sandwich, chocolate & fennel - also delicious.  mix of textures.i have to admit the flavors are not harmonious.  sometimes they dont go together.  sometimes they seem off.  maybe as the restaurant evolves, this will improve.  not sure. State Bird Provisions is a tiny restaurant in the Filmore. Ever since it won Bon Apetit's best new restaurant in America, it takes three months to get reservations here. Quite crazy!The way things work at this restaurant is there's a fixed menu and a rotating menu. You can order things off the fixed menu which has about eight or so dishes. Then the rotating menu is the things on the ""dim sum"" cart that goes around the restaurant. The waitress will tell you what the dish is and how much it costs. All food ordered is marked on the medium dim sum style. == Food ==The food here is a hit or miss. There are amazing ones, good, mediocre, and meh.The tout was really amazing. Totally fresh and really tasty. I don't usually like cooked fish, but this one was so good. The oyster on a half shell was good. Fresh and tasty also. One slurp and it's all gone.Steak tartare was good. It's rare beef. My first time having it. Quite different so I can't say much about this except it was pretty good.Ahi Poki was good. The tuna was really fresh. It tasted like tuna? Can't really say much on this.Garlic bread with burrata is amazing. If you love cheese, garlic, and bread, this is the dish for you. The gooey cheese is nicely melted in the middle of the spiral garlic bread. The bread is oily with possibly garlic oil and it has a great garlic taste to it.Ciccioli with rosemary buttermilk cracker was mediocre. It felt like cracker and white tuna.The state bird provision was really mediocre. I don't see what's the hype about this dish about. It's a panko breaded quail and tastes like one. The lamb dish from the fixed menu is really meh. Strips of lamb with some greens. There wasn't anything special about this.== Service ==Service is good here. The waitress really know her food and can recommend some good things. == Overall ==Really hard to get a reservation here. Then just like how dim sum restaurants are, things can really add up in the end. There's some really good things here and some really meh things. Be sure to do some review reading to maximize your experience. There's definitely some really tasty dishes here. Original and fun menu. Nice to see food choices before having to select. Enthusiastic and attentive service. Most but not all dishes were very good. Desserts were also very good. Certainly would go back. While waiting for our table, someone who just finished her meal passed us and gleefully/facetiously said ""you guys are gonna HATE EVERYTHING!""3 well known things about SBP:- Bon Appetite's 2012 best new restaurant in America and James Beard Nominee- Self-described ""dimsum"" style small plates - pick off of trays and carts that go around, with a few select items off of a menu- Hard to get reservations - but possible to get squeezed in the same week, just callSERVICESolid, very nice staffDECORKind of random and looks like could have been thrown together in a short time, watch the open kitchen if you sit at the bar.FOOD: Touches of Asian influence in most dishes...Great: Almond cake & duck liver mousse, Plum jam ice cream sandwich, Earl Gray Ice Cream SandwichVery good: State bird, Sweet corn garlic chive short stack, Sturgeon and Pancake, Ricotta DumplingsGood: Tuna crudo with quinoa, Avocado/shrimp & nori chips, Tuna & potato chips, Almond horchata, Peanut milk shot, Strawberry granita & quince tapiocaOK: Fried eggplant & greeen tomato, Guinea hen shitake dumplings, sweetbread poplette, Garlic bread burrata (greasy), Eggplant w/ rumesco, Pork BellyBad: Mushroom & eggplant puree, Yuba noodles & pesto, Trout hazelnut butter (unbelievably salty), Pork Ribs (massively overcooked)DAMAGE:Incl t&t =$65-80/person Overall 6-7 plates/person will get your pretty stuffed. I wouldn't say this is by any stretch the most tasty restaurant in SF, but without doubt, it is the most interesting. Amazing food and beautiful presentation.  The dim sum style service further sets State Bird apart, but I could have done without it.  I'd rather know up front everything that was going to be offered so I could pick and choose the small plates with my budget and appetite in mind.I came here for my birthday so it was a while ago, but these are the dishes I remember being impressed by:Garlic bread with burrataSweet corn pancakeAlbacore crudoCA state bird (fried quail) I don't get the hype. The decor is awful - the place is really loud. The food was good but  it didn't knock my socks off.  The assortment was fine. We had dessert then decided we wanted more food but they kept walking by and wouldn't stop.. what gives.. LOL I like to eat. Anyway, sure I recommend it since it's the new hip place but, make sure you have low expectations. I really don't know what all the hype is about.  My sister convinced me to be nice and not factor in the hype when rating SBP, thus the 3 stars.  I'd say it's more like a 2.5.I made reservations 2 months ago to get into this place, since it seems impossible to do so any other way.  My brother, sister, and I had a nice sibling dinner at 9pm on a Saturday.  Let me start by saying this: the food is good, not great.  Generally tastes pretty good but nothing really stood out (ie. mind = not blown).  The nori chips that we got off the cart (with shrimp/avocado) and the fried qual were the only things that are really worth talking about.  The meatballs with some sweetbreads was pretty good too.  As for creativity in food, pork belly w/ kimchi, fry bread with burrata, and porcini muchroom spread on flatbread aren't exactly ground breaking foods.  Call me a food snob, but I wasn't really wowed by these dishes.  They tasted good, but weren't amazing, and the pork belly was slightly overcooked (how that even happens I'm not even sure).What really bothered me about SBP was the whole concept of this ""dim sum"" style dining.  The wait for this place on a given evening is so damn long because diners are sitting around waiting for the next dish to come out.  When the servers tell you there are about 12-15 dishes offered via cart or tray each evening, you'll likely want to hang around to see what all of those dishes are.  We were there nearly 2 hours and probably saw 8 or so of those dishes.  The cart only carries about 3-4 dishes, meaning you're waiting for ~10 additional dishes to come rotating out via tray.  Problem is, they rotate a tray dish probably every 15 minutes or so, so you're literally waiting the entire time, nibbling on a tiny plate of food, then waiting again.  Unless you're ordering a bunch of food off the printed menu, you're going to be sitting at your table with maybe 1 or 2 plates at a time.  People want to know what all the dishes are, so they will wait, and that means, my friend, you will wait outside until I am done.Basically, I think the entire operation is completely inefficient and given that most of the food is just average, I'm generally surprised at all the hype this place has been getting. One of my favorite dining experiences I've had in SF. Went here a couple of months ago and loved it so much that I promptly went home and made reservations for tonight! Here are some details about our first experience: In September, my boyfriend and I walked in with no reservations at around 6:45pm and were told it would be about a 2 hour wait. We went up the block to Dosa for cocktails (good drinks btw), and received a call around 8:15pm. What we ended up being offered was the standing room-only ledge by the door. It ended up being a great experience. We were able to watch the chefs prepare each dish and got first dibs of everything. Everyone was friendly and attentive. The food was so flavorful and creative. I loved the small plates/ dim sum concept because it makes you try things that you wouldn't necessarily order. Some highlights for me were the duck liver mousse with almond biscuits, the guinea hen dumplings, and ""statebird.""The two of us ended up getting about 8 dishes and we were absolutely stuffed. Can't wait to try one of the savory pancakes tonight and some of the new seasonal dishes. I will definitely report back! AMAZING!  Genius!  I love everything about this place.  The food, the unpretentious feeling and ""no rules"" attitude.  My husband came in at 6 pm and put our name on the list and we got a 8:30 pm seating.  We arrived at 7:30 and grabbed wine/cheese at Fat Angel around the block. We were sat at the end of the bar which normally would feel like a bad seat but have to admit I was so happy we sat there.  We chatted it up with the chefs and owner and learned so much more then if we were at a table. We tried a lot of things but the highlights for me were.- fried quail (1/2 portion)- sweet corn and mt. tam pancakes- albacore crudo & quinoa with bonito-rosemary aioli- garlic bread with burrata- steak tartare with poblano & sunchokeMy mouth is drooling thinking about those right now.  The owner is a true artist and even makes some of the plates that the dishes were served on.  I can't wait to come back! The only thing that saved this from a ""one"" star rating was the staff: friendly, committed and apologetic about the rather dismal experience we (four) had at this place.Let's start with the wait.  We got there at 8:20 for an 8:30 reservation on a Wednesday night - and weren't seated until 9:10.  Now, I realize that it's somewhat unfair to hold the restaurant accountable for the bad manners of patrons but isn't it the job of the front of the house to make judgments about turnover and be realistic when confirming reservations?  Anyway, it set the tone for the evening.Among the four of us we tried a fairly wide range of dishes and the consensus among us was that, in almost every case, There was either one ingredient too many or an unnecessary complication that robbed the dishes of what could (and should) have been clean, fresh and enjoyable flavors.  Instead, almost every dish was muddy, confused and/or uninteresting.  A perfect example was the fried green tomatoes with chipotle aioli: the breading had absorbed a touch too much oil, leaving the dish tasting more of grease than of fruit, and the aioli was bland (!!) - we all agreed the dish was, essentially, tasteless.  Everyone enjoyed the corn pancakes and the dumplings but with every successive dish the execution was less and less successful: the lamb with cumin was greasy and undersalted; the quail (their signature dish) was overly breaded, underseasoned and, resting on a bed of lemony wilted onions, didn't make any sense; and the steak tartare alternated between too much spice and no spice at all - weird.As I said, the servers were uniformly enthusiastic and the only knock I have to deliver is the odd progression of the dishes: you are met with a flurry of dim sum/tapas-like small plates, of varying degrees of interest, and then the ordered dishes start coming - and then, for no good reason they stopped and we wound up waiting for our very last dish for an inexplicable 10-15 minutes.By the time we finished dining it was almost 10:30.  We waived away desert and heading for the door as quickly as possible.  None of us will go back.If you consider this place, go as a two-some - for larger parties, timely seating is a pretty dicey proposition.  Overall, we were definitely not impressed. Yes, we waited 2 months for our reservations, but... It was well worth the wait. This place is great! Very laid back and not stuffy at all. Everyone working there acts as your server. Everyone knows the dishes inside and out. The woman who sat us, Candace was a total sweetheart. Since it was our first time in she was sure to bring us whatever the ""must-have"" dishes were. And boy was she right! Jason was our actual server and he was very on top of his game. Super nice and again, very informative about the food and portion sizes. We brought along our own bottle of wine and they were perfectly okay with that ($20 corkage). We of course tried their famous dish, state birth with provisions. We had the half size, which was great for sharing between the 2 of us. Perfectly cooked with a balanced citrus sauce and shaved parmesan; the meat fell off the bone so easily.Another one of my favorites was a burrata dish with a puff pastry and shaved parmesan and cracked pepper. So simple, yet so delicious. And they are not shy with the burrata! We also had a lamb sweetbread dish with a fig and cherry chutney. A small dish as there was only two balls, but so good! The flavors are strong and can really stand on their own in the dish. We also had a pork and tofu kimchi, which was amazing. They make all their kimchi in house. I wish I could remember all the dishes we had, I'll add them as I remember. Plus pictures to come! I have a massive crush on this restaurant. Like a 12 year old in love, I sit and daydream about State Bird Provisions.  I even doodle Rebecca + State Bird = True Love Forever all over my Trapper Keeper notebook.  Everything I have had here has been delicious... from the raviolis (I actually made a special request for these on my second visit) to the Buratta to the beet salad dish. Dishes come around on carts like dim sum and you can either take the dish or pass on it. Great for trying lots of things.  Ask the servers what you absolutely must try and then take their recommendations seriously. They definitely won't steer you wrong. I can't wait until I go see my crush again. You'll find me there all dolled up and eating as much food as I can handle. AMAYYYYZING. Thanks to everyone from the hostess to Megan and Chef, my friends and I had a night of good food and drink. Started off with a Drake's pale ale, I love me a smooth, crisp ale, while waiting for our table, which was miraculously made a few weeks ago. Rumor has it there is at least a month or two wait for a table.The most memorable dishes were the pork belly with kimchi - the pork was soft and chewy, altho the kimchi could have had a bit more spicy bite, the cheese burratta, which was like a crispy, cheesy pastry with a hint of rosemary flavor, and the nori chips with avocado and shrimp. Surprisingly, though the plate sizes were small (think of ban chan bowls served at Korean restaurants) after 5-6 dishes everyone was sufficiently full. To top it off, we ordered the strawberry granata with quince and tapioca (not the tapioca in milk tea kind). WOW! The granata had a iced gelatto texture and paired well with the tapioca and quince.The bill was not bad either. I told Megan I will be back for the cheesecake though, I had to hold back!! Irrefutably hip and impossibly hyped, State Bird is an experience worth having, even if it does take calm perseverance to wait out the long lines or play the often-frustrating reservation roulette on their web site.  I chose the latter, and squeezed in after about four months wait.Squeezing is the first thing you do at the Bird - the passageway between the front door and dining room forces you to forge a narrow path through the teeming bar, cramped with festive folks getting the prize of quick counter service.  The dining room itself is an homage to industrial chic, with its concrete walls, warehouse floor, and black-and-white photographs.  The food literally comes at you from all sides, almost sensory overload, but oh-so-incredible.  You have a plethora of food choices, between the printed menu and the beautifully presented small plates that dart past, around and over you on trays and carts commanded by knowledgeable, personable servers.  Our favorite item was on the menu, a short stack of sweet corn and garlic chive pancakes topped with transcendent Mt. Tam cheese, a moist, rich, sweet and salty phenomenon...and gone so soon.  The other menu item we indulged in was the rice-crusted red trout with mandarin oranges, hazelnuts, and garum brown butter.  The flavor explosion defied categorization and defined eclectic, and we loved it.  The dim sum style cart and tray service yielded two superstars.  First, a perfect marriage of grilled shrimp and avocado, with a dousing of black garlic aioli and the ideal, heavenly accompaniment of crispy nori chips.   Second, a warm garlic fried bread (the forced sophistication of your favorite carnival fried dough) topped liberally with coarsely ground peppercorns (roasted to sweetness) and other mystically unidentifiable spices and then covered with a creamy, gooey burrata.  Need I say more?  Need I HAVE more?The answer, fortunately, was yes.  Dessert featured a brand new entry to their delectable roster, a chocolate-gingersnap pudding with toasted coconut-chocolate-almond crunch and topped with a roasted and caramelized sliver of delicata squash.  Words fail me in describing it further:  it's as good as it sounds.  Alongside, we tried the ""World Peace,"" a small shot glass of peanut muscavado milk which should be the new norm for palate cleansing.  It was also the perfect  nightcap. Although I wasn't blown away by the food, I can definitely say that it was inventive, well-executed, clever and tasty.  What really made my experience was the fact that the entire staff was very accommodating and friendly.  For that reason alone, I will definitely be revisiting provisions.Reservations are tough to come by, but if you're willing to come early and wait, you cna most definitely score a bar top or a table. I can't believe no one has thought of this before: bring dim sum to high end ""american nouveau"" or california modern, with a dash of asian influence. The experience is a great one, even if it does take a while to get a reservation. Everyone should try it once to see if they love it, and those who do will undoubtedly become loyal devotees. Tasty treats:- pancake with sweet corn- albacore crudo- pork belly- CA state bird with provisions (the namesake of the restaurant; thus you have to try it) Totally amazing concept.  Very competent American-inspired dishes served dim-sum style.  The best of both worlds.  I wish some dim-sum restaurants would step-up the quality and take a lesson from this place. What makes State Bird so good you ask? Food, well that's a given.  It's reputation precedes itself.  Will there be things you don't like? Naturally, traditional dim sum is that way.  You like some you don't like some. Difference is nothing should gross you out like Dim Sum can.   Dim sum joint remixed is one way to describe the place but my thought was more of a Chef's Choice remixed kind of place but the difference is if there's something you like you can keep going back to it over and over again.  Let me tell you that is handy. Can get expensive but it's handy.  I'd like to sit here and kill the hype but I simply can't. If you think the food isn't that great there is no way you could dis the hospitality of the staff.  Anyone can serve food and be efficient and nice. But to make you feel like you are at a friends house, well that takes a special kind of place. The people who work there make this as much as an experience as the food. So in summary it's fun, friendly, and f'ing good. That's 3 F's that equal to an A+. Top 3 dining experiences I've ever had.  Maybe number 1 after I break down other meals in my head. Hope I can get back there soon and I hope if you are reading this you do too. The food was awkward.  The flavors did not always match or compliment.  There were 3 things that stood out as solid:Yuba tagliatelle with matsutake and noriCumin lamb with scallions grapes and zucchiniSweet bread with black figThe other things mentioned by other Yelpers were just awkward in taste.  I really wanted to like this place... So sad... It's quite good.Very very good.In fact, almost everything I've had here was good, with the absolutely glaring exception of...... the quail.Surprise!A tiny, wee, little, miniature bird is not great in deep-fried form.The amount of batter, and oil, totally overwhelms it.There ain't now way that thing is winning.Sad, but true.No chance.Avoid.Aside from that; good stuff!P.S. Oh the ""delicious"" irony of their signature, namesake dish, being their least tasty, and least interesting dish. Sigh. Really unique, interesting food, and the folks keeping it all moving (Emily especially) are awesome! Unexpected and innovative idea of having small tapas, served like dim sum!  Fun, exciting, and leaves you curious to try more dishes.  Creative, new, and delectable flavor combinations surprise your palate and bring you to gourmet-gasm!  However, be prepared for a 2-MONTH waiting list to get a reservation... Wow. I'm not even sure where to start. I guess I'll kick this off with the first words that come to mind: incredibly disappointing and extremely overrated. I had such high hopes for this place after reading about it in Bon Apetit and pretty much every other food related blog on the planet. It took me 2 months to get a reservation (which was at 10pm, the only time they had available). We were seated pretty much right away which was a plus, and judging by the other reviews not all that typical. The dishes we had ranged from bland to just plain bad. They are clearly trying to be inventive and original and in my opinion drastically failing. The food was just plain not very good. We had the short ribs, pancake, some sort of ahi tuna thing...nothing very memorable and not during a single bite was I impressed. My boyfriend felt the same. An additional annoyance was the lack of food they had available - maybe it was because it was later in the evening, but one guy with one cart with a few measly small plates on it just didn't do the job of serving an entire packed restaurant. Maybe my expectations were too high bc of all the hype - but I think when a restaurant is voted best new restaurant in America the food should be impressive. Especially considering all the amazing restaurants in SF I am just blown away that this place tops the charts. Go !!! Good execution, with complex flavors. Some dishes were a bit muted though, like the cumin lamb. After a while, the cold dishes leave you wanting something hot, but some of the hot dishes weren't hot enough. We spent about $50 a person, which was a good value I thought.pork belly korean style, tofu, green beans; very goodchip with seafood salsaoysterking salmonstate bird nicely friedbeef cheek currypork ribscorn pancake, surprisingly goodgarlic bread burratacumin lambWe scored last minute reservations through a friend, but I'd be hard pressed to wait the two months to get a table here. One of the most amazing meals! Fun, fast, and tasty. Diversity Americana cuisine. A special treat worth waiting in line for. Price to very fairly to keep returning. This place is delicious! Cool staff, decor, food, and surprisingly a good value. It's tough getting areservatino, but it's well worth the wait. The food is great here, but the service is seriously lacking.  We had reservations at 8pm, showed up right on time, but they didn't sit us for 22 minutes.  They asked if we wanted wine while we waited, so we ordered some, but it turns out they were out of wine glasses (something they discovered right as we were sitting).  So they gave us some complimentary cava instead, which was nice... but other tables were having wine glasses brought to them about 2 minutes later.  We ended up having to re-order the wine, since they forgot it... and a constant theme of the night was that any wine order took 15 minutes.  We should have ordered a bottle.Food-wise, some things were amazing, some things were simply good.  Strangely enough, the seasoning was completely inconsistent: The steak tartar had basically no salt in it, but the deep-fried eggplant was quite salty (and amazing!!).The corn pancakes and quail were definitely on the amazing side, as well as the ice cream sandwich.  But the other things: Oysters, sea urchin pancakes, the ciccioli - definitely good, maybe not stellar.Overall, I won't be coming back just because I prefer good service.  Like places that sit you on time (or truly apologize for not), deliver wine quickly when you have a dish infront of you (not 15 minutes), ask you if your dishes are OK and if you need anything, don't try to charge you for complimentary things at the end, and don't ask you if you want more food after you've ordered dessert.  The front operations were just such a circus... but for some, the food's probably worth the hassle. Absolutely mind-blown and shocked with this place! Their servers, service, and food will leave you talking about it for months! Of course, that's if you're able to get past the 2 hour wait (if you're lucky) .. Or one month booked RSVP! The servers walk around constantly with different exquisite dishes, so it'd simply be a crime to not try them all. Their corn pancakes are a must-order-4-of-those ! ( bear in mind, Ive never been a fan of corn, so for me to praise about it, should really mean something) Love. This. Place. Amazing place!  We sat at the bar facing the chefs and enjoyed watching them prepare the various plates. The Kimchi that Chef Glenn has perfected was out of this world with tofu and pork belly!  The garlic bread with Burrata was yum!  The double choc pudding with passion fruit is not to be missed!  Chef Steve and Glenn made the night one to remember - such a fun atmosphere! Guys this is foodie white person dim sum.  I'm yellow, so chill.  It's nice.  It costs too much for a good dose of ordinariness.Yes you can get an appetizer for $5 and not $15.  But they are tiny.  And this is not Le Bernadin, OK?I'd up it to a five star if they started serving using a floating sushi boat mechanism and cut their costs accordingly by 40%.Three stars is like a kick in the groin from Yelp, but this is about mean and median for SF places that will run $50 a person for a after work meal.  It really is. amazing ! can't wait to go back !! This is the only meal I have ever had in my life at which the entire table decided we should immediately make another reservation to eat here again in 3 months. The food ranged from very good to unbelievably good. I had the best rib of my life here. One rib. One kind of expensive rib. It was worth it.UPDATE: I went again in December 2012 and it wasn't as exciting the second time around. I think the dim sum style American food is only worth extra points one time. Most of the same dishes were served and were still delicious. I might come back in a couple years. I had a great meal at State Bird Provisions a few weeks ago.I had a reservation at 9p for four which was a great way to try a lot of the menu on a first visit. Service was running a bit late (not surprising on a Friday night for this tiny place) so I checked in with the hostess Emily and she gave me a call when the table was ready so I could enjoy a quick drink nearby. She was great.Definitely a fun way to do dinner with friends. It is like building your own tasting menu! You have to stay on your toes and make some quick decisions but over all we were very pleased. Some portions are very small (splitting a tiny palm sized pancake 4 ways!) but we ordered 16 dishes (a couple were double orders) and a bottle of wine and left more then satisfied. Our total was $65 per person (including tip). I think that is a great value.Stand out items for me:cast iron eggs with guanicaleeggplant friesribsthe state birdthe ice cream sandwichI wouldn't wait three hours or eat my meal standing up (like some of the walk ins were doing) for this meal. Just stay vigilant and make a reservation. it is worth it. I was BLOWN away by this place...surprising as I eat out ALOT! and the concept idea is usually such a let down. Not so at SBP!! Amazing interior and even more delicious food!  We walked in at 5:45 and already an hour wait at this tiny place, no bigs for us as we just went and had a glass at dosa.The food was delicious I believe we had 12 plates and all were yummy (although my table said the state bird was the least tasty).  Of course the brie pancake and burrata were the highlights for this vegit!Worth the wait! It's always a thrill eating at the hottest new culinary hot spot, even if the only reservation we could get was at 9:30pm on a Tuesday night.  Even so, I came away pretty impressed.  Every dish we got was good--there was honestly nothing I could say was bad or even ""just okay.""  There were some standouts.  One dish, which I'd describe as a fried dough ball covered in warm burrata, was simply amazing: soft, chewy dough and creamy cheese, mmmmmmmmmmmmm.......  Also good was the fried egg with vegetables and pork skin, and the guacamole with spicy seafood salsa (pretty much a ceviche).  Service was very friendly, and the entire experience was a fun little food adventure.  This isn't really the place for a casual night out with the sig-o, as the dishes might leave hungry or somewhat unsatisfied.  But it's definitely a place I'll take guests or visitors who want to see what the SF food scene is ""all about."" Husband and I had dinner here this past Saturday, thanks to a friend who managed to get reservations for 4.Interesting way of serving foods on trays and carts, but then I grew up with dimsum every Sunday, so nothing new here. As far as food is concerned, it's pretty solid, but prices wise it's quite expensive, around $5-$9 per tapas sized dish. Value wise, considering both taste and spend, it's a OK.Between 4 of us, we tasted every single dish they served that night, and more (from the order menu). We tried a total of 17 dishes, plus 2 desserts, some notable ones are:- Sweet corn pancake- Biscuit with duck pate mousse- Egg with salmon and roe PROS- unique dining experience- tasty dishes- good serviceCONS- Incredibly hard to get a reservation- Not enough veg dishes- PriceyWorth going once but not sure I""ll go back. Such a fun experience - unique concept. Friendly and fun service. Amazing food.Our party of two risked going w/out a reservation - and on a Friday night - we lucked out and got the best seats in the house: at the end of the bar where the food comes out. When a restaurant gets this much hype I always fear that I will be disappointed. Lucky for me, this dinner was one of the most unique and life affirming (yes, life affirming!) experiences I have had in years.The place itself is urban in all the right ways and accented with beautiful floral arrangements and an open kitchen. We tried almost every dish that came by and each one was stellar in it's own way. I have rarely had such refined, beautiful food in such a casual, fun atmosphere. Hooray for it!I also loved that everyone served as part of the wait staff, including the chef himself. Everyone was so warm and personable and excited to be there I almost felt like I was in a sitcom about a restaurant.**My only negative feedback was that the hostess refused to acknowledged that we had to wait even though we had a reservation - a personal pet peeve of mine after working in the service industry for years. Would it kill you to say, ""So sorry about the wait, your table should be ready soon""?? I have to agree with comments that the food was all good, interesting, balanced, but not that much was outstanding. Nothing orgiastic, melting, burning and spinning, stunning your socks off - just healthy, nicely arranged, cute little dishes in a cute little restaurant staffed by young people with shaggy bangs and hipster clothes. The staff was friendly but again, while very competent the service was not particularly outstanding. Really great service is when the waitstaff just pour out knowledge about the food and wine; this staff is ""a little too cool for school"" without the drive and professionalism that really makes you feel taken care of. Before tip our tab was about $125 for two people which was surprisingly low given the huge number of dishes that we tried. I might go again sometime but it just wasn't enough of a blowout for me to become one of my all time favorites. Went with 2 friends and sat at the chef's counter - best seats in the house as we got to talk with the chefs preparing the dishes.  We all thoroughly enjoyed each and every bite of the many dishes that came before us.  And it wasn't just the food, but the intimate space, warm and sincere service.   Everyone that we came into contact with seemed to genuinely enjoy what they were doing and was excited about the food they had to offer.  When we asked questions, they were ready with the answers.  they were attentive with water and beverage service. The only draw back is the wait to get in whether you plan months in advance or wait in line to put your name on a list and wait for a call back later in the evening. Whoa.  I lived in SF years ago and had friends in the industry, so always ate well... For my return week in SF I was determined to eat as well as possible.After extensive research I dined at about 10 restaurants.  Several of them were great, what you'd expect of fine dining.State Bird Provisions, however, is on a level all it's own.  By far my best dining experience in SF, and on of my best ever. I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to have eaten at some excellent meals at fine and not so fine restaurants around the world.  State Bird will be remembered as one of the best.Applying the ""dim-sum"" approach to fine dining makes the whole experience more interactive and gives the diner a chance to let their senses decide on what to eat.  Nearly every dish I tried was so beautifully balanced and subtle.  Their concept may be inviting, but the skill of their staff is what makes this place SO incredible.The wine list was small, but provided what I wanted.I urge anyone who loves great food to try this restaurant.  If there are 2 or less in your party, you probably don't need a reservation.... So, we made a reservation--6 weeks to get in for our prime dining request of 7pm on a Saturday.  We later learned that walk-ins can get a table and a little flexibility will go a long way in making a reservation.  Bon Apetit had just named it the ""Best New Restaurant in America"".   So, I was expecting it NOT to live up to the hype and a six week wait.   I was totally and pleasantly surprised!  They have a menu of 5 or 6 items you can order and about 15 items that come around on trays or carts (think dim sum style).   The food was awesome.  Tasty, inspired, new-american meets tapas and dim sum.  loved the food and the concept.  Most importantly, the staff were warm and friendly.  The dining room manager was very friendly and engaging.  The wait staff very informative, explaining the food and and wines.  We were not rushed and enjoyed most of the dishes tremendously.  They seem happy to be there and so were we.  Can't wait to go back and eat my way through the rest of the menu.  Recommend that you try one of everything, share the small plates and enjoy! What a lucky surprise! I made a reservation for SBP three months ago and promptly forgot all about it only to be reminded by email last week. I rounded up some friends and we had one of the best meals in recent memory. I liked the tapas style, although we felt the need to order quite a few different dishes off the regular menu. Instead of giving a blow by blow of each dish, I'll just say that the quality of each one was outstanding and the uniqueness of the dishes was often surprising. The downside to trying lots of experimental small dishes is that there are always going to be some you don't really like (and as a group we did tend to disagree from dish to dish) but at the end of the night, we all agreed it was one of the better dining experiences we have had in SF. And to top it off, it was relatively inexpensive given the quality of the food. Highly recommended! Third time was the charm. After a one-and-half hour wait, we finally got seated and the adventure began. All the dishes were beautifully presented and packed a lot of flavor. Service was attentive, but nothing special. Recommend, but be prepared to wait..... The whole dining experience at State Bird Provisions is so uniquely different.  It's so fun to pick and choose as the waiters come around with their carts and explain the assortment of dishes to you.  It feels very personal.  The food was good, but nothing that I had was amazing.  The bf and I sampled a good share of the 13 or so provisions they were offering that night, with a couple of commandables as well.  A highlight was the seafood salsa, although very familiar in flavor profile to many Mexican salsas with tomatoes and avocado.  A miss was the cast iron egg.  There was no flavor to the dish, and the fried bread compounded the greasiness of the dish.  The peppers seemed a bit out of place as well.  Everything else was good, but not blow your socks off good.  The experience overall was more fun and adventurous than anything.  I think it's totally creative and accessible, and I'd love to go back.  Hopefully when I do, they'll have proper beer glasses though.  My Green Flash Rayon Vert was served in a ridiculously narrow glass that foamed over at the slightest pour. I really don't understand what everyone is raving about.  It was an interesting concept but overall the food was poorly executed.  The kim chee tofu pork belly was not good, in fact it made me sick.  Passion fruit was a step to far with the pudding! Came in a last minute whim and was seated right away with no reservation. Lots of little plates full of fried and raw delicacies. The plates never stop wheeling by so pace yourself! The state bird was good. Had an epic coconut cake which was as cute as the woman who made it. The kitchen staff all smiled and waved at us when we left. Super cute place! Let me preface this by saying that I love my Bon Appetit magazine...I've cooked tons of recipes from their magazine and I love reading their various articles an tips!  I am a loyal reader and I really trust them.  So maybe my expectations were set too high since I had read about this place on Bon Appetit as being the Best New Restaurant in America.  I just can't seem to agree less.First off, we had a 9:30 reservation and did not get seated until a little after 10pm.  There is really no room to stand around and wait in there since they have to cart their food through any open space they have so we kept getting asked to move out of the way with no acknowledgment or apologies that they were late on our reservation. Fine, sometimes they can't control the tables eating beforehand but I would have expected them to feel bad about seating us so late and perhaps offer us a glass of wine or something.  I will say though at the very end of the meal someone did come to our table and thank us for waiting for so long to eat and that they were sorry about the wait.  I would have felt better had they done that from the start.Part of why they probably won Best New Restaurant in America is due to their unique style of service.  Think Dim Sum...but is that really new or unique?  I've been eating in dim sum restaurants since I was a toddler....I won't say how old I am but let's just say it's not new...not by a long shot.   The servers and hosts were not particularly friendly either.  I will say there was one server there that was actually really nice and then rest never really smiled and didn't have really have any personalities. Maybe they are just too hip for me.There were four of us so we pretty much almost ordered everything they had that night on the menu.  Of course you may never have these items on your menu if you go but I will review based on our menu that night. I wouldn't say the food was bad but I wouldn't say anything really blew my mind and made me want to go back anytime soon.  There were also a couple things that had strange flavor combinations that just did not work or that just didn't taste right.  A couple of those dishes came to mind that I wish I hadn't ordered:1. Kimchi-pork belly with tofu.  Something was off putting with their tofu.  The taste reminded me of the smell of bad tofu...and since I have never eaten bad tofu but boy have I smelled it, I could only imagine their tofu is how bad tofu would taste...sour and bitter and made me want to spit it out.2. Glazed Pork Ribs with Swiss chard, Togarashi.  I could not finish my pork rib.  Not because I didn't try but it was so dry that I could not get it off the bone.  Even when I tired to fork and knife it it was tough.3. Pickles, Smoked Albacore-Lardo Butter. The main parts of this dish were not bad tasting but they had these chicharron toppers and when I bit into mine it was like a piece of rubber.  Not crispy, rubbery as hell.  Not edible...imagine biting into a piece of styrofoam, I couldn't even bite it in half. Not to also mention that they were completely tasteless.  I should give them 2 start just because they didn't put any salt on those fried pork rinds.  Isn't seasoning your food ""cooking 101""?4. Marble Chocolate Pudding, Birdseed Crunch, Passionfruit.  This dish was not finished by any of us and that's hard to imagine. We finished every other dish except this one and the 3 above.  The pudding and the passionfruit just didn't taste good together.However, I will say though that there were a few dishes that helped them retain my 3 star rating:1. Garlic Bread and Burrata.  Think deep fried beignet with creamy burrata...I mean you can't really mess that up.  Fried bread nom nom nom...it was good.  2. Cheesecake Japonaise, Tomato Carmel, Strawberries.  This was excellent.  Light and creamy just like the Japanese cheesecakes you get at the Japanese market except even better since it's fresh.3. Chanterelle Egg, Pecorino & Pork Jowl.  This was a good dish, the flavor combinations of the creamy, salty, fatty were just perfect.  The egg was custardy and delicious.4. Sweet Corn & Garlic Chive ""Shortstack"" with Mt. Tam.  Probably cause I love Mt. Tam cheese from cowgirl creamery but these little pancakes were delightful!  And, I just love corn right now...any fresh corn dish will win me over.Don't get me wrong, I am proud as hell a new restaurant in my hometown achieved Best New Restaurant in America on Bon Appetit magazine, but did it really earn it?  Hard to say unless I go and try all the other 9 restaurants on their list.  In my opinion though, nothing there really blew my mind and I'm not really itching to go back anytime soon. Hopefully you will have a better experience and menu when you go try it! 3.5 stars out of 5.Came here on a Tuesday around 6:15 and they said that we would have a table at around 8. We headed to 1300 Fillmore for happy hour drinks (they would text us when a table was available).There's a menu with direct orders from the kitchen as well as items not on the menu that they walk around with to lure you in (prices displayed).Here's a list of what we ordered with ratings:2/5 - Farm egg with bacon, chanterelles, and tomato sauce - Tomato sauce reminded us of pizza sauce. Bacon was flavorful but the overall dish didn't come together well.2/5 - Kimchi tofu pork belly stew - had better kimchi stew homemade. Kimchi was a little too sour for us.4/5 - Fried quail - batter was flavorful and quail was juicy.3.5/5 - Ribs - good but nothing to write home about. Fall off the bone tender.4/5 - Guinea hen dumplings - meat was nice and spiced and the broth was a great compliment.3/5 - Seafood ceviche - Pretty bland. Could have been more citrusy or with some accompanying herbs. A little like bland tomato purée.5/5 - Fig and Lavender ice cream sandwich. Delish! So many flavors going on in every bite. It was like a party in my mouth. My friend mentioned how the lavender notes hit different parts of your taste buds (I usually don't like lavender). The favors were harmonious and really stimulated my palette (sounds cheesy but that's how I really felt). We were glad we got this one because otherwise we would have been disappointed.Overall, such a hyped up restaurant should have every item on the menu special (at least good and not mediocre) and I didn't feel that way. I would suggest waiting for hype to die down or make reservations if you really want to try it. Also everything is pricey and the items that pass by are tempting so if you care about how much you spend I would suggest doing some research on what dishes are good since I felt like it was a waste for some of the choices we tried. Maybe if we lucked out on trying every dish that was good I would give it a 4. State Bird Provisions is everything you think it is but better.  My friend and I planned to get there when they opened at 530 and ended up eating at 7 on a Tuesday.  It's worth the wait and you can grab a drink near-by.Food.  Each small plate is really dumb-founding.  Every single taste bud was satisified.  I've never had such inventive, but simple, and as the Stuart the chef said, food that just made sense.  The tapas style is genius because there's so many yummy dishes that you see and want to try. And you can.  Also, the most inventive fully disclosed dishes I've had.  The chef is happy to tell about each plates ingredients and process.  Amazing.Staff/ ambiance.  Staff= 10 stars.  We were lucky enough to sit at the bar so we had full access to the kitchen and all the cooks.  Amazing to see the workings of this incredible restaurant.  And all the staff talks with you and takes care of you all while whipping up these fantastic dishes.  There's a real sense of community.  Everyone takes care of the patrons and they want to make sure you are enjoying the food.  Ambiance- it's like your sitting at your friend's kitchen chatting.  The experience at the bar is great if you want to socialize.  We sat with a staff member who was taking his night off to eat as a patron and another couple of friends.  All of us shared food.  If you see something and you want it you just ask for it and voila it's there right in front of your drooling mug.Chef.  He's so talented, invented, humble, gracious and just happy to serve amazing.  He was working and coming around to every table and explaining the dishes.  Unreal can't wait to go back again.  And so lucky that it's in my neighborhood! A must go if you're in the city. This review may be a bit biased but what the hell, I will write it anyways.  So I have not been to the actual restaurant but tried State Bird Provisions at the SF Street Food Festival in August 2012.I got to the festival before it even opened at 11:00 am and there was already a line for the State Bird Provisions booth so, being the lemming that I am, I stood in line.  And wow, I am super glad I did.  I ordered the Burrata with Green Garlic Bread and WOW!  Such a simple dish of perfectly baked garlic bread with fresh burrata and a hint of spices and olive oil.  This dish truly exemplified ingredient driven food in my book and I can only imagine what is being made at the restaurant!I can't wait to make a trip up to SF to try the full State Bird Provisions experience! We got in on Thursday night without a reservation.  We stood in line at 5:30 and were told we'd have a table for 4 at 7.  At 6:10 a text said our table was ready!  We had at least:- Sweet corn + chive pancakes with Mt. Tam cheese - Burrata with garlic bread- Avocado with seafood salsa - Dumplings in aromatic broth- Oysters on the half shell- Beef cheek and oxtail curry- Smoked salmon w/tomato and corn- Lamb- A tostada-like thing with halibut sashimi- Ice cream sandwichesBeer and wine A few dishes were delicious, most were good and a few were poor.  I really liked the oxtail, lamb and halibut.  I was told the oysters were excellent.  The garlic bread under the burrata was cold and chewy.  I didn't like the dumplings and the broth was cold.  Odd pairing of ingredients and spices.  A little lavender in the ice cream sandwich.  The concept is great and for a restaurant so highly reviewed the prices are reasonable. Everything is tiny however.  Even the large dishes.  Beer and wine pours are small. We made reservations for three about three weeks in advance, and the only table we could get on a  Friday night was at 9:45pm. Kind of small restaurant for such a popular place. The concept is American food served on a cart, where you eat with yur eyes first.This is what three of us picked out: fried quail with onions & parmesan, almond biscuits with duck liver mousse, steak tartare with shishito peppers, ginger scallion pancake with sea urchin, tomato, corn & salmon salad, soft cooked egg with tomatoes, padrons & guanciale, guinea hen dumplings, tomato-dashi mushrooms with charred eggplant, Japonaise cheesecake with starwberries & candied tomatoes.(see entire menu here: yelp.co.uk/biz_photos/QZ…)My favourite dishes were the quail, almond biscuits with duck liver mousse, & uni pancake. The quail was perfectly fried and the cheese gave it a nice saltiness. The onions at the bottom were amazing too. The duck liver mousse was rich and creamy and paired well with the mini almond biscuits. Everything else was scrumptious. I was not disappointed at all. The process is a little slower...dinner took 2.5 hours, but we didn't mind. I had a great date last night and State Bird Provisions was central to it.  I really liked (nearly) everything about it.  Here's the rundown.Overall Experience: Excellent.  I really loved the vibe in this place.  Simple, a bit rustic with modern touches.  Not too loud but vibrant.  The layering of the set menu with the rotational items they bring by your table was a great touch and made the experience unique.  My only slight nitpick was the service.  The front of the house was warm and inviting.  Our waiter was fine.  Stopped by occasionally but clearly running about, super-busy and not overly welcoming.  Nothing off-putting though...just OK.Food: Excellent.  We had some delightful dumplings in a tasty broth.  Some pork ribs with spice that was unique and truly excellent.  We had ""seafood"" salsa which was a mix of guacamole, tomato based sauce and a mixed assortment of salsa.  It was interesting and good (not my favorite though).  For desert we have the chocolate and pudding.  Interesting and pretty good.Tip: Walk-ins seem to be the way to go here.  The wait was a couple of hours but we'd walked in at peak time on a Friday night.  So, here's the trick: put your name on the list..give them your cell #.  Walk around the corner and grab a drink (and perhaps some small bites if super-hungry) at Fat Angel (a gastropub that never disappoints).  Then, get the text that your table is ready and you're off!  I was trying for reservations here but read that walk-ins works...so did that.  Good move.  They said that half of their biz is walk-ins.Now one of my favorite spots in SF (the kind of place you take out-of-towners). Delish! Scored a last -minute reservation and had an amazing meal. It's Dim Sum with New American food. The food is innovative with great flavors--a lot of the new american restaurant genre is bland and boring--not here!State Bird Provisions deserves the hype.My only complaint would be that the place is pretty noisy, but that's also a flaw of many SF restaurants.--quail--amazing!--corn pancakes--excellent; can't wait to try to replicate them myself--kimchi pork belly--a little fatty for my taste but the flavor was divine.--beef cheek curry, mushroom dumpling (broth was memorable), garlic bread/burrata--all wonderful.--the only thing we didn't like was fish crudo dish that wasn't anything special. State Bird Provisions serves up New American dishes dim sum style. In addition to a selection of small plates that are brought by the table for you to pick from, there are some items you can order off the menu, including pancakes, meats, and desserts. The day I came here, there were 13 tableside small plates choose from. Unfortunately, not all of them made their way past our table in the 75 minutes we were here. I really liked the concept of State Bird. While I didn't LOVE every single item I tried, everything was decently good. Items I liked more denoted with ""**"" below.- Sweet corn + chive pancakes with Mt. Tam cheese **- Burrata with garlic bread- Avocado with seafood salsa **- Dumplings in aromatic broth- Oysters on the half shell- Beef cheek curry with crepes + bok choy **- Cast iron eggs with tomatoes, padron peppers, guanciale- Cheesecake Japonaise **The bill for the above items came out to just under $80 pre-tip.Other notes:* Unassuming exterior and very cool modern interior* Good service* No tables of greater than 4 available* Very close to the Japantown parking garage As my girlfriend most eloquently put it, the way this place runs is kind of like a ""Create your own tasting menu"" joint. Sure, it's like a dim sum place, but the similarities stop with the carts and trays rotating around for your pickings. With that in mind, you should be prepared to pay as much as you would for a prixe fixe at a place that offers it. My gf and I spent about $60 each, and came away more than stuffed.We tried about 6 or 7 things, but here are some of the high (and low) lights:* The State Bird Provisions (i.e. breaded fried quail) was delicious. I was expecting some gaminess to be there, but was pleasantly surprised at how little gaminess there actually was. The breading was crispy and savory. Finger licking good.* Oxtail Curry - To be honest, this was kind of a disappointment. On one hand, the flavor was off the charts. I could eat that sauce all day everyday. Where this dish really felt short was the oxtail itself. I felt like it didn't have enough time to be completely tenderized. It was a little chewy, and as a result was a little difficult to eat.* Toast with Lardo Butter and Chicharron - I love all these things individually, so I couldn't say no when the cart came around. It sounded great in my mind, but in application I didn't see any cohesion there. I didn't think the flavors went well together here.* Cast-Iron Eggs - Although it was pretty rustic, this was a nice dish. I thought the egg was cooked beautifully and its richness really brought everything together. Really tasty.Overall, I think this is a great place to hang out and enjoy some pretty tasty food. The dim sum style service is fun, especially since the folks coming around with the food can be easily understood, aren't rude and are happy to tell you all the ingredients in the dish. Although every dish I had wasn't a home run, I'm still really interested in coming back. I think this would be a perfect spot to eat and drink before heading to the Kabuki for a movie.If you're a beer snob, you'll also like this place because they have a small but delicious selection of craft beers. I've been to SBP twice now, had a great experience both times and will continue to return (even if that does mean booking reservations over a month in advance....the anticipation is well rewarded). Given some of the poor (but uncommon) reviews I've seen on Yelp, it's apparent the concept of this restaurant isn't for everyone. But frankly, I'm OK with a few bad reviews because perhaps it will make it easier for me to get a table. :) I personally like the dim sum concept for the food, though yes, it does mean that the food from the carts doesn't come out steaming hot. But here's the point everyone - most of it shouldn't be served hot anyway. In my experience, the dishes on the cart are supposed to be served cold or room temperature. The items that should be hot usually come out on hand carried trays immediately after coming out of the oven or off the grill. And the items you order from the menu come out immediately as well. I'm sure the staff may have off nights, but so far I've not had any complaints about the temperature of the food.Concept aside, what I like most about SPB is the food. I feel like I'm being taught a lesson in flavor with nearly every bite. This place exemplifies the concept of eating the dish as the chef intended - everything on the plate has a purpose, just go with it and be prepared to smile (or sometime giggle, it's that good). The place is super busy now with all the local and national hype (and I overheard one of the cooks say Monday was one of their busiest nights, fyi), so even with a reservation, we still had to wait about 20 minutes to get our table. But a glass of sparkling wine, a celebrity sighting, and plenty of food eye-candy helped passed the time easily. It also helped me keep tabs on what I wanted to try so I could pace myself through the selection. Try it. If you don't love it, then my apologies, but thanks for making more room for me. :) I've already booked my next visit. If you don't already have a reservation for State Bird, make one now, or be ready to get in line at 5:00 or earlier, 30 minutes before opening for a coveted walk-in spot....in the end the wait will be totally worth it...I stake my Yelp reputation on it :-)I recommend starting with the restaurant name sake and the full order is a must. The quail is coated in what I'm told is 20+ different spices the coolest of which is coarsely ground pumpkin seeds which adds great texture. Who would've thought our state bird was so damn good.The guinea hen dumplings are based on a delicious hen confit and a broth that I found almost similar to Pho with hints of cinnamon, star anise, etc. Well done dish.Kimchi-pork belly with tofu..mmm meltingly tender chunks of pork pair so well with the silkiness of the tofu. Nice twist on a traditional Korea hot pot.Duck liver mousse: well since I can't get foie gras this is the next best thing to fill that void in my pallete. I particularly liked the almond biscuits.Had a bunch of other items but this review is getting a bit long...bottom line they were all stinkin' yummy. Don't believe the HYPE. I did and I'm disappointed, but read on because there are still things that were good here (not great, but good). There are 1 of 2 reasons for this: 1) my palate isn't culinary enough to know what the heck I was eating/why it was special or 2) this place wasn't that great - I'd like to believe the latter.Came here for a special birthday and without a reservation, arrived at 5pm per the yelp reviews and restaurant staff suggestions. We were 2nd in line, luckily not a minute later, because this line definitely grew fast. When the doors opened, we were given seats at the counter (maybe this is just for walk-ins, but the coupe behind us sat at a table and they didn't seem to have a reservation, so it would've been nice to ask us which we preferred since I forgot to ask in the organized chaos of the check in process, somewhat organized, somewhat stressful, somewhat happy because you realize you got a seat!). *ding #1 - don't sit at the counter if you can help it, if you're going to pay 100+ for a meal, it's best not spent crammed between 3 men.*Food started arriving quickly, tapas style, I jumped the gun and ordered steak tartar to be adventurous, not realizing that this may later cause a week of upset stomach. Second dish, also jumped the gun in excitement, said YES to the Duck Liver, forgetting that I actually don't like Liver, but it was creamy and the little buns served with it are quite good, but nothing special. A handful of mediocre dishes came and went, so we ordered from the menu. Had to try the state bird - why you would point out that you are eating the California State Bird by naming your restaurant this, baffles me, but this was very good. Tender and juicy with a crispy exterior - lives up to its expectations. Oxtail Curry - is very odd and not worth ordering *ding2*, definitely a miss. Curry flavor was subtle but this had no ""light up my tastebuds"" quality to it. The raw oysters were very fresh and the seafood salad with toasted chips (tasted a little like salsa) was very good as well.The sole reason for the review and the stars - BURRATA. This was AMAZING and when we had this, I thought the night was taking a turn for the better, but it didn't. The cheese was so fresh and a great compliment to the flaky burrata. Dessert was very yummy too and I may be biased as I love sweets, but the ice cream sandwich is a must try.The bartender was swamped in the beginning which didn't allow her much time to socialize, so yes she was doing her job, but no she kind of wasn't. She wasn't overly friendly nor amused when we asked what certain things are - one of my biggest pet peeves at fancy places when they treat you like you aren't fancy enough. She lightened up by the end of the night, maybe she was just busy. Most of the staff seemed stand-off-ish but at times friendly, so honestly, this also baffles me *ding #3*Long story short: I trusted Bon Appetit and a trusted culinary friend's recommendation, but I was disappointed. Maybe my expectations were too high or they just didn't live up to the hype. Few good items, but not enough to make me come early or make a 60day in advance reservation to come again. I have been meaning to try this place for a while and I finally made it there this weekend. I also managed to score a reservation at a reasonable time which of course always helps! To start, my friend and I somehow timed it perfectly and got probably one of the best seats in the house - it was right where the servers come out from the kitchen so we got first dibs on dishes. Our waitress was very personable and helpful in explaining how the process works. We ordered drinks and also the ribs that are on the menu that do not come out with the servers. Then the fun began! Here are the items we selected from the passed dishes:- Heirloom tomatoes w smoked salmon and sweet corn - Excellent flavors and combination.- Albacore mousse with pickled veggies and chicharones - Ok not one of my favorite dishes- Duck liver mousse w almond biscuits - LOVED the biscuits, the liver mousse flavor was great but a bit soft on the consistency- Quinoa w Ahi tuna - This was one of my favorite dishes and I don't even like quinoa! The flavors are layered and excellent together.- Spicey tomato sauce with egg and chantarelle mushrooms - sounded good but everything just kind of blended together and was kind of one note- Burrata with fried garlic bread - if you are a burrata fan then you will probably love this, it is a bit heavy but really good flavor- Dumplings with hen and shitake mushrooms - one of the just ok dishes, would not get again- Ribs - these were delicious and tender. A different flavor than I have ever tasted before on ribs, and I have had a lot of ribs!- Melon granita with ginger tapioca and berries - we were so full (very proud we managed to try 8 things between the 2 of us!) so we went with the lightest sounding dessert. Not fantastic but a fun and light dessrt which we enjoyed.All of the servers were great and fun to talk to. They checked in on us without being intrusive and we never felt rushed. We really enjoyed the concept and will be back! You know what - f these guys. I ate there 6 ish months ago with a reservation and it was OK - not amazing, good food but nothing blew me away. Last night I thought that perhaps, just perhaps, since their website clearly states that they welcome walk-ins, if we came late enough we might get a seat. Instead we get rudely shoved into a line and have to wait while the hostess does other things, talks to other people who jump said line, and then she comes over to us and says ""uh, no, I'm closing out the restaurant with those last people"". I'm frankly sick and tired of the restaurant scene in San Francisco - it's like you people don't know how to cook your own food. I'm exhausted by the lines, the impossible reservations and the trendytrendytrendy spots. Plow, I'm looking at you as well. From now on, when I go out I'm going to stick to the no-longer-so-hot but still very solid and innovative restaurants. Like SPQR, where we had dinner. And it was delicious, and they weren't rude and stuck up, because they're not the hot b*tch on the block anymore. This place should be Yelp-proof by now, so I'm going to defer to Bon Apetit with regard to overall impressions. I'm writing to the reader who has already made reservations and is thinking about what they might like to order. If you are thinking of going there and you haven't made reservations yet ... well, good luck to you then. Must: State Bird - fried quail over pickled veggies. Signature dish didn't disappointOysters - if raw oysters is your thing. This was the one dish we re-ordered.Ravioli - it's tiny, and served with a tiny amount of broth, but there's a lot of flavor thereMust Not:Ox tail curry entree - You know, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, and worse, it seemed to clash with everything else we ordered.It wasn't the best meal I've had in SF, but it was a darn good meal. Enjoy! I have heard a lot of great things about SBP, so I must say:  The concept is 5 out of 5, the atmosphere is 5 out of 5, but the food is 3 out of 5.  The reason I'm writing a review is I think this restaurant has a good thing going and concept is great.  I believe the owners/employees are open for feedback and will improve.  I will go there again in a few months:  The glazed pork ribs were dry and chewy.  The quail was ok, not good or great, but just ok.  I have prepared quail, dove, and small game birds 20 different ways, sometimes you fail and sometimes you are successful.  Try again, again, and again.I want to see SBP successful, successful to the point that other restaurants start to copy them. I am going to be that 1% to give a contrarian review to the overwhelming positive responses.  In a word: overhyped.  To be more precise:  the place has a great concept (small creative plates served efficiently in a dim sum style).  However, creativity does not equal great taste when it comes to food.  While many of the dishes had ingredients I've never had or heard of, the overall ""taste"" factor was only luke warm.   We had:- The pork belly with tofu and kimchee.  Very tasty but very similar to a Korean tofu stew.  - Garlic bread with buratta:  Salty version of a Chinese bun deep fried with cheese on top.  A bit too salty.- Pickles and smoked albacore spread with crostini:  The spread was very tasty.  Pickles were a bit strong and it had 2 pieces of fried pork skin that was really tasteless.- Smoked salmon and tomato&corn.  Mediocre- Green beans with seeds.  Probably the worst of the bunch.  Green beans were nice and crispy but they served it in a sour sauce with a sorts of seeds.  I did not care for the texture mix or the taste.- Fried eggplant:  Very good and unique.- Sweet corn pancakes:  Tasty and very savory.- State bird 1/2:  Their signature dish which is a deep fried quail served on top of some pickled veggies.  Not a lot of meat and not very good.  In terms of the food, at the end of the day, I just didn't find it to taste as good as all the 5-star reviews.  Most of the dishes were ok-good...just not great.Other than the food:  Service was mostly friendly.  We arrived at 6pm as walk-ins and got seated around 7.  They will text you when your table is ready so you can go wait somewhere else.Decor is very minimal and trendy.  Open kitchen.  Seems to be a draw for hipsters. So many reviews already I guess there isn't much I can add..highly reviewed on yelp and you can find so much written on this place..  I would say definitely try it out because this place makes eating fun and it doesn't hurt that the food is pretty good.This is basically a Dim Sum style/tapas/ hors d'oeuvres kinda place where you have an array of items (usually they say 13 things or so) passed around on trays and carts (average 5-9 dollars?). Then you have some things you can order off a selection from the menu (7-25 dollars but you can choose from half or full order).I loved the: sweet corn and chives pancakes (off the menu), the glazed pork ribs, pork belly w/kim cheeI could pass on the: oysters, seafood salsa, corn thing with salmon and oxtail curryWould of loved to try the: CA state bird with provisions (which I heard was what they are famous for?), cast iron eggs, burata garlic bread, peanut milk shot and ice cream sandwhich..I was too full already.I loved the concept of small plates parading through you because I felt I was able to try a little bit of everything...and that I was content.The place is super small with the open kitchen that greets you up front..it can be a bit crowded with the bar like sitting area surrounding the front open kitchen and people waiting along the side...I went in and was a bit lost to find the hostess.The staff were all warm and friendly..I felt very comfy and at home.This is probably not a good place for a romantic first date but definitely set a warm, casual, upbeat atmosphere if that's what you are looking for.  Great place with friends but maybe not a big group. The place overall is pretty small..I didn't really see any tables that could accommodate more than 4-6..I made a reservation about 3 weeks prior (the only time was I believe 9:30p.m.)...which I actually forgot about until they called me the day of.  I don't know how hard it is to make a reservation now..but I highly recommend it although I did see a lot of walk in's and the wait was about 20-30..but this was already close to closing time.  Since most people probably like to sit and linger longer for all the food to pass by..the turn around time for tables didn't seem fast because we were the 3rd to last seating for the night and only 2 tables left during dinner.  Anyways..make a reservation. However, this seems like a fun place if you were to eat solo..the bar area always looks festive as the kitchen is right there so it seems like there is always someone to chat with if you are feeling social.The pricing is very decent minus the 4 glasses of wine from our bill..the food total came out to be about 70 for 2 persons and we ordered about 6 things off the carts/trays and 2 things off the ""commandables"" menuI also found this recipe off Bon Appetit for the ribs...and I can't wait to try it at home.bonappetit.com/recipes/2… This was the most inspirational restaurant I have had the pleasure of eating at in (probably my whole life) - or a really really long time..... We ate here two nights in a row back to back bc the food was so outstanding and the atmosphere so inviting that we could not want to go to another place for dinner.  I didn't eat a thing that wasn't top notch.  Highlights included a halibut crudo with marinated peppers, cilantro, mint on a wafer thin house made cracker.  There was a burrata cheese garlic bread that was amazing, avocado mousse with poached seafood in house made tomato ""gazpacho"" kind of.....  duck liver mousse with a small almond savory financier ...  Oxtail in a multilayered curry was amazing with a crepe, sand dabs sautéed with hazelnuts and mandarin oranges,  I can go on for a while - we ate the whole menu in two days sans one or two dishes.  We even had some great desserts the second night we dined here, a peanut infused milk with moscavado syrup, some kind of chocolate Panna cotta 2x with passion fruit and a Japanese style cheesecake.  The service was great, super friendly and very attentive.  The kitchen staff were all great, extremely knowledgable, very attentive and helped serve, clear and make our food all whilst being extremely cool and having a good time while they worked.  I wish every restaurant could learn a lesson from these guys (the whole crew) bc this is what going out and sharing great food is all about.  State Bird - u guys rock! This is the best restaurant in San Francisco and I'm seriously considering taking a star off every other 5 star review. We had the Green Beans, Pickled Beets, Duck Liver, Pork Spare Ribs, Quinoa Albacore, Egg Guanciale, Fried Eggplant with Aioli, The State Bird, Burrata, Corn Pancakes, Japanese Cheese Cake and Double Chocolate Pudding. Ok, here we go:Green Beans. These were the best I've ever had. I could eat buckets of these. Perfectly crispy and lightly steamed. There was an amazing sauce that I dare not give away. Get this, it's perfect. Pickled Beets. What can you do with beats. Personally I hate beats but my GF said they were the best prepared she had ever had. Get this, it's perfect.Duck Liver. This is perfection. If you can handle the texture of liver this one is out of this world good. The tiny little muffins it comes with are great alone too, wow. Get this, it's perfect.Pork Ribs were so tender they just fall off the bone, not too tender but just perfect with just enough spice added as not to over power the meat, just right. Get this, it's perfect.Quinoa Albacore. This was so perfect. I'm coming back just for this and will likely have three orders, out of this world. Get this, its perfect and maybe the best thing we had. I say, ""maybe"" because everything was out of this world.Egg Guanciale. This is perfection. Get this.Fried Eggplant with Aioli. The Eggplant was pan fried to perfection. Totally amazing. Get this, it's perfect.The State Bird. We had to try it and you know what, it was wonderful. Just crispy and crunchy enough on the outside while still preserving all the juicy happiness on the inside. Cooked to perfect tender amazement for your taste buds. Get this, it's perfect.Burrata: This was the last thing we ordered before desert and it was too much food at this point but we couldn't stop. Think about it. What if we were never to come back? We had to try it. The cheese was marvelous and the bread was killer. Think pizza bread stick modified to the point where nothing else matters. Corn Pancakes: Outstanding! You have got to try these miniature masterpieces. Perfection. Japanese Cheese Cake: Every now and again you have a food that is so good it redefines the meaning, this was that food. The best Japanese Cheese Cake I've ever had. The tomatoes were perfect. Get this, it's perfect.Double Chocolate Pudding. I can't even put into words how amazing this was so please just try it. If you think you might like chocolate you will love this more than anything. Get this, it's perfect.The service was very nice, extremity fast with special request and vary attentive.TOTAL including nice tip: $145.5299.999% chance I will return. State Bird Provisions has received a lot of hype.  I was able to grab a walk-in table right when they first opened, but had to wait another month before I could make my second reservation!  But man, is it ever worth it.The food comes out on trays and carts.  Most of the time they rotate clockwise, once in a while they mix it up and go counterclockwise.  So, you want to sit in the middle column, closer to the front of the restaurant to get first dibs!  Of course, since the restaurant is in such high demand you are rarely able to choose your table.  If you're stuck in the back (like we were the second time) you can always creepily peer around at what other people are eating (no shame!) and ask your server about the dishes.  There's no rule that says you have to wait for the trays!My favorite dish here so far was only available the first visit - a potato puree.  I could describe it in words and it would not do it justice.  Everything was thoughtfully made.  My best suggestion would be to try everything that sounds good.  And everything will sound good - that's why they come in small plates! You can try everything!  (Don't forget the items only available by ordering off the menu).  The state bird is crispy and succulent, the garlic bread with burrata is fluffy and warm, the farro salad was refreshing with a surprising depth.Wine prices are very reasonable and start around $30/bottle. Why bother getting a $200/person tasting somewhere that will leave you feeling bloated and tired?  SBP really is a special experience that brings the tasting experience and so much more.  The options are brought around on trays, so you can pick and choose the things you want to have, as well as how many dishes you want to have.  Service is excellent and the quality of the food is extremely good. Oh was it worth the 90 minutes at Dosa to meet Stewart and his crew here. This is the new go to place and the line starts at the door at 4:30 and the open at 5:30. Was it worth it? Absolutely! If you can swing a seat at the bar go for it. The kitchen crew are awesome and you get first dibs on everything coming out of the kitchen. Check out the review in Bon Apetit magazine and get here as soon as you can. Thanks for dinner Reputation as a place for foodies well deserved.  Small plate approach with eclectic styles.   Asian influence on some dishes .  Others are new takes on the traditional.   Super friendly staff.  Like the dim sum approach to keeping track of what you eat.  Open kitchen design up front is a fun twist.  Reservation system is a bit harried.  You are likely to wait even with reservations.  Place is also loud.   Way too dim to really see what you are eating.  Just know that it all tastes good. I was here just before they got the Bon appetit honors and San Francisco was in full state bird love fest mood.  I was only in sf for a couple of dinners so needed to really maximize quality.  We ate at Mission Chinese the first night and here the next.  We were lucky enough to get a late reso and got there early eager for a great meal.  It is a great space with a long bar facing a busy open kitchen as you walk in. Chef Stuart saw me peaking around and greeted me before I got up to the main seating area.  He was warm and friendly even though obviously very busy.  We were seated right a way and our server came by to explain how the meal will work.  As our drinks were getting made, the food started flowing.  They ALL looked so good we said yes to almost all of them even though there were only three of us.  Spicy cold tofu salad, yummy, eggplant fries, delicious, but the state bird and savory fried giant ball of dough topped with burrata?  Nothing like I have ever eaten before and I ate at the French Laundry three night before that.  We finished with the ice cream sandos and grilled pound cake which were the perfect ending to a very unique and lovely meal.  I don't think this concept will fly in Vancouver (I can already hear the hmming and hawing and the miserable server holding the tray full of food getting cold, shooting daggers from his/her eyes) but will definitely come back here next time in SF.  The chef really personified the warmth and genuineness of the place as he actually bothered to turn and thank us with a giant smile as we left.  One doesn't get that kind of personal touch anywhere anymore. This is arguably the best restaurant in San Francisco, and one of the best across the country. The gourmet preparations are extraordinary. The method of service of the eclectic variety of small plates is innovative, and the tastes are one wonder after another. Stuart, the cooks, the service, notably Megan, were gracious and warm.We will be frequent visitors...Enjoy This place is an amusement park for your taste buds! Oh did we have fun saying yes to the plates as they passed by on the rolly carts. And the server was not hesitant to help us as foodie noobs. A great experience, but likely a yearly one, since the price for two was well into the triple digits. I didn't realize what a huge deal this restaurant is when I made my reservation.  I called less than a week in advance and they had one available.  I guess I got lucky!  There was a  line of people waiting for a walk-in table almost the entire time we were there.Our waitress was awesome.  The concept of the dim sum style carts/ trays is genius.  A smart way for the restaurant to stack up a bill very quickly - every time something came out, we grabbed it!  The carts/trays were not consistent, however.  For some time there would be a flurry of food coming around and then for a long period of time there would be a lull where we were waiting for more food to come out.  Would be nice if there was a steady flow of food coming out.PROVISIONS:Oysters = Topped with something that reminded me of sauerkraut.  2 stars.blackberry marinated beets with goat cheese = 5 starsguinea hen dumplings with aromatic broth = 3 stars.  Yelp, you deceived me!  Yes I expected 2 tiny dumplings so I was not surprised by the small size but I also expected 2 tiny dumplings of amazing, which I did not get.  They were good but wasn't crazy about them.marvel stripe tomato with sweet corn, smoked salmon = 3 starsduck liver mousse with almond biscuit = 10 STARS.  AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING.  I could eat plates and plates of this by myself.  The biscuit is extremely buttery and the mousse is like eating a delicious, livery cloud.haricot verts, pickled-egg salad, nuts & seeds = 3 starsgarlic bread with burrata = 2 stars.  Most unspectacular of them all!  Where was the garlic?haas avocado with seafood 'salsa' = 4 stars.  Plump, fresh seafood, perfectly cookedkimchi-pork belly with tofu = 2 stars.  Pork belly was very tender and well cooked but this was basically a fancy version of kimchi jjigae... eating this made me want to go home and make my own (better and tastier) kimchi jjigae.sweet corn & garlic chive ""shortstack"" with mt. tam = 4 starschanterelle ""PANtatin"" cured pork jowl, candy cap topped with crispy mustard greens = 2 stars.  Smelled very sweet like maple but didn't taste sweet.  Interesting!  Unfortunately it only tasted ok.COMMANDABLES:CA state bird with provisions = 3 stars.  Fried quail on top of a bed of pickled vegetables.  Not quite sure what they were.  Definitely get the full size.  If you know what a quail is, then you know how small the bird is.oxtail curry, bok choy, french crepes = 4 stars.cast iron pullet eggs, bread salad & tomato with guanciale = 3 stars.DESSERT:cheesecake japonaise, griddled figs in sherry &honey = 4 starschocolate mint ice cream sandwich, raspberries = 3 stars'world peace' peanut muscovado milk shot = 5 stars.  Tastes like a liquid Snickers bar!Include 2 bottles of wine.  Total bill about $300 for 4 people.  (But as you can see we did kind of go all out...)OVERALL:  This was a strong 3.5 stars for me.  I loved the concept and our waitress was great.  However since Yelp doesn't allow half stars, I am rounding down to 3 stars because I don't have a desire to return.  I think it is definitely worth a try and I will certainly consider coming back when the menu changes. apparently, this is a hard restaurant to get a reservation at.... but they do talk walk-in's if you're lucky enough to come at the right time. The space is small, so if u have reservations, u still might have to wait, and there is no room in the restaurant for u to stand and wait.the concept is a bit like dim sum.... lots of small plates to share, some of which come around on a cart, and some you can order off of a menu.  HIGHLIGHTS of dinner were the State Bird dish, named after the restaurant.  it is in fact the State bird of California - the quail.... which i found a little funny that we were actually eating it. but damn, was it DELICIOUS.  it was crispy fried, and moist.  get this!! also, the seafood salsa was amazing.  bits of fish, scallop, squid, avacado and tomato, all mixed up, and eaten with blue corn chips.  really, really good! the eggplant dish was so-so, the shiitake mushroom dumpling was so-so, but the broth it was in was really good, and the pate with corn cakes were meh.  there were lots more dishes (we almost tried the entire menu), but those were the ones i remembered..... the menu changes frequently! non-alcoholic drinks i tried were the peach and white balsamic soda (delicious), and the dragon eyes iced tea (okay).  they also have a selection of wines and beers. the servers are very helpful, and pretty nice.  one server in particular was amazing, but i didn't catch his name.  he's got close shaved hair, and was very nice.  he even gave us a plate of oysters on him!!   great guy!also, if you tell any server (everybody is your server here....) that you're celebrating a birthday, they bring you a little dessert with a candle.  no embarrassing singing, just a nice dessert :) We got super excited, place has a very good vibe when you walk in, staff gives you this warm welcome. An interesting concept with Dim sum service and the ability to order off the menu as well.  I think a lot of restaurants will use this style going forward. - vibe of the restaurant is really good, you can do a walk in if you don't mind waiting an hour or so but luckily there are plenty of places around the corner to get a drink and wait and they will call you. A really nice option as lots of folks are walking in.- Ability to sample lots of small plates is great. but most of the dishes were good but not amazing. - LImited Vegetarian options or just greens in general - but if you want lots of meat this place might be for you. All we could find is s small beat salad and sweet corn cakes. Once again  good but not anything amazing.  - The couple next to us said the best part was the desert and I think they had the same experience - these mini ice cream sandwiches which I would have to agree.  - Service overall was beyond dreadful. While they have a ton of staff there no one knows what anyone is doing. We waited for drinks, water, ordering throughout the whole night. Where it really ruined the night. That is why they get 2 stars vs. 3. I think the food is 3.5 stars but the service was 2. - Overall a fun place, good look, food is good but not amazing. and service was luckily something they can fix in the future. Came here and literally ate like 20 dishes.Very unique. American dim sum with a twist!I love the idea of random small dishes coming around and you just picking whatever you want. I would say they have no more than small tables, so make your reservations!A few of the dishes were just alright, but most of them were unique and tasted superb!Customer service was great. Would be great to come back, if I can get a seat. Hipster Credit: My friend and I made our reservations BEFORE the Bon Appetit announcement.Now that that's settled, onto the restaurant. State Bird Provisions provides a dim sum style service with creative and rotating food. I'm actually surprised that the service model of SBP hasn't been picked up on before, as it seems so.. intuitive. The layout itself is very interesting, almost like a bakery. You are greeted by the kitchen and a long bar, which is pretty unique (unless you're used to Buca di Beppo.). However, there really isn't anyone to 'greet' you, and there isn't a traditional place for a host. In fact, there seems to be so much bustle, I wasn't quite sure who was my host. Making your way past the bar is where the small but not too cozy dining space. I suppose the need to keep aisle space clear for a cart of food gives you a bit more personal space than many other SF restaurants offer. You are encouraged to order a few things from the a la carte menu, and then pick from the dishes that rotate throughout the cart. My friend and I ordered the Chive/Garlic Short Stack and Pullet Eggs in a Castiron pan from the menu, and the rest from rotating carts. I will say that one server in particular took note that I was a vegetarian, and made sure to entice me with particular veggie friendly options, including roasted beets, mini mushrooms and the burrata. One potential negative is that dishes are quite small, and you can often get glazed over for seconds, unless you make a special request. I don't think there was one dish that was AMAZING, but I have to give the restaurant credit for keeping originality alive. Rarely, if ever, does an institution move into SF embracing a forthcoming legacy like State Bird Provisions.Humble shades from the owners and a distinct ethic of allowing the food to thrive leaves guests of this establishment leaving with a sense of wonder. Imaginative, thoughtful, and integrative - the full circle experience at State Bird is one of a kind.We arrived at the early onset of dinner, around 6, mid week and found stools at the bar. The absolute best seats in the house. Front row to the 10 digit wizards.State Bird Provisions is a modern take on dim sum. Small dishes pirouette through the down to earth interior leaving you with a constant strain in your neck. Arriving hungry will leave your first few minutes loading your table like a carb to a diet.Highlights:The fried garlic bread with warm burrata is decadent. Every piece of warm dough clings to the healthy portion of burrata which nests in the middle of the dish as the diva.The duck liver mousse with almond biscuits were a perfect in between. Rich and eloquent, the mousse has a back of the mind saltiness that allows you to truly appreciate the miniature biscuits.We couldn't miss the namesake of the establishment, so a half order of the State Bird was easily ordered. Crisp, well portioned, and a finger fighting plate.Came in with very little expectations, but left knowing that one of the best meals in San Francisco can still be affordable, organic, and up to par with the heavy hitters within the walls of our 7x7 city.By far one of the best restaurants in San Francisco. Go. Eat. Enjoy. my friend and i came for dinner last night, and it was great.  i've been wanting to try it but didn't make a reservation, so i was worried that the wait would be horrendous.  the place is tiny, so there's not really any space to wait.  the host told us that the wait would be about 30+ minutes, so we went to fat angel around the corner for a drink first.we came back, got another drink and still had to wait another 45 minutes or so before getting seated.  luckily we came early, so by the time we sat down to eat, it wasn't too late.to start, the chef gave us some eggplant fries that were delicious.  we seriously ordered everything in sight.  we got the ribs, beef cheeks, salmon, corn pancakes off the menu.  we also got a couple items off the cart.   i was STUFFED by the end of it, but we still had room for chocolate pudding.  luckily the pudding wasn't that big.  my fave dishes of the night were the beef cheeks and ribs.  if you can come w/ more people, then you can try more things.  i like that you can order small or large sizes of dishes so that you can get a taste of everything!"|5|100|0|Routine|This inspection has no violations.|GOOD: no inspection needed
State Bird Provisions 3|4.5|Tapas/Small Plates in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|1051|3|4.184523809523809|" Restaurants of the moment are like farts in the wind: one must be at the right place at the right time to experience their essence. I found it auspicious that Bon Appetite magazine declared State Bird Provisions their restaurant of the year for 2012 and that I happened to be binging my way through the San Francisco restaurant scene.I was not at all daunted by my lack of reservations and you shouldn't be either, unless of course you insist on dining with your coven of foodie friends - Provisions is a tiny restaurant and due to the present buzz getting a seat here will necessitate a lot of planning or a lot of waiting.  I chose to wait, not in the cramped space along the wall, but at Yoshi's down the street enjoying some smooth jazz and bubbly.  The text from the courteous host came much sooner than promised and when I arrived back at Provisions I was promptly seated at the counter.This seating arrangement, which overlooks the open kitchen and the energy and élan of the chefs engaging in their mesmerizing sautéing, grilling, and assembling, can best be described as cozy.  One has no choice but to engage with your neighbors since there is literally no elbow room between diners; hopefully you will be seated next to someone that is equally as engaging as you are.  The small dining room is quite spare and rather boring, the furniture modish and predictable, and the tables nearly as closely spaced as the uncomfortable steel stools which ring the kitchen, and upon one of which my large ass was installed.So why put up with all this nonsense?  The food of course - the impressive, outstanding, brilliant food! OMFG! Yes I am too old for that type of tweeny lingo, but it encapsulates my reaction for what was one of the best meals I've indulged in this year.  The food is sophisticated without being at all pretentious; don't expect engineering marvels which try to emulate leaning towers of food sculpture or Pollock like squiggles of sauce dribbled across plates meant to suggest cleverness and elegance.  Rather the elegance and refinement come from the taste sensations in each bite.  Don't get me wrong, the visual appeal is all there too, but the flavors and the aromas are what distinguish and elevate the food.The way Provisions works is also intriguing.  One can order from the menu but even more exciting is the constantly changing little dishes which are enticingly paraded in front of you by roaming servers on trays or carts where you get to pick and choose which dish most appeals; the only anxiety you will have is that they all will.  These little bites are packed with flavor sensations that will please and challenge your taste buds and blow away any assumptions you may have previously had of what it means to dine at a temple of haute gastronomy.  This style of eating is fun, casual and allows one to sample a wide variety of dishes.I loved the quail, which is described on the menu as the CA state bird with provisions. Yes it is fried, which of course means that I would automatically love it, but it had such a wonderful crunchy bread crumb coating that remained crisp and it was topped with shaved parm; wow this little birdy of a dish really does sing.  Next up, the Guinea Hen dumplings with aromatic broth; wow, just wow! Two little raviolis stuffed with the meat of another bird and then at the last second the server pours over the most astonishing broth of preserved Meyer lemon and over 30 other aromatic herbs and spices.  I can't even describe it; you just have to get it.  I dropped my spoon and lifted my bowl to slurp up the last remaining drop of this heavenly elixir.  To me, the most revelatory dish of the evening.  Then the cumin lamb with scallions, grapes and zucchini. The arrangement was of shaved lamb, like a gyro, but with the juiciness still intact and the flavors of the Mediterranean out front for my enjoyment.  The lamb was sautéed with delicate zucchini, which was still in its fledgling state with several buds of the flowers just about to bloom.  Delicious.I couldn't stop, so I ordered one of the pancakes. Again the description defies what is delivered.  The menu reads as follows: local boquerones, yeasted-sesame pancake, crème fraîche.  What you get is the freshest of anchovies on top of a curiously, light and fluffy sesame covered bready round shaped disc.  Oh yeah, there are slivered radishes atop as well - this is not an afterthought but a textural foil for the rest of the composition. I did have dessert too; I ordered the double chocolate pudding with plums and birdseed crunch.  The plums were served atop the pudding and were a tart counterpoint to the sweet pudding underneath.  Off to the side was the crunch - a chocolate treat reminiscent of a thin rice crispy treat with a nice crunch to it and a lot of chocolate flavor and a textural contrast to the smoothness of the pudding.Stuffed and happy. Thank you State Bird Provisions. I look forward to your next restaurant. Giving this four stars only because I've tried just a few of the menu items. It might very well be a five.Stopped by on a whim late on a Saturday night and got on the list for the chef's counter. Was told it was a three-hour wait. This was just a few days after the Bon Appetit coverage, so I was very surprised that the wait turned out to be only 30 minutes.The chef's counter is where it's at. This restaurant being what it is, the chefs, who double as order takers, are all hip and pretty, and are happy to answer questions about the dishes you're eyeing. They were a little pushy with the special, but did it in a way that I felt bad for them that I didn't want to try the gigantic sardine.Had the green garlic bread with burrata, which will make all other garlic breads disappoint me for the rest of my life. The eponymous bird was awesome but small; next time, I'll get the whole order instead of the half.You go here for the food and the experience. The concept will continue to be copied (they're certainly not the first ""western dim sum"" place), but if they continue to keep the menu inventive, they'll do just fine. 'Sophisticated Dim Sum'I'm a huge fan of the dim sum model that State Bird Provisions is using. They also have a menu which you can order various small plates from. However, what makes this establishment far beyond a tapas style restaurant is that there is a 'cart' going around where you can pick various dishes from. They simply mark what you pick from the 'carts', and everything is pretty straight forward.The overall offering at State Bird is really well rounded and makes you feel that have the ability to enjoy an incredibly diverse range of dishes. The pork and faroe with egg was meaty and delicious. We also really enjoyed the tuna crudo, as well as the tomato w/corn and smoked salmon salad. Our only 'issue' and it was really not a complaint by any means was regarding the ribs and the lamb. The lamb could have been a little bit more tender, and the ribs possibly a little less fatty. That being said, they were so well flavored and accompanied by such tasty ingredients that it was really not a big issue for me. I highly recommend this place for a date or a SMALL group.  It's a fun and refreshing experience and there is such a variety of small plates that any picky eater can find something to satisfy their pallets. Also, I felt that it was a very reasonably priced business model. Each plate is 6-10$ and 2 people can easily get full on 4 plates.This place is fairly small and cozy, so don't plan on showing up here with a 10 top anytime soon!PS- 5 STARS FOR THE FRIENDLY STAFF!!. Even the chefs smile and greet you upon entering! Treating guests in such personable fashion and not trying to be some dis-attached 'foody expert' with patrons is something that can be hard to find at times. I had somewhat high anxiety for a number of reasons -#1.  Securing an online reservation took several attempts. Tip: I made it on a Monday for Friday at 5:30pm of same week.  Wide open.  Lots of times to choose from.#2.  We arrived at 5:30pm when it opened to find a line stretching 20 people deep.  Mixed of folks with/without reservations.  Very confusing. We had to jump past some folks to reach the host.  Finally sat down at 5:50 pm.  I apologize if I inadvertently cut in front of anyone who also had a 5:30 pm reservation.#3.  Once seated, waited again before our server came over.  She explained the dim sum concept and the boarded items.  She took our drink orders and then we waited some more to see what might come by.I like how the dim sum concept has been westernized.  Carts or trays of small plates. You can yay or nay to any item.  The price of each plate is identified so no surprises.  Pros - 1) fun. 2) various food items; freedom to select or not from carts and trays.  3) the ability to order off the menu also.  This is where the state bird offering is.  4) fresh seasonal items 5) yin and yang food ingredients.Cons - 1) an item may not reach your table so then you have to wait to see if it'll come around again during your dining interval. 2) The haphazard check in process at 5:30pm when the place opens.  I know folks w/o reservations are trying to get one of the counter seats but it's organized chaos.We were very pleased with everything we consumed.  The hightlight was the state bird = quail.  We started with 1/2; then order another 1/2 later on. The second time was better cuz we knew what to expect.Nice service.  Friendly staff.$82.00 food and drinks before tax and tip. Amazing food, great visual feast for the eyes and stomach.  LOVED being able to see, pick and choose items as they come by freshly prepared.  Great service.  All of the staff are amazing, kind, friendly and talented. Walked in on a Wed night around 6pm and was lucky to nab a table for 2 right away (after that a line started forming).  Wait staff was very attentive, kept refilling our water and wine and making sure we had everything we needed.  Food I remember and enjoyed: fried bread w/ burrata, avocado w/ seafood salsa, marinated beets and goat cheese,  duck liver mousse w/ almond biscuits, salmon and roasted corn dish, and tuna crudo.  There were a couple more dishes, but I cant remember them, so prob not worth the mention.  We also had a bottle of grenache.  After tax/tip, we spent about $55 pp and were stuffed. Never got around to ordering from the plated menu because the carts were intriguing enough.      Very memorable experience because of the service and the fact that we didnt have to wait hours to eat (as is many people's experiences).  Bummed we were too stuffed to try some of the desserts since the Yelp photos make them look amazing.  Just means I'll have to go back. Fancy Schmancy hipster cuisine. 3.5 starsItems ranged from super amazing (the burrata thing) to not memorable (sorry can't recall :))It was good for a-go but I'm not likely to return unless my husband wants to go (he really enjoyed the food.)The state bird with provisions was good not great and was a small portion although we paid for a large size. Quail is a small bird though...Oh, it took about a month for us to get a reservation for a Thursday night! I did see some people walk-in though.Service was very good. After trying to get in after a show at Yoshi's (Fail), I was finally able to get back and grab a bite.Maybe it's because I was by myself, I found that the service was especially attentive.  I let them know that I wanted to try the qual (State bird with Provisions), and anything else was up in the air.I ended up with 7 item (hey, it's like a tasting menu.  Just better)The quail was really good, as was the cornish hen dumplings.  The farro risotto with farm egg was good, but maybe had one too many ingredients to wow.  They had local sardines (from the day's salmon catch), that was perfect over the potato salad.  The Salmon, corn and heirloom tomato salad, seemed simple but was really tasty!I was going to forego dessert but was told that I really should try the cheesecake japonaise with sherry fis and honey.  At first I figured this was another ""you're trying too hard"" dish, but then I had a bite.  This was perfect.  The cheesecake was light.  The figs weren't too sweet and there was a sprinkling of black sesame seeds over it to give it a hint  of savoriness.  I aslo got the world peace peanut milk.  Okay, it's $2 and it tastes like peanut butter + milk.  If that's your thing, you'll love it.Overall, I think I had two of the line cooks come over and tell me about the food (that's why I ordered som much, I'm sure) and even people that weren't waiting on me were chatting with me (and they had much better things to do).They also have an organization and sincerity, that another restaurant that was on Bon Appetite's list last year (that's in the Mission that serves Chinese Food).  This was a much better overall experience.Make sure to save me a seat at the bar! I do not understand the hype.  The food was somewhat (emphasize SOMEWHAT) good.  It should be amazing if you have to make reservations 3 months in advance.  Some items we ate (that I can remember):- duck liver mousse with almond biscuit- 2 of the pancakes- griddled sweet corn cake, nectarines, peach leaf cream- double chocolate pudding, birdseed crunch, plums Savory,creative provisions. The concept is unique ,the  dishes  truly palate awakening. MUST TRY ITEMS: Try everything :) Bon Appetit named it Restaurant of the Year 2012!  We got to try it before that announcement when it was named One of the Top 50 American Restaurants of 2012!We got there about 5:40pm on a Sat without reservations, the late was 1.5hr, but we were willing to wait this time.  Get your name on their list & they will send you a text & you gotta call them back to let them know you want the table or not.Since we didn't have reservations we got seated at the Chef's Counter - those are for walk-in only.  Stuart, owner, told us to get reservations to call the day you want to go between 2-5pm, maybe they'll be cancellations.There's some dishes on the menu that you have to ask to be made to order, other dishes are on carts or carried on trays.We tried:mendocino sea urchin, ginger, scallion pancake, soy-lime $12 - pancakes with sea urchin on top.  We liked it fine.Cucumber & stuff I can't remember $5 - okCold tofu, cucumber dish $5 - oklamb dumplings - 2 little dumplings in broth $7 (?) - okSalmon & other stuff that looked like cevichePeach pit soda $3 - nothing specialFried quail half order $8 - B. liked it, I took a taste & found it ok, juicy.Green beans, egg salad, crunchy stuff on top $6 (?) - fineSeafood dish w/ chips $9 (?) - B. likes seafood & liked the dish.World Peace Peanut Milk Dessert Shot $2 - tastyDouble chocolate pudding & crunch dessert $8 - tastyOur total before tip $75.95.  Charged it.Make Reservations!  It's The Hottest Restaurant NOW!State Bird Provisions1529 Fillmore St, SF415-795-1272statebirdsf.comHrs: Closed SunM-Th 5:30-10; Fri & Sat 5:30-11 Lives up to the name 100%.  As in, if you like your provisions to be the size that the state bird likely consumes, you will love this place.  - Dim sum style service (although if you peer at the same dish passing by twice, a snarky waitress might just say to you ""you already saw that"", with no accompanying ""would you like another?"")- Quail was exquisitely done, but to say that the portion size was made for sharing is laughable.- Guinea fowl dumpling... fantastic.  Again, ridiculously small portion.  We're talking 2 wee little dumplings here, people.  For $6.  Or was it $9?- They overcharged us for the wine.Left wishing a slice of pizza was on the dessert list.  Won't be back... it would be equivalent to lighting camp fires with $20 bills. One of the best new restaurants that has opened in the City in a long time! State Bird provides a great California-Italian fusion style food in a dim sum format, with amazing service to boot. The dim sum format allows people who love to try everything a chance to do so. The burrata dishes were delicious, pickled beets to die for, and the ravioli so good we special ordered it on our second visit. The service is excellent and they even remembered us from our first visit, including our wine order. This type of customer service is always so refreshing. The only drawback is the reservation system, but for this place I am willing to deal with it. Cloistered in a narrow restaurant space lining Fillmore Street, State Bird Provisions flies high above the San Francisco restaurant scene. They attack your palate with small offerings provided dim sum style as carts and trays pass by your table allowing you to see what they're cooking up that night before committing to it. A couple dishes are offered a la carte including a rotating selection of seasonal pancakes (sweet corn & garlic chive shortstack with Mt. Tam cheese, yes please!) and larger ""commandables."" I took a cautious approach with my dinner at State Bird Provisions as I wanted to make sure I didn't miss out on anything fantastic. The first thing I pulled off a tray was the warm burrata and garlic bread as the creamy burrata was softly melting over a warm, fluffy cloud of garlic bread. This dish remained to be one of my favorites through the night. Everything else I had was really good and several times I thought about pulling another serving of something off of the tray the next time it came by only to be intrigued by another offering. The wait staff was also very attentive even given the style to make sure we were seeing enough things, to ask us about our preferences, and to make sure we didn't want anything else sent out. We closed out with a dessert of a pumpkin seed cake and a peanut muscovado milk shot. If you like peanut butter desserts get the milk shot, it's delicious and a perfect pairing with something else that only sets you back another $2. The creative experience and superb culinary execution makes State Bird Provisions a definite star and worthy of multiple trips especially given the rotating menu and options. Have you heard?  BIRD IS THE WORD... ;)I came here after yelping for new places in SF and from two friends'  recommendations.  The name is cute and catchy. Let me tell you - what a great experience!!! I brought my friend Grace here after work and we luckily made reservations. There was already a long line in front before opening at 6pm. The atmosphere is cute and staff is very friendly. The concept is dim sum style where you pick what you want from trays and carts as well as order from a set menu for other items.We had the ""State Bird Provision"" (deep fried quail leg over a bed of luscious lemony onions), a couple of Kumamoto oysters, seared salmon salad with sweet white corn, potato chips with chicken liver crudo, the sweet corn & garlic chive shortstack pancake with Mt. Tam cream (yum!), seared veggies with roasted nuts and a creamy dressing, a garlic bread puff with melted mozzarella, and an almond ice cream sandwich between chocolate nibbles cookies dressed with the sweetest currants. OMG!!! As my buddy Greg would say... De-Frickin-Licious! :D We also had two glasses of the Nero D'Avola rose, which were perfect. This is my new favorite restaurant! Given the enormous press recognition State Bird has received and the plethora of Yelp reviews, I'm not sure how much I can add, so I'll limit my review to some general musings and tips. (The food, service, and experience was all very good, as evinced by my five star rating.)1. Yes reservations are extremely difficult, but with patience, time, and the ability to be spontaneous, they are quite possible.  For two days straight, I refreshed the reservation page throughout the day and noticed that same-night reservations would occasionally pop up as people cancel.  The second day, a prime time 7:30 spot opened up and I jumped on it.2. I wouldn't get the quail again.  I've had similar type fried quail at other restaurants, and the one here really is not that unique or remarkable.  I definitely understand trying it--it is the restaurant's namesake after all--but there are enough other interesting things to try that I would stay away from the state bird next time.3. Prices are quite reasonable.  The NY times article suggested $70 for two people, sans-alcohol and tip.  Gf and I were ""stuffed"" after $40 pre-tip and sans alcohol.  I say ""stuffed"" because we managed to fit some bi-rite ice cream in us afterwards, but we definitely were very full. 4. The food that is ordered from the regular menu (not dim-sum style) takes a while to prepare.  Order them early so you won't be sitting around waiting for them and wondering how much more of the small plates to order!5. Why did it take so long for a dim-sum styled Western restaurant? So it sounds like I'm a bit of a naysayer relative to many others. Not to say I didn't like it - I did. But it wasn't good enough, in my opinion, to warrant the hype and the difficulty of getting a reservation.  But part of that feeling stems from my not really liking the dimsum format. I really wish all the evenings offerings were listed so I'd know what was coming/available and what to wait for. Without that it's too easy to fill up too fast and regret doing so. We saw things I think we would preferred after it was too late. At least with dimsum you know what's available - here you have no idea. The menu is literally given to you in pieces.  Yeah, it's definitely a different approach, and that's often very cool. But I would much prefer to know all the options before deciding. I will try to go again with my BF who's a much bigger eater (doesn't fill up as quickly) in hopes of trying more and finding more things to love. We had five items: loved two, liked two and didn't like one. I don't think that's a great score for a place that so many say is THE BEST and is hard to get into. Service was fantastic. Atmosphere was good - we sat at the bar which was great. Wine list is cool. Wish they had cocktails. I had heard a lot of buzz about this place and its ""Western dim sum"" schtick.  However, all that matters to me is the food.  SF has a lot of great restaurants so standards are pretty high for something both original and tasty - this place is both.My favorite savory dishes were the ""short stack"" of corn pancakes and the farro/pork belly/pickles, but our cocoa nib/basil ice cream sandwiches capped off the night perfectly.  The other dishes we had were really good as well - and all were not like any other dishes I've had anywhere else.Can't wait to come again. It took us weeks to get in - but mostly because we had to keep changing our dinner reservation for scheduling issues.  So, when we finally went on a Wednesday night - it was with some pent up expectations.Happily, we were NOT disappointed.When we arrived we were warmly greeted by the owner Stuart and his staff and were seated within just a couple of minutes.  The place is small, but hustling and with just the right amount of chatter (energetic but not so loud you have to shout to be heard).We didn't order anything off the fixed menu (not deliberately), just because we were tempted by too many of the dim sum-style, tapas sized dishes that were being shuttled down the aisle by the wait staff.Though all the dishes passed the good threshold - not all of them were standouts or dishes I would order again (as I will definitely be heading back).  The top dishes were the almond biscuits with duck liver mousse (heavenly and so rich), the mouth-watering guinea hen dumplings in an incredibly aromatic broth (this was my favorite dish), the homemade potato chips and truffle aioli, and the  glazed pork ribs with spigarello & togarashi - this last item we didn't actually order - as it's on the menu - but our server had a gut feeling we would like it, and did we!  The meat was super tender, juicy and the seasoning was delectable and reminiscent of cardamon.The other dishes we had were the garlic puff bread and burrata (loved the cheese, but was not impressed with the bread), a scallop, salsa dish and a saute of mushrooms, eggplant, dahl & cauliflower.Oh, and before I forget - don't share dessert - we ordered the double chocolate pudding with pecan crunch and were fighting over the portion.  It was fabulous! Sweet, luscious and perfectly chocolate.Go, sample and enjoy! Wow. My new favorite restaurant. It's all about the food. Had such a great meal and when we got the bill we were shocked. One hundred bucks for two with six beers! I haven't been that happy for that little. We felt a little bit guilty for offering so little what what we got. Wow. Brilliant!  Stuart and his crew shine in this place, serving up remarkable little servings of top-notch gourmet cuisine in the passed-plates style of Chinese dim sum!  Dishes change daily except for ""commandables"" like quail and ribs, which are not to be missed!Reservations are hard to get even a week in advance, and due to the small size they won't take parties larger than four.  There are 10 walk-in seats, for which the line forms a good 20 minutes before opening.  But it's worth the wait!  Welcome to my new favorite restaurant! Loves:-Interior of the restaurant; it's small, but they do a lot with the space and manage to make it feel comfortable and inviting. -Service is very friendly. Sitting in front of the prep kitchen was pretty awesome.-The concept of dim sum with California cuisine. It's a great idea since it gives you the opportunity to try a bunch of different dishes, which allows you to perhaps try things you wouldn't have tried before.-Eggplant: This dish was great balancing game. There was a balance between the soft, mushy interior texture of eggplant and the crispy fried panko? (I'm guessing) bread crumbs on the exterior as well as a balance between sweet, acid, smoky, and savory flavors. -CA state bird: Probably the best preparation of quail that I've had. Previous forays into quail have resulted in poor attempts to eat a stringy, tough to eat bird. This quail was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.-Corn pancake: I am a sucker for sweet corn. Pancakes were very yummy. I am a bit regretful that I didn't try more of them.Dislikes:-Pork belly with kimchi and tofu: Pork belly was tough and overcooked :( . The tofu actually tasted better than the pork belly. I did like the kimchi'd strawberry they had though. -Seafood salsa: Seafood was bland, salsa was nothing to write home about.Okay:-Duck liver mousse: Mousse was smooth and pleasant tasting and wasn't too grainy or metallic tasting the way that liver can be. I really liked the little almond cakes they had with it.-Steak tartare: Good, but not great.I had initially written this reviews as 3 stars, but after recalling every dish that I ate, I remembered that I actually enjoyed the majority of things and so I bumped up my review one star. I think my issue was that I left the restaurant feeling a little unsatisfied, a little underwhelmed. I think I might have been expecting too much in that I wanted every dish to blow me out of the water. I think I was also expecting a bigger variety of dishes to come out via the dim sum carts, but realistically, this is difficult to do considering the cuisine. Food: 4.25Experience: 5 (who doesn't like Dim Sum California food!)Price point: 3.5Overall worthwhile and would return. A fun place for a group to come and partake in an interactive dining experience. The advantage of the dim sum, tapas style is that instead of only tasting a couple dishes off an a la carte menu you get to try 10 or so dishes of smaller portions! Although I think my stomach would have allowed me to try 15 or 20 dishes but my wallet not so much. For that price I would rather do a tasting menu elsewhere.Highlights (5 star dishes) included the Buratta, Fried Eggplant, Marinated Tofu, and PuddingPretty solid dishes (3.5-4 star) were the pancake, quail (although overpriced at $16), and cumin lamb (not as tender and seasoned as I hoped), and ice cream sandwichWord is bon (appetit) Everything has been covered in previous reviews, dim sum/tapas, small creative dishes, and friendly staff. So here's what I had:Garlic Bread with Burrata: Total Heaven. Divine. Perfect.Guinea Hen Dumplings with Aromatic Broth: MehFancy Fried rice with quail egg: YummySalmon Tartar: So-SoCalamari squid lobster thing: No CommentCA State Bird with Provisions: Pretty Damn Good. At State Bird Provision seasonal ingredients are used to create California cuisine served in Dim Sum style. I love the concept, and was impressed by the flavors of the food and quality of the ingredients. I ordered the salmon salad, curry lamb, dumplings, steak tar tar, a farro salad ranging from $5 to $13 and had the nectarine and beets for desert ($3). The food was not warm enough for my taste when served from the cart but when ordered from the menu and delivered by the cooking staff was perfect. The well lit restaurant is brightly decorated with flowers and extremely loud. Something really should be done about the acoustics of the room. I had trouble hearing my friends and the staff had trouble hearing me. State Bird Provisions was amazing! It is like gourmet california dim sum. We tried everything on the cart and each bite was as unique and flavorful as the next. The duck liver mouse, garlic bread with burrata, the pancakes, the state bird provision (quail), the cast iron mushrooms etc. etc....ALL SO GOOD! The restaurant has great ambiance and excellent service. What more could a hungry girl ask for?! Couple of dishes were ok.  But most were too salty or greasy.  Restaurant is very loud due to the concrete everywhere.  They don't do the state bird any justice. Any place south of Geary on Fillmore takes some doing for me, but this place is worth the trip.  Consistent with other reviews, the food carries the day here: interesting, delicious bites to share, passed around dim-sum style.  The food pricing is appropriate, leaving enough flexibility to really sample what the kitchen is up to that day.Highlights for me were the lightly fried eggplant and the mashed potatoes.  The mains we had (pork ribs, signature quail) were strong, but I think I enjoyed the novelty of the sampling more.  Save room for desert too.  Some real thought went into this place top to bottom.Two knocks.  First, the space, which is far too narrow upfront to accommodate the consistant traffic and bar-style seating. Second, the wine list, which on our visit lacked both sub-$40 options and local representation.  To be fair, I'm touchy about SF restaurants that local source everything from their beef to their butter, but utterly fail to sample from the rich, local viniculture.   Harumph! Very solid spot, and surprisingly reasonably priced as 3 of us went, ordered quite a bit, had one drink apiece, and the bill ended up being about $40 per person with 20% tip..  Everyone was friendly and attentive and more than happy to help you with whatever you needed.  I hadn't read any reviews, and didn't really know what to expect.  Turns out it's a small plates type place serving a broad range of california ingredient driven cuisine drawing influence from several different cultures, served on carts that are wheeled around the cozy dining room much like a dim sum place.  The service style certainly adds to the fun factor, and as with any good restaurant, the dish descriptions were equally fun and alluring.  My personal favorites of the evening were the eggplant fried with sungolds and pimenton and the potato, porcini, and hazelnut.  OOH - don't forget the guinea hen dumplings with aromatic broth.  My least favorite dish was the spareribs as they were ok, but a bit charred for my taste (and $20 for 4 spare ribs is a bit ridiculous).Overall a very nice experience and a place that I'd be happy to return to. charming people walking around with pretty trays and carts of small tapas plates is glorified dimsum. it is not a novel concept. now that that's out of the way...i had been wanting to try this place for a long time because i had heard so many great things about it, but i really don't see what the hype is all about (although i DO love that they have a lot of creative dishes made with fresh and organic ingredients). the dishes were kind of hit or miss - they either had little flavor or tons of it. the service was also painfully slow. i honestly didnt know who our table's server was and we had to keep asking for more water and had to ask several times about the tea we had ordered. This place was amazing... definitely a place you should take out of town visitors. I can't remember anything being subpar. The pate was amazing and prepared very differently than what I'm used to. I know their signature was the quail and it was pretty good, but I preferred the smaller dishes to the larger ones.  My suggestion is (as you are walking in) to sit on the left side. Those people get served first because the waiters walk in a circle. We were on the right side and got served last. I mean eventually the food made it out to us, but I think it is much more fun to be surprised by the food than to watch other people get to pick what they want first. Went there the other night for dinner.  Was not a good first impression.  The restaurant is a cross between a dim sum restaurant and a tapas bar.  The melon mint soda was refreshing, and the ice cream sandwich dessert was delicious.  I would highly recommend trying those two.  But the savory dishes weren't as memorable and were somewhat overpriced.  A majority of the dishes lacked flavor, and presentation was decent.  I do not recommend ordering the ribs off the menu.  A full order is $20, which comes with 4 ribs.  If you are going to spend $5 a rib, I would recommend going to a restaurant that specializes in ribs and does not serve ribs where the cow seemed to have been on a diet.  To the restaurant, it would also help if instead of telling your guests ""aromatic broth"", tell them what's in the broth itself. Wow. Was looking for something really special and different for a couple of suburban escapees on date night, and was excited to try it based on the reviews. State Bird doesn't disappoint. The food was delicious and the service very friendly & prompt without being pushy. So good, it inspired me to finally make a Yelp review.As noted by others, the space is small in a comfy way, and reservations are key. When I first checked, there was nothing avail for 2 weeks. The online system through urban spoon is pretty efficient, and after checking a couple of times in the day, we landed a table for that night. I really liked that the hostess called later in the day to confirm and was gracious in taking time to answer some questions. Right when we walked in the feeling was relaxed and friendly. Nothing pretentious here. There are great, detailed reviews from others that cover the food - and it's true, everything we tried was sooooo good. The tuna and quinoa was yummy. I loved the guinea hen dumplings. Also, there's a nice tea selection, which is a good complement to the dishes. I can't say enough about the people though - super welcoming and nice from the minute we arrived til we left thanking the chefs.  It was perfect for a late night dinner after a movie (easy walk from Kabuki), though we might have needed at least one of the larger plates if we were there for a regular dinner. Can't wait to go back and find out.Go and enjoy. Probably one of the best experiences I've had at a restaurant ever.  The vibe from the kitchen and the servers was so nice and welcoming. We sat at the bar and had the best time. Everything was delicious. Get as many items as you can that aren't on the menu. And if it's sounds weird, it's probably amazing. Cool concept and fun, however, it took quite a while for me to actually feel full. Each small plate very unique and delicious. I loved the fresh seafood salad with nachos as well as the ravioli. They only give you 2 small ones so it leaves you wanting more. At $5-$6 bucks per small dish it adds up. My friends and I ended up ordering 2 $50 of Pinot and the experience was cool but I'm not so sure this will be a regular spot for me. Mother of GOD.That was the phrase that I kept uttering/moaning during our meal.  My BFF and I arrived at 7 PM for our reservation.  We were seated at the first table in the middle of the room so all the food passed us by right out of the kitchen.  Prime location!We hadn't eaten since our 11:00 AM brunch that morning so we were primed for a great meal.  However, we ended up getting a SPECTACULAR meal that left us totally speechless and blissed out.1. Fried Garlic Bread with melted Burrata.  it was like crack.  Total Crack.  Couldn't get enough.2. Fried eggplant fries topped with chopped sweet tomatoes and a lovely vinaigrette.  The best eggplant dish I've ever had.  Mopped up the leftover sauce with the above garlic bread.3. Steak tartare on top of a porcini aioli sauce with fried potato chips.  One of those ""I only get once this in a while"" indulgences - phew!  Glorious. . .4. Cumin Lamb with figs, zucchini, pea vines and green onions.  Thinly sliced perfectly seasoned Willamette lamb (sliced off the shank).  Our fabulous server Megan said it was her favorite so we had to order it.  It rocked our world.5. Buttermilk soaked fried quail on top of a lemony onion jam sauce.  Meaty crispy saucy heaven.8. Apricot  & Vanilla Ice cream sandwiches (the almond meal cookie has the toothiness and texture of french macaroons) - pure summer sinful yummy-ness.My BFF and I had such an amazing meal that we would burst into fits of laughter and giddiness from the food buzz we were experiencing.  We were completely besotted by the care/love put into each dish and inspired flavors.We also adored the staff -- they were sassy, engaging and funny.  It felt like Christmas each time they walked by with a new offering.  Ooooh!  Clapping hands and bouncing in our seats like little kids.  After our second dish, we were already plotting  when we were going to come back.  We both felt extremely lucky and grateful for our culinary experience.  Mother of God!  It was soooo. . . good. LOVE IT.  20 courses of solid flavors.  :-Pthe skylight provides natural light for the photo.  +++++ Really enjoyed the fresh approach in this restaurant - sat as a party of four and were impressed with attentive waitstaff despite the novel approach of ""passed dishes"".  The space is simple and appealing, but rather noisy.  As others have noted, the Burrata was popular with all of us; halibut popular with our fish lovers.  Would definitely recommend arranging an evening at this increasingly popular establishment. This is one of the restaurants I've kept an eye on, and it's gotten a lot of good press, but so many times places don't live up to the hype so I'm thrilled to report that this place does.1. Food - Consistently delicious-burrata and garlic bread - generous portion, really good-quinoa and tuna tartar - awesome-some sort of seafood cerviche-state bird chicken - small portion, great chicken, didn't love the 'provisions'-green onion and corn shortstack - highly recommend-farro with egg - this is the only one I didn't loveI may be leaving something off, but almost everything was absolutely delicious. Such unique flavors, combinations I hadn't had before, great sauces, etc. I would have liked to see a salad or two as we felt it was it was starch heavy.2. Service - excellent, surprisingly laid back. I feel like often there are snooty hipster types working at places like that, but everyone was great and down to earth, checked in with us the right amount of time. Even when they called to confirm our reservation, it was nice that they reminded us about Filmore Jazz fest as Filmore street was closed that night.3. Price - our bill came to $76 before tip. My husband had several beers, i didn't drink, and while we had enough to eat, we weren't stuffed. This is one of the cheapest dinners I've had in SF in a while and while I'm sure we could've ordered more, I was still impressed with how reasonable the prices were for very high quality ingredients.4. I would return. So often, even if I have a good meal somewhere, I'm still like 'crossed that off the list', always wanting to try somewhere new. This place I would go back to b/c everything was good but their menu is constantly changing. Also, it's not a big to-do. We were in and out of there in less than an hour for less than $100 for amazing food. Interesting concept for SF. After reading Phil H's ROTD, I knew I had to try State Bird. He's totally on the money about making a reservation ASAP; I looked online and no good reservation was to be had until 2 weeks out. With that said, there are 10 ""first come, first serve"" bar seats, which you might have to get there at 6pm to even have a crack at getting before 8:30pm. My friend and I actually thought the bar seat was the best in the house since we got first dibs on the dim sum items that came out of the kitchen...SCORE!So you might have heard, State Bird's menu constantly changes. When you sit down you can pick some menu listed items and/or you can take your chances and roll the dice with the randoms that come from the kitchen. Each tray brings a new surprise and the wait staff won't spoil the mystery (shhhhh).My favorites were:- burrata with garlic bread *drooooooool*- beets & rosemary nectarine with goat cheese- potato puree with mushrooms *drooooooool again*I can't promise any of these dishes will be here when you visit but I can promise that you will enjoy your meal. After my brother told me about State Bird Provisions I've been wanting to try this place out. I decided to come for my bday with my family. I was so excited for this place I even read up why they named the restaurant State Bird Provisions.Made reservations for 4 at 6pm. Arrived at the restaurant right when they opened and there was a line coming out of the restaurant. After we sat down the waitress told us how the restaurant works, we can order some food off the menu, and some off the carts/trays as they walk around. Similar to that of a dim sum restaurant.We decided to try as much as we could. We had about 12 dishes off the provisions, 1 item off the pancake menu, and ordered everything off the main courses. I was surprised I actually enjoyed about 90% of the things I ate at here. Everything had rich flavors but at the same time was very oily. For dessert had the ice cream sandwiches and the ""world peace"" peanut muscovado milk. I enjoyed both desserts and the ice cream sandwiches. The ice cream sandwiches even came with a candle which was a nice plus since it was my birthday.Overall I thought the food was a little pricey and the portions were pretty small. There are plenty of other nice restaurants I could've eaten at for $250. Even after all that food I wasn't close to being full. Although the food was good, I'm not sure if I would come back as I already tried about 90% of their items already. Small, trendy, comfortable, dim sum serving style spot with excellent, unique items to offer. 4.5 starsFood: 4.4, Service: 4.5, Atmosphere: 3.5Cost to worth it rating: 4 (very reasonable for the quality of food provided)Return worthiness: yesEve award: best accompaniment to burrata Highlights:- Fun presentation: unlike tradition dim sum, every item had personality and an artistic quality to the presentation - Variety: I love having a bunch of different options to try- Burrata: what I called the salty funnel cake. A thick puffy rolled dough underneath the typical creamy cheese. Our favorite of the night. It came by towards the end of the meal and though we were stuffed, we were so tempted to get another.- Liver mousse with mini corn muffins (not the technical description, but what I got out of it): mousse was light and airy and corn items slightly sweet.- Mussels and scallops: mixed on the spot in a tomato base placed on top of guacamole and tall tortilla chips. Scallops were so soft and fresh I adored them. I'm not into mussels, but these were missing that briny fishy sea taste- Eggplant hazelnut zucchini: thinly sliced green vegetable loosely spiraled and put on top a eggplant purée. Hazelnut bits made the dish- Clams and tofu in a kim chee broth: cute oval cast iron/hot pot looking bowl housing these items. Again fresh seafood and the broth didn't overwhelm it.- Ribs: fall off bone HUGE and great flavors- Wine: by class sparkling followed by a red I asked the waitress to serve were both great.Midlights: - Fried green tomato: not bad at all but compared to the other items that were outstanding, via grading it on a curve, this makes it in my midlight category. The cheese sauce it was placed on top of was great.- Pancake: we got the pork onion one which was bit thick and not packing enough flavor for me- Chocolate dessert: was a bit unappetizing on delivery being unevenly chunky and all brownLowlights- With no menu of the passed items, don't know what's coming, so it's hard to save room for what you might like best- Harder with 2: would be more fun with 4. Unless you're like me and just order everything I want even though there's just the hub and I--and he doesn't even eat a lot of things.Was glad to stumble on this spot, thoroughly enjoyed it, and would love to come back Dim sum style in an American restaurant?  Say it ain't so.  That's how State Bird operates.  They bring dishes around in a try or cart and you choose whether you want it or not.  They do describe the dish a bit more to you such as quinoa with tuna tartare with a so and so sauce instead of pork dumpling.  We ordered a plethora of dishes to try such as but not limited to fried quail, fried egg plant, red trout, pancakes, crab meat with potatoes, baby back ribs, cocao nib ice cream sandwiches.  Since there were so many dishes (four of us to share) but we only got a bite out of each one, it's really hard to remember what and how each dish was.  I will say what impressed me was the flavors majority of the dishes brought.  You get loads of flavor packed into each bite which is what made this restaurant good.  The sesame pancakes with creme fraiche was excellent, as were the ribs as were the guinea hen dumpling.  Since it was my brother's birthday, they put a candle for him on the dessert which was cool.  So why is this place four and not five stars?  First of all, I thought some of the dishes were a bit too oily.  Second reason is for the price of each dish, the portions were a bit small.  The meal for the four of us ended up being $250 which is understandable since that is how much a good restaurant costs when eating out in SF.  However it's still rather pricey as the environment is pretty casual.  I think if it was $150 to $200, it would have been much better value.  Anyway I definitely recommend trying it; it's a new concept and food that is creative and delicious. What a pleasant surprise. Was taken here for a late birthday dinner, and even though everyone in our three person dinner party was at various degrees of sickness, we were not going to give up our dinner reservation.New-American tapas served dimsum style, with a few menu-order-only items. It is a very novel concept and I was already intrigued.We ordered (using the best of my memory):1. Tuna Quinoa Tartare: excellent, the crunch of the fried quinoa was a great contrast to the fresh and delicate tuna, would order again2. Fried Eggplant with Aioli and fresh tomatoes: another great dish, perfectly battered fried eggplant, the aioli was a good creamy contrast, and the tomatoes were a nice pop of tartness, would order again3. Mini-almond muffins with Duck Liver Mousse: I thought the muffins were tasty, but I didn't care too much for the liver mousse, it just tasted like sweet whipped cream to me, I could skip this one next time4. Fried State Bird (off the menu): My favorite dish of the night, perfectly fried and succulent, served with a broth and thin slices of cheese... sooo good5. Shittake Mushroom and Duck (?) Dumplings/Ravioli: Tasty, but I didn't think it was a standout; I could do without this one next time too6. Beef Tartare with Housemade Potato Chips: Superb; we actually thought the chips stole the spotlight of the dish since they were so delicate, thin, crispy, and perfectly salted; the beef tartare went very well... although truthfully the ratio of chips to beef is like 2:1, which though not balanced, we didn't mind so much7. Kimchee Pork Belly: The pork belly was great, the kimchee portion I didn't think was spicy/picked enough to really be called 'kimchee' and didn't go that well with the pork; still worth it for the pork belly alone though8. Fried Garlic Bread with Burretta: Eat fast or the cheese will solidify; decadently good; it was like a garlicky-savory donut9. Whipped potatoes with porchini mushrooms and hazelnuts: Also a standout; the crunch of the hazelnuts wents exceptionally well with the creamy potatoes, and the meaty mushrooms gave some nice heartiness; loved10. $8 Dessert #1, Sweet Corn Pancake with blueberries, ground pumpkin seed, and cream: recommended by our waitress and super good11. $8 Dessert #2: Vanilla Tapioca with Peach granita: also recommended, so refreshing for a bunch of sick people, and the vanilla flavor really stood out in the best possible way, maybe my 2nd favorite dish of the nightThe service and staff was so friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. One of them (the manager?), Emily, who recommended our fabulous desserts and was especially accommodating, was the highlight of an already great meal. I'd give her a 6th star if I could.I will definitely be back and bring guests to State Bird Provisions for the great food, unique experience, and excellent service. The name is what threw me. I heard it was good, very good in fact, but that name made it sound so trendy in an Audubon Society kind of way that I thought I'd wait and read the reviews. Then of course, the New York Times praised it to high heaven a couple of weeks ago, so it was time to go. By sheer luck, there was an open table available last Thursday, so Jamie W. and I decided to forgo the Soup Company and splurge a bit on a school night. It's a surprisingly modest-looking place, smallish, in the struggling Lower Fillmore area, but what immediately strikes you is the open kitchen and prep area where chefs Stuart Brioza and Nicole Krasinski and their staff were busily preparing all their specialty dishes in full view.I knew almost immediately that this was going to be good. To experience a wide variety of their special delicacies, Brioza and Krasinski smartly decided to take a tapas approach. You can either order à la carte off their plank menu which gets stashed under the table, or from a cart or a large tray dim sum-style, where various small dishes are offered in the $5 to $8 range. Or you can do it like us and order both ways in order to try as much as possible within one meal. A lot of tempting choices, but we knew we had to tackle their signature ""Commandable"" dish, the $16 CA State Bird with Provisions, which is appropriately a crispy spiced quail piled atop onions stewed in lemon and rosemary (see photo).It had been so long since I had fried chicken that it was the perfect bite to have at that moment with the puckery onions a nice counterbalance to the crispiness of the quail. It was over all too soon. The next dish was a bit more exotic, the $14 Cumin Lamb with Scallions, Figs and Zucchini, stir-fried and casually flavorful, it was easy to devour (see photo). Complementing the two protein-dominated dishes was the $12 Cast Iron Mushrooms, Eggplant, Dahl and Cauliflower, a hearty veggie mix simply executed and perfectly savory (see photo). Throughout the meal, the cart would stroll by with all sorts of delectable items or a waitress with a big tray would present another trio of dishes. It was all becoming quite overwhelming, especially on a school night.But we wanted the full experience and  grabbed the $5 Guinea Hen Ravioli in Duck Broth, which was just a couple of bites for the both of us but still quite a treat (see photo). We also tried the $6 Ahi Tuna Tartare which was mixed with Quinoa (see photo). The contrast in texture and flavor was nice, and it was almost like having a Hawaiian mini-poki salad. Even with five dishes under our belts...literally, we still felt a need to try their $8 desserts. Both were splendid. The first was the Sweet Corn-Coconut Cake with Blueberries and a dollop of Buttermilk Cream, a homespun treat that wouldn't be out of place at a county fair (see photo). The second was even better, the Cocoa Nib-Verbena Ice Cream Sandwich, cut in quarters, with Blackberries (see photo). The perfect ending.FOOD - 5 stars...incredible variety, great batting average on flavors and a sense of culinary adventure uncommon even in this city...and I didn't feel stuffed at the endAMBIANCE - 4 stars...casual and not too noisy considering how busy they wereSERVICE - 4 stars...attentive and informedTOTAL - 5 stars...truly unique and the tapas approach lets you try more than you would expect for a little over $40 per person Thought the quail was outstanding. all of us agreed that everything else was underwhelming and a tad too salty. Can you say yum? Brilliant concept + fabulous food = amazing experience. Just go - it will blow any other restaurant away... Meh. More like 2.5 stars. Whimsical concept, liked the idea of dim sum for California food. We tried 5 of the ""floating"" plates. I found the dishes innovative but unfortunately the flavors were quite forgettable. The pork belly with kimchi for example - have you ever had kimchi with absolutely no heat? or any pickled flavor? or pork belly with no crisp whatsoever? It was cabbage with fatty pork. Oysters were blah. Burrata on garlic bread - which is a dish even I couldn't mess up - was a huge disappointment. Didn't have any salt (which it needs) or olive oil (which helps it), and the garlic bread had no garlic. The pancakes with Mt. Tam were wonderful - and tasted just like warm Mt. Tam cheese. On the plus side you can start eating as soon as you sit down which is wonderful if you're hungry. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Note for anyone considering this for a date spot: do you want to be interrupted every 2 minutes by someone carrying a tray of food describing the contents therein? F*ck. Yes.Tapas / dim sum, only with New American cuisine? Winning.There are two ways to order:  the hot stuff (pancakes, most meats, delectable desserts) are made to order. The rest is carted around like dim sum. Vegetarian must-haves:Sweet corn & garlic chive ""shortstack"", with mt. tamGarlic bread with burrata Shaved squash with charred eggplantMarinated vegetable egg salad, nuts & seedsI can't wait to go back! Came here last night (Tuesday).  Had reservations thankfully as there were already people gathering to get in.  I was VERY excited to try this place with all the rave reviews, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations!!  Everything was so unique and delicious, and I really liked the set-up of menu PLUS dim sum style. Was difficult to not get every item sent around.Favorites... simply delectable:- Tuna tartare w/ fried quinoa, tomatoes, greens and aioli - Sweet corn pancakes with Mt. Tam cheese - Porcini mushrooms over whipped potatoes and hazelnut crunch- Farro with a slew of things you mix together (can't remember, but it was my tablemates' favorite)- Beef tartare with porcini aioli and porcini dusted potato chips- Dessert: ""ice cream sandwich"" YummmmmAlso good:- burrata with fried bread- squash/zucchini over an eggplant pureeWouldn't get again:- Guinea fowl dumplings- Ribs off the menu (fatty)So much more I want to try - will be back SOON! Please sprint to this restaurant.  Clever, inventive, and every bite of everything I ate was extraordinary. Excellent service. 3 1/2 stars. Served like dim sum style. You can also order off the menu for certain items they don't walk around with. Some of the food was a hit and miss. I think I expected much more because of the hype, but I am really glad I tried it. oysters on the half shell-they were fresh, but I had betterwhipped smoked trout, peas & mint-way too many peas, don't taste the mint, and the whipped trout you can't really taste. I did like the very crunchy crutons that came with it.tuna tartare & quinoa with bonito-rosemary aioli-very refreshing. I don't usually like quinoa, but went really well with the tuna to give it that crunchduck liver mousse with almond biscuit-love, love, love. The biscuit was so moist and to add the liver mousee just made it even tastiergarlic bread with burrata-eat quick cuz the cheese gets hard, but this was goodhaas avocado with seafood 'salsa' -gross. all you can taste is salsa from the jar. kimchi-pork belly with tofu & clams-very comforting. I wanted more.Things we ordered off the menu:sweet corn & garlic chive ""shortstack"", with mt. tam-so good! What isn't good with corn and garlic, but wish it was a little more crispyCA state bird with provisions-fried perfectly. The batter was so good and the bird was tender. Must try this!cumin lamb with scallions, dates & snap peas-I dont eat lamb, but my friends said flavor was good, but way too oilycast iron mushrooms, eggplant, dahl & cauliflower-colored pickle cauiflower with smoky mushrooms, which was really good, but the egg plant was blah and very soggy. No room for dessert. Staff was friendly and it was fun trying new things, but I wouldn't come back. My new favorite restaurant. SBP is creative, inspired, interactive, and fun. In my opinion, it represents all the best qualities of what San Francisco dining should be and is an example of why SF is such a great food city. The space is sparse and unpretentious. The service attentive but casual. And the food was thrilling and inventive. Sure, not every dish was perfect - but when you are out there on the edge trying new things, I don't expect bull's eyes every time. I would say 70% of the dishes were outstanding, 20% very good, and 10% were so-so. There are definitely some must tries if they have them on the night you are there: the garlic burrata bread (transcendent), the seafood ""salsa"" (chock full of perfectly cooked mussels and scallops), the ricotta sauerkraut pancakes (sauerkraut salt!), and the zucchini with smoked eggplant and fermented garlic (an incredible, unexpected combo of flavors). We also really enjoyed the pickled, fried cauliflower in the cheddar-beer sauce. We will skip the duck pate and almond biscuits next time (the flavors just didn't jibe for us) as well as the smoked trout spread with favas (ho hum flavors). The granita with tapioca and figs for dessert was excellent. I won't be recommending this spot to my vegetarian friends - it would be pretty tortuous to let all those interesting meaty dishes go by, but as for me - we are booking our return trip for next month tonight! Wow what an amazing experience all the way through.  We had a 5:30 reservation which was pretty early for us but we were out of there and heading home at 7pm which was nice.  The decor inside is pretty cool and minimalistic but we really liked it.  It's pretty small inside but they make the best of the area for sure.  We had so much food I'm not sure where to begin.  Everything was really tasty and the tuna tartare was my favorite. We also had the duck pate cornbread, burrata garlic bread, preserve wonton with mushroom sauce (my wife's favorite), puree avocado tortilla with a scallop and mussel salsa (loved the salsa), tuna tartare with quinoa salad (again my fav), smoked potato salad, CA state bird provision (of course we had to get that here - not much meat on this dish though), sauerkraut pancake (awesome but make sure you use the salt), pickled cauliflower with cheese fondue, nectarine with feta cheese and for dessert we had the vanilla saffron ice cream sandwich with blackberries and the double chocolate pudding (so smooth) and a chocolate crunch and raspberries.Delicious meal and service and we'd definitely come back. This place is fan-funghing-tastic!  Wonderful ingredients, smart balance of them and perfectly cooked and well seasoned.  I am a huge supporter of this concept and place.  The chefs efforts are appreciated within the community and it shows.Ideal for sharing, tasting, conversing and enjoying what real food tastes like. Right as I rode up on my bike I realized I had forgotten my bike lock. Shat! Luckily, the kind folks at State Bird Provisions are awesomely nice and let me stash my bike in their storage hallway while we dined. What a wonderful first impression!Then, from start to finish it just kept getting better and better! The service was amazing - everyone we encountered was engaging, funny, generous, and knowledgeable about the food and wine. And the food itself, mmmm... we had a few items from the set menu, and then enjoyed picking several of the dim sum style goings arounds, and all were wonderful. The worst dish we had was good, and the best was incredible. And everything was reasonably priced and in a cool atmosphere. I hope to support this place by visiting again soon, and telling my friends! Highly recommended! LOVE this place! It's not fancy and it isn't very cozy, but the service and the food make up for it.  Plus although bustling it isn't ear-splittingly loud. I've been twice and have loved both visits.  The State Bird (quail) is perfectly fried in a crunchy batter with an interesting pickled onion side.  I also really liked the fried green tomatoes and the trout and the green onion burrata bread. It's really fun to be able to sample several things and still leave room for dessert.  The flavor combinations are new and different, and they also surprise you with different textures. The wine list is small but quite interesting and they have Abita beer on draft! I'm so happy I am walking distance to here... This place is full of deliciousness!  My date and I made reservations a month in advance and I'm glad we did--it's hard to get in here on a Friday night.  It's ""dim-sum"" style, where 12-18 dishes are walked around throughout the night on trays/carts and you can order off them and there's also a menu with other stuff you can order from.  All the plates are small, but meant to be shareable.  Date and I ordered 3 items off the menu, which came out hot and yummy and 5 items from the cart, lukewarm and yummy.  With 2 drinks and dessert, our bill came out to $80.  I was still a little hungry, but I'm on a diet so I guess it's okay. :)I will say that the cost and fun of eating here is way better than eating at one of those schmancy fancy restaurants with 10 courses @ $180/pp.  Here, you get 10 for $80 total and the menu is equally exciting.  I only give 5 stars to places I definitely feel like I would go back to and I'm definitely looking forward to returning. So, the non-foodie Oldman surprised me again! He whisked me away to dinner to celebrate my birthday. Again, I wondered if he was stalking Tyler Florence and found a new TF place to try. No! This place is certainly a horse of a different color. Wouldn't shock me if they start serving horse, or unicorn with a side of cosmic muffin in the near future.The earliest reservation on a Monday night was 9:30pm. Or, take your chances and walk-in and wait. So, he decided to take a chance. As the taxi dropped us off in front of a very nondescript section of the block, we walked up to a pretty tiny looking place... FULL of people, already chowing down in the dining room, or lined up against the wall, waiting... yearning, longing to get a table. We discovered that the wait would be 45 minutes (for silly chance-taking people). So, we lined up against the wall and waited. The more we waited the more intrigued I became. You see, waiting for a table puts one in perfect view of all the hustle and bustle of the kitchen. I couldn't take my eyes off the fast-paced, yet loving way all of the tender little morsels were being prepared. And the more I gazed, the more I salivated and the more antsy I became. Then I started to get a little jealous of the couple standing at the 4-""seater"" counter. Screw it, my inner princess-wanting-a-table gave into the Olman's suggestion and we swooped in on the other two spots to get our grub on!I tell ya, standing at that little counter is THE way to go. The lucky 4 willing to stand will reap the rewards of attaining the FULL menu. You see, when you choose the dining room, you will receive a smaller menu (don't worry, you may see something that strikes your fancy as it floats by your table, dim-sum style). But, standing at the counter will not only give you the dim-sum option, but you may now put in your request from the FULL menu... damn, I felt like a rock star! And, my mouth felt like an Iron Chef/porn star!What I dined on. Read it and weep (this was in late April, so I'm sure the menu is totally diff). I'm getting verklempt. Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit - Hey, I saw the word LIVER and visions of not being able to dine on foie gras (legally) come 7/1/12, made me want this even more! I know. My cold heart was only thinking about my stomach. And, it was wonderful. Thank you to the fatty duck. The almond biscuits reminded me more of tender little Madeleine cookies (my favorite- probably kin to a cosmic muffin).Kimchi-pork belly with tofu and clams - served in a mini cast iron pot. Interesting and very tasty combo!Pancakes! Mendocino sea urchin, ginger scallion pancake, with soy-lime - I have been wanting to try Uni for quite a while now, but I've heard stories of funky uni and I was kind of hesitant yet excited. The nice guy (which I'm going to assume was one of the owners) talked me into it. It was buttah! Like foie gras of the sea, atop a savory pancake, drizzled with the delicious soy-lime holy syrup.Green garlic bread - just get it. And, just as I was thinking this would be the next item I wanted to request - poof! Magical chef offered it to us. You see, standing up will also give you first dibs on plates headed to the dim-sum cart! And bam! That's how Mary had her little lamb. Well, I'm going to order that lamb dish next time seeing howz I don't really care for lamb, but I'm sure this place will have me going out of my way to silence some with my fork.I highly recommend. You'll swear you've never had this much fun shoving stuff into your mouth. Holy Crap! I loved this place. Are they tapas? Are they dim sums? Such high energy! I love the DIFFERENCE of the place. The servers were ecstatic and so positive! Excellent chardonnay choice! Try theMushroom dish (it's in a small skillet w/ eggplant) OMG!State Bird w Provisions (quail...yes. YUM!)Simmered cherry dish for dessert!There's so much.What it is is that there are dishes, like the quail, which you can order. I suggest don't pre-order anything. Just do dim-sum style and everything will come to you...pronto. Pace yourself or you will get too stuffed too fast and be out of there too fast! That's fine if you short on time, like I was. I was trying to get to the Symphony! No problem.But getting stuffed kinda crimps your thoughtfulness and comfort! Oh, Yoshi's is just down the street and there's a parking garage across from Yoshi's...as the area is still a bit sketchy.In few words, Go Forth and Have Fun! Overall, very flavorful unique dishes, but a bit $$ for the small portions. I was hungry in just a couple hours and had a second meal even though I feel like I ate a full dinner.Tried:Lemon lime basil soda - pretty on point!Calabrian spiced tofu - tofu tasted like cheese, probably wouldn't recommend this dishBoquerones pancake - soft buttery savory sesame pancake was delishCA state bird - fried quail leg - very small but tasty and fried skin was light and crunchyCoconut ice cream sandwich with almonds and blueberries - one of the best understated items on the menu - *would eat again for sure*Green garlic bread with burrata - cheese was amazingly soft and one can't really go wrong with fried garlic breadMushroom guinea hen dumplings with an aromatic broth - i really liked the texture of the mushrooms, the guinea hen, and the broth was full of flavor (my dining partner wasn't so impressed)Fried green tomatoes with a creamy cheese sauce - great sauceMmm..typing this out makes me salivate, but I think the portions are too small to even share with one other person. You each need your own dish. Simply put, State Bird Provisions is one of the best 'new' restaurants in San Francisco. Believe the hype, it really is that good. Ignoring the cool 'dim sum' system of choosing food,  the unpretentious surroundings and attentive but unfussy service - and concentrating on the food.... The food here is fun and different. Interesting but uncomplicated small plates of flavorful California cuisine with a definite Asian influence. There are dishes here that I haven't tasted elsewhere, and they mix up the 'dim sum' dishes on a regular basis.  That's not to say every dish is a 'hit' but best dishes are absolutely outstanding, and at a non 'fine dining' price point. As I mentioned the food isn't revolutionary.. but has the same extreme emphasis on ingredients and taste as you'll find at Frances. Of course, it's difficult to get a reservation - but go now before they get their first Michelin star and it becomes impossible to get a table within three months! surprised by many of the reviews.  this restaurant is different to put it simply, and absolutely tasty to boot.  while one shouldn't expect the normal wait service or food fare of other establishments, one needn't be scared of having something so out of the realms of the typical dining experience.  to accomplish this while still managing to have a unique and flavorful taste is pretty amazing.convincing dishes: squab dumplings, crisps with horseradish creme fraiche and roe, cumin lamb (typically despise cumin), burrata fried bread (though slightly over-salted, still a fab dish), chocolate pudding (typically do not favor, but this case it was delightfully textured).not that i'm familiar, but this restaurant is exactly my type. Tried out the food here last night. Fun spot and for trying small dishes. They serve about 12-14 small dishes per night (we only saw about 8 circulate in the hour we were there) and several made to order dishes on the menu.  I thought all of the dishes were tasty, but I really liked the sauerkraut cheese pancakes, the quail (state bird), these little sweet corn breads with pate. I like that you can sit down and immediately start eating (just like dim sum)! Overall, food was fun and interesting, service was great. I would come back. Two people for dinner had about 6-7 dishes and we left quite full. Had dinner here tonight and absolutely loved it!First off, when you walk in, everyone (including the owner and head chef) greets you and wants to help take care of you. We were very early for our reservation, and Mary the GM immediately went back, found a table for us, and sat us. As was mentioned in other reviews, it seems like everyone there is really excited to be there; super inviting!As for the food, it was stellar! We especially loved the sweet potato salad, the pork farro with soft egg, the pork ribs, and the lemon blueberry ice cream sandwich. Half of the time, we didn't even know everything we were eating; just that it tasted really good.I liked the ambiance a lot, too; the pegboard wall, concrete wall, and small cafeteria-type feel is kindof the point, and there still manages to be an ambiance! Definitely recommended! Loved the industrial ambiance, loved the food, loved the philosophy. The prices add up though for sure (typical tapas). They win points for having cheap beverage options for sure. We sat at the bar, which was fine, but the service staff didn't pay us as much attention for that reason. I think our server was also playing host, and he didn't seem to have time to give us menus or take our drink orders/give us our bill. I enjoyed it, but it probably won't be a repeat destination. So I was on a first date with a super cool chick (SCC).  I wanted to take her to a fun and memorable place, a regular restaurant simply won't do.  Unfortunately, it is nearly impossible to get a Fri evening reservation.  The rumor was show up at 530pm and they have ""places put aside for walk-ins"".  I have a feeling that it's the counter, not a good idea if you want to impress your SCC.  The advice I got from the person who answered the phone was to check back during the week as cancellations occur.  I bookmarked their website and daily checked the reservation, lo and behold, one week before my date night, a 630pm table for 3 opened up (I only had two people, but I am a big eater, so I took the table for three!).  I got no issues from the hostess about just the two of us and my SCC got a kick out of my antics of getting us a table.The food was pretty good.  I don't remember if any of it was cooked, but there was a lot of food that tasted like cerviche.  They bring around 10 different dishes on trays and offer them up.  You can also order off the menu to enhance your culinary experience.  After about three hours of good laughs and good food, we finally finished.  It was about $70 for two but we didn't get alcohol.  Very good value for a fun experience, not the type of place that you would go to regularly to have a hearty meal, but certainly a place to go for a fun experience and a nice night on the town!  Enjoy! Not worth it... Ah, those hip places with lines outside and reservations weeks in advance. What else could I do but reserve a table and wait for my 6 pm dinner?Very interesting idea -- you are presented 3 food choices with each cart or tray. It would work amazing if the food had yummier look. We decided not to focus on the small dish size and try everything, but vegetarian option - not into vegetables. Well to be honest out of everything I ate I was not impressed with anything. - felt like the food was lacking flavor and ingredients.  I left this place $120 lighter and still hungry...  I'd love to give it another try, but later when they will figure out the menu.... First, the food is 100% amazing. Chef/Owners Stuart and Nicole take a daring approach to flavors and marry them to create tasty and visual masterpieces that dance on your palette. Everyone at the restaurant is great and the service, though somewhat unconventional, is engaging and fantastic! The whole experience at SBP really draws you in to a world of culinary bliss that makes you feel like you are a part of something special. Cute idea, cute ambiance, just plain cute. Not so great for a vegetarian, but they did have some options. We had wine and with three people, the bill came to about $50 person, plus tax and tip. Not unreasonable for a unique experience, but I was hungry a few hours later! This place was great.  Food was tight and the service was attentive but not overbearing.  Beer and wine only so a cocktail accross the street is a great way to kill the wait time.The service style (dim sum passing )  works great.  Overall big fan and I will return to try more items. Great food.  Really.  A lot of attention is given to the ingredients, preparation and presentation.  I had the red trout and asparagus and then several items off of the cart.  The cart is a cool concept because you can grab more food based on what looks good without having to judge from a menu's description.  Immediate gratification... The food is amazing. We tried virtually everything and loved it all. Superb quality, great flavor combinations, and creative presentations. Unique, fun dining concept. Makes for a really fun, engaging dinner out with friends. The service was terrific as well, especially for a new establishment. One of my new favorites in San Francisco. Can't wait to make it back for their brunch. This is he best restaurant for new american cuisine in the City. The ribs here were amazing as was hen dumplings the pork with egg and farro was fantastic the tofu was good the burata with fried peppery dough thing underneath was great and the ice cream mini sandwiches were excellent and the chef was great to chat with. My new goto spot. SBP is a Western style dim sum with servers pushing a cart or carrying different trays of dishes with the price listed. A few times, the servers almost dropped their trays on our table which meant the trays are too heavy or beware of putting your hands on the table. Out of 8 dishes, only 3 were memorable with the pairing of flavors, ingredients, and texture. Recommend the kimchi pork belly, the CA state bird with provisions, and the chocolate walnut ice cream sandwich.Unfortunately, since 3 out of 8 dishes ranked well amongst us, that's a 37% success rate. Definitely room for improvement. Overall, good idea, poor execution. Ill keep it simple. Everyone who worked in this place was super nice. not over the top kiss ass nice. Nice like i would want to hangout with them. even the people in the kitchen made friendly eye contact. The guy greeting us, who i guess was the owner/chef was incredible. checking on us while we were waiting offering us a drink. not that we had to wait long. took a chance while we were walking home, no reservation, and we were seated before we could get our drink order. had to uses some restraint to not order everything, as it all looked great.loves:, Garlic bread burrata, pork belly, seafood salsa, duckliver mouse.So so's: oysters (but iam a firm beliver you shouldnt F with them anyway) sliced duckBad...nothing. it was all good and i cant wait to go back and work the rest of the list.I had beer my better half had two different wines that were suggested based on her tastes and they were both excellent. 2 people, 7 tasting plates, the signature State Bird,  2 deserts and two drinks each and still just over $100 by a couple bucks, so its pretty cheap in my book as well. Gald we were walking home. needed it! Wanted to give this place 5, but the service has some kinks.First, the atmosphere -- love the decor, two walls and a ceiling of pegboard.  It feels surprisingly warm and welcoming, and for a small space, not at all cramped.Our dedicated waitress was absolutely lovely (I think her name was Sarah?) and on the ball, as was the gentleman at the front expediting, who still made time to chat with us. The kinks come in the dim sum service.  We were seated right at the front of the restaurant, but were often totally ignored by the cart and the passing trays, even when our table was totally devoid of other dishes.  Meanwhile, food would be offered to tables where several plates were already being enjoyed.  It kind of felt like we were in a service blind spot.  I recommend asking for a seat near the back, they seemed to get more attention.Ok, on to the food:Of the commendables we had1) the uni pancake     --very generous serving of uni, the soy lime sauce was a great pairing, and the garnish of pea shoots and bean sprouts was a great textural contrast.  We were fans2) the short stack of guanciale pancakes    --not super bacony, well balanced, love the maple flavor of the candy cap mushroom powder.  Total breakfast for dinner and very satisfying.3) the glazed pork ribs   --good, but boring.  They're pork ribs.  Tender, meaty, nice sweetish glaze.  The cooked bitter greens with it were lovely. Of the circulating items we had1) the duck mousse with little corn cakes  --super creamy mousse, not aggressively flavored but definitely duck liver.  The corn cakes were moist and sweet.  Would get this again in a second.2) the smoked trout mousse with croutons, fava, and mint  --the mousse itself was a bit salty, but paired with the unsalted croutons and fava, it worked, since both offset the salt well, but it wasn't amazing.3) the smoked duck breast  --gorgeously tender duck breast, perfectly seasoned, with delicious little bits of potato.  Also a winner4) the guinea hen ravioli with broth.  --the ravioli itself was piping hot with a well seasoned filling that tasted like it had a healthy dose of five-spice.  Sadly, the broth was tepid at best, which detracted from the ravioli.  Maybe they should drop the broth? It felt unnecessary.5) the pork fried (rice? farro?) with pickles, greens, and a poached egg --tasty, but felt like it was lacking salt.  The pickles were a nice touch though --the contrasted with the texture of the egg and the flavor of the rice/farro well. Definitely did not blow we away. 6) the fried green garlic dough with burrata  --Um, it's piping hot fried dough with yummy yummy cheese.  Get this. Dessert:1) Macaron Japonaise -- almond and rhubarb.  Sour.  Not my favorite.2) Ice cream sandwich -- you may be turned off by the portion size but don't be deceived.  These are delicious but SUPER rich.  That portion is more than enough.I know this sounds like a lot of food but some of the portions were fairly small, which I loved because we got to try so much!  Two people, 4 glasses of wine, and all of this for $145 (after tip).  Definitely worth a trip back. After waiting a month for our reservations, I was very excited to come here for dinner.I went with 3 other friends. We brought our own wine ($20 corkage). We split everything offered plus the fried quail & two of the pancakes.Everything was fine but a little tepid. The fried quail was just fried quail, nothing incredibly exciting or enlightening. The pancakes were OK, I liked the one with guacinale the most. The galic bread with burrata was pretty tasty too. Most of our dishes were lukewarm. Everything aside from the aforementioned was forgettable.The ambiance of this place could use some work as well. I felt like with the hype & prices they command, they could at least make their tables un-wobbly and make it feel less cafeteria-like on the inside. Part of eating out for me is the ambiance and intimacy of eating which there was very little of here.We all left hungry after paying about $30 per person. My friend couldn't eat many of the dishes due to a shellfish allergy (they put it in almost everything). I probably will not return here. I wonder if they will continue to stay in business after the hype has worn off. State Bird Provisions is one of the hottest restaurants in recent times.  Reservations for a 8pm spot took one month.  It's been reviewed by practically all the local critics and highly praised at that.  So naturally, my expectations were super high.Although good, I don't think it quite measured up to what I was hoping for.It's a Western-cuisine dim sum joint with many items brought by on carts or trays (the one big difference is that the servers are extremely well-versed on all the dishes and eager to impart this information, unlike the ""take-it-or-leave-it"" attitude at traditional dim sum restaurants).  A select number of items are also available on the menu and brought by only upon request.  A quick recap of dishes:- Duck neck dumplings - quite good.  First dish of the night. Arguably one of the best.- Homemade kimchi in a broth with a clam and tofu - rather bland with surprisingly little kimchi.  Disappointing.- Duck liver mousse with almond biscuits - biscuits were a bit too sweet and the mousse didn't have that much flavor, although it offered a nice savory balance- Oysters with pickled kohlrabi - didn't like this at all ... way too salty and the pickled taste was overpowering.- Whipped trout mousse with peas and croutons - the server raved about this one ... but in all honestly, it was just alright.  The most interesting thing about this dish was the texture of the peas (or fava beans) - tasted more like edamame.- Quinoa tuna tartare  - unique interpretation with crunchy uncooked quinoa on top of the softer cooked version that was mixed in with ahi tuna.  One of the better dishes of the night.- World Peace peanut muscovado - served in a large shot glass, this was yummy (basically peanut milk)- Macaron japonais with rhubarb - nice savory sweet combo but just ok to me.I can see how some might rave about this place and others would be disappointed.  I think this time around, I was in the latter boat. This place is amazing. I took my best friend here for her birthday last Friday.  I booked the reservation through UrbanSpoon ten days beforehand and barely snagged a 10p reservation.  Not an ideal time for dinner, but glad we went anyway.  I did receive a text around 9:30p that the table was ready but we already had obligations.  This place was easy to find and the front is not pretentious.  The open kitchen was casual and people seemed to enjoy working there.  Nobody was stressed because they cook one dish and split it between three plates.  If you order an entree off the menu, they will have the two leftover plates and go around the tables to see if anyone wants to try them as well.  This is ingenious since you get to try a lot more dishes (I love variety) and each dish is something I've never tasted before.1)  Quinoa tuna tartare - we almost passed on this since it was the first thing offered in person on the tray, but we decided to try it.  They had uncooked quinoa sprinkled on top that gave it a nice crunch and the rosemary aoili wasn't overpowering and was fresh and perfect.  This was one of our favorite dishes of the night and was quite inspiring (I'm adding quinoa to my tar tar recipe!).2)  Guanciale and ramp short stack with candy cap powder (and balsamic vinaigrette) - this was pretty good.  The flavors were sweet and salty and the pancake gave it substance so it was to my liking.3)  State Bird with sour provisions - fried quail with a white sauce that was a bit sour for the both of us.  We didn't finish this dish.  It was a flop, kinda like when you're watching a movie and the characters state the movie title in a cheesy line.4)  Braised beef and beet salad with bone marrow sauce ($18!) - It came with four very well executed beef cheeks that were tender and separated with little effort.  The fat from the bone marrow set off the lack of fat on the clean piece of beef.  However, the beets could've been cooked a little more and the salad was a bit flat for me.5)  Whipped trout with fava beans and croutons - This was served in a Korean side dish dish (if that makes sense).  That's why it reminded me of home.  But these flavors did not.  I would skip this dish.  Good for one teaspoon just to taste, but that's about it.6)  Pork farro with ramps and a soft egg - this is their version of bi bim bop.  Loved it.  The greens really set off the fatty and savory pork and the fatter, shorter rice grains were a perfect texture and size to offset that of the pork.  7)  Green garlic bread with burrata (mozzarella) - pretty good but might get you really full.  I wish there was a place that served this dish!  The bread is the shape and form of a cinnamon roll with no cinnamon though and the mozzarella is soft and liquid-like on the inside of the glop of cheese.  There are spices on top that make this dish phenomenal (reminded me of the spices on the Mediterranean bread at Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder in Lincoln Park).8)  World Peace peanut muscovado milk in a shotglass - unfortunately, I ate the ice cream sandwich portion before I drank the milk so it just tasted like lukewarm milk to me.  I recommend drinking this BEFORE you dabble in any of the other desserts.9)  Strawberry granita (grainier than a sorbet), small, white and clear tapioca balls and hard, candied dates - I love dates but not in this dish.  The dates were hard to chew and got stuck on my molars.  The granita was pretty good, but would pass on this one next time.10) Chocolate walnut ice cream sandwich and dulce de leche - this was my favorite since the chocolate was a bit unfinished and tasty.  It came out in finger-like portions and was very good.  Order it! I had the Snap Dragon Iced Tea and it was nothing but regular iced tea, not spiced or anything special.  I recommend the Lemon Basil soda, which was pretty good.The service was excellent.  The Indian gal took care of the bill, but most of the time it was the waiter in the paisley shirt with the curly longer hair or the younger, tall guy with brown hair in all black.  The younger guy with brown hair (wish I got his name to put on this review!), was great with his recommendations and was super friendly (not to mention really cute). Definitely would come back (especially since the menu changes)! 3.5 star rating.First off, service here was wonderful and the concept is a twist from Chinese Dim Sum restaurants.  You are able to order things off a short menu (made to order) or else you can pick things off of the trays and carts that is being circulated around by the staff.I came here with a friend and we got many dishes.  The two standout dishes would be the green garlic fried bread with buratta and the state bird (quail).  Both dishes were made perfectly.  I loved just how juicy and wonderful the quail was and the fried bread and buratta was heaven!  We also got many other dishes from the cart and also ordered the short rib salad with bone marrow dressing and I found that they were okay.  Though the dishes were unique, there wasn't anything special about the flavor.Overall, a nice place.  I wouldn't mind going again since the menu changes and the food is pretty solid.  I just found that some of the dishes were quite overwhelming after hearing such a hype about it. The State Bird is a Quail....!Yeah right, like you actually knew that before. But I bet we can all agree that the state bird is pretty tasty deep fried served with stewed lemon onions and freshly shaved parmesan. Then there's the sea urchin, ginger, and scallion pancake. Not to mention the chocolate creme fraiche ice cream sandwich.The concept here is nice, the service is very nice, the names of the dishes sounded inventive and outstandingly nice, and the rest of our food was... well... um... nice. While everything looked visually appealing and delicious, there was just something missing at times. For instance, the kimchi pork belly with tofu & clams (in broth) tasted a bit disjointed. The pork belly did not fit in with the rest and was better eaten separately. The cumin lamb was ordinary and standard. The pork ribs had a bit of sizzle that tickled the tongue, but at that point I was looking for nice things to say.With the hype and fanfare, I thought everything would be on point. I suppose it's still new and things often grow and change. With the state bird, uni pancake, and ice cream sandwich beckoning for a second trip I'll be back. I was interested in seeing how this place was executing the ""food on a cart"" concept. It obviously reminded me of having dim sum. But these days the dim sum trend has moved away from the chart concept. Overall the concept may be a fun/different gimmick, so I'm interested to see how things turn out. The food was solid. The pork belly and kimchee dish I had was a bit under seasoned. The most creative restaurant i've been to in years!This is a theme park for foodies.Every waiter, server, chef, etc. is excited to be here.  That says a lot about what's coming out of this place.... I've eaten here 5 times and am just getting around to writing a review.  Instead of listing all of the dishes I've eaten, I'm gonna stick to what I think will happen if you eat here (based on my experiences).It's ""dim sum style"" service.....I really like this concept.  Considering the chefs have Michelin Star backgrounds, you can basically tailor a very sophisticated tasting menu to your personal desires.  Feel free to pass on dishes that don't sound great to your tastes...you won't regret it because you could never eat the entire menu.  So, pick well and enjoy.  On this topic...save a little appetite for dessert.  Their pastry program is insane!!!  I lean toward savory but holy sh*t, they knock it out of the park with their desserts.  We've had friends licking bowls....a little embarrassing but booze does bring out the dog in most of us.  I digress...On to cost...there are a few approaches you can take here.  If you have a Fillmore show or movie to catch...you can nail a few dishes and a beer and get out of there lightly scathed since most options cost between $4-$8.  You can also go in a small group (4 works well) and order 2 of everything that sounds good to the group and hit their wine list.  There are lots of interesting wine options under 40 bucks.  This is where the value really is, considering the experience.  The last time we ate this way, we had a couple hour food journey with lots of wine and only spent about $60 per person.  Now compare that to Commonwealth, Sons & Daughters, etc.  I have a hard time separating them when comparing food only.  Albeit, the atmosphere is a lot nicer at the aforementioned restaurants but I don't really rank atmosphere as high when dining out (personally).Alright, I'll put the pom poms down but I really like this restaurant and will go back again soon. The perfect mix of creativity, skill, and laid back classiness can be found here - AND (unless you are a hopeless glutton) it won't cripple your piggybank either!Although reservations FAR in advance are required for a table, showing up early (I arrived approx 40 mins and was first on line outside - sorry for the nose-prints & drool-stains on the window, SBP!) and getting a spot at the chef's bar was by far more enjoyable I think (more on that later)..It seems their ""Provisions"" menu (the part served dim sung style) is always evolving, so what follows is likely just a sample of what to expect:-- Avocado, guanciale & pomelo (bite sized bits - a nice introduction!)-- Halibut tartare & quinoa with bonito-rosemary aioli -- haas avocado with seafood 'salsa'-- duck neck dumplings in sauerjus-- pickled veggies, smoked potato & egg-- green garlic bread with burrataPACE YOURSELF with the dim sung, it's easy to just grab each item the first time it comes around, but that may leave you full faster than you anticipate. The last item there (burrata) was the most enjoyable to watch being prepared; it was in fact a fried garlic bread dough in the shape of a doughnut with the burrata served in the middle. DELICIOUS!I couldn't stand one of the flavors in the pickled veggies and egg (my personal taste, not their mistake), and when the gracious server inquired about my barely-touched-plate, they took it back & removed it from my bill.  THAT is the mark of a restaurant that cares.  The server was so helpful and patient in explaining each dish, the pride in their creations were blatantly evident without being pompous. The ""Commandables"" menu are items you must order and are then promptly cooked. I enjoyed both the pork ribs with spigarello & togarashi as well as the sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancakes. STAND at the chefs bar - not only does this grant you first dibs on the dim sung cart (don't fear, table dwellers - all the dishes are equally perfect quality, choosing last doesn't mean a loss of quality, but choosing first DOES mean you're guaranteed to get stuff before it runs out. They DO keep going around with stuff though, so don't despair!) but standing and watching these careful artists at their work is entertainment enough.  I wasn't even thinking about the burrata until I watched this delicious dough fried up, and after the liberal shower of Parmesan grated that followed, the only thing keeping me from reaching over and just snatching one were the sharp knives in the chefs' hands. Aside from being first-dibs or watching creations, as the pace of the evening slowed down from the hectic prepping and a la carte orders, the staff turned around and were open to conversation. THIS was my favorite part of SBP - upon finding out I was traveling alone from NY, a few staff easily opened up and told their own stories of living/working in the city. The conversations drifted from the demise of Brooklyn (goddamn hipsters), to the Picasso(?) tattoos on their arms, to the thoughts and inspirations behind the selections available that night. During the course of the conversation, I put the fate of my dessert in their capable hands and was not steered wrong. -- milk chocolate sesame crunch with clementine cocoa jam -- chocolate-coconut 'ice cream' sandwich, pecan strudel--pineau des charentes (DELICIOUS butterscotch taste) I love the concept.  I love the funky artistic design (including state birds in the bathroom).  I love $3-5 local beers.  I love going in not knowing what you're going to get and being surprised by interesting combos - some whoah!, some oh cool, yum. Overall, my favorite thing was the textures. Creamy cold burrata on crisp outside chewy inside green garlic roll was my favorite.  I also love the ""standing chefs counter"" where you can stand and eat if you don't want to wait for a table.  Fun short night before a show at the Fillmore. San Francisco dining has coalesced in recent years into a drab monoculture that is an unhappy medium between overpriced American comfort food (thanks, Thomas) and overpriced, oversimple ""French"" country food (thanks, Alice).  The invariable Fried Chicken with Escarole and Guanciale for $25, the odious term ""house made"" prefixing every menu item, the Seasonal Disorder that requires us to eat all the same ingredients in their time -- this is religion, not dining.So I seek to find places that break the mold, if not entirely the orthodoxy.  State Bird Provisions is one such.  Their offerings do suffer from some of the city's nervous ticks about eating; witness the inexplicable obsession with overpriced ramps.  But in general the menu is innovative -- starting of course with the unbelievable, crispy fried State Bird.  It's far more delicious than the not-so-down-home fried fowl dishes elsewhere.Please do not miss the fried green garlic bread with burrata or the silky duck liver mousse with almond biscuits; certainly try the eel special if they have it; do not skip the pork-fried farro with a soft egg.  All of the desserts are great, especially the ice cream sandwich that impressively even outdoes Miette's excellent version.As if the excellent menu were not enough, State Bird Provisions also has a compelling Tray and Cart service: a bit of a ""Dim Sum""-style experience without the terrifying spectacle of Chinese ladies wielding kitchen shears.More impressive than the impeccable cart service is the entryway to the restaurant where the conviviality and sheer beauty of the food come to life.  Although they have sacrificed some curb appeal in placing the kitchen up front, entering a restaurant and seeing the freshest oysters with pickled kohlrabi being loaded onto carts more than compensates aesthetically.State Bird Provisions is substantial and necessary in a dining culture that is slouching towards high-end Chain Restaurantdom.  We need more restaurants like it. Had dinner here tonight. The concept is nice. The servers were nice. The food was...not so nice. The pancake special for tonight tasted mostly of pepper. I bit into a whole peppercorn and that's all I could taste. The trout dish (which was on the menu) was so salty that it overpowered all other flavors....and basically, that was the theme for the evening for the 6 things we got: each dish had an ingredient that dominated and the food suffered due to it. So did our taste buds.I really wanted to like the meal. My friend had to make a reservation a month in advance so there was much anticipation, but also, when we arrived, everyone who worked there just seemed so nice, so I feel bad for writing this 2 star review, but the food really was disappointing. Maybe it was an off night or we just got the ""wrong"" things, but a truly great restaurant is consistent and not ""hit or miss."" I'm glad others had a great experience here. I wish I could say that I did, too. Welcomed with a smile even w/o a reservation. Chefs seem so happy and food was delicious. Pastry chef is adorable and so are her desserts. I had a coconut cake that gave me goosebumps. Concept is neat. Said yes to everything, filled up and during dessert saw all these new dishes come out. :-( my recommendation - take your time and pace yourself,  you never know what might be coming out next! Very interesting concept. Dim sum style in a hipster restaurant atmosphere. Came here on a Thursday night with reservations and there were people waiting for a table. The place isn't large though and there are some counter seating too.So the positives...- Excellent atmosphere- The concept is unique and it made for an interesting experience- There were new food combinations and texture with the small dishes that worked and was enjoyable to taste- Overall good service- They are tapas/dim sum/small plate style I know, but felt the price was a bit high for amount...for example, the kimchi pork belly w/clams was good, but there were 3 or 4 clams and 2 or 3 pork belly in the dish for $9. could have had a few more clams/pork. We had heard that the ""CA state bird provisions"" was their specialty. Cooked well as meat tender and juicy and outside was nicely crispy. However, the ""full"" order had 2 small legs for $16.Overall, I enjoyed the dinner and the experience. I really liked ""Quail with Accompaniments"".  Sorry, I mean State Bird Provisions.Our server was actually the chef owner.  I didn't find out until the end of the evening.  I am always impressed with the food knowledge of servers in high end SF restaurants, but he really impressed me with his food knowledge and enthusiasm.  Someone who is so passionate about his business that he would actually get THAT close to the customer is really inspiring.  Obviously, the service was amazing!!!I love state bird provisions because like Bar Agricole, Bar Bambino, Mission Chinses food, and a few other restaurants, it seems to stand out among the crowd. Every SF restaurant seems to have the same format and the same style of food.  I love cal cuisine, yummy salads, etc., but SF has about 100 of these restaurants.   I like places in SF that try and branch out and be bold and different.  State bird provisions has a very unique yet simple decor.  It has an open kitchen.  It has a dim sum style format.  And it also has standing chef's counter.  All of these things are very unique, fun, and a welcome edition to the SF food landscape.  The crowd is not Marina (which tends to be a bit yuppie), or Mission (which tends to be a bit hipster).  The crowd is just the right mix of normal urban food lovers.The food is simply amazing.The portions are small, but well priced. You get the opportunity to try many different flavor combinations without going broke or feeling cheated.  The food had was an ode to Korean, Swedish, Southern Chinese, Northern Chinese cuisine.  It also had very compelling Modern American/Italian/Cal influences as well. Other people have made specific comments about the food, so I will defer to them. If I had one negative about the restaurant, it is actually the unique format.  I like that it is unique, but dim sum format doesn't work for high end cuisine.  I think of food as an experience or a work of art.  One should contemplate and savor their food.  Pacing is very important to achieving these goals.  At a dim sum style, you see great food pass by and you just want to grab it.  Next thing you know, you have 5 amazing dishes on your table that demand attention.  You don't have time to really focus on the flavor combination of one dish because you have four others in front of you.  This is a minor gripe and can be easily fixed by exercising some restraint. If you have been on the fence about this restaurant, it is time to take a risk and try something different! I highly recommend this place. Came here for a google sponsored event.  This was a very interesting restaurant.  First of all this place is easy to miss.  Very small entrance and a narrow dinning room. So look carefully when looking for the entrance. Second, the food was a combination of spanish tapas, asian and american cuisine.  Just a very diverse menu. The service was great and they have a very good wine selection.Dinner:-duck liver mousse with almond biscuit (Yummy creamy goodness! Must order!)-tuna tartare & quinoa with bonito-rosemary (not bad. nice and light)-sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancakes (it was ok.  I prefer the langos at bar tartine.  Its a nice carb to have at the table though)-kimchi-pork belly with tofu and clams (reminds me of a soon du bo tofu soup)-beef short rib 'salad', radishes & bone marrow  (oh! so tender! I wish this dish was bigger!)-glazed pork ribs with spigarello & togarashi (nice portion of tender meat slides off the bone ribs)Dessert: we ordered all the dessert on the menu but the one that really stood out was the 'rocky road ice cream' sandwich.  Perfect dessert! Chocolate and Ice cream.  How could you say no. I had wanted to try this place for so long that when my BF had a family emergency, I scrambled to find a friend so I could keep the res.  Glad I did: love the concept of dim sum-style food; the vibe (waiters seem like they are having fun, and are competent too).  Only a few of the dishes were stellar, but none was bad, and the total ($96 pre-tip and $34 of it was for wine) surprisingly low.  If it weren't for their ridiculous UrbanSpoon reservation system (c'mon, there is a reason why OpenTable is the standard: it works)...I'd be a regular. Met the fabulous Bella W here for a belated make-up dinner. It was pouring rain with thunderstorms so it just added to the excitement of the meal. Made reservations but had to wait 20 mins. Kind of a downer but we made small talk with the chefs and they made waiting tolerable.On to the food. So we had the following:kimchi-pork belly with tofu and clamsduck neck dumplings in sauerjusmoked duck fingerling potato saladasparagus with pickled egg gribiche, nuts & seeds'green garlic bread' with burratapork fried farro & ramps, red wine braised turnipand a smoked trout dish which was actually one of my favorites. The first two (kimchi pork belly and duck neck dumplings) were my least favorite. The flavors in the first one didn't really pair well (and the pork was a bit overcooked) and there was anything that stood out about the dumplings except maybe the dough.The rest, however, was amazing. Really well executed and we had some helpful servers to give us the lowdown on the food.Looking forward to taking the lady here and some friends for a fun night out.This is a creative way to serve food and I hope it catches on. Really interesting idea and executions. First the easy stuff. The waitstaff was mixed - the servers bringing food were great, our actual waitress had a bit of an attitude. Also, does anyone else wish they replaced plates and silverware more often? They only did for us when we got to dessert. Oh, also the portions are really small. I tend to eat a lot and was in no way full after trying almost everything they offered.Recommendations:State bird with provisions, obviouslyDuck neck dumplingsGarlic bread with cheese (I forget the kind)Tuna tartare with quinoaTroutAsparagus with lentilsTortilla ""salad"" with seafood soup (surprisingly generous with the seafood)Tapioca and ginger beignetsmeh:Smoked and creamed troutAsparagus with egg I loved this place. I had heard only about two sentences about this place before we got there and I hope by adding another good review I'm not making it that I will never get in again but I can't hold in my pleasure of this gem.Our server started surly (but cute surly) at first and warmed up like a cab left to breath, we loved her by the end of the evening. The tap pilsner was a great way to start our meal and the Barbera was bargain as we finished up. The dim sum concept works great with small plates as sometimes it's hard to judge quantity, I'm surprised no one has thought of this sooner. Interesting concept and ingredients.  Many unfamiliar flavor profiles.  I liked, but not necessarily thought everything was delicious.  Loud industrial dining room.  Fun throwback hip hop music.  Servers are on point and quite friendly, even the kitchen staff greeted and bid us farewell.  Recommend:-Ricotta pancakes, savory and quite good.-Duck dumplings, I wish there were more, my favorite of the evening-Clams, pork belly and kimchi, comforting, could have used more seasoning-CA state bird, liked the batter, thick and tasted healthy, succulent meat-Beef cheek and bone marrow salad, deliciously fatty-Jasmine blossom tapioca and ginger 'beignets', tied for 1st place, so good-Choco Szechuan  pepper ice cream sando w/pecan streusel, everything came together for a perfect bite, kind of hard to eat though, b/c the streusel is placed on the plateAlright:-Tuna tartare w/quinoa, the bonito and rosemary were almost nonexistent, which made it almost bland-Smoked trout, the croutons were rock hard, I don't even remember the fish-Pork fried farro, ramps and farm egg, too much acidReally reasonable pricing for this sort of dining, 7 savory, 2 desserts and 2 glasses of wine for $119 including tip and tax. Had dinner tonight at State Bird. Not impressed. Exceptionally dull interior, very nice people, some good food but a total mishmash-- the dim sum dinner concept just doesn't work for me. I really like this restaurant,. but more for the experience than the food. 3 stars for food5 stars for service and creativity of presentation==4 stars totalWhat I liked:- The staff was friendly and accommodating. Our waitress spontaneously suggested alterations they could make in dishes which she thought we might like. - They do a dim-sum style service, where they walk around with small plate dishes on a tray or cart, with a price card standing in the middle. You can decide what looks good at get it immediately- The dishes were creative and tasted good.All in all, it was a very fun experience.On the slight downside: - We had to wait 25 minutes past our reservation time. I do understand that they're busy and popular.- The attractive looking dishes coming by made us eat a bit more than we would have otherwise... clever idea, that dim sum style service!- Everything tasted good, but not over-the-top great. I'll definitely be back at State Bird Provisions and I hope to be able to give them that extra star!Cost: $65 for two, including wine, dessert and one or 2 extra dishes we ordered from the carts! I'm on the fence between a 3.5 and a 4, but since the flavors were awesome and unique I just rounded up.DISCLAIMER! Do not come if you are starved, as the portions are small and it is easy to rack up the bill, especially when things are brought to your table and you're like ""why not.""  Yes, it is completely like dim sum style, where food is brought to the table and you can decide if you want it or not.  Unlike dimsum style, the plates range $7-$10, and each plate is made to be shared among maybe 2 people at most. Must haves and highlights:-Duck liver mouse -STATE BIRD WITH PROVISIONS - the best damn quail I've ever had-Fry bread with burrata cheese and fresh cracked pepperEverything else was just meh...however the clams with pork belly and kimchi really tasted like home cooked asian food. It had great clean flavors. But for 2 clams, and 2 pieces of pork belly, not worth the price when my mama can replicate it. I've never seen a restaurant like this one before! The idea is very clever. American food served like asian dim sum. It's like eating a surprise every time! Waiters and waitresses walk around with whatever the chef makes and you decide if you want to try it or not. If you're an adventurous, experimental fat foodie like me, you'll like this place. The search for the restaurant itself was quite an interesting experience-- it's very discreet and hidden off to the side. Definitely give it a try =) Saturday night was fun and yet, still home by 10!  Met some new friends out for an early dinner.  Prior to this, we weren't sure what we wanted to do or where we wanted to go, but we'd been itching to check this place out since the guy is an office neighbor to the ol' ball n chain.  Gathered up his old co-workers/my new friends and decided to check his new place out.I rarely really know what to expect from a new restaurant.  Whether it's been open for  years or fairly new, I may check yelp or just go in with a fresh palate.  I went for the latter and was pleasantly surprised.  The whole dining experience is exactly like dum sum.  Rather than delicious Asian treats, this was like really good tapas with the freshest ingredients.  In fact, even the fried stuff still tasted clean and light.  We basically decided to get one of everything, some beer, and a bottle of wine.  Price-wise, we ate great for 4 folks and I paid less than what I paid when going out to Range for just two folks.  Hope that gives some perspective for the frugal little man that lives in your wallet.Check this out.  I say go early, get a great meal, hang out in the hood or Japantown.  Maybe even check out some karaoke at Festa (just posted a review on that lil gem). Creative American food served dim sum style... Yes please. Overall my wife and I had about 12 different dishes, they were all pretty good, although none were spectacular. Some highlights of the night:  financier with duck liver moussetofu saladbraised beef and bone marrow saladtuna tartareSmall portion dishes means trying out more different flavors which makes dinging out more fun. I thoroughly enjoyed what Stuart Brioza and Nicole Kransinski have brought to SF. The staff here is also was warm and delightful. I will definitely be back if I can get a good reservation. Highly recommended. You think it's a tacky idea at first, but then you realize that it frickin' works. First off, let me be clear that I write this out of love.  (It takes a lot for me to actually write a Yelp review.)  On food alone, SBP is my favorite new restaurant in the City, and I think one of the best food experiences in the city period.That said, after my last experience, I'm convinced they have some service issues that they really need to correct.  We arrived for a 9:30 Wednesday (the only reservation you can generally get within a few weeks) and waited until around 9:50 to be seated.  Not a particularly big deal, but it would be nice if the host would at least acknowledge it, given that they must know 95% of their 9:30 reservations are because people HAD to book then, not because they wanted to....The real issue was once we sat down and our server proceeded to VERY casually (many older patrons would probably say ""rudely"") explain how because it's late, a few carts will still come around but we should probably just order the stuff we want.  After you've waited 20 extra minutes on an already late reservation, that's a pretty big bummer for the server to basically imply they're winding down, so just forget the primary concept of the restaurant and order.... If you need to start closing up at 10, that's fine.... but don't seat people then and treat them as an afterthought.  Just cut off the reservations at 9.I think part of the issue is that at SBP, the service is always very casual.  My first two visits, this was part of the charm, because it really adds to the fun/whimsy of a blowoff.     Again, i love the food.  All three trips have offered new, exciting stuff that just isn't happening anywhere else in the city.  But regardless of how great the food is, I left feeling embarrassed for the people at how non-chalant they were about pretty crappy service.  I'm sure I'll be back, but I really wouldn't recommend doing the late reservation... and hope the staff isn't reading too much of their own good press to hold themselves to a higher standard than what we experienced the other night. I liked, but didn't love it. Nice industrial space. Some of the food was better than others. The highlights were me were the ice cream sandwich, the lamb, the green garlic bread, and the quail. Found the food a bit greasy. The ribs were not special.The banshee wine was good. I'd go back, but wouldn't fight for a seat! I am disappointed I didn't like this place more. I loved the concept of small dishes and tasting a little of everything. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a WOW dish here.*duck liver mousse with almond biscuit $5 (2 of 5) Not complimentary to my taste buds. I was really surprised this savory and sweet combo was a failure. Each component was great. Duck liver was smooth and light. Almond was light and delicate. But when I ate it together, I didn't like it.*kimchi-pork belly with tofu and clams $8 (3 of 5) I expected a more savory taste from the pork belly or a seafood blast from clams, but neither tastes shined. This small pot of goodies was quite mellow. In fact, I think stewing the contents with the kimchi vegetable chemically made it more bland.*sm. duck, celery root & date salad $6 (3 of 5) Smoke Duck was savory and tasted like strong piece of ham. But I didn't favor too highly with the date pairing. I guess I am just not a dates kind of person. Again, sweet and savory, but not to my liking.*CA state bird with provisions quail (3 of 5) Was like skinny version of buttermilk chicken. Tasty, but not very filling. Delicate dish, but a lot of work, for very little meat.*glazed pork ribs with spigarello & togarashi $10 (3 of 5) It was ok.I really wanted to like this place more. They pushed out little dishes like at a dim sum restaurant and marked up your bill with the different priced items. So cute, but the dishes were just not to my liking... Go right now. This may be my new favorite restaraunt.  Went in for brunch today (no reservations accepted) and was absolutely floored.  Plenty of veggie options. Nested egg (poached egg nestles in green garlic bread) and polenta custard (with hazelnuts, strawberries, yogurt) were absolutely phenomenal. Side of yukon potatoes (a nice-sized portion) and the painperdu (think haute french toast) were equally tasty.  Really nice people work there too. After a spate of bad reviews which I have been forced to write, I am pleased to announce that my last visit to the culinary temple which is State Bird Provisions is unequivocally given the highest marks.  Fancy?  no  Amazing art on the walls?  no, unless you like simplistic mural size yarn art.  Truly unforgettable flavors?  yes!Yes, yes yes!A great approach to small plates dining, emulating the dim sum cart form of service in a fashion which is approachable and pleasant.  Our experience took us through a variety of tastes and textures which were creative from end to end.  Presentation on creative plateware, simple yet attractive plate up arrangement, intoxicating, alluring aromas and spot on delivery with sumptuous flavor.Stuart Brioza and Nicole Krasinski both formerly of Rubicon, have really knocked one out of the park at State Bird.  Aptly they named their signature dish after it, which is a wonderfully coated delicious fried quail served over onion confit, and garnished with shaved Parmagiano-Reggiano.  Love starts here...But the love does not end...The onslaught of flavor comes forth with some wonderful little courses, there is so much to mention.  It just keeps coming.  You'll have to find out for yourself just how good it is, but trust me, rather than me listing out each course exhaustively, just go try it.  Though good luck with getting a reservation these days, its a little tight.    But trust me, if I say the best dish that I had was cured tongue with pickled veggies, then you know the rest is going to be unforgettable!Let the lovefest begin! The only word you need to know here is ""YES"".""Would you like some of _______?"" say the servers as they walk by your table with little plates and bowls full of steamy goodness which are not dim sum.  YES.""Would you like to order ________  off the menu in addition to the things you're ordering straight from the trays?""  YES.""Would you like me to bring you another bottle of ___________?""  YES.""Since you're here celebrating 2 birthdays would you like to order every single dessert on the menu?""  YES YES and YES.  I came, I ate, I drank, I left carrying a 5-month old food baby and I spent the next day in a food coma... so much wonderful, delicious, rich, tasty, unique food.  So much red wine.  And what about that little $2 World Peace peanut muscovado milk dessert drink?  I think it was one of the most refreshing things I've ever tasted.  I loved the novel concept here and believe I did it up right by coming as a party of 4 (enabling me to taste almost everything).  The restaurant itself isn't much to wow over but  I was having such a great time that mattered not a bit.  With a YES attitude, I tried every damned thing on that menu + everything that walked by my table give or take a few people on their way to the restroom.  Great concept, great execution, great food, great servers.  YES, YES, and YES. 2 words to describe this place: creative and delicious. Each dish we had was exploding with flavors and 'mmm's'. My advice: Drink all the broths!You've probably read from other reviews that they come around with small dishes like dim sum restaurants although you can order ala carte off the menu as well.Really creative spot with just really good good creative food.Amazing desserts as well. I love earl gray and they had an earl gray panna cotta. Real good. Not too sweet and just the right amount of tea flavor.Might be my new favorite place to spurge for some really amazing food that ! wont be able to find anywhere else.FYI - my friends and i (party of 4) made a reservation at 6:30 Monday about a month and a half ago. It's busy and the buzz of the town right now. Hopefully you wont have to wait that long but if you do- it will be worth it. Expectations ran a little high when it took a 30 day advance booking to get an 8PM slot on a Monday, but glad to report that this place is well worth the effort.Wine and beer, with both lists looking quite interesting.The quirky dim sum thing is not overdone and felt pretty natural.  The warm and friendly service helped to make it work.  The mains you order, then they pass small places now and then in case you want some immediate gratification.  Even the mains seemed designed to share.Dining here felt special and fun.  It certainly helped that the food was consistently stellar.My friend and I sampled the garlic bread with burrata, halibut with toasted quinoa, duck neck dumpling, fried quail (the state bird), short ribs, smoked trout salad, roasted asparagus with some other veggies made into a sauce, cacao soda (think cream soda), and the coconut chocolate ice cream sandwiches.I was stuffed, might have skipped the smoked trout salad in hindsight, but it was all great.  Cost was about 120 out the door for two. In the beginning, I was attracted to this place solely for it's dim sum cart concept but after my meal here, I would say the food is going to bring me back. It was unique, creative and delicious. There were a few dishes that missed the mark for me but overall it was a great meal.Kimchi clams w/ pork belly ($8), sourdough pancakes ($6) and the smoked trout w/ creme fraiche are the dishes I would NOT order again. However, the fluke tartare ($6) was amazing and so was the little bite of avocado wrapped with guanciale ($2/bite). The duck neck dumplings ($6), duck salad ($6), garlic bread w/burrata ($8), fried quail ($8/half order), trout with hazelnuts ($9/half order) were all great as well. For dessert, we had the earl gray panna cotta ($4) and the poppyseed profiterole ($4). Both were great. We also had the peanut milk ($2) something I would not order again. It literally tasted like milk and peanuts. I couldn't taste the muscovado. There was just nothing special or unique about it. Some items required ordering off the menu. I would get rid of the menu and serve everything off the dim sum cart. I think the menu took us away from the unique ""dim sum"" experience.The staff was nice and service was good. Few dollars here, few dollars there adds up very quickly. It does take many dishes to feel full so the meal doesn't come out cheap but it's fun and well worth it. Our meal came out about $120 for the two of us, no alcohol but including tip.The menu changes often so I'm looking forward to go back! Hipster service by people who act as if they know they'll be working somewhere else in a few weeks. I went here for brunch the first weekend they stated serving brunch. I loved the quail signature dish and my friend's toad in the hole was also pretty tasty. I'd like to go back for dinner to try out more dishes. I thought it was a good compromise for foodies with non-adventurous friends. They have things like bone marrow and kimchi cocktails for the adventurous and simpler things like mimosas and eggs for the non-adventurous. yummy.  but dropping in for a later dinner (only 9:30) meant that there was no more tray/dim sum service - i missed out on the novelty factor and two of our dishes arrived lukewarm.  the ones that didn't, however, were delicious.  outstanding, even.  the cast iron lentil dish comes to mind.  don't go late.  i wouldn't again - but will most likely return.....at an earlier hour and be more particular about getting things fresh out of the kitchen! We really enjoyed it.  Had about 15 dishes between wife and I.  All were unique.  None bad.  Majority of them stellar.It won't be everyone's favorite, but it is one everyone should try.For us, it was a real treat and we will return..  Bill for plenty of food, two glasses of wine, tip, and tax $170.  For everything else, there is master card. EXTRODINARY!! Yes I dared to do a walk in with no reservation, on a Saturday, after heeding the advice of the reservationist on HOW to get in without waiting weeks or getting a 1030 crappy reso. Nicole, the reservationist said the best bet is to show up before opening at 6pm and most likely I will get a table at one of the tables they keep for walk ins. We get there at 545 with 7 pl in line. I quickly hopped out of the car while the hubby fought for parking in Jtown, while I braved the freezing cold and torential wind chill to get some (hopefully yummy food) and waited amongst other foodies in line.The door promptly opens at 6pm and the entire line rushes in, orderly, but obviously anxious to see if they can get a table. The couples in front of me were able to score tables, and then they cut it off at US! NOOOOOOO....The hostess kindly told us it would be a 90 minute wait, OR we could take one of the 4 ""stand up"" only tables at the kitchen/bar. Basically they have 4 placesettings in a bar like area in the entrance to the restaurant that faces the open kitchen.  No seats..We walked over, and thought it was abit akward but hey what the heck we got in!!Unbeknownst to us, this was the best decision ever.....not only did we get first dibs on the carts coming out, we got to see everything the cooks and sous chefs were making, plating, etc. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY Chef Stuart Brioza YES FORMER RUBICON CHEF himself served us!!   That was such a special treat and he was the most polite and took his time (with a packed house) to explain to us the menu and the house specialties.we were so excited to be able to talk to chef himself about each dish, and he was equally excited to talk to us about all of his creations. Since we were eating practically in the kitchen, we got to see them plate everything and put it onto the dim sum cart before it rolled out to the main dining room. As we were eating, i told the hubby this is the best seat in teh house!! the main dining room, albiet nice, but it was small and DARK. I wouldnt have had such a good time eating there really as you can barely see the food and just being in that open air kitchen and seeing them cook and then serve you was just so special and unique!Almost everything we had was very, very good, and each dish was special and creative in its own way. All the flavors in each dish was uniqe, and this is very hard to do when you have so many small dishes on the menu. We basically had all the must eats on the menu, and were stuffed. we had:Oysters on half shell- really fresh kumamotos wiht house made vinegrette. at $2 a pop so worth it!Steelhead caviar chip n dip- chef said they cure it in house and make everything fresh. This was my favorite. The steelhead caviar had a nice pop to it and not overly salty at all. IT was perfect and I could eat this all day long!Fluke tartare, quinoa, with bonito rosemary aioli-this dish was refreshing and interesting. Between the bites of the raw fish, ,the toasted crunchy quinoa and the aioli, you had a mix of textures in your mouth. It was like a party in your mouth!Duck liver mousse with almond biscuit- oh so good. SO GOOD. YUM. THey make the mousse in house  and also have a pastry chef making the little biscuits. Mousse wasnt too salty or overpowering while the hint of sweetness in the biscuit complimented it so nicely. The biscuit was more like a cake like thing. I could eat them all day too!Pickle plate- beef tongue, potato and veg pickles- oh man this dish was very tasty and interesting. They pickle the beef tongue in house, so tender and flavorful, with the slightest pickled taste. The veggies -carrots, potatoes were also pickled and oh so good. This was probably my 2nd fav dish. Green garlic bread with burratta- Anything burrata I do love. I saw the pasty chef making the green garlic bread fresh. It looks like a pretzel, they fry it, then pile up some fresh burrata on top. Great hung over snack!Ca State bird with provisions- basically the deep fried quail. I was talking to sous chef and we saw him making this dish and he said it was their specialty. We tried to find out what mixture he used to fry it with- something with flour, ground up pistachios and some other things. It was light, crispy, flavorful, and very tender and moist.-- did I mention he was also cute??!! We admired the rest of the night all of his fabulous creations like two little food groupies on crack.Beef cheek salad, radishes and bone marrow- I had high expectations for this considering it said ""bone marrow"". The presentation is great, and chef comes by to pour you the dressing out of a little ceramic thing that looks like bone marrow. The beef cheeks were cooked perfectly while the greens gave it a nice texture. I was expecting more flavor, the hubby loved it. Milk chocolate sesame crunch, clementine cocoa jam- were stuffed but chef convinced us otherwise! duck neck dumplings/ sauerjus-soo good. DO IT!!Cant wait to go back! Wow! This is a true neighborhood gem - truly incredible. As other reviewers have posted, small dishes are served dim sum style. There is also a short menu from which additional items can be ordered. Our favorites were:fluke tartar - knock your socks off good.sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancakes - whoa, dude. amazing.coconut cake - tasty little treatLove the owner too - he greeted each guest at the door and gave off a happy energy. Will be back again and again! What an interesting, different concept... delicious tapas served dim sum style!  Except, they don't use the loaded dim sum carts normally seen in chinese restaurants... the servers walk around with the tapas on a tray, and are gracious enough to explain each tapa and answer questions.  Each dish we had was great, I can't specifically remember each item ordered but we did have some stand out memories:  the CA state bird with provisions (quail, i believe) was perfectly cooked, moist, flavorful, amazingly executed.  The bone marrow dish was great- I totally f'd my s when the waiter poured the bone marrow straight out of the bone onto the flatbread... I can't remember when was the last time I got that excited when a dish was served.  All dishes had beautiful presentations and amazing flavors- I love it when restaurants take ingredients that normally don't work together and create something harmonious- this is what State Bird Provisions does best.The 'world peace' peanut muscovado milk was amazzzzzing- at a whopping $2 i highly highly suggest trying this.  Literally a liquid peanut butter cup, I could have drank a whole glass of this deliciousness if possible! Yay for State Bird! My first visit was a proper sit-down meal with friends of the owners so we got some nice extras from the kitchen and the food and company were fantastic- the crispy duck dumplings in sauerkraut jus were amazeballs as well as the braised pork belly and trumpet mushrooms, but we confirmed State Bird a total win on our second visit when we took a visiting friend there and the food was so delicious that we didn't even notice that we'd been eating fully upright on our feet at the standing bar for 2 hours. Duck dumplings and state bird sublime again, check. Green garlic bread with burrata, glazed back ribs, seafood salsa, and mandarin aspic with avocado, OMG. Earl Grey panna cotta, sesame crunch with chocolate/orange jam and peanut milk divine. But the rosemary 'ice cream' (semifreddo) sandwich, holy shit. My mouth was so ecstatic from getting to try so many creative combinations of flavors that I kept involuntarily clapping. Watching the kitchen staff do their thing from the standing bar was really cool too. Totally agree with the reviewer who said that eating here is a great chance to get a wonderful tasting menu at an affordable price. No wonder a crowd was waiting patiently to sit on a rainy Wednesday night- none of us wanted to leave! First things first: if we can't pluck the state flower why can we eat the state bird? Mr Valley Quail you need to get the lawyer that the poppies got. Anyways, dim sum/tapas made in San Francisco isn't a new concept, but it's the Western style of dim sum that State Bird Sanctuary serves. It's quite cozy and the wonderful dishes are coming right from their kitchen as fast as they can. With all the animal bits and pieces (duck neck, pork jowl, trout flank) this place is probably not good for vegetarians. On a mission to start trying the hip, hyped restaurants of the moment.  SBP seemed like a good place to start.Ended up with Wednesday 9:30 pm rez. Arrived early but were seated pretty much at 9:30. There is nowhere to sit if you are waiting for a table. We stood against the wall with 6 other people.  The guy at the front getting drinks was very nice.  He had me try 3 different wines to find one I liked.Once seated, I was alread starving, and so  grabbed the first thing that came around- duck neck dumplings with a sauerjus(?) sauce. It was tasty. The sauce was odd. Definitely sour. Interesting combo, but one that I'm not sure worked for me.  I was so hungry I hardly tasted the dumpling. 2 per order. I tried more sauce on its own. Kind of like creamy sauerkraut juice soup. I liked it but there was so much sauce/broth in the bowl, it seemed like a waste, since there was no bread or anything else with which to eat it.My friend got tuna tartare with quinoa and bonita flakes. Odd. But she said the more she ate, the more it grew on her.  The combination of textures was interesting. Crunchy, soft, chewy.  To me the prevalent flavor was the bonito flakes.Next up was the shaved veg salad with a sort of ceviche salsa. yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG….  The rock shrimp in the salsa were fantastic. But I wanted more of the seafood! The shaved veggies were baby root vegs with the greens attached. I was a little confused- I don't usually eat carrot tops. In fact, I've read they can be poisonous. But I ate them. Mostly tasted the salsa. It was good, but I sure would have loved a bowl of the seafood salsa.I was very excited about the kimchi/porkbelly/clam/tofu stew. yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG…. It sounded great! But I was not thrilled with it.  Why? Because I didn't consider that it would be spicy, and having never had pork belly before, I was surprised at how little I like it. Why is pork belly so popular?! It's basically like the chunks of fat on pork chops that I avoid. Not the food's fault, just not my thing.  It looked great, though.My favorite dishes were the green garlic bread with burrata and the sourdough pecorino ""pancakes"" (tiny, blini size things) yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG…. Both were tasty, carby and cheesy. I'd like a giant version of the pancakes. And maybe a garlic bread thing to myself. Dessert - yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG….  Neither of us could understand the rave reviews about the peanut milk.  A tiny glass of peanut flavored milk. You know, there's a place on Divisadero near Haight that has had a sign for their homemade peanut milk for longer than I can remember. Perhaps that's where I've tried it before.  I've had it somewhere. The peace milk struck me as completely unspectacular. What is the big deal?!The tastiest was the coconut/custard thing with candied hazelnuts. Oh yeah! I would have liked a bigger piece!Milk Chocolate sesame crunch with citrus struck me as much darker than milk chocolate. It was tasty, but too dark for my taste.My unrefined palate says- interesting mix of food, many little tastes, but perhaps combinations with which I wasn't blown away.All that said, the presentation was fantastic. Really nice looking dishes. The service was also great. We both couldn't get over how friendly everyone was. Like they took happy pills. Nicely un-San Francisco.And I was surprised at how full I got from what did not appear to be a large quantity of food.FYI- I asked before going if the 9:30 rez would mean getting a reduced selection of the dim sum style food and was told it would not. But the food carts began to dwindle about 15 minutes after we were seated. I asked and they said they were slowing down for the evening. They did say we could order anything from the passing menu if we wanted, but admittedly, I was already kind of full by then. I'd definitely go again, but would go less hungry so I could be more discriminating in what I choose and more aware of the flavors of what I was eating. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner tonight, and this restaurant may just be one of the top 3 best dinners I have ever had in my entire life!  A little background: my career has been in hospitality and I have had the privilege to work with the finest chefs in the bay area so my critiques have been critical (although I will not blast it on Yelp).  I take all my reviews seriously.Food: Extraordinary.  The reinvented tapas style menu with carts is refreshing, the conceptual design of food assembly was clever and fresh, and the integration between education and social interaction was great.  The poached egg paired with smoked bonito flakes and beans was a fabulous play on textures and flavors: the mild soft egg integrated perfectly with the smokey bonito flakes, the crunchy cheese topping and the hearty texture of the beans.  The house made chips with creme fraiche and caviar was playful.  CA State Bird Provisions is a must have, as the delicate breading was fried to perfection and the texture of the bird itself is plump and juicy in a bed of sauerkraut.  And the trout was a knockout too: the kishus and hazelnut danced in my mouth with the smooth brown butter, but it did not overshadow the fresh taste of the trout.  We ordered a total of 8 tapas, but I am not listing everything because I will end up writing a novel.Service:   Top notch.  Sarah, our server, was on point at all times, and the nuances and attention to detail she had was amazing.  When she noticed we didn't have any plates of food on our table toward the end of the meal (we were waiting for more carts to come out), she expedited a few custom items for us.  Water in bottles were refilled without asking, she was consistently checking on our table without being overbearing, she was knowledgeable about the food preparation and ingredients in all items served that evening,  Candice was another food runner that noticed that she has come around twice to us with the raw bar and asked us was there anything else I haven't tried yet that she can grab for us.  Finally, a cute curly hair brunette with a neck scarf (don't know her name) who was also a runner remembered that I declined a dish that was with raw seafood (I'm allergic) and came back to me on several occasions with other non-raw fish items for me to try.  In conclusion, for all adventurous foodies out there, this is the place to be.  You will be blown away by the experience in more ways than ten, I guarantee it! Brilliant idea to pass around meal items so guests could 'eat with their eyes' first. Excellent food too - I was most impressed with the: fluke tartare, smoked duck salad, fried quail, peanut muscovado milk, and milk chocolate sesame crunch. And STUART BRIOZA IS PURE GENIUS!!! No matter how hectic it gets, he and his staff interact nonstop with guests, and let you in on the wonder of each item you choose. Their passion and sense of service melted me. Bravo! Hidden little gem!  A local to SF told us about this place (we were visiting from DC).  All I kept saying the whole time was ""holy crap this is amazing.""  The staff were super laid back, friendly and not pushy at all!  It was a very pleasant, romantic relaxed dinner.  Very pleasant and we can't wait to come back!!!! A  real fun place to  have dinner ! Dim Sum like trays or carts come around with small plates. You can also order off the small regular menu.All is fresh and tasty and has a fun surprise element in it. We especially loved the fluke tartare and the trout with kishus and hazelnut.One of the best I have tasted.I am not a fan of quail but here it is done nicely with delicious and light breading.Only small items need improvement, like ricotta pancakes. They had a slight bitter aftertaste as if the cheese was maybe a bit burned on top ? Couldn't figure it out. Otherwise the plate was great.And the dumplings were just  a bit on the bland side.But again nothing major.For dessert we had earl grey panna cotta which was delicious.Corkage is $ 20., we brought our own wine.We had a very nice dining experience here ! State Bird Provisions (or SBP as our group of foodies call it), is a nice change of pace restaurant. Yeah, it's 'dim sum' like but without the crazy, pushy servers and customers. First impression was great. SBP was a clean looking (and smelling) place. The servers were friendly and attentive. I also liked the fact that the customers were giving off positive vibes and smiling. Whereas in a typical dim sum place, I always feel like cattle -- get herded in, grazes, get herded out -- and the customers are usually pushy and competitive.We had some of the homemade chips and pancakes - yum! Also had a salad that was freshly made. We had a light meal (with ice tea) and it was very pleasant. Will definitely come back to try the more substantial dishes! Provisions is a really fun place to have dinner. They take a different approach to the restaurant experience by placing the kitchen at the forefront of the restaurant so you can see all the action! The fact that the food comes by you dim sum style is great too - you don't have to think about what to order and you can see exactly what you are getting. It takes the pressure and guesswork off so you can relax and let the friendly staff take over.  There is one thing that could use some improvement - certain dishes don't make it all the way through the dining room. So depending on where you are seated you could have last dibs.Overall, a fabulous place for a casual yet sophisticated meal and a whole lot of fun! Needless to say, everything we tried was terrific and I would go back many times over. Very solid restaurant. Had the potato chips with creme freche and steelhead roe.,Braised/BBQ'd ribs, some pancake deal, this is pointless, read the other reviews... The food was very tasty, but the problem for us was portions.  We spend $120, had three glasses of wine, but were starving by the time we left so we got take out chinese.  The pork ribs--$20 for two ribs? Ridiculous and in fact outrageous.   Dont go hungry or prepare to stay hungry. Great food and great concept! Excellent service!!! Great Great Great!Everything about this place is Great!Great Ambiance, Great Food, Great Location and a very enjoyable experience.This is a unique restaurant that puts it's own signature on the Dim Sum approach to food.Hosts bring fresh, hot and cold dishes around to the tables for guests to sample various dishes.Each dish is prepared fresh and the menu rotates, and portions of the menu are constantly changing, so you can  be sure to get a fresh and different delicacy on each visit.I LOVED the Duck Neck Dumplings. I hope the chefs' keep this one as a regular staple on the menu!!! Move over Yank Sing.  It's finally happened.  With the use of fancy ingredients, cute stationery, and hip decor, you can now watch your money drop out of your pockets with each stamp on the check while your hunger pangs laugh at you for even trying.  State Bird definitely puts an interesting (read: western) twist on dim sum.  I don't think we did a very good job ordering.  There was a dish with sesame seed encrusted goat cheese and tiny little vegetables, that while absolutely adorable, was somewhat bland.  Then there was a dish with potato chips and some kind of a salmon and dill dip.  I can appreciate that everything, including the chips, were probably made in-house, but aside from that, it felt as though it was another thing we could've thrown together on our own.  Finally, we ordered a dish with three rounds of some kind of meat (turkey? chicken? I don't remember) that came with (I think) a braised cabbage and prune.  It was a tasty combination.Our server and everyone who walked by were intent on reminding us that we could order off the menu at any time from any person.  Perhaps we should've followed their persistent insistence.  Next time, for sure. We were excited about this concept.  Small plates on carts.  While we could see the work that went into each plate we found most of the dishes missed the mark of something remarkable.  The deserts were something to return for. Only wish there was more to each plate. As much as I want you to read this review, you need to do me a favor first and open up another window and make a reservation at State Bird Provisions. Go ahead, I'll wait. Trust me, it's a good idea to do so now while there are still reservations to be had...if my dinner last night is any indication, a seat at SBP will be a hot ticket in no time. While being listed under tapas, the cuisine at State Bird Provisions is more like Hipster Dim Sum (Hip Sum?) You have the option of ordering off a set menu as well as picking items off trays and/or a cart being wheeled around the dining room by a friendly, knowledgeable staff. We ended up trying at least 10 different items and left stuffed to the gills. Highlights included duck neck dumplings, beef cheek salad with a bone marrow dressing, homemade potato chips with trout roe, duck prosciutto, pickled veggies with beef tongue, duck rillette with the most amazing financiers and pork belly & clams w/ kimchi stew.Yes, I listed a lot of highlights but truth be told, everything was fantastic. Actually, the one item I wasn't over the top excited about was the fried quail - it was good but I was glad we ordered the half portion, the hip sum items proved to be the stars. Oh, we also had some great desserts, definitely leave room! (and at prices ranging from $2-$6, it's easy to order a few to split) State Bird Provisions may be my new favorite restaurant in San Francisco (sorry, Frances) It's easy to create your own 10-12 course tasting menu without breaking the bank, and the atmosphere is incredibly hip and laid back for the quality of the food being produced. Good stuff, I'll be back soon! State BirdThis place is what happens when dim sum meets tapas meets hipster -- but in a good kind of way, with custom made, reclaimed teak, welded blue, red and wood carts pushed by the chef and sporting $6 provision size dishes that circulate the restaurant floor all night like a Jersey boy looking for a hot play. And these provisions are good! I actually stood at the kitchen counter, which is an excellent way to enjoy your meal, so long as there isn't a long line of folks standing right behind you. At the counter, you get time to watch your chefs make your food, admire their craft and craftiness, and even get to throw in a word or two in between plates running in and out of the broiler. It's a real experience and not just a meal; a sort of Disneyland for the culinary senses. When it came down to food, I had the crudite with goat cheese and toasted sesame that was quite fresh and refreshing, although not particularly accented one way or another. This I followed with the duck rillette with almond biscuit. Now, this is where you need to pause for a moment. Reading this dish's description you might find yourself very underwhelmed. I mean, what's the big deal about duck rillette and almond in particular? It's not like ducks and almonds grow on the same tree or feed from the same terroir after all. Well, think again. This combination of rillettes with a financier like ""biscuit"" is absolute genus. Whether accredited to Stuart (the chef) or not, I give him full credit for making them and making them oh so well. This is quite possibly the best preparation of duck rilletes that I've ever had. The secret, I'm told, is in the use of duck fat instead of butter to plump up those financier biscuits. And, it tells. These things are so rich and so perfectly matched to enliven the otherwise lean rillettes. The one-two flavor punch is just to die for. I applauded them -- with my hands, as did another patron as she was leaving for the night. Truly, there were accomplishments worth an ovation at this place.This stellar dish was followed by two dishes which did not particularly overwhelm my culinary sensibilities. They were good, but somehow they did not move the needle for me far above just nice. These were the duck neck dumplings in sauerjus, which are a kind of gyoza/pierogi inside a small soup made of sauerkraut juice, and the cauliflower, lentils and sunchokes, which was a curried dish that seemed to neither scream lentils, nor cauliflower, nor sunchokes and yet still managed to stay mildly nice. But no worries, this was just a short plateau in what picked up again into a nice crescendo: the sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino and ricotta pancakes and the green garlic bread with burrata. Ok, the pancakes I am just partial too. They're fried cheese pancakes. What can possibly go wrong with that? Nothing. And although I don't recall a strong taste of sauerness, I did like the seasoning quite a lot and especially the ground coriander that appeared all over the plate (idiot alert: i may be wrong about it being coriander, but that's how I remember it now). This dish was fine enough on its own, but then I saw one of the chefs roll out a fresh roll of green garlic bread, where the green and the garlic are mixed into the fresh dough which is then -- gasp -- deep fried. Oh boy, now I was getting short breathed with excitement. Fried dough with fried cheese?! oh, dear lord. And, the lord did provide. What a wonderfully fun dish. Served freshly fried, the burrata cheese is nestled inside of its bread roll like a puppy in its crib, and you ""just wanted to eat it,"" as my sister is ought to say of puppies in cribs. And eat it I did. Nomnomnom good.But that wasn't all. Oh, no. To top off my savory dish extravaganza, I took the half CA state bird: a deep fried quail with pepitas on top of a lemon-onion concoction that all put together is like a mad twist on chicken piccata meets the deep fryer minus the waffle. Deep brown in color and tender and juicy this dish was just pure success, and I am honored to have shared in it. What a great recommendation from the chef, who had been guiding my selection throughout the night. Another great perk of standing at the counter and not being a lazy bum at a table (I'm venting a bit for not having wanted to wait 30 mins for a table to open; it's acceptable. Look it up in the Yelp rule book). And so, my meal ended, but not the fun. Dessert. It has to come. I mean, it has to, right?And come it did. Twice. A truly multi-orgasmic finish to an already stimulating meal is what I got when I ordered the ""world peace"" peanut muscavado milk and the warm cornmeal custard, walnuts and huckleberries desserts. Yelp is limiting how much I can write about it, so you'll have to go try these on your own. And, if I was living in San Francisco, I'd be telling all my friends about this place, because without doubt the bird is the word. Word. I really wanted to like this place, but I was pretty underwhelmed.First off, the format is cool in theory - small plates come around a la your typical dim sum restaurant. i get it, you're trying your best at shifting some paradigms. that's fine. However, one big difference is that when the dim sum steam cart comes around, the food that is presented to you is actually hot because, well, it's coming out of a steam cart. At SBP, the ""hot"" dishes that come out are often times just room temperature, because they've been hanging out for a little bit before they get to your table. Sure there are dishes that don't need to be hot so those make it to your table at the temperature you'd expect. I can get over the dining experience issues, but the food is where this place fell flat. With a few exceptions everything was pretty lackluster. Of all the dishes we had, the standouts were a fluke sashimi with blood orange vinaigrette and a dessert consisting of creamy polenta with huckleberries. Both were superbly executed.beyond that, the flavor profile of many of the dishes seemed, in the words of my wife, ""rounded."" I'd describe them as muddled, unfocused, and even downright bland at times (pseudo-casear salad - i'm looking at you). I know it isn't fine dining, but i expected a lot more from the kitchen, given the hype. For the record, duck pate does not work well with cornbread. Bone marrow in dressing on a beef cheek salad comes across as a ham-fisted. The texture of a hazelnut does not add the right kind of flair to a mushroom salad. Many of the kitchen's decisions just seemed clunky. A for effort but C for execution.And If i'm paying $20 for FOUR pork ribs, i expect them to be the best ribs i've ever had. Sure, they were falling off the bone, but to me, they were rather dry and poorly seasoned. I'll head down to Texas and get a bucket of them for that price and be a much happier customer. To their credit, the staff was awesome, service was great, as was the booze selection. i know i fall in the small minority on my assessment of SBP. I can accept that. Maybe I just hit it on an off night. However, with all the other tasty options available in this city, i don't think State Bird Provisions will be getting another chance to send me home with $100 less in my pocket. OK, so we wanted to try this American dim sum place. It ended up to be quite an expensive meal and we were not even half full. The idea might be cute but half of the dishes we ordered were just ok.  The beef tongue, the beef cheek salad, tuna with Quinoa, chips with their own dipping would be the only dishes I recommend. Their signature dish was over rated. The quail itself is very tender but the batter was way too thick. Only go there if you want to try something different but not necessarily looking for a nice dinner One of my favorite new places. It's fun, different, new style (American Dim Sum) and super creative.We went with friends and we able to try a bunch of dishes, and here is my list of ""must haves""Tuna Tartare & quinoaDuck Rillette with almond 'biscuit'Beef tongue, potato and veg pickledDuck neck dumplingsCA state bird with provisionsTrout with hazelnuts, and brown butter (!!)Ricotta cavatelli with wild mushroomsand my need to try list:Sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancakesdesserts were playful, and my top pick is the Warm cornmeal custard, huckleberries & walnuts, while the milk chocolate sesame crunch and clementine-cocoa jam was awesome as well. spiced butter cookies with carrot jam was refreshing from the common overly sweet desserts.we got here for super late reservations, 10:30, but everything was still available. we were given the dim sum menu with the regular menu, but did get to see the cart pass by. for 4, plus at least 9-10 drinks, price was really reasonable. Eating here is like going to a friend's house for dinner, a friend who can cook and has a fancy kitchen.  These guys are like mad scientists producing delicious pieces of art...lots of layers, texture and flavor.  I've come here a handful of times and each visit feels like the first, sometimes they take former dishes and reconstruct them as a new experience the following week.  That's why I love coming back here, that and their passion that leaks through (from the chefs to the servers to the diners).  Oh, and also (if you don't mind standing) the best ""seats"" in the house are to the right of the Chef expeditor...it's the standing bar in front of where the cookin' is happening so you'll get first dibs on what comes out.  It also feels like you're hanging out at the counter of your friend's fancy kitchen.  Casual and yum!*note*  also admire the asymmetrical ceramic plates Chef Brioza made during his break between Rubicon and SBP...a true artist! This was my favorite dinner restaurant in all of San Francisco. I loved the concept of this restaurant (maybe because I'm a huge fan of dim sum and I get more excited when I can physically see the food I'm about to order in front of my face). My recommended dish would be the braised ox tail flat bread that came around on a tray (not on the menu). The pork ribs were also a favorite at our table. It can be on the pricier side (I think we spent about $100 including tip for just the two of us - but we kind of splurged since it was somewhat close to Valentine's Day) but if you pay attention to how many dishes you're consuming you can stay way below what we spent. I recommend trying the desserts too. A lot of the time desserts can be an afterthought but we went in knowing we wanted to try at least a couple and thank god we did. My favorite dessert was the pear ice cream sandwich. Seriously. Try this place if you're in Pacific Heights.God I want to go back to San Francisco. Awful, awful dining experience. There was not one good thing I got out of dining at State Bird Provisions. I'm going to try to keep this story short, for my sake, because I really don't wish to relive this horrid occurrence any more than I have to. I know that State Bird just opened about a month ago, so I'm really trying to avoid sounding overly harsh, given that the staff is new, blah blah. I can forgive things like slower seating or minor mistakes like that. But what happened was not minor. Our easy-peasy short two-item order was somehow lost between our table and the kitchen (distance of 30 feet, no joke) Really? REALLY??? I can hardly think of anything worse than completely omitting an entire table's orders.So there we sat, the boy and I, 45 minutes later still waiting for our plates, being bullied (by our own hunger, not by SBP staff) into ordering dish after unsatisfying overpriced dish of their so-called ""dim-sum-inspired-a-la-carte fare"". What a crock. I hate to admit it, but it was this exact (seemingly) fresh idea of trollying around small plates that lured me in the first place.I finally watched in astonishment at the chef sitting down to eat his own dinner, and noticing that most of the kitchen was shut down. Oh my Gee Ohh Dee. Asked our server how much longer our plates would be. She comes back and tells me nonchalantly ""Your ticket was never put in, oops."" No apology, not comps, nothing. WOW.To boot, I actually ordered the quail- the ""State Bird with Provisions"". Cue Alanis Morrissette's ""Ironic"", if you please. Tell me, how can a restaurant overlook a ticket for a homonymous order? If that's not dropping the ball, I really don't know what is. The question looms: ""Where can I possibly eat after this ethereal experience?""I woke up dreaming of all the intricate, well-balanced, shining flavors I experienced last night over what felt like an extremely decadent dinner. First off, the service was exemplary. We were mainly in the capable hands of Sarah, and she was friendly, professional, intuitive... (She even asked at the beginning if we had any food allergies. ) Sarah paced our dishes in a way that placed the strongest, heartiest fare toward the end so we could really taste the subtleties of the earlier dishes. The timing at which the dishes arrived was perfect too!  (Again, intuitive.)We started with provisions delivered by cart. Before being seated, we were very curious (and skeptical) about the concept. When the cart first arrived, we got it!!  To be able to see the colors, the presentation, experience the aromas at the time of ordering was a total treat. We started with: oysters, trout tartar with quinoa, green onion flatbread with cheese, duck neck dumplings in sauerjus...The oysters were perfect: the flavors delicate and balanced, with a bit of daikon and reminiscent of Japanese flavorings.The trout tartar with quinoa had delicate, layered flavors and the most amazing texture...Green onion flatbread with cheese: Had such a nice undercurrent of a citrusy flavor (like lemongrass??) That just kicked it to the next level.The duck neck dumplings were probably the star of round 1. Not to be missed!!Next, we really couldn't decide what to order off the menu as it all sounded amazing. Soooo, we ordered almost everything: chicories, sourdough-sauerkraut-pecorino-ricotta pancakes, state bird (quail), trout with garum butter, glazed pork ribs, ricotta cavatelli dumplings, beef cheeks with radishes and bone marrow...It sounds like a lot of food, right? It was! My dining companion is a sous chef so we decided to go in for the full experience. :-) It was totally worth it!chicories: tangy, bursting, balanced with the almonds, dates, yogurt...The panckaes: I was actually not too psyched about the pancakes. When they arrived, however, they blew my mind!  We ate them ""Mmmmming"" and ""Mmmmming"" when my dining companion realized it was evoking a childhood comfort for him: perogies!!! He was right. State bird (quail) - the breading was perfect, the tangy onions served as the bed for the quail were divine!Ok. You get the point.The star dish for me: the ricotta cavatelli with wild mushrooms & spinach.  Wow! Wow! Wow!  the mushroom flavor stood strong as did the flavor of the perfectly-textured cavatelli. My favorite. Desserts:milk chocolate sesame crunch with clementine cocoa jambeer begnetsrhubarb crisp with rosa gardenia ice creamThe desserts were as innovative as they sound. The begnets and the sesame crunch took the prizes from our table.All of this plus beer, wine, a pomegranate spritzer ... still reasonably priced for a nice dinner out for 2.  It also made for a great date: discussions of the food, sharing the experience, discovering the nuances: great date spot!Make a reservation. They are busy! This is why I live in San Francisco. I just wished I still lived in this neighborhood and I'd be here twice a week. Fantastic food, attentive but not intrusive service, and downright reasonable prices. Such an interesting concept and a great way to try lots of different offerings at a restaurant. I recommend everyone go to this place before the Chronicle publishes a glowing review and it becomes impossible to get in. This was the most enjoyable meal I've had in 6 months, in spite of a tour of Bay Area Michelin one-stars over the past year. My gf said the dishes were hit or miss, and I must admit we had a couple that were not so great, but I was impressed enough to write a review. And any place worth reviewing always has something like 863 Yelp reviews so it's seriously easy to skip writing one.First, the dim sum concept is brilliant. The problem with tapas is that I always feel ripped off, even at fine places like Bocadillos or Ramblas/Locanda. You don't know what you're going to get, and you spend a small fortune to get your fill. But here you get to see the plate and its price, and hear its description before you take it. It is a perfect solution. It helped that the prices were very reasonable.Second, the execution was great as well. The service was friendly and attentive, and the dishes inventive and tasty.I didn't take notes, but my favorites were the kimchi pork belly clam stew, flatbread with ox tail, and duck prosciutto with dried persimmons. Also excellent: quinoa, marinated mushrooms, and goat cheese with vegetable crudite. The radicchio beet salad reminded me of cole slaw -- not necessarily a bad thing, but did not do justice to the fresh beets. And I thought, exactly as another reviewer remarked, that the sourdough pancakes from the menu were doughy and undercooked.I'm sorry I missed the fried quail and will certainly return to try it. hit or miss place. a nice ambiance, attentive service, reasonably priced dishes but only a half of the dishes were as good as we had hoped. I wouldn't call it hyped up but it's not worth 4.5 stars based on my experience.its dining concept is different; more like an upscale, contemporary American dim sum place? we had about 12 dishes and about 6 were very good and the other 6 left us hanging. for a sucker for pork belly, it hurt my soul sharply that they didn't execute two pork belly dishes quite well. however, their quinoa + halibut dish, duck rillette, trout dish, dark chocolate-pair desserts were really good. I would definitely come back and try different menu but for now, 3 stars feels right to me. Great food, loved the waitstaff, and a cool ambiance. Every time I return I'm surprised by the menu in the most pleasant way imaginable. Wow, best food I've had in SF!!!! Now I hope they'll try my cooking. Good luck and all the best wishes,Michelle 02.09.12    bookmarked 02.01.12I was being a daredevil yesterday.  I walked into SBP without a reservation, right when they opened.  They were all booked up.  People were lining up to get seated.  We got ""snuck in"", if we promise to leave within an hour so the table can be vacated for the people who had the foresight to make reservations.We wasted no time, and picked the small order of the CA state bird with provisions (fried quail) and the small order of glazed pork ribs with spigarello and togarashi.Then comes the fun part.  Dishes come out in carts or trays, just like dim sum.  And just like dim sum, they mark the dollar value to the back of your check, and tally the total afterwards.We picked the halibut tartare and quinoa with bonito-rosemary aioli (which, by far, was my favorite dish of the night); the duck neck dumplings in sauerjus; and the braised oxtail in seven-pepper flatbread.Wash it down with a large strong amber ale (that they have on tap), and we were good to go.Absolutely fabulous concept and experience.  I am utterly surprised that this has not been done before, and I can't wait to go back with a larger group to try even more dishes over a bottle of wine!Total damage for two: $55ADORE. good wine list, good food, interesting ordering method. passed like dim sum for some of it, and ordered off the menu for some of it. I'd pass on the crudites - it's just some weird-looking veggies likes romanesco with a plop of goat cheese, but everything else is quite good. And order the state bird, obviously. Kind of loud because it's all hard surfaces inside, if you're old and care about that sort of thing. Worst dining experience ever I'm the bay area. Poor service, forgot our order and below average food What happened!??Its really embarrassing when you talk up a great new place to friends and colleagues and go for a second visit and it falls kind of flat.  I had an outstanding experience when I first came here. My second visit with a friend felt like I was at a different restaurant.     Most of the dishes we had on my first visit were not available.  The dishes which were available on the menu last night were OK at best.I couldn't wait to come back after my try.   After my second try, I just cannot recommend. At State Bird Provisions, it begins the second you walk through the door. You are greeted immediately by the kitchen and its staff, followed by a member of the incredibly friendly waitstaff, and then (if you are lucky), your well-appointed table. Everything at SBP feels intentional and refined without being stuffy or highbrow.For $80 including tip, we enjoyed 6 dim-sum style plates offered by tray/cart (including heavenly Drakes Bay oysters), 1 item from the standing menu, and two desserts in addition to the two beers we ordered while waiting for our table (reservations highly recommended as we lucked out on getting our spot and this place's popularity is soaring for good reason).All of the dishes tasted uniquely well-balanced--the menu here is an incredibly thoughtful fusion of local ingredients, distinct flavors and a wide variety of styles.This is a great place to go with folks who share a sense of culinary adventure an an appreciation for quality ingredients and service.Our new favorite restaurant! While promising, some super groups just never quite pan out: Soundgarden + Rage Against The Machine (Audioslave) = eh.Sammy Hagar + Joe Satriani (Chickenfoot) = um, seriously?New Kids On The Block + Backstreet Boys (NKOTBSB) = actually... that might be the exception. I love terrible pop music. Secretly, I'm hoping one day for a Biebas duo to hit the road (Justin Bieber + Nick Jonas).  Well, when I heard the news of a fresh concept combining new-American fare with dim sum just steps from my 350 square foot studio apartment, I was intrigued to say the least... and after being open for roughly four weeks, I was able to pop in and experience the magic of State Bird Provisions first hand. Suffice to say from the gaggle of glowing reviews accumulated already, you don't need me to reveal their gustatory super group concept won't soon be the Power Station of San Francisco eateries.Upon original speculation, I envisioned this place to be exactly like a dim sum restaurant with rolling carts chock-full of odd looking mystery vittles that you hope don't make you incredibly ill hours into the night. However, while that's certainly a staple standout of their dinner service, it's more of a fun attribute to a brilliant static menu. Still, fun, and incredibly uncommon. They encourage you to order roughly half of your menu items (small, tapas style) from the physical scribe, then treat your taste buds to a handful of the passed plates that do, indeed, arrive at your table by way of a four-wheeled tumbrel. It's really fun, and certainly a unique way to enjoy a night on the town.Spanning both the physical menu and the passed plates, you'll find items like Drake's Bay oysters in the half shell, vegetable crudite with goat cheese & toasted sesame, marinated halibut with yuzu-jalapeno vinaigrette, marinated mushrooms with vanilla-parsnip & hazelnuts, kimchi-pork belly & clam broth, glazed pork ribs, and at least 10-12 other courses appealing to any kind of eater. They even have one or two dessert items making the rounds throughout the dining room, and it's about as challenging as solving a Rubik's Cube to let the sweet treats drift off into the distance. I don't have as much of a palate for sugar, otherwise I'd have gobbled up those sacchariferous digestifs faster than a bee stung stallion.Changes of pace are nice when you've grown tired of the usual dining routine, and if the quality of taste and ingredients rivals a clever, outside-the-box concept, you're in for a real treat. In Lower Pac Heights, State Bird Provisions is that treat, and one I hope to indulge in far too often. SBP opened New Years Eve 2011/2012, not quite seven weeks ago, so they still have plenty of room to grow and develop their menu. The food style is Asian/California/Italian. (Somewhat like the late-great-Oritalia on Fillmore.) SBP has a rather unique concept: A very abbreviated printed dinner menu, supplemented by small courses on carts or trays wheeled or carried by a friendly and knowledgeable staff to the patrons' tables. These latter plates are not listed on the menu, but the prices are clearly displayed on the carts and trays.Next time I go I probably won't order immediately from the printed menu, but instead take my first courses from the carts and trays, and possibly add some menu selections later.What we ordered from the printed menu:* Sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancakes... $6* Char-grilled chicories with yogurt, dates & almonds... $6* Halibut with hazelnut and mandarin... $18* Ricotta cavatelli with wild mushrooms & spinach... $16What we took from the carts/trays:* Raw vegetable and fruit with whipped goat cheese... $6 * Mushrooms with parsnip puree... $6My comments:The four small pancakes were fine, although they would have benefited from a dab of some interesting sour cream concoction on top. Also, the sauerkraut must have been cooked into the pancakes but it was not apparent in the flavor.The chicory greens were very good, if a bit acidic from added lemon, vinegar or vinaigrette. (Cooking these in the open kitchen may have contributed to the slight smokiness of the room.)  The halibut was dry and flavorless in an unpleasantly acidic (again), very minimal, sauce.The cavatelli pasta was a laughably small serving. Tasty, but the mushroom-to-spinach-to-pasta ratio didn't include enough pasta, and was not satisfying at $16.The raw vegetables were fine and the whipped goat cheese was very good.The mushrooms and parsnip puree needs work. The cooked mushrooms should have been warmed (they were cold) and there was too little puree.Wine list is short but good (we had only one glass of Beaujolais) and the hazelnut apricot linzer bars (which were comped) were tasty. SBP needs to offer some heartier dishes. Also, for diners who might not be enthusiastic about the unusual flavors of some dishes, they should offer a few standbys with a more comfort-food orientation. They grill chicory, why not grill other vegetables and maybe potatoes with a romesco sauce (they like nuts at SBP)? Dial-down the acidic elements and offer dishes with more rounded flavors. Olive oil, anyone? How about some bread and butter? Most importantly, increase the serving sizes - we both left hungry having spent $81 including tax and tip.In the end, I do appreciate what they're trying to do and applaud their effort. The staff was very good. I will probably go back.Oh, yeah. Music choice was not so great. They're in an historic area of great jazz and vintage SF rock. Go for the jazz and leave Johnny Cash to the BBQ joints. Spent the day with friends who live in the Bay Area and had dinner with 5 others.  Food was great loved the fact you could see the VERY clean kitchen when you walked in and out.  The staff and Chefs greeted you when you walked in and ALL thanked you when you left.  You know they love food if it tastes that good. Dim sum style for casual upscale american food.Love the concept, liked the food, but they still need to work out some of the kinks with operations. Perhaps sleeker dim sum style food carts would improve the flow.Really enjoyed the variety of food and especially the deep fried quail Definitely go with a group of 4-8, so you can try all the dishes. I'm pretty stoked off of this place. My hood has been in dire need of a decent place to eat for far too long (the Fillmore is the ONLY place in SF with every possible fast food option in a half mile radius). Provisions is delicious AND affordable. I've been three times, each time with a friend and shared 4-5 plates, a couple beers (great beer selection including Stone Levitation Ale for only $4 bottle) and the highest bill was around $40.The food is very good.The interior is also a pleasant surprise.I'll be very happy to see this place stay consistent and in business. When an innovative restaurant opens up within a 3 minute walk from my house, stays open until 12, and takes reservations, I'm bound to give it a few extra brownie points (hence the 5 stars instead of 4). This place was definitely a win with a wonderful tapas concept and ever-changing menu. The small dishes fairly priced for the most part and had a few stand-out dishes:1. Braised Baby Carrots (really stellar, I hope this stays on the menu always)2. Farro with Wild Mushrooms (off the menu)3. Marinated Wild Mushrooms4. 7-Pepper FrybreadOn the negative side: I was not the biggest fan of the Grilled Chicories and the oysters were a little unexciting. A friend also found the duck dumplings pretty average.The service is wonderful and the waiter was very accomodating to my vegetarian needs offering variations of existing dishes so that I could try them. Can't wait to come back and try some new dishes! Warning: There is no such thing as super sizing here. After a weekend of super indulgence at ayce shabu shabu and then buffet the next day, this place is exactly what I needed. Everything we had here was amazing. State bird, pork belly with kimchi , marinated wild mushrooms, duck dumplings and an amazing salad with bone marrow. This place is definitely pricey for the amount you get. But well worth it! Came here with a girlfriend on a Saturday night ~10/10:30pm, past the dim sum-style serving time. We simply ordered from the menu.Our waitress was pleasant and very helpful in answering some of our questions about the menu. We ended up having:1. CA STATE BIRD WITH PROVISIONS This is a whole deep-fried bone-in quail. The provisions were lemon-stewed onions with shaved Parmesan. The bird was quite moist and delicious. It is a bit difficult to share as the bird is not deboned - you'll have to split it with some creative cutting. Best to eat with your hands to get all the delicious meat off the bones.2. MARINATED WILD MUSHROOMS w/ vanilla-parsnip purée & hazelnutsThe mushrooms were extremely flavorful and had just the right amount of tang. The hazelnuts gave the dish the right amount of sweetness and a nice crunchy texture combined with the soft mushrooms.I also had a glass of Temperanillo, which was very good. I enjoyed the ambience of SBP as it was equal parts rustic and modern. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. I'd recommend SBP for some quick bites as one of a few stops on a night out in the Fillmore neighborhood. Probably not great for a filling dinner but certainly a cozy, low-key date night nibble. What do you mean it is tapas dim sum, oh.. yeah, it is just like that.Small plates coming down the isle. While you can order some other larger dishes from the menu. Sort of I can get my chicken feet from the cart, and order my chou mien from the menu.Everything is fresh, quintessential of new California cuisine. Standout dishes are:* Quinoa with small bits of red snapper and chrysanthemum: I couldn't say enough good things about this small creation, the favorite came out so unique and balance. My favorite.* Cavatelli with dungeness crab & tomalley butter: wow, please give me more! So light and fresh, the bread crumb added such interesting taste.* 7 spice bread with ox tail, sun choke sauce, and lentil: who thought about this?* Buckwheat bao (bun) with lemon cream: a piece of heavy that is only $5.I like the layout of the restaurant, completely open kitchen in the front. Everyone is friendly, the chef was near the door when we left, and chatted with us a bit when I complimented him on the dishes (I rarely do). Such humble man!Only complains are the place is noisy! It only died down after about 10:30pm. I could also see that if you are sitting in the back, you are in trouble! Cause all the deliciousness won't make it back to you. There is no good waiting area, but they actually can take your cell number and text you when your table is ready. Service is friendly, you can tell each staff knows the dishes well. Considering the quality of the food, this is a bargain place. We had a few drinks and about 10 dishes for two of us. $100 tips included.And open till midnight, heck ya!Visit this place before it gets publish, and the mobs swarm in. State Bird Provisions is a shining example of why I love the food culture in San Francisco. The entire restaurant experience here is top-notch; definitely one of the best dinners I've had in the city. State Bird Provisions introduces a dim sum-style ordering process to unique, fresh, and flavorful concoctions, all of which were absolutely delicious.The large open kitchen in the front of the restaurant is definitely a nice welcome. You see a dedicated league of chefs preparing a countless number of intricate and interesting dishes. There are a few shared plates on the menu, and plenty more that they bring around the room on trays and carts. I love this process because you can see the food before you decide to take it, and you can ask questions with the dish right in front of you. I've never seen anything like this before at an American restaurant, and it really is genius. Be aware though: you will probably end up spending way more than you expected to, because it's pretty difficult (at least for me) to reject any of the dishes they bring around. They all looked phenomenal, and the vast majority of them were.----------------------------A group of 3 of us had the following:Serrano Ham w/ Persimmon: Fresh & tasty. I could eat these all day.Pan-seared Trout = Excellently-cooked trout.Beef Cheek w/ Bone Marrow Vinaigrette = Delicious. The Bone Marrow vinaigrette is incredible and the Beef Cheek was nice and tender.Flatbread with Oxtail and Curried Lentils = Warm & flavorful. Loved it.CA State Bird w/ Provisions (Fried Quail) = This was my favorite dish of the night. The fried quail was PERFECTLY fried and the meat was unbelievably moist. This is how poultry should be fried.Cavatelli w/ Dungeness Crab = Interesting flavor that really grew on me with each bite.Kimchi Pork Belly w/ Yuba Noodles = Very good take on the Korean flavors. The kimchi flavor is faint, but works very well in the broth. Pork Belly was nicely crisped.Duck Confit w/ Cornbread = The cornbread is phenomenal. The duck confit was good, but I wish they utilized something different with cornbread (ideally something like foie gras).Duck Neck Dumplings = Little dumplings that had a distinct duck neck flavor, but the dumpling skin was a little too doughy. Still good, though.Clam Sliders = The bun for the sliders were great, although I wish the clams were hot instead of cold.Goat Cheese w/ Vegetable Crudite = The goat cheese was great -- not too overpowering but still had a strong flavor. Goes well with the vegetables.Grand Total: $61.00 per person, including an ice-cold IPA (and tax & tip).----------------------------For a brand-new restaurant, State Bird Provisions blows many SF establishments out of the water. It serves up incredibly fresh, unique, and tasty dishes at decent prices. Make a reservation now and be prepared for an amazing night out. SBP is a brilliant new restaurant! There are so many great things to say about it that I don't know where to start!!! From start to finish I had an amazing experience here! The staff is highly trained, friendly and truly cares about their guests! I have some strange allergies (wheat, potato and peppers) and after letting our server know this fact I found out that she made sure to share the info with everyone who was passing food so that they could help me avoid anything that would be a problem. SO impressive!!!!And now for the FOOD!!!!! Holy Moly!!! The food was ridiculous!!!! We tried just about everything that was passed around. Favorites of the evening: crudite of mini vegetables and soft goat cheese with sesame seeds & cardamom, duck liver pate with almond cookies, glazed pork ribs with spigarello & togarashi, and the coconut-ginger-cardamom baba with hachiya persimmon. The oysters on the half shell were fresh and tasted like the sea. There were just too many delicious options to sum them all up here! The menu changes on a weekly basis so be ready to be surprised! Everything is fresh with a flavor profile that will knock you socks off. It is a bit pricy, so bring three friends with you and split the bill! That way you can all try even more items off the carts and trays! Go...EAT!!!! The idea is genius and the execution is well done.  Not every dish that comes out on the cart is 5 stars, but every dish is inventive and daring.  The atmosphere is lively, wine list is small and cheap, and the experience is fresh.  Don't miss out."|5|100|0|Routine|This inspection has no violations.|GOOD: no inspection needed
State Bird Provisions 4|4.5|Tapas/Small Plates in San Francisco, CA|$31-60|1051|4|4.545454545454546|" What a great restaurant! The former Chef from Michelin starred Rubicon has opened his own place.  A small plates format at a great price point.  And for that price you get really, really wonderful food and service. The format when I dined was akin to that of a Chinese dim sum restaurant.  Many smaller plates that didn't require warming were wheeled around the restaurant for patrons to pick and choose.   A small group of larger but still modestly priced dishes that require the immediate attention of the patron are ordered ala carte and come directly to you from the kitchen.   It worked surprisingly well, although I think they may have trouble getting people to leave.  I was tempted to stay to see what would come out on the cart next.  I started with mushrooms that came with parsnip, vanilla and hazelnut.  A lovely way to start as the earthiness of the mushrooms was contrasted by the parsnip, vanilla and hazelnut. Next, char-grilled chicories that came with yogurt,  and dates.  A great plate of food as the grilled chicories had taste and texture that paired perfectly with the contrasting yogurt and dates. A larger plate of glazed pork ribs with spigarello and togarashi was sublime.   The braised ribs had a bit of char.  The spigarello had a touch of acidity from some lemon that cut the fattiness of the heavenly ribs. Next a half order of fried quail.  I don't particularly care for quail.  But this was different.  Great stuff and the signature plate of the place.  And for good reason. I finished my meal with braised carrots that were wonderfully sweet.  Some slightly bitter winter greens were a perfect contrast to the carrots.  It's places like State Bird Provisions that make San Francisco a great food city.  Yum.  Yum.  Yum. There were maybe two dishes that were just ""good"".  Considering we had seventeen tick marks on our tab at the end of the night, that's an awfully good record.  Outstanding State Bird (of course) and really yummy lamb belly.  Lovely service and pretty presentation.  One of the ladies recognized me from the Rubicon days!   Even waiting by the kitchen for our table was super fun.  Pretty loud and crowded, I hope this place will be around a long time. We wanted to try this place first weekend they opened.  When we got there, we thought it was closed because we didn't see any patrons from the sidewalk looking in.   All the workers, including chefs are at the front where the kitchen is(very Chinese).  The diners are all in the back, away from street view.  The food are served up dim sum style where servers bring the dishes around and you point to what you want.  The server explained what's in the dish and then marked a line on a piece of paper that keeps count of how many $2 to $12 dishes you have selected.  When you are done eating, the host will take the sheet and come back with your total, plus tax.  All along, you should be able to see how many dishes and your total(if u can do quick math while stuffing your face). They have some really delicious items there.  As much as we ate, there were still so many dishes yet to try.  Favorite was their signature dish, the quail.  Their meat items are quite good.  This is not a dimsum place nor a Spanish tapas place.  The dishes are quite eclectic and creative.  The workers are young hip and friendly.  Did I mention the dishes they served up were tasty?!  Dining here takes time as you have to wait for the food to come around, but it really is great to sip on wine and chat as food settles before the next dish arrive.  You get to see the food item before you buy.  The clientele is also quite eclectic.  We welcome State Bird Provisions to our block. For such an interesting food place a proper review should start with the food:  wow.  Three dishes were amongst the best this hedonist has ever tried: fabulous crusted lemony quail, brilliantly vibrant (I think tuna) tartar, and a non-earthy, redolently citrus-tasting mushroom dish, an unexpected elegant winner.  The sturgeon caviar with potato chips, if not totally new (at least if you've been to Swanson Winery's Napa Valley Salon) was at least completely DE-lish!, underscoring I think this restaurant's sense of humor and self-confidence.  Hey, I even loved the seared calf tongue served in room temp blood red (beet, as I recall) sauce.  Sense of humor, for certain, and roundly beautiful.Dwelling on that a tad more, I liked the food presentation.  Tiny plates are offered on a tray, reminiscent of a dim sum style.  So cool to be able to look over everything.  Kind of a fun ice-breaker for dates too, actually.  I came away feeling the chef really knew how to incorporate a sense of art--textures and colors as well as flavor-- into the meal.A plus or a minus, I can't tell, but an important detail:  from the outside you would never know this is a restaurant.  In fact, I walked by twice even though I knew the address.  I scratched my head, and took a shot, still thinking ""this can't be it...""   The entrance looks like it's a catering operation from the outside.  Diners essentially walk past the kitchen to a small secluded dining room, a spartan SF-chic-space composted of unassuming peg board, cement and stone tones.  The tables are unadorned.  The food and friendly nature of the place make the experience as a result.  As a really huge bonus for foodies:  the wines by the glass are well-considered by the owners, inexpensive ($7-11) and lovely.  We enjoyed several as the night progressed, using them as wonderful compliments to a round-robin of sophisticated flavors. I could not wait to try this place ever since it starting receiving press in the Chronicle.  It did not disappoint.  I loved the idea of the concept, and I loved it in practice.  I don't want to order off a menu ever again.  Unlike a dim sum cart, they only put a few plates on a tray, so nothing gets cold.  The servers do a great job describing the dish and answering questions.  We sat in the back and were initially concerned that everything would be snatched up by the people in front.  That worry was quickly alleviated as the staff expertly gets things to every table.  The benefit to this style of dining is you might try things that would sound boring on a menu.  For example, the first thing we had was a grilled chicory dish.  I would not have ordered it off of a menu, but it was awesome.  Every dish except the rye bread & red beet dish was really good (I did not personally like the sauce with the beets).  My favorite dish was duck dumplings with a ridiculous broth poured over them.  The broth was SO GOOD.  Nothing that comes with a broth/jus should be missed.  The pepper bread with oxtail was awesome.  We just cut it in half and picked it up and ate it like an openface sandwich.  Cutting it up would leave too much gravy on the plate.  The quail was awesome on its own, but the lemon stewed onions take it to the next level.  In the end, we only had room for one dessert, the chocolate sesame crunch.  It was really good, but really sweet -- so one dessert was fine.  I cannot wait to go back. Maybe one of the best openings in 2011. Of course they waited until NYE. We got one of the larger tables in the back on opening night and they didn't disappoint. While most people were out doing fancy cut throat NYE ""special menus"", we opted for the reputation of two chefs coming back into the game. Turns out the ex Rubicon gang came back with many of their past co workers so the night started off with a staff that mostly knew each other in some way or another. The long corridor with the reception at the front of the kitchen line was not something I expected. I knew where the place was but still did a double take. The combination of industrial space, cafe, and dim sum style service makes for an interesting mix. Things come out on trays in carts, etc, etc. Being the gluttons we are, we had two (yes 2) of everything that was offered:crudité with goat cheese & toasted sesametofu with lime, ginger & fennelpickled wild mushrooms with root purees & hazelnutschicken 'salad' with buddha's hand & celery root curdsourdough kraut ricotta & pecorino pancakes'pain au poivre' with oxtail mushroom gravycarnitas stuffed squidrye bread & red beet 'viennoise' with horseradish-ale creamsmokey-grilled chicories with urfa-yogurtfried quail with lemon stewed onionsfragrant spiced shrimp with yogurt whey & pomegranateroasted carrots & braised jammy greensmeyer lemon chocolate croquettes with blue bottle coffee sabayonmilk chocolate sesame crunch, clementine-cocoa jamdrunken cherry caramel chocolate mistakechestnut buckwheat profiterolepeanut muscovado milkwarm fig cinnamon swirlsHow's that for a spread? I think we put some fear in the line and front of house as we just tore stuff down non stop. The bonus? everything was delicious and intriguing. The flavor and ingredient combinations are thought provoking while tasty. I think the Fillmore area just got a huge boost and I know where my de facto before shows around the area is now. StatebirdSF certainly ended the year with a bang! (See pics)Review #1095.Inventive items without a menu boundary. State Bird, as the owners used to hike along the peninsula and saw the quails walking around, was the name.A tribute to California and bay area especially with lighter taste that pleases the local healthier crowds, a focus on using ingredients that we are all familiar with but with an interesting twist.Interesting concept-- tapas serving in dim sum tray style as they walk around with freshly made food on scene. The space has a fusion of post 1906 earthquake brick exposed walls on 1 side, sound proof look-alike wall on the other. A very high ceiling and deep space for an eatery.The utmost important dish with the battered fried quail which was very delicious, juicy and delightful. All other dishes we tried, such as duck rillettes, steak bites with a fried egg and vegetables, full on fresh and lightly grilled vegetables with goat cheese, properly cooked pasta with crab meat and peas, duck confit on baked slightly sweetened dough, dumplings, etc etc. All were good with lots of tones in them.For the desserts, the very fine powdered peanuts with milk pouring over it was my favorite as it was very light in liquid but silky in taste. The chopped nuts and raisins in Ganache chocolate sauce, an unplanned put-together dessert in the owner's kitchen in the past, has become a hit and was lovely delicious.Also a simple but good list of wines (for food and dessert), tea and BB coffee are a good balance for the varied plates.On a strip that is filled with mostly Asian eateries, a couple bars and a few music venues, here flies the State Bird Provisions. Owner Stuart enthusiastically described his childhood hiking and seeing quails along the way was a nice touch to this new place. This will be a place where you will find different dishes at every visit. YAY FOR MENAGE A TROIS!Do you enjoy inventive New American cuisine?Do you enjoy Tapas style dining?Do you enjoy yum yum Dim Sum?If you answered, ""YES"" to all of  the above, then you will love State Bird Provisions.SBP is discreetly located in the FillMo'. Having just opened on NYE, it's still without any signage. However, you can't miss it being next door to the glowing neon signs of Won Mi, a Korean restaurant that I personally banned myself from after nearly taking down a wall of banchans at 2:30 AM. Um yah, we won't even get started on that one. :XSBP's menu consists of inventive and adventurous American Tapas flawlessly executed with fresh, seasonal ingredients seamlessly paired together creating culinary mini-masterpieces with well balanced flavors and textures. There is no set menu. Each night, about 14-16 dishes come around a la dim sum carts/trays. See something you like? Point and get it. In my case, this is why I LOVE dim sum aka The 'SEE'food Diet, I get to eat EVERYTHING I see.F O O D*Prices: $2-12/dish; most were $6-$8*3-4 dishes/person is sufficientAn average of 4 STARS, below are the dishes we sampled last night listed from my most favorite to least favorite. *BRAISED OXTAIL in 7-Pepper Flatbreadyelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG… The STAR of the night, the warm, crisp, and fluffy flatbread was generously filled with savory tender shreds of oxtail. The light smearing of yogurt sauce gave a delightful layer of creamy tanginess. *FRIED QUAIL w/ Lemon Stewed Onions yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG… Deliciously crunchy on the outside and succulently moist in the center, the fried quail was lip smacking good. The citrus from the onions added a ray of sunshine while the parmigiano-reggiano gave a savory saltiness.*TROFIE PASTA w/ Dungeness Crab & Pancettayelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG… A perfect rendition of a pasta surf and swine, the al-dente twisted pasta married the sweet crab meat with a scrumptious crisp, fatty richness from the pancetta bits. *PORK RIBS in a Pork Brothyelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG… The carniwhore in me rejoiced with these ribs. The subtle smoky ribs were crisp around the edges and tender on the inside. The broth was like an au jus imparting a layer of briny saltiness.*BEEF TONGUE PASTRAMI CROSTINI w/ Bone Marrow Sauceyelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG… The holy grail of all crostinis, the beef tongue pastrami was delectably smooth and salty. The bits of bone marrow added a burst of beefy richness while the acidity of the red onion marmalade helped cut through the richness.*RYE BREADED BEETS w/ Horseradish Kaleyelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG… I loath beets but this dish made me a beet convert. Nicely coated with rye bread crumbs, the beets were fried to a robust golden brown and then lightly smeared with the horseradish kale sauce. Crisp, tender, and sweet, the beets were wonderfully delicious with a light nose tingle from the horseradish.*BRUSSEL SPROUTS w/ Squid & Mandarin Orangesyelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG… Crunchy brussels sprouts with tender squid tossed with sweet vibrant oranges made me miss the rare summer days in SF.*FARRO w/ Wild Mushrooms & Parmesanyelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG… Reminiscent of risotto, the farro grain was tender with a bite. The wild mushrooms and parmesan added an mouth-watering earthiness and a salty creaminess.*DUCK NECK DUMPLINGS yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG… My least fav dish of the night, the pan-fried skin was too thick and very doughy which hindered the taste of the duck neck. The broth was also very salty.S E R V I C EConsidering they've only been open 10 days, the staff operates just as flawlessly as the food. They're warm, genuinely friendly, and knowledgeable.We got a chance to chat with co-owner, Stuart Brioza (Rubicon) who was a cool cat. The immense passion he has is emanated in the careful and artful preparation of the food and the attentive service of his staff. A M B I A N C E / D E C O RCasual and inviting, SBP's open kitchen is the highlight of this 40+-seating restaurant. As you're waiting to be seated, your eyes and your nose will be tantalizingly teased on what's to come. Dimly lit and not overly noisy, it's a great place to take a foodie on a date.P A R K I N GDifficult street parking on weekends. There's a garage 1 block away across from Yoshi's; $3 for the 1st hour, $1 for each add'l hour. SBP is a living testament that a Menage A Trois DOES work! Honey, don't knock it till you've tried it... Came with 5 other girlfriends for dinner last night. Great concept (food served dim sum style), but that also means that the food is lukewarm once it arrives. They need those real steel dim sum carts that hold in the heat. Portions are quite small too. We had to wait awhile for food to come by and it was also intermittent. We stopped midway through the meal b/c everyone was kinda disappointed with the food. The food wasn't bad at all and was well prepared and unique w/fresh ingredients. None of the dishes stood out either. We didn't get to the dessert, but they looked tasty. We ended up going to Sophie's crepes to fill our tummys. Friendly service. There's no sign outside the door, so it made it difficult to find! In short, the food here is executed at a very high technical level, with friendly staff, and flavors & techniques you have likely not seen before. As far as food- be sure to grab 1-2 plates of the oxtail & pepper bread-- the braised meat lining the fried bread is an experience. Ask how the bread is prepared.Oh. Oh. And the pork ribs are excellent. Braised then grilled goodness.The staff touted the fried quail as the hallmark dish, but the idea felt kitschy, the appearance clunky, and flavor under-whelming.Chicories- unfortunately these were inedible...beyond sour & burned.As far as service & timing, you need to bare in mind that SBP has opened very recently AND re-invented a style of dining, their timing will be ironed out in coming months. That being said, it would have been nice to have received more attention from the wait staff in between dishes.  First-month diners are worth listening to: they've likely anticipated your opening for weeks, if not, months; and likely know more about your concept than you think.As far as additions, a full bar would be nice, of course license permitting.  For what they do carry,  I didn't really get the wine program. I'm always curious to hear the story behind the wine list & why specific wines were carried. Didn't get that.SBP is for the SF diner seeking a new experience, but with seasoned staff, and intricate flavors. You'll also need to be patient, show up hungry & not mind the Reagan-era dining room interior. Everything was delicious! The flavor pairings were all great and my 5-person group pretty much tried everything that wasn't solely a vegetable dish. (We weren't in a healthy mood.) The unique dim-sum serving style made the eating process very leisurely, but if you come hungry you'll probably not appreciate it as much until you've gotten a few dishes in you. However, that said, use the time in between dishes to really savor the flavors and textures! Savory must-try's: - pickled wild mushrooms with root purees & hazelnuts- anything with duck- 'pain au poivre' with oxtail mushroom gravy- bone marrow bread- the state bird provision (fried quail with lemon stewed onions)Sweet must-try's: - chocolate croquettes with rosemary-meyer lemon sabayon- milk chocolate sesame crunch, clementine-cocoa jam, coffee cream (it was like a refined Krackle)For all those tea drinkers out there: try the white chrysanthemum tea! It's really light and went well with everything. The price of the dishes were a bit on the more expensive side, though, and after all was said and done, our bill came out to be about $170, including a pot of tea and 2 big bottles of beer, excluding tip. For the price each of us paid, I personally would have liked to walk away feeling very stuffed, rather than feeling contently filled, but that's just me wanting to feel like I got a great deal. Last thing to mention is parking, which is hit-or-miss on the surrounding streets. I would recommend driving around the block once or twice just to see if you get lucky, otherwise you can always use the Fillmore parking lot which is just one block away. We paid $5 for 2 hours there, which isn't bad at all. This is one of those restaurants you need to go to now before it gets yelped to death. The clock is ticking! Think Dim Sum-style California fusion dishes.Each dish come out in multiples of about four on a tray to be selected by various tables. Dessert comes out on a quaint cart which really needs to be a little narrower and allow rotation in all four wheels: in other words, not designed for functionality.The oxtail, Bone Bread (pretzel-roll) with marrow sauce, and the beet salad are my favorite, and most of the rest of the things we tried (and I think we tried everything except the sardines on toast - we were full, not uninterested) was solidly good and interesting. A few dishes were pedestrian in design, although executed well, and only one seemed to be showing off its outré ingredients.Deserts were similarly inventive and rather good, especially the fig arugula.We were there on the second night of operation, and we hope it does well. The number of cooks in the open kitchen as well as the number of servers seem prohibitive for long-term success; we assume they have run the numbers and know what they are doing. I had New Year's Eve dinner here with some friends...a group of 5 of us.  This is a new venture from the chefs from Rubicon.  After talking to our server, it sounds like a lot of other staff followed them also.  When you walk in, don't be confused by the open kitchen that dominates the front of the restaurant...walk a little further in, & someone will help you.  So, you get a menu for drinks, then they leave a ticket at your table.  The meal works dim sum style, meaning they will bring trays/carts of the food around, and you pick out what you want as they come around, & they mark the ticket with a hash mark.  Oh, they do tell you what the dish is, unlike dim sum, where you generally have to ask if you don't know.We were the gluttons who ordered two of every dish that came out (17 savory dishes & 4 sweet) so that everyone at the table could try everything!  We thought there were only going to be 10-11 savory dishes, but they just kept on coming...Here's their menu from online.  We pretty much had all of the savories & then some that weren't on the list (pork ribs, caviar & chips, chocolate cherry mistake).  We didn't have all of the desserts on the list, so I deleted those.  crudite with goat cheese & toasted sesametofu with lime, ginger & fennelpickled wild mushrooms with root purees & hazelnutschicken 'salad' with buddha's hand & celery root curdsourdough kraut ricotta & pecorino pancakes'pain au poivre' with oxtail mushroom gravycarnitas stuffed squidrye bread & red beet 'viennoise' with horseradish-ale creamsmokey-grilled chicories with urfa-yogurtfried quail with lemon stewed onions  (yes, they serve their namesake here; makes sense, doesn't it?)fragrant spiced shrimp with yogurt whey & pommegranateroasted carrots & braised jammy greenscrispy chocolate croquettes with rosemary-meyer lemon sabayonpeanut muscovado milkclove spiked fig cookiesEverything was spot on...I had lunch with one of my friends who was at that dinner today, & we were talking about how the every dish was solid with innovative flavor combinations.They offer wine & beer, & tea.  Our group actually didn't have any alcohol & did our drinking later in the evening.Décor is simple, minimalist...the wall we were sitting against was a pegboard.Service was very good...staff was pleasant, professional, yet friendly.There's a single room unisex restroom at the back. Located on the west side of Fillmore, between Geary & OFarrell.  The storefront is narrow, & there's no signage (at least not on the night I went), so I walked right past it at first. Support this establishment. Expect to be surprised by tasty food and service. Love it. I give them points or stars for attempting the whole dim sum restaurant theme.  It's different and it may actually work if those carts they ""cart"" around were actually filled with food.  Dim Sum calls for choice and they need a huge selection of small bites to make the masses happy, or maybe just the Chinese folks.  This one cart I saw pass by had two desserts on it, pathetic.  The same cart with the same 2 desserts passed by maybe 3 more times.  The ribs which came out a bit later as we were wrapping up our meal was delicious!  Now if only that stuff came out in the beginning.  Very attentive staff who will give you a description of each dish as they make a stop by your table.  Sitting in the back, may cause you to get the rejects dishes, unless they have some system implemented already.  The space is small, and we were lucky we got a table for 2.  Do yourself a favor and make a reservation.  It's definitely worth a try! :) The food was amazing,,,so many different items yet they all married well.  The concept is fun, dim sum style plates arricv at the table and you decide if you want to indulge or wait for the next wave of food to come around.  I think they are still working out a few kinks with service but everyone was very nice and knowledgable.  I love the quail, i remember the quail from Rubicon.   We had some fun dishes, the calamari was so tasty and the homemade bread with bone marrow sauce was yummy.  I can't wait to go back to see what else they come up with.  Good luck guys,,,so happy you are back on the scene. Amazing. You'll be addicted. The quality of a 5 star restaurant for good prices.I wasn't kidding about the last point. Stuart and Nicole used to be the chefs for Rubicon (in downtown San Francisco). Rubicon was owned by Drew Nieporent, who owns Nobu in New York.Tip: the desserts are a must try.The only caveat is I'm not sure the dim-summing thing is going to work out. I wish I could just order my food tapas style. I was looking forward to trying this restaurant based on some of the recent press I had read.  Walking into State Bird, it felt so warm and cozy. We were greeted by a friendly staff that made us feel like we have been friends for a while.  We tried almost everything on the menu and were excited by the idea of not knowing what was coming next.  All of the food that we ate was awesome and the prices were very reasonable.  Our favorites were the Quail, the tofu salad with grapefruit, and the Chocolate Cherry Mistake.  We are definitely going back real soon. When you walk in to SBP (as I'm sure it will get nicknamed) you see a pristine kitchen with a wonderful open kitchen to greet you. We were sat immediately and shown our wine menu, carefully tucked under the table. American/Californian Dim Sum is the concept and wow - it really blew me away. A tray of morsels, or a cart comes by at just the right time offering you little plates of gems. We tried everything that came around. Fresh greens with tofu (that I thought was fresh cheese, it was so tasty), Bone marrow and housemade bread stick, wild mushroom farro risotto, the State Bird (buttermilk roasted quail) with provisions of lemon onion confit, these amazing shrimp with a whey pomogranite jus, duck pate with corn financier and so many other things. I can't really write about it because my mouth keeps watering from lasts nights masterpiece! The dessert......well if you have never had Peanut milk, get here fast. I have a feeling it will be one of the most popular things they offer. I can't forget to mention the Rye bread Beet 'cake', it was stellar. The wine list was carefully chosen and beautifully presented. I chose a glass of Cava and a glass of Picpul. My tea was Pu-ehr and I have to say I was very impressed with the selection of tea. No one serves Pu-ehr like this.  The prices are exceptionally reasonable and the service is top notch. Each chef in the kitchen have worked at the top respected restaurants you all read about. I can't wait to go back to SBP for more yummy goodness. Felt so lucky to be invited by friends of friends to the soft opening this weekend and have literally been licking my lips ever since.  Great concept:  dim-sum style service makes dining not just more fun but also WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get).  For example fabulous lamb orzo bowl was my personal favorite but so rich and savory that one bowl sufficed for all three at our table.  Their Rye bread and red beet 'viennoise' with horseradish ale creation was quite possibly the single best bite-of-beet I ever set tongue to -- and hey,  I'm a foodie from beet-growing Ft. Collins in Colorado, so I know my beets baby.  Likewise the signature fried quail (our CA state bird) with lemon-steamed onions was unforgettable.  Crudites and wild-mushroom creations showcased the freshest local produce possible.   Opened with a surprising and satisfyingly glass of dry Picpoul from France; finished with perfectly-brewed Blue Bottle coffee served in a French press.  Our unanimously-declared favorite dessert (we couldn't help but sampled several) was the aptly-named ""Drunken caramel cherry Mistake"" -- which the chef discovered by happy accident.  Huge beautiful butcher block prep table as you enter sets the atmosphere for some serious cheffing.  Tables spaced widely for easy conversation (no bench-style seating with couples crammed together like quails).  Hurry up and grab a table before the line starts snaking around the corner! Came here for their soft opening tonight and things were looking good! The concept here is dim sum style. They'll bring plates of small plates on a tray or cart and you can pick whichever one you want. They'll place the dish on your table and will put a hash mark on your bill according to the price. Their signature dish is the ""state bird with provisions"" as this dish is deep fried quail with lemon stewed onions. The pickled wild mushroom was one of my favorite. This dish is full of flavors and texture (hazelnut is the crunchy when you eat it with the mushrooms). The spiced shrimp is also full of flavors - definitely a must!Their tea selection is very good also. I tried their ""dragon ball"" ice tea and their white chrysanthemum tea. Both were very light on flavor - which is my preference when it comes to tea. Their dessert selection is very nice. The combination of ingredients and flavors are very unique and it works. My favorite was the chestnut buckwheat profiterole and the bittersweet chocolate croquettes. The peanut muscovado milk was better than expected, probably because I've never had peanut milk as dessert before! The portions are small so you can definitely order 4-5 for 2 people. The price is also decent as they range from $5-$8 for the items we ordered tonight. You can definitely order all the items on the menu while you pop open a bottle of wine with a group of friends for the night. The staff is so friendly there that you will end up being there for hours! The open kitchen is located as you enter the door so you can see everything being made fresh right then and there. Come give this place a try before everyone else finds out about it!!!"|5|100|0|Routine|This inspection has no violations.|GOOD: no inspection needed
